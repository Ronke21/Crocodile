<text>Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna (6 July 1930 – 22 November 2016) was an Indian Carnatic vocalist, musician, multi-instrumentalist, playback singer, composer, and character actor. He was awarded the Madras Music Academy&#x27;s Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1978. He has garnered two National Film Awards (1976, 1987), the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1975, the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second-highest civilian honor in 1991, for his contribution towards arts, the Mahatma Gandhi Silver Medal from UNESCO in 1995, the Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 2005, the Sangeetha Kalanidhi by Madras Music Academy, and the Sangeetha Kalasikhamani in 1991, by &quot;the Fine Arts Society&quot;, Chennai to name a few.

Balamuralikrishna started his career at the age of six. In his life-time, he gave over 25,000 concerts worldwide. Apart from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, he presented jugalbandi concerts (duets) with Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty and Kishori Amonkar, among others. He is also known for popularizing the compositions of Sri Bhadrachala Ramadasu, Sri Annamacharya, and others.

Balamuralikrishna&#x27;s concerts combined sophisticated vocal skills and rhythmic patterns of classical music with the popular demand for entertainment value. Balamuralikrishna presented concerts in many countries, including the US, Canada, UK, Italy, France, Russia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, countries in the Middle East, and elsewhere. Apart from his native tongue, Telugu, he has also composed in other languages including Kannada, Sanskrit, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, and Punjabi.

He appeared as a featured soloist with an award-winning British choir, performing the &quot;Gitanjali Suite&quot; with words from Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winning poetry and music by &quot;Dr. Joel&quot;, the noted UK-based Goan composer. His clear diction in several languages prompted an invitation to record Tagore&#x27;s entire Rabindra Sangeet compositions in Bengali, preserving them for posterity. He had sung in French, and even ventured into jazz fusion, collaborating with the top Carnatic percussion teacher, Sri T.H. Subash Chandran, in a concert for Malaysian royalty.

==Early life==

Balamuralikrishna was born in a Brahmin family at Sankaraguptam, East Godavari District, Madras Presidency (now a part of Andhra Pradesh state). His father, Mangalampalli Pattabhiramayya, was a well known musician and his mother, Suryakanthamma, was a veena player. Balamuralikrishna&#x27;s mother died when he was an infant and he was raised by his father. Observing his interest in music, his father put him under the tutelage of Parupalli Ramakrishnayya Pantulu, a direct descendant of the &quot;shishya parampara&quot; (lineage of disciples) of Tyagaraja. Under his guidance, the young Balamuralikrishna learned Carnatic music. At the age of eight, he gave his first full-fledged concert at a Thyagaraja Aradhana in Vijayawada. Musunuri Suryanarayana Murty Bhagavatar, a Harikatha performer, saw the musical talent in him and gave the prefix &quot;Bala&quot; (&quot;lit. child&quot;) to the young Balamuralikrishna. (Prior to this, his name was Muralikrishna; following Bhagavatar&#x27;s addition of the prefix, he began to be known as Balamuralikrishna.)

Having begun his musical career at a very young age, by age fifteen he had mastered all the 72 melakartha ragas and had composed krithis in each of them. His Janaka Raga Manjari was published in 1952 and recorded as Raagaanga Ravali in a nine-volume series by the Sangeeta Recording Company. Not merely content with his fame as a Carnatic vocalist, he also played the kanjira, mridangam, viola, and violin. He accompanied various musicians on the violin. He also presented solo viola concerts. He was the person who introduced viola to classical Indian music.

==Experimentation==

Characteristic of Balamuralikrishna&#x27;s musical journey have been his non-conformism, spirit of experimentation, and boundless creativity. Balamuralikrishna has experimented with the Carnatic music system by keeping its rich tradition untouched. Ragas such as &quot;Ganapathi, Sarvashri, Mahati, Lavangi&quot; etc. are credited to him. The ragas which he invented represent his quest for new frontiers. Ragas such as &quot;Lavangi&quot; are set to three or four notes in ascending and descending scale. Ragas such as &quot;Mahathi, Lavangi, Sidhdhi, Sumukham&quot; that he created have only four notes; while his other ragaa creations such as &quot;Sarva Sri, Omkaari,&quot; and &quot;Ganapathy&quot; have only three notes.

He also innovated in the &quot;tala&quot; (rhythm) system. He has incorporated &quot;gati bhEdam&quot; (గతి భేదం) in the &quot;sashabda kriya&quot; (సశబ్ద క్రియ). Actions that can produce sound/shabda (శబ్ద) in &quot;talas&quot; are called sashabda kriya – సశబ్ద క్రియ and are a part of the existing Tala chain. New chains are possible, too. Saint Arunagirinaadhar used to inject such systems in his famous Thirupugazh, but only as Sandham, while Balamuralikrishna is known to be the pioneer in bringing such Sandhams into a logical rhythm, with Angam and definition. &quot;Trimukhi, Panchamukhi, Saptamukhi,&quot; and &quot;Navamukhi&quot; are the basic classifications in his New Tala System.

He gave his authorisation to S. Ram Bharati to found &quot;Academy of Performing Arts and Research&quot; in Switzerland. He also worked on music therapy. After his death, his family started a trust in his name &#x27;Dr.M.Balamuralikrishna Memorial Trust&#x27; to honor and keep his legacy alive. He has authored a musical therapy research paper with Shreya Kappagantula regarding &quot;The Effects of Musical Therapy on Mental Disorders&quot;

==Compositions==
Balamuralikrishna has over 400 compositions to his credit and is one of the very few people to have composed in all the 72 Melakarta Ragas and has created several ragas, with 4 notes and 3 notes and also has invented a new Tala system. His compositions encompass every genre in Carnatic Music including Varnas, Krithis, Thillanas, Bhavageethas.

==Cinema==

Balamuralikrishna has sung in several films in Telugu, Sanskrit, Malayalam, Kannada and Tamil. He made his acting debut with the Telugu film &quot;Bhakta Prahlada&quot; (1967) as Narada, and has acted in a few other films in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.

==Death==

Balamuralikrishna died at his residence in Chennai on 22 November 2016; he was 86. He died in deep sleep at around five in the evening, due to a cardiac arrest. He was cremated with full state honours at Besant Nagar Crematorium in Chennai the very next day. Thousands attended his funeral. He is survived by three daughters and three sons who are all Doctors. His wife, Smt. Annapurna, outlived him for three months, and died on 16 February 2017.

==Legacy==
His family has formed the Dr. M. Balamurali Krishna Memorial Trust to represent him after his death.

==Ragas created==
==Talas created==

The &#x27;Mukhi&#x27; Tala system builds on the traditional Adhi Tala or Chathusra Jaathi Triputa Tala ( I 0 0 ), however the first kriya or mukha (meaning face) of each anga takes the gathi of its tala name and the rest in chathusra gathi. For example: Panchamukhi – the first kriya of each anga will be in kanda gathi and so the tala consists of 35 Matras (5 + 4 + 4 + 4 | 5 + 4 | 5 + 4 || ).

Following this method, four Talas can be generated:

This scheme can be extended across all 35 sooladi thalas, however currently these four are in practice.

Compositions:

There have been many pallavis set to panchamukhi Tala such as &#x27;&quot;Isai inbathirku ēdillaye ivulakil – sentamil&#x27;&quot; in ragam Lathangi composed by Amrutha Venkatesh and &#x27;&quot;Aadi Vaa, Pirai Soodi Vaa, Aalavaai Naathane&quot;&#x27; in ragam Abheri composed by Rameshvaidya and tuned by S.J Jananiy and also others in Bilahari, Thodi and Kalyani composed by Dr. Balamuralikrishna himself.

There have also been Alarippus composed for Bharathanatyam in Panchamukhi.

<doc id="437779" wikidata="Q1009612" url="?curid=437779" title="Bridge of Weir">
<text>Bridge of Weir is a village within the Renfrewshire council area and wider historic county of Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland.

Lying within the Gryffe Valley, Bridge of Weir owes its name to the historic crossing point that it provided over the River Gryffe. The village was initially formed around industries such as cotton and leather, reliant on the power of the river. These industries brought about its expansion in the 18th century in land attached to the 15th century Ranfurly Castle situated between the two established parishes of Kilbarchan and Houston and Killellan. A rail connection, as part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, in the 1860s, significantly supported the village&#x27;s development.

Today Bridge of Weir serves largely as a dormitory settlement for nearby Glasgow and Paisley, maintaining a commercial centre of its own and some light industry and agriculture. It remains well known for its leather production, which has continued since the first industry emerged.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The name of Bridge of Weir () is first recorded in the early 18th century before a significant settlement was constructed in the area. The &#x27;weir&#x27; is a reference to a salmon weir which used to be located on the Gryffe. An older name provided for the village is &quot;Port o&#x27;Weir&quot;, implying a river crossing; this name remained in some use even after the current name had been adopted.

===Early history===
Bridge of Weir was historically a rural area divided between the parishes of neighbouring Houston and Killellan and Kilbarchan on either side of the River Gryffe. Growing out of the lands of the 15th century Ranfurly Castle, the village emerged later than its neighbours among a number of small farms that occupied the area.

The earliest economy of the village was centred on the Renfrewshire cotton industry. From the late 18th century, the River Gryffe was exploited to power cotton mills. The bridge at Bridge of Weir was constructed at Burngill around 1770 and was considerably upgraded and widened in 1892 to allow for two-way traffic. It was finally demolished in 1964, with a more modern structure created. The bridge owes its construction to being on the route between the significant towns of Greenock and Paisley, with a Great Road constructed between the two in 1794.

Leather also emerged as a local product, with the village supporting three tanneries. The leather industry survives to this day, now on a single site, in the form of a highly successful, modern facility with five Queen&#x27;s Awards for International Business.

===Later expansion===
The Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal provided an initial link for Renfrewshire industry to its wider urban centres. The former canal provided a route for the later expansion of the railway to nearby settlements. From 1864, the Bridge of Weir Railway provided a rail link to Johnstone through the Bridge of Weir railway station in the village. From 1869, the line was incorporated into the wider Greenock and Ayrshire Railway, extending to Kilmacolm and beyond to Greenock. This railway substantially altered the character of the village and contributed to its forthcoming affluence. The railway closed on 10 January 1983 and now forms part of the Clyde to Forth cycle route (National Cycle Route 75).

==Economy==
Bridge of Weir is surrounded by agricultural lands, with traditional industries being cotton milling and leather tanning. The earliest cotton mills were built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries on the banks on the River Gryffe. Today, the town&#x27;s golf courses and fishing attract visitors and there the village has a commercial centre with retail stores, restaurants and public houses.

===Leather===

From the 18th century, the waulking mill was used in the production of leather with the Burngill Mill having been recorded in 1770. It was purchased by Andrew Muirhead in 1870 whose family had been in the leather industry in Glasgow for several generations. In 1905, Arthur Muirhead set up a further leather mill at the Laigh Mill (renamed the Clydesdale Works) and founded the Bridge of Weir Leather Company. Despite having several premises in the past, since the beginning of the 21st century, the company&#x27;s business has been consolidated at the Locher and Baltic Works.

The leather works continue to serve as a large employer in the area and trade their goods across the world. Some notable customers include:

*In 1989, the benches of the British Parliament&#x27;s House of Commons and House of Lords chambers in Westminster were reupholstered using Bridge of Weir leather.
* Bridge of Weir leather has upholstered many famous ocean liners, including Cunard&#x27;s Queens &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth 2&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;. Azimut Yachts and Sunseeker are also customers of Bridge of Weir Tannery.
*The Old Bailey, and many other notable public buildings around the world feature their leather.
* Several major airlines, including British Airways (including the Concorde), Virgin, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Qantas
* Automobile customers of Bridge of Weir leather include Aston Martin, Bentley, DeLorean, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Saab, Polestar, and Volvo. Also, some of Ford&#x27;s Model T (that were UK built) were upholstered with Bridge of Weir leather.

==Governance==
Bridge of Weir is part of the council area of Renfrewshire, as well the historic county of Renfrewshire which has wider boundaries and retains some official functions, for example as a registration county and lieutenancy area.

For elections to Renfrewshire Council, Bridge of Weir is part of ward 10, named &#x27;Bishopton, Bridge of Weir and Langbank&#x27;, which elects three of Renfrewshire&#x27;s forty councillors. The ward results in the most recent election are:



Bridge of Weir also has one of Renfrewshire&#x27;s twenty-seven community councils representing the village.

==Culture and community==
===Recreation===
Bisected by the River Gryffe, angling is available within the village. The river hosts brown trout, grayling and occasionally Atlantic salmon. Numerous outdoor pursuits are available at the nearby Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park. National Cycle Route 75 runs through the village.

The village is also known for its golf history. At one point there were five golf courses in the vicinity; today there are two remaining: the Old Course Ranfurly and the Ranfurly Castle golf clubs.
There was a thriving ice hockey team from around 1895 and in 1935 were Scottish National League Champions.

===Notable people===
*Margaret Sangster and Florence Sangster were born here in the 1890s and both had a leading effect on advertising.

He also competed in the U.S. versus Great Britain international cable matches from 1896–1901, compiling a +4−1=1 record.

==Assessment==

Showalter was known as &quot;the Kentucky Lion&quot; after his birthplace and his hairstyle, which consisted of a thick mane down the back of his neck, and perhaps also his playing strength. His wife Nellie was one of America&#x27;s leading female players, who won a match against Emanuel Lasker at knight odds 5–2.

A variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted is named after him (1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3).

The famous &quot;Capablanca Simplifying Manoeuvre&quot; in the Orthodox Variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.Rc1 c6 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Nd5) had in fact been used by Showalter in the 1890s, many years before José Raúl Capablanca played it.

Showalter was inducted in the World Chess Hall of Fame on August 7, 2010. His great granddaughter, Amy Showalter, attended the ceremony and accepted the plaque on behalf of the Showalter family. The content of the induction speech was supplied by Kevin Marchese of Columbus, Ohio, who is currently writing a biography on Showalter that was slated to be delivered in late 2016. As of April 2021, the manuscript is nearly completed with aspirations to publish in early 2022.

<doc id="437794" wikidata="Q7965290" url="?curid=437794" title="Walter Johnson High School">
<text>Walter Johnson High School (also known as Walter Johnson or WJ) is a public upper secondary school located in the census-designated place of North Bethesda, Maryland (Bethesda postal address). The school was founded in 1956 and named after Walter Johnson, a famous baseball player who was also a native of Montgomery County, Maryland. The high school was the first to be named after a player of Major League Baseball. WJHS serves portions of Bethesda, North Bethesda, Potomac, and Rockville, as well as the towns of Garrett Park and Kensington. It is a part of Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS).

==History==
The school first opened to grades 10-12 in 1956, and was named after the baseball pitcher and politician, Walter Johnson who lived in the area and had died 10 years prior. The school&#x27;s original mascot and team name was The Spartans; as the student body chose the school colors based on the colors and name of Michigan State University, Spartans. Originally, the school only educated 11th and 12th grader&#x27;s.

In 1963 Mighty Moo, a dairy cow named after the cows that roamed the fields before the school was built, was named the school mascot. After a 1987 consolidation with nearby Charles W. Woodward High School, Walter Johnson maintained its school colors of white and green, but adopted Woodward&#x27;s mascot, &quot;Wild Thing&quot; the Wildcat. In 1963, a group of Seniors&#x27;s painted Mighty Moo onto the school chimney where it remains to this day.

In 2024 the student body expanded to over 3,000 kids, with each grade&#x27;s having over 700 kids apiece. To deal with the rampant overpopulation of the school, Woodward High School will be reopened in 2027. The construction of Woodward High School has been problematic with up to 39 million dollars having been lost in funding.

== Academics ==
Walter Johnson High School established their APEX-Reach Signature Program in 1996. This APEX-Reach Program leads students through a more rigorous curriculum through a combination of honors and Advance Placement (AP) classes.

The school offers Advance Placement (AP) classes since pre-1996 with a total 28 AP classes. Since the fall of 2023, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) will pay for all AP and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams that students who take these courses will take.

WJ students average a score of 1192 on the SAT, with 604 on verbal and 588 on math.

As of 2024, Walter Johnson is the 15th-ranked high school in Maryland and the 855th-ranked nationally, according to U.S News and World Report. 

== Construction ==
In 1960, sixteen more rooms were added to the school along ten more in 1964. Construction in the mid-1970s introduced the addition to a secondary gym and theater. In the merge with the Charles W. Woodward High School, more lockers, trophy cases, and seven portable classrooms were added. 

At the start of the 2001-2002 school year began construction plans to renovate the school. The construction took ten years which include new installations like 19 more classrooms, 4 more science labs, a new cafeteria, stadium, media center, new gym, and new auditorium. The renovation also include the addition of more amenities like an art, music, and technology suite. The school&#x27;s entrance was designed to have a glass ceiling decorated with 90 national flags respresenting the nationalities of the student population.

== School Articulation Patterns ==
Walter Johnson serves two middle schools, each of which serve three elementary schools.

=== Expected Changes ===
With overcrowding at many schools in the downcounty area, especially Walter Johnson, Woodward will be fully reopening with the goal of alleviating overcrowding at nearby schools. To address these concerns, MCPS has begun a boundary study that will affect up to eight high school service areas: Bethesda-Chevy Chase, Walter Johnson, Walt Whitman, and the five high schools within the Downcounty Consortium. The boundary changes are expected to take place at the start of the 2027-28 school year, when Northwood high school students will return to their expanded facility.

== Activities ==
=== Athletics ===
The school offers a variety of sports with fall, winter, and springs sports. In the fall, the school offers cross country, field hockey, football, golf, pom&#x27;s, soccer, and volleyball.

<text>The 2003 State of the Union Address was given by the 43rd president of the United States, George W. Bush, on January 28, 2003, at 9:00 p.m. EST, in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives to the 108th United States Congress. It was Bush&#x27;s second State of the Union Address and his third speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, accompanied by Dick Cheney, the vice president, in his capacity as the president of the Senate.

It outlined justifications for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It began his discussion of the &quot;war on terror&quot; by asserting, as he had after September 11, 2001 and in his previous State of the Union, that &quot;the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.&quot; In 2002, Bush had laid out the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, touching on Iran and North Korea before elaborating on Iraq. The 2003 speech would focus entirely on Iraq, in parallel with an ongoing campaign in the United Nations for support on an Iraq intervention.

Bush said that Saddam Hussein, &quot;a brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.&quot; In this context, Bush also said, &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa&quot;, a line which became a source of contention in the later Plame affair. The domestic brutality of Hussein and the benefits of liberty and freedom for the Iraqi people were briefly noted near the end of the speech. He began with, &quot;In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong.&quot; 
In the middle of the speech, he said, &quot;In Afghanistan, we helped liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children — boys and girls.&quot;
He ended with, &quot;Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America&#x27;s gift to the world, it is God&#x27;s gift to humanity.&quot; He spoke to the 108th United States Congress.

Just before the President addressed Iraq in the speech, he spent five paragraphs addressing his initiative to fight AIDS in Africa.

The Democratic response was given by then Washington Governor Gary Locke, who was appointed to be United States Ambassador to China in 2011.

<doc id="437806" wikidata="Q636214" url="?curid=437806" title="Jack Sheppard">
<text>John &quot;Jack&quot; Sheppard (4 March 1702 – 16 November 1724), or &quot;Honest Jack&quot;, was a notorious English thief and prison escapee of early 18th-century London.

Born into a poor family, he was apprenticed as a carpenter, but began committing theft and burglary in 1723 with little more than a year of his training to complete. He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724, but escaped four times from prison, making him notorious, though popular with the poorer classes. Ultimately, he was caught, convicted, and hanged at Tyburn, ending his brief criminal career after less than two years. The inability of the notorious &quot;Thief-Taker General&quot; Jonathan Wild to control Sheppard, and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard&#x27;s colleague Joseph &quot;Blueskin&quot; Blake, resulted in Wild&#x27;s demise as a criminal boss.

Sheppard was as renowned for his attempts to escape from prison as he was for his crimes. An autobiographical &quot;Narrative&quot;, thought to have been ghostwritten by Daniel Defoe, was sold at his execution, quickly followed by popular plays. The character of Macheath in John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1728) was based on Sheppard, keeping him well-known for more than 100 years. He returned to the public consciousness around 1840, when William Harrison Ainsworth wrote a novel entitled &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;, with illustrations by George Cruikshank. The popularity of his tale, and the fear that others would be drawn to emulate his behaviour, caused the authorities to refuse to license any plays in London with &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; in the title for forty years.

== Early life ==
Sheppard was born in White&#x27;s Row, in London&#x27;s Spitalfields. He was baptised on 5 March, the day after he was born, at St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney, suggesting a fear of infant mortality by his parents, perhaps because the newborn was weak or sickly. His parents named him after an older brother, John, who had died before Sheppard&#x27;s birth. In life, he was better known as Jack, or even &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; or &quot;Jack the Lad&quot;. He had a second brother, Thomas, and a younger sister, Mary. Their father, a carpenter, died while Sheppard was young, and his sister died two years later.

Unable to support her family without her husband&#x27;s income, Jack&#x27;s mother sent him to Mr Garrett&#x27;s School, a workhouse near St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate, when he was six years old. Sheppard was sent out as a parish apprentice to a cane-chair maker, taking a settlement of 20 shillings, but his new master soon died. He was sent out to a second cane-chair maker, but Sheppard was treated badly. Finally, when Sheppard was 10 years old, he went to work as a shop-boy for William Kneebone, a wool draper with a shop on the Strand. Sheppard&#x27;s mother had been working for Kneebone since her husband&#x27;s death. Kneebone taught Sheppard to read and write and apprenticed him to a carpenter, Owen Wood, in Wych Street, off Drury Lane in Covent Garden. Sheppard signed his seven-year indenture on 2 April 1717.

By 1722, Sheppard was showing great promise as a carpenter. Aged 20, he was a small man, only 5&#x27;4&quot; (1.63 m) and lightly built, but deceptively strong. He had a pale face with large, dark eyes, a wide mouth and a quick smile. Despite a slight stutter, his wit made him popular in the taverns of Drury Lane. He served five unblemished years of his apprenticeship but then began to become involved with crime.

Joseph Hayne, a button-moulder who owned a shop nearby, also managed a tavern named the Black Lion off Drury Lane, which he encouraged the local apprentices to frequent. The Black Lion was visited by criminals such as Joseph &quot;Blueskin&quot; Blake, Sheppard&#x27;s future partner in crime, and self-proclaimed &quot;Thief-Taker General&quot; Jonathan Wild, secretly the boss of a criminal gang which operated across London and later Sheppard&#x27;s implacable enemy.

According to Sheppard&#x27;s autobiography, he had been an innocent until going to Hayne&#x27;s tavern, but there began a preference for strong drink and the affections of Elizabeth Lyon, a prostitute also known as Edgworth Bess (or Edgeworth Bess) from her place of birth at Edgeworth in Middlesex. In his &quot;History&quot;, Defoe records that Bess was &quot;a main lodestone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt&quot;. Such, Sheppard claimed, was the source of his later ruin. Peter Linebaugh offers a more politicised version: that Sheppard&#x27;s sudden transformation was a liberation from the dull drudgery of indentured labour and that he progressed from pious servitude to self-confident rebellion and Levelling.

== Criminal career ==
Sheppard began habitually drinking and whoring. Inevitably, his carpentry suffered, and he became disobedient to his master. With Lyon&#x27;s encouragement, Sheppard began criminal activity in order to augment his legitimate wages. His first recorded theft was in Spring 1723, when he engaged in petty shoplifting, stealing two silver spoons while on an errand for his master to the Rummer Tavern in Charing Cross. Sheppard&#x27;s misdeeds were undetected, and he progressed to larger crimes, often stealing goods from the houses where he was working. Finally, he quit the employ of his master on 2 August 1723, with less than two years of his apprenticeship left, although he continued to work as a journeyman carpenter. He was not suspected of the crimes, and progressed to burglary, in company with criminals in Jonathan Wild&#x27;s gang.

He relocated to Fulham, living as husband and wife with Lyon at Parsons Green, before relocating to Piccadilly. When Lyon was arrested and imprisoned at St Giles&#x27;s Roundhouse, the beadle, a Mr Brown, refused to let Sheppard visit, so he broke in and took her away.

=== Arrested and escaped twice ===
Sheppard was first arrested after a burglary he committed with his brother, Tom, and his mistress, Lyon, in Clare Market on 5 February 1724. Tom, also a carpenter, had already been convicted once for stealing tools from his master the previous autumn and burned in the hand. Tom was arrested again on 24 April 1724. Afraid that he would be hanged this time, Tom informed on Jack, and a warrant was issued for Jack&#x27;s arrest.

Jonathan Wild was aware of Sheppard&#x27;s thefts, as Sheppard had fenced some stolen goods through one of Wild&#x27;s men, William Field. Wild asked another of his men, James Sykes (known as &quot;Hell and Fury&quot;) to challenge Sheppard to a game of skittles at Redgate&#x27;s public house near Seven Dials. Sykes betrayed Sheppard to a Mr Price, a constable from the parish of St Giles, to gather the usual £40 reward for giving information resulting in the conviction of a felon. The magistrate, Justice Parry, had Sheppard imprisoned overnight on the top floor of St Giles&#x27;s Roundhouse pending further questioning, but Sheppard escaped within three hours by breaking through the timber ceiling and lowering himself to the ground with a rope fashioned from bedclothes. Still wearing irons, Sheppard coolly joined the crowd that had been attracted by the sounds of his breaking out. He distracted their attention by pointing to the shadows on the roof and shouting that he could see the escapee, and then swiftly departed.

On 19 May 1724, Sheppard was arrested for a second time, caught in the act of picking a pocket in Leicester Fields (near present-day Leicester Square). He was detained overnight in St Ann&#x27;s Roundhouse in Soho and visited there the next day by Lyon; she was recognised as his wife and locked in a cell with him. They appeared before Justice Walters, who sent them to the New Prison in Clerkenwell, but they escaped from their cell, known as the Newgate Ward, within a matter of days. By 25 May, Whitsun Monday, Sheppard and Lyon had filed through their manacles; they removed a bar from the window and used their knotted bed-clothes to descend to ground level. Finding themselves in the yard of the neighbouring Bridewell, they clambered over the 22-foot-high (6.7 m) prison gate to freedom. This feat was widely publicised, not least because Sheppard was only a small man, and Lyon was a large, buxom woman.

=== Third arrest, trial, and third escape ===
Sheppard&#x27;s thieving abilities were admired by Jonathan Wild. Wild demanded that Sheppard surrender his stolen goods for Wild to fence, and so take the greater profits, but Sheppard refused. He began to work with Joseph &quot;Blueskin&quot; Blake, and they burgled Sheppard&#x27;s former master, William Kneebone, on Sunday 12 July 1724. Wild could not permit Sheppard to continue outside his control and began to seek Sheppard&#x27;s arrest. Unfortunately for Sheppard, his fence, William Field, was one of Wild&#x27;s men. After Sheppard had a brief foray with Blueskin as highwaymen on the Hampstead Road on Sunday 19 July and Monday 20 July, Field informed on Sheppard to Wild. Wild believed Lyon would know Sheppard&#x27;s whereabouts, so he plied her with drinks at a brandy shop near Temple Bar until she betrayed him. Sheppard was arrested a third time at Blueskin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brandy shop in Rosemary Lane, east of the Tower of London (later renamed Royal Mint Street), on 23 July by Wild&#x27;s henchman, Quilt Arnold.

Sheppard was imprisoned in Newgate Prison pending his trial at the next Assize of &quot;oyer and terminer&quot;. He was prosecuted on three charges of theft at the Old Bailey, but was acquitted on the first two due to lack of evidence. Kneebone, Wild and Field gave evidence against him on the third charge, the burglary of Kneebone&#x27;s house. He was convicted on 12 August, the case &quot;being plainly prov&#x27;d&quot;, and sentenced to death. On Monday 31 August, the very day when the death warrant arrived from the court in Windsor setting Friday 4 September as the date for his execution, Sheppard escaped. Having loosened an iron bar in a window used when talking to visitors, he was visited by Lyon and Poll Maggott, who distracted the guards while he removed the bar (security was lax compared to that of later years; the guard-to-prisoner ratio at Newgate in 1724 was 1:90, and wives could stay overnight). His slight build enabled him to climb through the resulting gap in the grille, and he was smuggled out of Newgate in women&#x27;s clothing that his visitors had brought him. He took a coach to Blackfriars Stairs, a boat up the River Thames to the horse ferry in Westminster, near the warehouse where he hid his stolen goods, and completed his escape.

=== Fourth arrest and final escape ===
By this time, Sheppard was a hero to a segment of the population, being a cockney, non-violent, handsome and seemingly able to escape punishment for his crimes at will. He spent a few days out of London, visiting a friend&#x27;s family in Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, but was soon back in town. He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid on Finchley Common, and returned to the condemned cell at Newgate. His fame had increased with each escape, and he was visited in prison by various people. His plans to escape during September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell, and he was transferred to a strong-room in Newgate known as the &quot;Castle&quot;, put in leg irons, and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts. After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient, by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will, he was bound more tightly and handcuffed. In his &quot;History&quot;, Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament, joking that &quot;I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country, but they are all at my Heels &quot;Baughing&quot; after me&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;Blueskin&quot; Blake was arrested by Wild and his men on Friday 9 October, and Tom, Jack&#x27;s brother, was transported for robbery on Saturday 10 October 1724. New court sessions began on Wednesday 14 October, and Blueskin was tried on Thursday 15 October, with Field and Wild again giving evidence. Their accounts were not consistent with the evidence that they gave at Sheppard&#x27;s trial, but Blueskin was convicted anyway. Enraged, Blueskin attacked Wild in the courtroom, slashing his throat with a pocket-knife and causing an uproar. Wild was lucky to survive, and his control of his criminal gang was weakened while he recuperated.
Taking advantage of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. He removed the bar and used it to break through the ceiling into the &quot;Red Room&quot; above the &quot;Castle&quot;, a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. Still wearing his leg irons as night began, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60 feet (20 m) above the ground. He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. He broke into Bird&#x27;s house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). Spotted by the barn&#x27;s owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to provide for a (nonexistent) bastard son. His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith&#x27;s tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard&#x27;s mistresses. This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, &quot;The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard&quot;. In his &quot;History&quot;, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard&#x27;s escape.

=== Final capture ===

Sheppard&#x27;s final period of liberty lasted just two weeks. He disguised himself as a beggar and returned to the city. He broke into the Rawlins brothers&#x27; pawnbroker&#x27;s shop in Drury Lane on the night of 29 October 1724, taking a black silk suit, a silver sword, rings, watches, a wig, and other items. He dressed himself as a dandy gentleman and used the proceeds to spend a day and the ensuing evening on the tiles with two mistresses. He was arrested a final time in the early morning on 1 November, drunk, &quot;in a handsome Suit of Black, with a Diamond Ring and a carnelian ring on his Finger, and a fine Light Tye Peruke&quot;.

This time, Sheppard was placed in the Middle Stone Room, in the centre of Newgate next to the &quot;Castle&quot;, where he could be observed at all times. He was also loaded with 300 pounds of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors four shillings to see him, and the King&#x27;s painter James Thornhill painted his portrait. Several prominent people sent a petition to King George I, begging for his sentence of death to be commuted to transportation. &quot;The Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see him was exceeding Great, he was always Chearful and Pleasant to a Degree, as turning almost everything as was said onto a Jest and Banter.&quot; To a Reverend Wagstaffe who visited him, he said, according to Defoe, &quot;One file&#x27;s worth all the Bibles in the World&quot;.

Sheppard came before Mr Justice Powis in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench at Westminster Hall on 10 November. He was offered the chance to have his sentence reduced by informing on his associates, but he scorned the offer, and the death sentence was confirmed. The next day, Blueskin was hanged, and Sheppard was moved to the condemned cell.

== Execution ==
The next Monday, 16 November, Sheppard was taken to the gallows at Tyburn to be hanged. He planned one more escape, but his pen-knife, intended to cut the ropes binding him on the way to the gallows, was found by a prison warder shortly before he left Newgate for the last time.

A joyous procession passed through the streets of London, with Sheppard&#x27;s cart drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street accompanied by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men. The occasion was as much as anything a celebration of Sheppard&#x27;s life, attended by crowds of as many as 200,000 people (one third of London&#x27;s population). The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a pint of sack. A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn, where his &quot;official&quot; autobiography, published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe, was on sale. Sheppard handed &quot;a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold&quot;, perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the &quot;Narrative&quot;. His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes, but it caused him a slow death by strangulation from the hangman&#x27;s noose. After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes, his body was cut down. The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed, fearing dissection; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard&#x27;s friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him. His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields that evening.

== Legacy ==

There was a spectacular public reaction to Sheppard&#x27;s deeds, which were cited favourably as an example in newspapers. Pamphlets, broadsheets, and ballads were all devoted to his amazing experiences, real and fictional, and his story was adapted for the stage almost immediately. &quot;Harlequin Sheppard&quot;, a pantomime by one John Thurmond (subtitled &quot;A night scene in grotesque characters&quot;), opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on Saturday 28 November, only two weeks after Sheppard&#x27;s hanging. In a famous contemporary sermon, a London preacher drew on Sheppard&#x27;s popular escapes as a way of holding his congregation&#x27;s attention:

The account of his life remained well-known through the &quot;Newgate Calendar&quot;, and a three-act farce was published but never produced, but, mixed with songs, it became &quot;The Quaker&#x27;s Opera&quot;, later performed at Bartholomew Fair. An imagined dialogue between Jack Sheppard and Julius Caesar was published in the &quot;British Journal&quot; on 4 December 1724, in which Sheppard favourably compares his virtues and exploits to those of Caesar.

Perhaps the most prominent play based on Sheppard&#x27;s life is John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1728). Sheppard was the inspiration for the character Captain Macheath; his nemesis, Peachum, is based on Jonathan Wild. The play was spectacularly popular, restoring the fortune that Gay had lost in the South Sea Bubble, and was produced regularly for more than 100 years. An unperformed but published play &quot;The Prison-Breaker&quot; was turned into &quot;The Quaker&#x27;s Opera&quot; (in imitation of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;) and performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1725 and 1728. Two centuries later &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was the basis for &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill (1928).

Sheppard&#x27;s tale may have been an inspiration for William Hogarth&#x27;s 1747 series of 12 engravings, &quot;Industry and Idleness&quot;, which shows the parallel habituation of an apprentice, Tom Idle, to crime, resulting in his being hung, beside the fortunes of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master&#x27;s daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.

Sheppard&#x27;s tale was revived during the first half of the 19th century. A melodrama, &quot;Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724&quot;, by W. T. Moncrieff was published in 1825. More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s third novel, entitled &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;, which was published originally in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank, overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. An archetypal Newgate novel, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard&#x27;s life, but portrays him as a daring hero. Like Hogarth&#x27;s prints, the novel pairs the increasing involvement of the &quot;idle&quot; apprentice with crime with the fortunes of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. Cruikshank&#x27;s images perfectly complemented Ainsworth&#x27;s tale—William Thackeray wrote that &quot;... Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, and that Mr Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it.&quot; The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Ainsworth&#x27;s novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre featuring (strangely enough) Mary Anne Keeley; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank&#x27;s illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, tableaux on stage. It has been described as the &quot;exemplary climax&quot; of &quot;the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially&quot;.

The story generated a type of cultural mania, embellished by pamphlets, prints, cartoons, plays and souvenirs, not repeated until George du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Trilby&quot; in 1895. By early 1840, a cant song from Buckstone&#x27;s play &quot;Nix My Dolly, Pals, Fake Away&quot; was reported to be &quot;deafening us in the streets&quot;. Public alarm at the possibility that young people would emulate Sheppard&#x27;s behaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to ban, at least in London, the licensing of any plays with &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; in the title for forty years. The fear may not have been entirely unfounded: Courvousier, the valet of Lord William Russell, said in one of his several confessions that the book had inspired him to murder his master. Frank and Jesse James wrote letters to the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; signed &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;. Nevertheless, burlesques of the story were written after the ban was ended, including a popular Gaiety Theatre, London, piece called &quot;Little Jack Sheppard&quot; (1886) by Henry Pottinger Stephens and William Yardley, which featured Nellie Farren as Jack.

The Sheppard story has been revived three times as movies the 20th century: &quot;The Hairbreadth Escape of Jack Sheppard&quot; (1900), &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; (1923), and &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot; (1969), a British historical drama directed by James Clavell with Tommy Steele in the title role. Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel &quot;The Fatal Tree&quot;. In &quot;Confessions of the Fox&quot;, a 2018 novel by Jordy Rosenberg, the Sheppard story was recontextualised as a queer narrative.

In 1971 British popular music group Chicory Tip paid tribute to Sheppard in &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Jack&quot;, the B-side to &quot;I Love Onions&quot;. The song, apparently sung from the viewpoint of a witness in the courtroom, describes Jack&#x27;s daring exploits as a thief, and futilely begs the judge to spare Sheppard because he was loved by the women of the town, and idolised by the lads who &quot;made him their king&quot;.

In Jordy Rosenberg&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Confessions of the Fox&quot;, a 21st-century academic discovers a manuscript containing Sheppard&#x27;s &quot;confessions&quot;, which tell the story of his childhood and his love affair with Edgeworth Bess, and reveals that he was a transgender man.

The reasons for the lasting legacy of Sheppard&#x27;s exploits in the popular imagination have been addressed by Peter Linebaugh, who suggests that Sheppard&#x27;s legend was based on the prospect of excarceration, of escape from what Michel Foucault in &quot;Folie et déraison&quot; termed the &quot;grand renfermement&quot; (&quot;Great Confinement&quot;), in which &quot;unreasonable&quot; members of the population were locked away and institutionalised. Linebaugh further says that the laws applied to Sheppard and similar working class criminals were a means of disciplining a potentially rebellious multitude into accepting increasingly harsh property laws. Another nineteenth-century opinion of the Jack Sheppard phenomenon was offered by Charles Mackay in &quot;Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;:

<doc id="437807" wikidata="Q334687" url="?curid=437807" title="Anaximander (crater)">
<text>Anaximander is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northwest limb of the Moon. It is joined at the northern rim by the crater Carpenter, a younger and better-defined formation. To the southeast is the much larger J. Herschel, a formation of the variety known as a walled plain.

The outer wall of Anaximander is heavily worn and eroded, with multiple notches and breaks. There is no central peak, but the floor contains several small craterlets and a multitude of tiny pits from minor impacts. This crater has merged with the larger Anaximander D to the south, and there is a wide break in their common rims where they have joined. To the northwest a low rise in the surface is all that separated Anaximander from the much larger satellite crater Anaximander B.

The crater is named for the 6th century BCE Greek philosopher and astronomer Anaximander.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Anaximander.

<doc id="437808" wikidata="Q2003797" url="?curid=437808" title="Bank of Baroda">
<text>Bank of Baroda (BOB or BoB) is an Indian government Public sector bank headquartered in Vadodara, Gujarat. It is the second largest public sector bank in India after State Bank of India. Based on 2023 data, it is ranked 586 on the Forbes Global 2000 list.

The Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, founded the bank on 20 July 1908 in the princely state of Baroda, in Gujarat. The Government of India nationalized the Bank of Baroda, along with 13 other major commercial banks of India, on 19 July 1969 and the bank was designated as a profit-making public sector undertaking (PSU).

==History==

In 1908, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, set up the Bank of Baroda (BoB), with other stalwarts of industry such as Sampatrao Gaekwad, Ralph Whitenack, Vithaldas Thakersey, Lallubhai Samaldas, Tulsidas Kilachand and NM Chokshi. Two years later, BoB established its first branch in Ahmedabad. The bank grew domestically until after World War II. Then in 1953 it crossed the Indian Ocean to serve the communities of Indians in Kenya and Indians in Uganda by establishing a branch each in Mombasa and Kampala. The next year it opened a second branch in Kenya, in Nairobi, and in 1956 it opened a branch in Tanzania at Dar-es-Salaam. Then in 1957, BoB took a big step abroad by establishing a branch in London. London was the center of the British Commonwealth and the most important international banking center. In 1958 BoB acquired Hind Bank (Calcutta; est. 1943), which became BoB&#x27;s first domestic acquisition.

===1960s===

In 1961, BoB acquired New Citizen Bank of India. This merger helped it increase its branch network in Maharashtra. BoB also opened a branch in Fiji. The next year it opened a branch in Mauritius

In 1963, BoB acquired Surat Banking Corporation in Surat, Gujarat. The next year BoB acquired two banks: Umbergaon People&#x27;s Bank in southern Gujarat and Tamil Nadu Central Bank in Tamil Nadu state.

In 1965, BoB opened a branch in Guyana. That same year BoB lost its branch in Narayanganj (East Pakistan) due to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. It is unclear when BoB had opened the branch. In 1967 it suffered a second loss of branches when the Tanzanian government nationalised BoB&#x27;s three branches there at (Dar es Salaam, Mwanga, and Moshi), and transferred their operations to the Tanzanian government-owned National Banking Corporation.

In 1969, the Indian government nationalised 14 top banks including BoB. BoB incorporated its operations in Uganda as a 51% subsidiary, with the government owning the rest.

In 1972, BoB acquired Bank of India&#x27;s operations in Uganda. Two years later, BoB opened a branch each in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Back in India, in 1975, BoB acquired the majority shareholding and management control of Bareilly Corporation Bank (est. 1954) and Nainital Bank (est. in 1922), both in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand respectively. Since then, Nainital Bank has expanded to Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi state. Right now BoB have 99% shareholding in Nainital Bank.

In 1980, BoB opened a branch in Bahrain and a representative office in Sydney, Australia. BoB, Union Bank of India and Indian Bank established IUB International Finance, a licensed deposit taker, in Hong Kong. Each of the three banks took an equal share. Eventually (in 1999), BoB would buy out its partners.

A second consortium or joint-venture bank followed in 1985. BoB (20%), Bank of India (20%), Central Bank of India (20%) and ZIMCO (Zambian government; 40%) established Indo-Zambia Bank in Lusaka. That same year BoB also opened an Offshore Banking Unit (OBU) in Bahrain (Gulf).

In 1992, BoB opened an OBU in Mauritius, but closed its representative office in Sydney. The next year BoB took over the London branches of Union Bank of India and Punjab &amp; Sind Bank (P&amp;S). P&amp;S&#x27;s branch had been established before 1970 and Union Bank&#x27;s after 1980. The Reserve Bank of India ordered the takeover of the two following the banks&#x27; involvement in the Sethia fraud in 1987 and subsequent losses.

In 1996, BoB Bank entered the capital market in December with an initial public offering (IPO). The government of India is still the largest shareholder, owning 66% of the bank&#x27;s equity.

In 1997, BoB opened a branch in Durban. The next year BoB bought out its partners in IUB International Finance in Hong Kong. Apparently this was a response to regulatory changes following Hong Kong&#x27;s reversion to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The now wholly owned subsidiary became Bank of Baroda (Hong Kong), a restricted license bank. BoB also acquired Punjab Cooperative Bank in a rescue. BoB incorporate a wholly–owned subsidiary, BOB Capital Markets, for broking business.

In 1999, BoB merged in Bareilly Corporation Bank in another rescue. At the time, Bareilly had 64 branches, including four in Delhi. In Guyana, BoB incorporated its branch as a subsidiary, Bank of Baroda Guyana. BoB added a branch in Mauritius and closed its Harrow Branch in London.

In 2002 BoB acquired Benares State Bank (BSB) at the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s request. BSB had been established in 1946 but traced its origins back to 1871 and its function as the treasury office of the Benares state. In 1964 BSB had acquired Bareilly Bank (est. 1934), with seven branches in western districts of Uttar Pradesh; BSB also had taken over Lucknow Bank in 1968. The acquisition of BSB brought BoB 105 new branches. Lucknow Bank, a unit bank with its only office in Aminabad, had been established in 1913. Also in 2002, BoB listed Bank of Baroda (Uganda) on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE). The next year BoB opened an OBU in Mumbai.

In 2004 BoB acquired the failed south Gujarat Local Area Bank. BoB also returned to Tanzania by establishing a subsidiary in Dar-es-Salaam. BoB also opened a representative office each in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Guangdong, China.

In 2006 BoB established an Offshore Banking Unit (OBU) in Singapore.

In 2007, its centenary year, BoB&#x27;s total business crossed 2.09 trillion (short scale), its branches crossed 2000, and its global customer base 29 million people. In Hong Kong, Bank got Full Fledged Banking license and business of its Restricted License Banking subsidiary was taken over Bank of Baroda branch in Hong Kong w.e.f.01.04.2007.

In 2008 BoB opened a branch in Guangzhou, China (02/08/2008) and in Kenton, Harrow United Kingdom. BoB opened a joint venture life insurance company with Andhra Bank and Legal &amp; General (UK) called IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company.

In 2009 Bank of Baroda (New Zealand) was registered. BoB (NZ) has 3 branches: two in Auckland, one in Wellington.

===2010s===
In 2010 Malaysia awarded a commercial banking licence to a locally incorporated bank to be jointly owned by Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Andhra Bank.

In 2011 BoB opened an Electronic Banking Service Unit (EBSU) at Hamriya Free Zone, Sharjah (UAE). It also opened four new branches in existing operations in Uganda, Kenya (2), and Guyana. BoB closed its representative office in Malaysia in anticipation of the opening of its consortium bank there. BoB received &#x27;In Principle&#x27; approval for the upgrading of its representative office in Australia to a branch. Bob also acquired Mumbai-based Memon Cooperative Bank, which had 225 employees and 15 branches in Maharashtra and three in Gujarat. It had to suspend operations in May 2009 due to its precarious financial condition.

The Malaysian consortium bank, India International Bank Malaysia (IIBM), finally opened in Kuala Lumpur, which has a large population of Indians. BOB owns 40%, Andhra Bank owns 25%, and IOB the remaining 35% of the share capital. IIBM seeks to open five branches within its first year of operations in Malaysia, and intends to grow to 15 branches within the next three years.

On 17 September 2018, the government of India proposed the merger of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with the Bank of Baroda, pending approval from the boards of the three banks, effectively creating the third largest lender in the country. The merger was approved by the Union Cabinet and the boards of the banks on 2 January 2019. Under the terms of the merger, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank shareholders received 110 and 402 equity shares of the Bank of Baroda, respectively, of face value 2 for every 1,000 shares they held. The merger came into effect on 1 April 2019. Post-merger, the Bank of Baroda is the third largest bank in India, after State Bank of India and HDFC Bank. The consolidated entity has over 9,500 branches, 13,400 ATMs, 85,000 employees and serves 120 million customers. The amalgamation is the first-ever three-way consolidation of banks in the country, with a combined business of Rs14.82 trillion (short scale), making it the third largest bank after State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank. Post-merger effective 1 April 2019, the bank has become the India&#x27;s third largest lender behind SBI and ICICI Bank.

Bank of Baroda announced in May 2019 that it would either close or rationalise 800–900 branches to increase operational efficiency and reduce duplication post-merger. The regional and zonal offices of the merged companies would also be closed. &quot;PTI&quot; quoted an unnamed senior bank official as stating that Bank of Baroda would look to expand in eastern India as it already had a strong presence in the other regions.

==Recent developments==

They followed a similar approach with Mumbai Metro where Andheri metro station has been named as Bank of Baroda Andheri
* Bank of Baroda sealed a 3-year principal sponsorship contract with Olympics 2016 Women&#x27;s badminton silver medalist P. V. Sindhu and India&#x27;s No 1 ranked Men&#x27;s Badminton player Srikanth Kidambi.
* Bank of Baroda became the first National Supporter (Indian sponsor) of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, the first football World Cup to be hosted in India

==South Africa corruption controversy==
On 4 September 2017 the South Africa Financial Intelligence Centre fined Bank of Baroda 11 million (equivalent to US$837,000) for flouting anti-corruption laws in transactions on accounts owned by the Gupta family. Following the flagging of 36 suspicious transactions through Gupta-family-owned accounts over a ten-month period valued at 4.2 billion, the bank tried to close the accounts. The Gupta family has filed an interdict against the bank to prevent it from closing their accounts. During February 2018, it was announced that the Bank of Baroda has given notification to the South African Reserve Bank that it will be exiting the country.

The bank played a crucial role in the Gupta family&#x27;s business dealings. According to a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Bank of Baroda allowed the Gupta family to move millions of dollars in alleged corrupt business transactions to offshore accounts. Although the Bank of Baroda denies the illicit behavior, the documents report that the bank&#x27;s South African branch issued unapproved loan guarantees, ignored internal compliance efforts, and averted regulators from learning about suspicious transactions in a way that benefited the Guptas’ network. Around 4.5m Rand has circulated around a handful of Gupta-associated companies between 2007 and 2017. Due to the volume of Gupta owned accounts, the majority of the bank&#x27;s transactions in Johannesburg involved Gupta family funds.

Reports reveal that inter-company loans provided an untraceable and inexplicable technique used by the Gupta brothers to transfer money from the Bank to various Gupta-owned companies like Trillion Financial Advisory and Centaur Mining. The suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by workers at the Bank of Baroda related to Gupta transactions were often voided by managers and higher-level bank officials. Most SARs failed to reach the South African Financial Intelligence Centre as a result.

<text>Anaximenes is a low-rimmed lunar impact crater near the north-northwest limb of the Moon. It lies to the west of the crater Philolaus, and northeast of Carpenter. To the northwest is Poncelet, close to the visible edge of the Moon.

The outer rim of Anaximenes has been eroded and worn into a roughly circular ring of ridges. The rim is lowest along the northeast side where Anaximenes partly overlaps the equally worn satellite crater Anaximenes G. There are also low cuts through the rim along the southeast, where the crater is attached to an unnamed plain in the surface.

The interior floor of Anaximenes is relatively level, compared to the typical lunar terrain. The inner surface is pock-marked by a multitude of tiny craterlets of various dimensions, the most notable having a diameter of 2-3 kilometers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Anaximenes.

<text>Susan Howlet Butcher (December 26, 1954 – August 5, 2006) was an American dog musher, noteworthy as the second woman to win the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1986, the second four-time winner in 1990, and the first to win four out of five sequential years. She is commemorated in Alaska by the Susan Butcher Day.

==Life and career==

Susan Butcher was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a lover of dogs and the outdoors. She completed secondary school at the Warehouse Cooperative School, then studied at Colorado State University, and ultimately became a veterinary technician.

To pursue her love of dogsled racing and breeding huskies, she moved to the Wrangell Mountains area of Alaska. There Butcher began training to compete in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a grueling 1,112 to 1,131-mile race through arctic blizzard conditions across the Alaska wilderness, which tests the endurance of both mushers and dogs over the course of one to two weeks. She spent two years working for Iditarod founder Joe Redington in exchange for dogs to build up her team. In 1979, she and Redington, along with Ray Genet and two others, made the first dog-sled ascent of Denali.

After placing in several Iditarods, Butcher was forced to withdraw early in the 1985 when two of her dogs were killed by a crazed moose, despite Butcher&#x27;s attempts to ward the animal off, and thirteen others were injured. Libby Riddles, a relative newcomer, braved a blizzard and became the first woman to win the Iditarod that year.

The more experienced Butcher won the next race in 1986, and then proceeded to win again in 1987, 1988, and 1990. She joins fellow four-time winners Martin Buser, Jeff King, Lance Mackey, Doug Swingley, and Rick Swenson who won five, and Dallas Seavey who won six.

Butcher married fellow dog racer David Monson on September 2, 1985. They had two daughters, Tekla and Chisana.

She held the Iditarod speed record from 1986 until 1992, breaking her own records in 1987 and 1990. Her other speed records included the Norton Sound 250, Kobuk 220, Kuskokwim 300, and the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon. She retired from competition in 1995.

Her accomplishments gained her substantial media attention in the late 1980s and earned her many awards, including the &quot;National Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation Amateur Athlete of The Year Award&quot; and the &quot;Tanqueray Athlete of the Year.&quot; She also won the &quot;U.S. Victor Award&quot; for &quot;Female Athlete of the Year&quot; two years in a row. In 1988, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Philip Anschutz. In 2007, Butcher was inducted into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame as one of the five charter members in the inaugural class.

In episode 1 of season 28 of Antiques Roadshow, the 1990 trophy that Butcher won for her record breaking 4th Iditarod was valued at $50,000-100,000 dollars

==Illness and legacy==
On December 2, 2005, Butcher was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, which had manifested as a blood disorder three years earlier. She underwent chemotherapy at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and received a bone marrow transplant on May 17, 2006, after the cancer went into remission. According to her husband David Monson, &quot;someone said this might be a tough disease, but this leukemia hasn&#x27;t met Susan Butcher yet.&quot;

Butcher died on August 5, 2006, after fighting graft-versus-host disease and learning that the cancer had returned.

On March 1, 2008, Susan Butcher was honored by the State of Alaska when, just prior to the start of the 2008 Iditarod, Gov. Sarah Palin signed a bill establishing the first Saturday of every March as Susan Butcher Day. The day coincides with the traditional start of the Iditarod each year. Observing the special day, the bill noted, provides opportunity for people to &quot;remember the life of Susan Butcher, an inspiration to Alaskans and to millions around the world.&quot;

<text>Anaxagoras is a young lunar impact crater that is located near the north pole of the Moon. It lies across the larger and more heavily worn crater Goldschmidt. To the south-southeast is Epigenes, and due south is the worn remains of Birmingham.

Anaxagoras is a relatively recent impact crater that is young enough to still possess a ray system that has not been eroded by space weathering. The rays from the site reach a distance of over 900 kilometers from the rim, reaching Plato to the south. It is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The crater interior has a relatively high albedo, making it a prominent feature when the Moon is nearly full. (The high latitude of the crater means that the Sun always remains close to the horizon even at maximum elevation less than a day after Full Moon.) The interior walls are steep and possess a system of . The central peak is offset from the crater midpoint, and joins a low range across the crater floor. In fact, it appears that some of the central peak material has landed outside the crater rim.

<text>Transmetropolitan is a cyberpunk transhumanist comic book series written by Warren Ellis and drawn by Darick Robertson; it was published by the American company DC Comics in 1997–2002. The series was originally part of the short-lived DC Comics imprint Helix, but upon the end of the book&#x27;s first year the series was moved to the Vertigo imprint after DC Comics shut down their Helix imprint. &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; chronicles the battles of Spider Jerusalem, an infamous renegade gonzo journalist of the future.

Spider Jerusalem dedicates himself to fighting the corruption and abuse of power of two successive United States presidents. He and his &quot;filthy assistants&quot; strive to keep their world from turning more dystopian than it already is while dealing with the struggles of fame and power, brought about due to the popularity of Spider via his articles.

The monthly series began in July 1997 and concluded in September 2002. The series was later reprinted in an array of ten trade paperback volumes, and also featured two &quot;specials&quot; (&quot;I Hate It Here&quot; and &quot;Filth of the City&quot;) with text pieces written by Spider Jerusalem and illustrated by a wide range of comic artists. These were later collected in trade paperbacks.

== Story synopsis ==

Some time in the future (how long precisely is never specified, but said to be in the 23rd century) Spider Jerusalem, retired writer/journalist and bearded hermit, lives within an isolated, fortified mountain hideaway. Following a call from his irate publisher demanding the last two books per his publishing deal, Jerusalem is forced to descend into the City.

Jerusalem returns to work for his old partner and editor Mitchell Royce, who now edits &quot;The Word&quot;, the City&#x27;s largest newspaper. His first story is about an attempted secession by the Transient movement, people who use genetic body modification based on alien DNA to become a completely different species, and are forced to live in the Angels 8 slum district. The leader of the movement, Fred Christ, is paid to incite a riot and provoke the police, who use it as an excuse to clear out Angels 8. Jerusalem, however, publishes a story revealing the truth and brutal methods used by the police. Soon, Royce publishes it live all over the city, and the public outcry forces the police to withdraw. Jerusalem is brutally beaten by police on his way home, but defiantly says that he&#x27;s here to stay.

The first year of the series consists of a set of one-off stories exploring the City, Jerusalem&#x27;s background, and his often tense relationship with his sidekicks, Yelena Rossini and Channon Yarrow (referred to as his &#x27;filthy assistants&#x27;), who as the series progresses become full-time partners in his journalistic battles.

The main storyline of the series, the election and corrupt presidency of Gary Callahan (or &quot;The Smiler&quot;), begins in the series&#x27; second year and lasts for the rest of its run. Spider initially considers Callahan the lesser evil compared to the incumbent president (&quot;The Beast&quot;), but his investigation into Callahan&#x27;s past and ties with a right-wing hate group lead to Callahan having his own campaign manager, Vita Severn, a friend of Jerusalem&#x27;s, murdered. In a one-on-one meeting, Spider realizes that Callahan is not merely corrupt, but a complete lunatic who wants to be President solely to hurt people with his new power. To Jerusalem&#x27;s horror and disgust, the people vote Callahan into office by a wide margin.

Once elected, Callahan begins to use his presidential power to torment Jerusalem, the source of his trouble during the campaign. Jerusalem narrowly escapes a police massacre of people protesting how a recent hate crime was investigated. The police refused to release video of the incident, because it reveals several police officers watching the crime occur without interfering. Jerusalem writes a story revealing the truth about the crime and subsequent engineered massacre, but Callahan spikes it via &quot;D-Notices&quot;, government censorship of stories that could &quot;embarrass&quot; the country and the Callahan administration. After being informed of this, Jerusalem leaks the story via a straight-text news feedsite called &quot;The Hole&quot; and follows it up with an article exposing Callahan&#x27;s corrupt circle of advisers, one of whom is a pedophile. When Royce runs the story, Callahan forces the paper&#x27;s board of directors to fire Jerusalem, who makes an agreement to publish his future stories with &quot;The Hole&quot;. Callahan arranges for the City to be left defenseless from a hurricane-like &quot;near-near-near ruinstorm&quot; (an actual ruinstorm can skin anyone caught in it) that ravages the City and kills thousands, using the chaos to destroy the evidence Jerusalem has gathered against him, and places the city under martial law after the storm ends. Royce reveals that he had archived most of Jerusalem&#x27;s evidence and delivers it to him on disk, but during the storm Jerusalem collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable degenerative neurological illness with similar symptoms to Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, caused by constant exposure to the now-defunct informational substance known as I-Pollen. With about a year before dementia renders him dysfunctional and only a 1% chance of escaping this fate, Jerusalem increases his vendetta against Callahan, ultimately exposing his evil deeds and bringing the President down.

In the final issue&#x27;s epilogue, Jerusalem returns to his mountain home. Royce comes to visit, and the assistants show him around the house while explaining that Jerusalem&#x27;s disease is progressing. It is revealed that Channon has a book deal, and Yelena is taking a journalistic role similar to Jerusalem&#x27;s; Channon and Royce note that Yelena is his spiritual successor, displaying his trademark rage and passion as well as his talent. In the garden, Jerusalem tells Royce that the disease is so advanced that he cannot light his own cigarettes, and he forgets one day out of seven. When Royce leaves, Jerusalem pulls out a package of cigarettes and what appears to be a handgun. He appears to be placing the barrel under his chin, until it is revealed in the next panel that it is a lighter. He lights the cigarette and then spins the lighter on his finger, suggesting that he was in fact one of the 1% of patients who recover from the disease, and is now merely faking his illness so that he may enjoy his retirement in peace.

== Publishing ==
The series was originally published under DC Comics&#x27;s then-new science fiction Helix imprint. When the Helix line was discontinued, &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; was the only series of the line that had not been canceled, and was switched to the Vertigo imprint starting with issue #13. The entire set of trade paperbacks are now published under the Black Label line.

In June 2015, Vertigo began releasing &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; in the premium hardcover Absolute Edition format. The first volume included issues #1–18. The second volume, published in May 2016, included issues #19–36. The third volume was published November 2018.

=== Film adaptation ===
Co-creators Ellis and Robertson were approached about making a &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; film adaptation, with Patrick Stewart&#x27;s production company Flying Freehold Productions offering to option the rights in February 2003. Later, the burgeoning Internet boom led to an offer to create an online animated film series, with Stewart providing the voice of Spider Jerusalem, but the project never fully developed. Ellis and Robertson have been rumored to have indicated that they would like to see Tim Roth play Jerusalem, but during a panel at London&#x27;s Kapow! comic convention Ellis said that there is no chance of seeing Spider Jerusalem in a film adaptation, and Tim Roth was not discussed to play him, and explained that production costs would be too high to bring &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; to the big screen. In 2010, Ellis noted in his Twitter account that no production was underway.

Some items of &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; merchandise have been made, Robertson himself having produced one T-shirt: a black shirt with a three-eyed smiley face on the front and the text &quot;I Hate It Here&quot; in yellow on the back. DC Direct has produced five products. One is a black T-shirt with an image of Spider Jerusalem from the comic with the text &quot;Spider Jerusalem. Cheap. But not as cheap as your girlfriend&quot;. Early in the series they produced an action figure of Jerusalem wearing nothing but his trademark boxer shorts so as to show off his tattoos, and a variant that is giving the finger and holding a bowel disruptor. The third is a statuette of Jerusalem, in the same state of near-nudity, sitting on the toilet growling into his cell phone and arguing with his editor Mitchell Royce, who is visible on his small laptop computer on the base. The fourth is a wristwatch with the three-eyed Transient smiley as the watch&#x27;s face; and the fifth is a replica of Spider&#x27;s trademark glasses.

<text>USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was laid down on 25 January 1943 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 6 February 1944, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, who also sponsored the previous ), and commissioned on 3 December 1944, Captain B. H. Colyear in command.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==

===Construction and World War II===
&quot;Atlanta&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey, on 25 January 1943. She was launched 6 February 1944, and at the launching ceremony, she was christened by Margaret Mitchell, the author of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The ship was commissioned on 3 December that year with the hull number CL-104. &quot;Atlanta&quot; embarked on a shakedown cruise on 5 January 1945 in Chesapeake Bay and later south to the Caribbean Sea. She concluded her initial training cruise at Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 February. She then sailed north to Philadelphia for maintenance before departing on 27 March to join the US fleet in the Pacific. &quot;Atlanta&quot; passed through Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, while en route, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived in Pearl Harbor on 18 April. She carried out training exercises in the area through 1 May, before departing on 12 May to join Task Force 58 at Ulithi.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; served in the defensive screen for the task force&#x27;s aircraft carriers, which operated off Okinawa from 22 to 27 May; the carriers repeatedly struck Japanese positions in the area to prepare for the imminent invasion of Okinawa. While cruising at sea on 5 June, the fleet was struck by a major typhoon that damaged most of the ships, including &quot;Atlanta&quot;. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was detached on 13 June and sent to San Pedro Bay in the Philippines for periodic maintenance. She arrived there the following day, and the work lasted through the end of the month. She got underway on 1 July to rejoin the task force, which had by that time passed to 3rd Fleet and had been re-numbered as Task Force 38. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was assigned to the subordinate unit, Task Group 38.1, once again serving in the screen for the carriers. At that time, the unit consisted five carriers, three fast battleships, four other cruisers, and several destroyers. The carriers conducted a series of strikes on the Japanese Home Islands over the following weeks, and &quot;Atlanta&quot; took part in several shore bombardments during this period.

On 18 July, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was temporarily transferred to Task Group 35.4, along with the cruisers , , and and eight destroyers. The unit carried out a sweep for Japanese coastal shipping that night, but failed to locate any significant targets. By mid-August, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was patrolling off the coast of Honshū when Japan announced on the 15th that it would surrender. &quot;Atlanta&quot; entered Sagami Bay on 27 August with the rest of TF 38 to begin preparations for the formal surrender of Japan, which took place aboard the battleship on 2 September. &quot;Atlanta&quot; moved to Tokyo Bay on 16 September during the initial occupation of Japan. On 30 September, she departed to return to the United States with more than 500 passengers. The ship passed through Guam on the way to Seattle, Washington, arriving there on 24 October. From there, she steamed south to Terminal Island, California, for extensive maintenance. The ship earned two battle stars during her short wartime career.

===Post-War===
On 3 January 1946, &quot;Atlanta&quot; departed California, bound for Sasebo, Japan. Over the following six months, she toured the Far East, visiting a number of ports including Manila, Philippines; Qingdao and Shanghai, China; Okinawa, Nagasaki, Kagoshima, and Yokosuka, Japan; and Saipan in the Mariana Islands. The ship returned to the San Pedro, California, on 27 June by way of Guam. She was moved to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard two days later for an overhaul. She got underway again on 8 October to conduct sea trials out of San Diego, California. &quot;Atlanta&quot; operated off California into February 1947, until she departed on the 23rd to take part in training exercises held off Hawaii. She thereafter joined Task Force 38 to visit Australia, departing Pearl Harbor on 1 May. The ships had a lengthy stay in Sydney, Australia, before departing on 27 May to return home. They stopped at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Guam on the way back to San Pedro, which they reached on 28 July.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; participated in a series of exercises held off California over the following weeks. On 28 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor in preparation for another tour of East Asia. The ship visited Yokosuka and Qingdao again, and also made stops in Keelung, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. She departed the Far East on 27 April 1948, stopping in Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands and Pearl Harbor on the way back to San Diego, arriving on 19 May. &quot;Atlanta&quot; thereafter resumed training maneuvers off San Diego, which included a cruise north to Juneau, Alaska, which lasted from 29 June to 6 July. Six days later, she stopped in Seattle for a lengthy overhaul. On 20 November, she departed for San Diego for another round of exercises. The ship embarked a contingent of naval reservists in early February 1949 for short training cruises between San Diego and San Francisco. On 1 March, the ship moved to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard to be readied for transfer to the reserve fleet. The ship was decommissioned on 1 July and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1962.

The Navy decided to use &quot;Atlanta&quot; as a weapons testing ship, rather than simply break her up. She was moved to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to be extensively rebuilt. Her upper deck and existing superstructure were removed and several experimental structures were installed; these were intended to be fitted to the next generation of guided-missile destroyers and frigates. &quot;Atlanta&quot; would be used to test the resistance of these structures to explosions of various types. She was reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register on 15 May 1964 with the hull number IX-304. The ship was subjected to three tests in early 1965, designated Operation Sailor Hat, which damaged the ship but did not sink her. She was subsequently laid up in Stockton, California in late 1965 and remained there for the next five years. She was struck from the register again on 1 April 1970 and expended as a target ship off San Clemente Island on 1 October.

<text>Harborough () is a local government district in Leicestershire, England. It is named after its main town, Market Harborough, which is where the council is based. The district also includes the town of Lutterworth and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. In the north of the district it includes parts of the Leicester Urban Area, notably at Thurnby, Bushby and Scraptoft. Covering , the district is the largest by area of the eight districts in Leicestershire and covers almost a quarter of the county.

The neighbouring districts are Blaby, Oadby and Wigston, Leicester, Charnwood, Melton, Rutland, North Northamptonshire, West Northamptonshire and Rugby.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Billesdon Rural District
*Lutterworth Rural District
*Market Harborough Rural District
*Market Harborough Urban District

The new council was named Harborough, after its largest town of Market Harborough.

==Governance==
Harborough District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Greens, led by Liberal Democrat councillor Phil Knowles.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2000 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 34 councillors, representing 19 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
Harborough District Council is based at the Symington Building, located in the centre of Market Harborough. The building was originally a corset factory, built in 1884. The council purchased the building in 1980 and converted it to become its offices and meeting place, as well as providing a new library for the town. The building is also shared with Harborough Museum, the register office and Job Centre Plus.

==Geography==

Situated in the south of East Midlands but linking to Northamptonshire and the South East Region, and between the West Midland and East of England Region with access to three national transport routes - the M1 motorway the Midland Main Line railway and the A14 East West national trunk road, the district has always occupied an important strategic position.

The landscape of the district comprises both pastoral and upland characters. Generally the A6 Market Harborough to Leicester Road forms the boundary between each. The lower pastoral landscape of South Leicestershire is found to the west of the A6 whilst the more undulating upland landscape of High Leicestershire is found to the east.

South Leicestershire consists of gentler country around Lutterworth and Kibworth. Low hills swell out of shallow valleys and villages are pinpointed by church spires peeping above dark spinneys. Near Foxton and Gumley the Laughton Hills tumble down to the Grand Union Canal and Welland Valley, forming one of the best landscapes in this part of the district.

High Leicestershire consists of the tract of land between Market Harborough, Tilton On The Hill and towards Melton Mowbray and forms some of the loneliest countryside in the Midlands. Many villages were deserted centuries ago and remote hills such as Robin-a-Tiptoe in the parish of Tilton peer out over pastures and the occasional farmhouse.

The infant River Avon and River Welland form the southern border of the district with Northamptonshire with sources at Naseby and Sibbertoft respectively.

Brampton Valley Way, the former Northampton to Market Harborough Railway, is now a car free &#x27;linear&#x27; park. It provides a 14 mile long walking, cycling and, in parts, horse riding route.

==Demography==

Despite Harborough District being the largest in Leicestershire by area it is primarily rural in nature and its population density is relatively low. Population growth for the district is nonetheless healthy and is set out below:

The principal centres of population (from 2011 Census) are Market Harborough (21,894), Lutterworth (9,353) and Broughton Astley (8,940) to the south of the district and county. There are four large villages of over 3,000 population - Kibworth (5,455); Fleckney (4,894); Great Glen (3,662) and Thurnby and Bushby (3,301) - these evidence the transition from the relatively densely populated Leicester Urban Area into the countryside/farmland of rural Harborough. Other villages include Scraptoft (1,804), Houghton on the Hill (1,524), Husbands Bosworth (1,145), Great Bowden (1,017), Gilmorton (976), Ullesthorpe (903) and Billesdon (901). The District has 17 parishes with populations between 500 and 3,000, 40 parishes with populations between 100 and 500 and 28 parishes with populations of below 100 (mid-2004 population estimates).

==Built heritage==
Stanford Hall, Leicestershire is located in the south west of the district. The village of Stanford-on-Avon is in Northamptonshire but the house and park are on the Leicestershire bank of the River Avon

The Grand Union Canal (old) cuts across the district from Husbands Bosworth to Newton Harcourt with a spur to Market Harborough which leaves the Canal at Foxton.

Hallaton Treasure: More than 5,000 silver and gold coins, around 2,000 years old, were found at a site near Hallaton around 2002. The internationally important finds are exhibited at Harborough Museum.

The Eyebrook Reservoir straddles along the Harborough District&#x27;s border with the county of Rutland. The reservoir serves as a popular trout fishing area and bird watching area, with nearby Eye Brook Valley Woods as a beautiful and natural small forest area for walking. The Reservoir and woods are cared for by the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust and are SSSIs.

==Social and sporting==
The Harborough District has a long association with fox hunting and is the base for the Fernie Hunt. Although hunting wild animals with dogs has stopped following the Hunting Act 2004, the Fernie Hunt continues to operate under the three principal exemptions to the Act - trail hunting, hound exercise and flushing coverts to a bird of prey. A historical account of fox hunting in the Harborough District (when the hunt was known as Mr Fernie&#x27;s Billesdon Hunt) is available in the book &quot;Annals of the Billesdon hunt (Mr. Fernie&#x27;s) 1856-1913 : notable runs and incidents of the chase, prominent members, celebrated hunters and hounds, amusing stories and anecdotes&quot; by F. Palliser de Costobadie. Also see an earlier guide to the fox hunting country north of Market Harborough published in 1882.

==Community organisations==
The Harborough Youth Council was set up in 2007 to represent the views of young people (aged 13–19) and aims to improve life for young people. It holds a District Youth Conference each year where young people give their views in front of district councillors. The HYC meets usually once per month, and sends representatives to CYCLe (County Youth Council Leicestershire).

The Harborough District Sport and Activity Alliance aims to make sport and physical activity accessible for all people throughout the Harborough District enabling them to fulfil their potential through sport and physical activity.

==Civil parishes==
Most of the district is covered by civil parishes. The pre-1974 urban district of Market Harborough is an unparished area. The parish council for Lutterworth has declared that parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Many of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<doc id="437824" wikidata="Q2452755" url="?curid=437824" title="Marshal of the Royal Air Force">
<text>Marshal of the Royal Air Force (MRAF) is the highest rank in the UK&#x27;s Royal Air Force (RAF). In peacetime it was granted to RAF officers in the appointment of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), and to retired Chiefs of the Air Staff (CAS), who were promoted to it on their last day of service. While surviving Marshals of the RAF retain the rank for life, the highest rank to which officers on active service are promoted is now air chief marshal. Although general promotions to Marshal of the Royal Air Force have been discontinued since the British defence cuts of the 1990s, further promotions to the rank may still be made in wartime, for members of the Royal Family and certain very senior RAF air officers in peacetime at the discretion of the monarch; all such promotions in peacetime are only honorary, however. In 2012, the then Prince of Wales was promoted to the rank in recognition of his support for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in her capacity as head of the armed forces (commander-in-chief), while in 2014 Lord Stirrup, who had served as Chief of the Air Staff and Chief of the Defence Staff for over seven years, was also promoted.
Marshal of the Royal Air Force is a five-star rank. MRAF has a NATO ranking code of OF-10, equivalent to an admiral of the fleet in the Royal Navy or a field marshal in the British Army.

The rank was instituted in 1919 and the first officer to be promoted to MRAF was Sir Hugh Trenchard in 1927. Since that time, including Trenchard, there have been 27 men who have held the rank. Of those, 22 have been professional RAF officers and five have been senior members of the British Royal Family. King George V did not formally hold the rank of marshal of the RAF; rather he assumed the title of Chief of the Royal Air Force. In this capacity from time to time he wore RAF uniform with the rank insignia of a marshal of the RAF. He first publicly wore such uniform in 1935, the year before his death.

Excluding monarchs and other members of the Royal Family, the only two RAF officers ever to have held the rank without serving as Chief of the Air Staff were Lord Douglas of Kirtleside and Sir Arthur Harris. Both held high command during the Second World War. Harris was Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Bomber Command and Douglas was Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Fighter Command, Middle East Command and Coastal Command.

==Origins==
Prior to the creation of the RAF&#x27;s officer rank titles in 1919, it was proposed that by analogy with field marshal, the highest rank title should be air marshal. It was later decided to use the rank of air marshal as an equivalent rank to lieutenant general and &quot;marshal of the air&quot; was put forward as the highest RAF rank. This new rank title was opposed by the then Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir Henry Wilson, who considered that the title was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. However, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard was unmoved and the title was adopted. Though never held by a Royal Air Force officer, the rank title of marshal of the air lasted until April 1925, when it was changed to marshal of the Royal Air Force. Questioned in the House of Commons, Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare stated that the reason for the change in title was that marshal of the air was &quot;somewhat indefinite in character&quot; and the new title was deemed more appropriate. It has also been reported that King George V was not happy with the title of marshal of the air, feeling it might imply attributes which should properly be reserved for God.

==Insignia, command flag and star plate==
The rank insignia consists of four narrow light blue bands (each on a slightly wider black band) above a light blue band on a broad black band. This insignia is derived from the sleeve lace of an admiral of the fleet and is worn on both the lower sleeves of the tunic or on the shoulders of the flying suit or the service working dress uniform. Marshals of the Royal Air Force wear shoulder boards with their service dress at ceremonial events. These shoulder boards show the air officer&#x27;s eagle surrounded by a wreath, two crossed marshal&#x27;s batons and, since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the St Edward&#x27;s Crown representing royal authority. Prior to 1953, the Tudor Crown (sometimes called the King&#x27;s Crown) was used.

The command flag of a marshal of the Royal Air Force has a broad red horizontal band in the centre with a thinner red band on each side of it.

The vehicle star plate for a marshal of the Royal Air Force depicts five white stars (marshal of the Royal Air Force is equivalent to a five-star rank) on an air force blue background.

The rank insignia and flag exists in some other air forces for equivalent ranks. The rank title differs slightly, often being a variation on marshal of the air force, usually with the name of the relevant air force in place of the words &#x27;Royal Air Force&#x27;. A notable example of this practice is the rank of marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force.

== Marshals of the Royal Air Force ==


Unlike other MRAFs who only relinquished their appointments, Sir Peter Harding resigned from the RAF in 1994. Consequently, his name was removed from the Air Force List, but it was later reinstated.

<doc id="437827" wikidata="Q315640" url="?curid=437827" title="Francis of Paola">
<text>Francis of Paola, O.M. (also known as Francis the Fire Handler; 27 March 1416 – 2 April 1507), was a Roman Catholic friar from the town of Paola in Calabria who founded the Order of Minims. Like his patron saint (Francis of Assisi), but unlike the majority of founders of men&#x27;s religious orders, Francis of Paola was never ordained a priest.

== Biography ==
Around 1416, Francis was born in the town of Paola in the southern Italian province of Cosenza, Calabria. Paola was a small town near the Tyrrhenian Sea, midway from Naples to Reggio. His parents were very poor but worked hard. They were pious: God&#x27;s love and doing His will was their single-minded desire, and all they strove for. They had lived together several years without a child. It is said that they earnestly beseeched God, through the intercession of St Francis of Assisi, for a son. They vowed to direct him to God&#x27;s service, so that in due course he might serve Him and become an instrument to glorify His name. A while later a son was born. The parents saw this as prayer answered and named him after St Francis. Two other children were eventually born to them. When still in the cradle, Francis suffered from a swelling which endangered the sight of one of his eyes. His parents again had recourse to St Francis of Assisi. They made a vow that their son should pass an entire year wearing the &quot;little habit&quot; of St Francis in one of the friaries of his Order, a common practice in the Middle Ages. The child subsequently recovered. His parents seem to have made every effort to inspire Francis with pious sentiments, and to provide for him a suitable religious education. As a child, Francis duly showed a prefence for abstinence, solitude and prayer.

In his thirteenth year, Francis was placed in the convent of Franciscan friars at San Marco Argentano, 42 km from his home. One of the oldest Franciscan buildings in Calabria, the Conventual Complex of the Friars Minor at San Marco Argentano is thought to have been founded around 1284 by Pietro Cathin, a disciple and companion of St Francis of Assisi.

At the convent, Francis learned to read. It is said that from that time, he abstained from wearing linen or eating meat. Albeit not yet professed in the Order, he was apparently already outdoing the friars themselves in his scrupulously observing the Rule. After a year at the convent, he went with his parents on a pilgrimage to the Portiuncula at Assisi, and thence to Rome.

On arriving back home, he opted to withdraw, with his parents&#x27; consent, to live in solitude about half a mile from the town. To avoid being distracted by visits, he moved shortly thereafter to a more remote retreat in a rock corner on the coast, where he made himself a cave. Here he remained alone for about six years, devoting himself to prayer and self-mortification. When he shut himself up in this hermitage, in 1432, Francis was barely age fifteen. He had no bed other than the rock itself, nor any food other than herbs gathered in a nearby wood, or what sometimes arrived with a visit from a friend.

==Confraternity==

Francis was twenty when he was joined by two other devoutly inclined persons, who joined him in his holy exercises. To accommodate them Francis caused three cells and a chapel to be built by people of the vicinity. The three sang the divine praises every day in the chapel, where Mass used to be celebrated by a priest coming up from the parish church.

1436 marked the beginning of the religious order Francis was to found: the Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi. Within seventeen years their numbers had grown. By the end of 1454, sanctioned by Pyrrhus (Petrus) Caracciolo, Archbishop of Cosenza, Francis built a large monastery and church. This project triggered an outburst of enthusiasm and devotion toward Francis from the people in the countryside around; even members of the local nobility carried stones and joined in. People&#x27;s devotion deepened on hearing of miracles, in answer to prayer, attributed to Francis&#x27; intercession. One example was highlighted when someone, on oath, contributed to the subsequent canonisation process: through Francis&#x27; intercession, he was prepared to swear, a painful lame thigh had instantly healed.

As the life of Francis personified, humility was to become the most distinguishing hallmark of the religious brethren. Extraordinary severity characterised the self-denial in the rule of life adopted by Francis and his confrères. In his view, heroic self-mortification was a necessary means to spiritual growth. He and his companions were to seek to live unknown and hidden from the world. Freely undertaken were the Evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience, traditional among mendicant Catholic religious orders since the days of St Francis of Assisi, more than two centuries earlier. To this, Francis of Paola added a &quot;fourth vow&quot;: by the 15th century, there had been a decline in the custom of fasting during Lent. Reviving this observance, Francis hoped, might follow his imposing on himself and his companions an unbroken, year-round abstinence from meat and other animal products.

The community was still composed entirely of laymen, with only a few who could read or write. To inspect the confraternity at Paola, Pope Paul II sent an emissary in 1467. This was a priest and jurist, Baltasar de Spigno (known also as Baldassarre de Gutrossis, or Balthasar de Spino). At first Francis was reproached for undue austerity, its being supposedly rustic and not for the educated or well-bred. However, Baltasar appears to have been won over; Francis&#x27; general approach was accepted within the year. So that they could obtain essentials, and preserve their buildings, papal indulgences were forthcoming.

In 1470 Baltasar joined the brethren. For them to be officially approved, he approached Archbishop Caracciolo. This request was welcomed, and on 30 November 1470 Caracciolo promulgated &quot;Decet nos&quot;, wherein authority over Francis&#x27; confraternity was renounced by the archbishop and placed directly with the Holy See. So as to be recognised by Rome, the confraternity was helped by Baltasar&#x27;s advocacy in front of the pope. In the bull &quot;Sedes apostolica&quot; (17 May 1474) Pope Sixtus IV recognised the Congregation of Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi in the Territory of Padua, in which the members chose to live in a permanent Lenten manner. The document granted them the same rights as the mendicant friars and Francis was named their superior general. The document empowered them to write a rule for their community and to assume the title of Hermits of San Francisco.

==Minims==
This rule was formally approved by Pope Alexander VI, who, however, changed its title to Minims, the Order to be the Minim friars, i.e. the &quot;least of all the faithful&quot;.

Francis was invited to found new communities in Calabria. In 1472 he acquired some land for the construction of a monastery in Paterno Cálabro. He then founded the monasteries of Spezzano della Sila (1474), Corigliano Calabro (1476) and Crotona, the latter being in charge of Brother Paolo Rendacio. In March 1464 Francis left Paterno Calabro for Milazzo, on the island of Sicily, to found another monastery. In April of that year the miracle of the Strait of Messina occurred: the religious man, with two of his disciples, wanted to take a boat to cross the strait but the boatman rejected him because he had no money, so he put his cloak on the sea and The three crossed the strait on it. For this reason, Pius XII named him patron of the seafarers of Italy on March 27, 1943.[9]

Francis also preached about conversion. He told a person whose paralyzed hand had been cured, &quot;Go, sweep your house, that is, your conscience, and be a good Christian.&quot;[12] He once cured a man with a paralyzed arm with some herbs.

There was only one priest, Balthasar de Spino, doctor of Laws, and who was later appointed confessor to Innocent VIII. Francis founded another religious house at Paterno, on the Gulf of Taranto. There was a third house founded at Spezzano in 1474. Further foundations were at Corigliano and what was, in those days, called Cotrone.

In 1474 Pope Sixtus IV gave Francis permission to write a rule for his community, and to adopt the title of Hermits of St Francis. This rule was formally approved by Pope Alexander VI, who changed their name to &quot;Minims&quot;. His religious order having been sanctioned, Francis founded several new monasteries in Calabria and Sicily. He also established convents of nuns, and, following St Francis of Assisi&#x27;s lead, a third order for persons wishing to follow his rule but not living apart from the world.

Francis did not defer to a person&#x27;s worldly rank or position. He rebuked the King of Naples for his ill-doing; as a result he suffered persecution.

== France ==
When King Louis XI of France was terminally ill, he sent an embassy to Calabria to beg Francis to visit him. Francis refused, until the pope finally ordered him to go. Embarking at Ostia, he landed in France. Attributed to his intercession as he passed through Provence was the cure of many people sick from the plague afflicting the region at this time. Francis travelled to the king&#x27;s residence, the Château de Plessis-lez-Tours (now within the village of La Riche), and was with him as he died. He became a tutor of the heir, Charles VIII, who retained him at court and frequently consulted him.

Charles VIII built a monastery for the Minims near the chateau at Plessis and another at Rome on the Pincian Hill. Francis influenced many in the French church, particularly Jan Standonck, who founded the Collège de Montaigu along what he thought were Minimist lines.

The regard in which Charles VIII held Francis was shared by Louis XII when he ascended to the throne in 1498. The kings of France all insisted he remain in their country. Francis was, however, now eager to return to Italy. King Louis XII was loath to lose his counsels and direction. Francis never left France, spending his last three months in complete solitude, preparing for death. On Holy Thursday of 1507 he gathered his community around him and exhorted them especially to have mutual charity amongst themselves. He urged them not to relax the rigour of their life, in particular perpetual abstinence from meat and other animal products. The next day, Good Friday, he again assembled them all, gave them his last instructions and appointed a Vicar General. He died at Plessis on 2 April 1507 at the age of ninety-one.

== Diet ==

Francis followed a diet not only free from animal flesh, but also from all animal-derived foods, such as eggs and dairy products. Francis has been described as a vegan.

From its founding, this order became known for two major charisms: humility and non-violence. &quot;Minim&quot; implies living as the smallest or least, or embracing humility, simplicity and frugality. Expressed through avoiding harm to any creature is the call to non-violence and repudiation of cruelty.

== Gift of prophecy ==

It was believed that Francis had the gift of prophecy. The taking of Constantinople by the Turks was apparently foretold by him, not only to several persons but also on more than one occasion: 1447, 1448 and 1449. On 29 May 1453 the city was conquered under the command of Mehmed II. Constantine Palaeologus, the last Christian emperor, was killed in battle.

Theodoor van Thulden painted a mystic episode that was said to have occurred over a century earlier. It depicts Francis of Paola, who was revered in France because he visited the country in 1482, at the bedside of Louise of Savoy to announce that she will give birth to the next king of France, the future Francis I. In 1515, King Louis XII died without a male heir and the throne went to Francis I, of the royal family&#x27;s Valois-Angoulême branch. Louise of Savoy and her spouse, the Count of Angoulême, who is almost certainly the figure depicted to the left of the bed, decided to name the child Francis in honor of the saint.

== Legends ==

According to a famous story, in the year 1464, he was refused passage by a boatman while trying to cross the Strait of Messina to Sicily. He reportedly laid his cloak on the water, tied one end to his staff as a sail, and sailed across the strait with his companions following in the boat. The second of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Legendes&quot; (for solo piano) describes this story in music.

After his nephew died, the boy&#x27;s mother—Francis&#x27; own sister—appealed to Francis for comfort, and filled his apartment with lamentations. After the Mass and divine office had been said for the repose of his soul, Francis ordered the corpse to be carried from the church into his cell, where he continued praying until, to her great astonishment, the boy&#x27;s life was restored and Francis presented him to his mother in perfect health. The young man entered his order and is the celebrated Nicholas Alesso who afterwards followed his uncle into France, and was famous for sanctity and many great actions.

There are several stories about his compassion for animals, and how he gave back life to animals that were killed to be eaten. For example, a biographer writes:
&quot;Francis had a favorite trout that he called &#x27;Antonella&#x27;. One day, one of the priests, who provided religious services, saw the trout swimming about in his pool. To him it was just a delicious dish, so he caught it and took it home, tossing it into the frying pan. Francis missed &#x27;Antonella&#x27; and realized what had happened. He asked one of his followers to go to the priest to get it back. The priest, annoyed by this great concern for a mere fish, threw the cooked trout on the ground, shattering it into several pieces. The hermit sent by Francis gathered up the broken pieces in his hands and brought them back to Francis. Francis placed the pieces back in the pool and, looking up to Heaven and praying, said: &#x27;Antonella, in the name of Charity, return to life.&#x27; The trout immediately became whole and swam joyously around his pool as if nothing had happened. The friars and the workers who witnessed this miracle were deeply impressed by the miracle.&quot;

Francis also raised his pet lamb from the dead after it had been killed and eaten by workmen. Being in need of food, the workmen caught and slaughtered Francis&#x27; pet lamb, Martinello, roasting it in their lime kiln. They were eating when Francis approached them, looking for the lamb. They told him they had eaten it, having no other food. He asked what they had done with the fleece and the bones. They told him they had thrown them into the furnace. Francis walked over to the furnace, looked into the fire and called &quot;Martinello, come out!&quot; The lamb jumped out, completely untouched, bleating happily on seeing his master.

Francis of Paola called the animals by their names even after their lives had ended. He apparently believed they continued to exist after their deaths.

== Legacy and veneration ==

Pope Leo X canonized him in 1519. He is considered to be a patron saint of boatmen, mariners, and naval officers. His liturgical feast day is celebrated by the Roman Catholic Church on April 2, the day on which he died. In 1963, Pope John XXIII designated him as the patron saint of Calabria. Though his miracles were numerous, he was canonized for his humility and discernment in blending the contemplative life with the active one.

The Order of Minims does not seem at any time to have been very extensive, but they had houses in many countries. The definitive rule was approved in 1506 by Pope Julius II, who also approved a rule for the nuns of the Order. A Third Order of their movement was also approved. The most noted member of this Order was the illustrious French bishop, Francis de Sales. Although the Minim order lost many of its monasteries in the 18th century during the French Revolution, it continues to exist, primarily in Italy.

In 1562, a group of Protestant Huguenots in France broke open his tomb and found Francis&#x27; body incorrupt. They dragged it forth, burned it and scattered the bones, which were recovered by Catholic faithful and distributed as relics to various churches of his order.

A walk, &quot;The Way of the Young Man&quot; has been devised between San Marco Argentano and Paola. Another one, &quot;The hermit&#x27;s way&quot;, starts at the Sanctuary of St Francis of Paola in Paterno Calabro and ends at Paola.

<doc id="437829" wikidata="Q1677915" url="?curid=437829" title="St. Johns River">
<text>The St. Johns River () is the longest river in the U.S. state of Florida and is the most significant one for commercial and recreational use. At long, it flows north and winds through or borders 12 counties. The drop in elevation from headwaters to mouth is less than ; like most Florida waterways, the St. Johns has a very slow flow speed of , and is often described as &quot;lazy&quot;.

Numerous lakes are formed by the river or flow into it, but as a river its widest point is nearly across. The narrowest point is in the headwaters, an unnavigable marsh in Indian River County. The St. Johns drainage basin of includes some of Florida&#x27;s major wetlands. It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for Lake George and the Ocklawaha River, all managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District.

Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, much of Florida remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. With the growth of population, the St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers, suffering severe pollution and redirection that has diminished its ecosystem. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America&#x27;s Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are underway for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida&#x27;s population continues to increase.

Historically, a variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, Mayaca, Ais, French, Spanish, and British colonists, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees. It has been the subject of William Bartram&#x27;s journals, Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s letters home, and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings&#x27; books. In the year 2000, 3.5 million people lived within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River.

== Geography ==
Starting in Brevard County and meeting the Atlantic Ocean at Duval County, the St. Johns is Florida&#x27;s primary commercial and recreational waterway. It flows north from its headwaters, originating in the direction of the Lake Wales Ridge, which is only slightly elevated at above sea level. Because of this low elevation drop, the river has a long backwater. It ebbs and flows with tides that pass through the barrier islands and up the channel. Uniquely, it shares the same regional terrain as the parallel Kissimmee River, although the Kissimmee flows south.

=== Upper basin ===
The river is separated into three basins and two associated watersheds managed by the St. Johns River Water Management District. Because the river flows in a northerly direction, the upper basin is located in the headwaters at its southernmost point. The river begins as a network of marshes in Indian River County, at a point west of Vero Beach aptly named the St. Johns Marsh. It is a blackwater stream, meaning that it is fed primarily by swamps and marshes lying beneath it; water seeps through the sandy soil and collects in a slight valley. The upper basin measures approximately ; the St. Johns transforms into a navigable waterway in Brevard County. The river touches on the borders of Osceola and Orange Counties and flows through the southeast tip of Seminole County, transitioning into its middle basin a dozen miles (19 km) or so north of Titusville.

The upper basin was significantly lowered in the 1920s with the establishment of the Melbourne Tillman drainage project. This drained the headwaters eastward to the Indian River through canals dug across the Ten-Mile Ridge near Palm Bay. In 2016 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a restoration project, returning natural flow to much of the area.

The river is at its narrowest and most unpredictable in this basin. Channel flows are not apparent and are usually unmarked. The most efficient way to travel on this part of the river is by airboat. Approximately 3,500 lakes lie within the watershed; all are shallow, with maximum depths between . The river flows into many of the lakes which further confuses navigation. Eight larger lakes and five smaller ones lie in the upper basin; one of the first is named Lake Hell &#x27;n Blazes (sometimes polished to read as Lake Helen or Hellen Blazes), referencing oaths yelled by boatmen and fishermen in the early 19th century, frustrated when trying to navigate through floating islands of macrophytes, or muck and weeds, as the islands changed location with the creeping flow. Lakes Washington, Winder, and Poinsett are located further along this stretch of the river. The northernmost points of the upper basin contain the Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area, created in 1977 to assist with filtration of waters flowing downstream.

=== Middle basin ===
For the river passes through a basin fed primarily by springs and stormwater runoff. This basin, spreading throughout Orange, Lake, Volusia, and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater Orlando metropolitan area, where two million people live and major tourist attractions are located. The topography varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: Lake Harney and Lake Monroe. The shallow Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow Puzzle Lake; immediately north is the Econlockhatchee River, which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns to where navigation becomes easier for larger boats. The river veers west, touching on Lake Jesup before it empties into Lake Monroe near Sanford. It is at this point that the St. Johns&#x27; navigable waterway begins, which is dredged and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with channel markers maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. Lake Monroe, a large lake at with an average depth of , drains a surrounding watershed of .

Optimally an deep channel about wide after leaving Lake Monroe, the St. Johns meets its most significant tributary in the middle basin, the spring-fed Wekiva River, discharging approximately per day into the St. Johns.

=== Lake George ===
The river turns north again as it rolls through a basin spreading across Putnam, Lake, and Marion Counties, and the western part of Volusia County. Slightly north of the Wekiva River is Blue Spring State Park which contains the largest spring on the St. Johns, producing over per day. Bordering to the north of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, accessible only by boat.

The St. Johns creeps into the southern tip of Lake George, the second largest lake in Florida at , wide and long. The watershed surrounding Lake George expands through , lying within Ocala National Forest and Lake George State Forest, that protect an ecosystem dominated by pine and scrub more than and in size, respectively.

=== Ocklawaha River ===
The Ocklawaha River flows north and joins the St. Johns as the largest tributary, and one of significant historical importance. The Ocklawaha (also printed as Oklawaha) drainage basin expands through Orange, Lake, Marion, and Alachua Counties, comprising a total of . Ocala, Gainesville, and the northern suburbs of the Orlando metropolitan area are included in this basin. There are two headwaters for the Ocklawaha: a chain of lakes, the largest of which is Lake Apopka in Lake County, and the Green Swamp near Haines City in Polk County, drained by the Palatlakaha River. The Silver River, fed by one of Florida&#x27;s most productive springs expelling daily, is located about midway along the Ocklawaha.

=== Lower basin ===
From the intersection of the Ocklawaha River, to the Atlantic Ocean, the lower basin drains a total area of in Putnam, St. Johns, Clay, and Duval Counties. Twelve tributaries empty into the river in the lower basin. The river widens considerably on the north end of Lake George; between Lake George and Palatka the river ranges between wide. Between Palatka and Jacksonville it widens further to between . This portion of the river is the most navigable, and shipping is its primary use. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains shipping channels at least deep and wide. North of Jacksonville, the channels are expanded to deep and between wide.

The towns and cities along the lower basin of the river are some of the oldest in Florida, and their histories have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then Interstate highways were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.

The final of the river&#x27;s course runs through Jacksonville with a population of more than one million. Much of the economic base of Jacksonville depends on the river: of goods are shipped in and out of Jacksonville annually. Exports include paper, phosphate, fertilizers, and citrus, while major imports include oil, coffee, limestone, cars, and lumber. The Port of Jacksonville produces $1.38 billion in the local economy and supports 10,000 jobs. The U.S. Navy has two bases in the Jacksonville area: Naval Station Mayport, at the mouth of the river, serves as the second largest Atlantic Fleet operation and home port in the country. Naval Air Station Jacksonville is one of the service&#x27;s largest air installations, home to two air wings and over 150 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and the host for one of only two full-fledged Naval Hospitals remaining in Florida.

Using an unofficial nickname of &quot;The River City&quot;, Jacksonville has a culture centered on the St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (&quot;Scomberomorus cavalla&quot;), cobia (&quot;Rachycentron canadum&quot;), dolphin (&quot;Coryphaena hippurus&quot;) and Wahoo (&quot;Acanthocybium solandri&quot;). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.
== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===
Wetlands in the upper and middle basin are fed by rainwater trapped by the structure of the surrounding land. It is an oxygen- and nutrient-poor environment; what grows usually does so in peat which is created by centuries of decaying plant material. Water levels fluctuate with the subtropical wet and dry seasons. Rain in central and north Florida occurs seasonally during summer and winter, but farther south rain in winter is rare. All plants in these basins must tolerate water fluctuation, both flooding and drought. Sweetbay (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;), cypress (&quot;Taxodium&quot;), and swamp tupelo (&quot;Nyssa biflora&quot;) trees often find great success in this region on raised land called hammocks. Trees that live in water for long periods usually have buttressed trunks, tangled, braided roots, or protrusions like cypress knees to obtain oxygen when under water, but the majority of plant life is aquatic. Wetland staples include the American white waterlily (&quot;Nymphaea odorata&quot;), pitcher plants, and Virginia iris (&quot;Iris virginica&quot;). In the southernmost points of the river, &quot;Cladium&quot;, or sawgrass, grows in vast swaths of wet prairie that at one time extended into the Everglades. These wetland flora are remarkably successful in filtering pollutants that otherwise find their way into the river.

Flatwoods forests dominate the Lake George watershed, with slash pines (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;), saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;), and over 100 species of groundcover or herbal plants that grow in poor, sandy soil. Flatwoods pine forests stay relatively dry, but can withstand short periods of flooding. Larger land animals such as wild turkeys (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), sandhill cranes (&quot;Grus canadensis&quot;), and the largest population of southern bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus&quot;) in the contiguous U.S., find it easier to live in the flatwoods. Typical mammals that live in these ecosystems, such as raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), opossums (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), and white tailed-deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), are ones that prefer dry, flat areas with good ground cover and available nesting sites.

=== Fauna ===
Of most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, the foundation of food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (&quot;Pomacea paludosa&quot;), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.

Of vertebrates, numerous species of frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;) proliferate in marsh waters. Most of these animals are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. River otters (&quot;Lutra canadensis&quot;) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact. The marshes around the upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (&quot;Eudocimus albus&quot;), wood stork (&quot;Mycteria americana&quot;), and purple gallinule (&quot;Porphyrio martinicus&quot;) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.

Forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus floridanus&quot;) population in Florida; several troops of Rhesus monkeys (&quot;Macaca mulatta&quot;) have adapted to live near the river as well. The monkeys&#x27; introduction to Florida is unclear; they were reportedly brought either to serve in backdrop scenes of Tarzan movies filmed around the Silver River in the 1930s, or to lend an air of authenticity to &quot;jungle cruises&quot; provided by an enterprising boat operator around the same time.
Springs in Florida stay at an even temperature of throughout the year; because of this, Blue Spring is the winter home for West Indian manatees (&quot;Trichechus manatus latirostris&quot;), and they are protected within Blue Spring State Park. Manatees are large, slow-moving herbivorous aquatic mammals whose primary threats are human development and collisions with swiftly moving watercraft. Many parts of the St. Johns and its tributaries are no-wake zones to protect manatees from being critically or fatally injured by boat propellers. Human interaction with manatees in Blue Spring State Park is forbidden.

The proliferation of largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), black crappie (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;), and bluegill (&quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot;) in central Florida is a major attraction for fishermen from all over the country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (&quot;Etheostoma olmstedi&quot;) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (&quot;Dasyatis sabina&quot;) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (&quot;Rhithropanopeus harrisii&quot;) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.
Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river&#x27;s level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (&quot;Mullidae&quot;), flounder (&quot;Paralichthys lethostigma&quot;), shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;), and blue crabs (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.

Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (&quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.
== Formation and hydrology ==
=== Geologic history ===
Lying within a coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through an area that was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean&#x27;s edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North–south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water. Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.

From its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which is referred to as the &quot;St. Johns River offset&quot;, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.

=== Springs and aquifers ===
All of Florida&#x27;s abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.

Acidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin—less than —sinkholes can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least of water per second. There are four first magnitude springs that feed the St. Johns River: Silver Springs in Marion County, emitting between /second; Silver Glen Spring straddling Marion and Lake Counties, emitting between /second; Alexander Springs in Lake County, emitting between /second; and Blue Spring in Volusia County, emitting between /second.

=== Rainfall and climate ===
The St. Johns River lies within a humid subtropical zone. In summer months, the temperature ranges from , and between in the winter, although drops may occur in winter months to below freezing approximately a dozen times. Water temperatures in the river correlate to the air temperatures. The average range of water temperatures is between , rising in the summer months. Where the river widens between Palatka and Jacksonville, wind becomes a significant factor in navigation, and both whitecap waves and calm surface waters are common.

Rain occurs more frequently in late summer and early fall. Tropical storms and nor&#x27;easters are common occurrences along the Atlantic coast of Florida; the St. Johns River lies between inland, so any storm striking the counties of Indian River north to Duval produces rain that is drained by the St. Johns River. Tropical Storm Fay in 2008 deposited of rain in a 5-day period, most of it located near Melbourne. The St. Johns near Geneva in Seminole County rose in four days, setting a record. The river near Sanford rose in 36 hours. Fay caused severe flooding in the middle basin due not only to the deluge but the flat slopes of the river. Typically, however, the St. Johns basin receives between of rain annually, half of it in summer months. The rate of evapotranspiration corresponds to rainfall, ranging between a year, most of it occurring in the summer.

=== Flow rates and water quality ===
The entire river lies within the nearly flat Pamlico terrace, giving it an overall gradient of per mile (km); it is one of the flattest major rivers on the continent. Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity. Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river&#x27;s tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney. Tides typically raise the river level about at Jacksonville, decreasing some to at Orange Park where the river widens, and increasing back to at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from per second. The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages per second, but with tides it exceeds per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top per second. Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from per second near Lake Poinsett to per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.

As distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35 parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2 ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40 ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9 ppt and falls again to 0.81 ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.

Dissolved oxygen in fresh water is measured to indicate the health of plant and animal life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5 mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.

Like all blackwater streams in Florida, the color of most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and decaying aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of feet below.

== Human history ==
=== Pre-Columbian people ===
Humans arrived on the Florida Peninsula about 12,000 years ago when the ocean was about lower than today, and the peninsula was double its current size. These earliest people are called Paleo-Indians. They were primarily hunter–gatherers who followed large game, such as mastodons, horses, camels, and bison. Much of the land was far from water—most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.

Around 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting much of the polar ice caps and many glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into Archaic people. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated—including the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville—that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes, which preserved much of the human tissue. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of &quot;Viviparus georgianus&quot;—a freshwater snail—and oysters.

The advent of regional types of pottery and stone tools made of flint or limestone marked further advancements around 500 BCE. The Archaic people transitioned into settled groups around Florida. From the central part of the state north, along the Atlantic Coast lived people in the St. Johns culture, named for the most significant nearby natural formation. Around 750 CE, the St. Johns culture learned to cultivate corn, adding to their diet of fish, game, and gourds. Archeologists and anthropologists date this agricultural advancement to coincide with a spread of archeological sites, suggesting that a population increase followed. When European explorers arrived in north Florida, they met the Timucua, numbering about 14,000, the largest group of indigenous people in the region. The later Seminole people called the river &quot;Welaka&quot; or &quot;Ylacco&quot;. These forms may derive from the Creek &quot;wi-láko&quot;, &quot;big water&quot;, a compound usually applied to large rivers that run through lakes; the St. Johns forms and borders numerous lakes. Alternately, the Seminole name may derive from &quot;walaka&quot; (from &quot;wi-alaka&quot;, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;coming&quot;), perhaps a reference to the river&#x27;s slow discharge and the tidal effects on it. The name is sometimes rendered as &quot;Chain of Lakes&quot; in English.

In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge at the bottom of the river.

=== Colonial era ===
Though the first European contact in Florida came in 1513 when Juan Ponce de León arrived near Cape Canaveral, not until 1562 did Europeans settle the north Atlantic coast of the peninsula. Early Spanish explorers named the river &quot;Rio de Corientes&quot; (River of Currents). The St. Johns River became the first place colonized in the region and its first battleground: when French explorer Jean Ribault erected a monument south of the river&#x27;s mouth to make the French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades. Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe.

In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière arrived to build Fort Caroline at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they called the river &quot;Rivière de Mai&quot; because they settled it on May 1. An artist named Jacques LeMoyne documented what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions. Fort Caroline did not last long, though relations with the local Timucua and Mocamas were friendly. The colony was unable to support itself; some of the French deserted. Those who remained were killed in 1565 by the Spanish, led by Pedro Menéndez, when they marched north from St. Augustine and captured Fort Caroline. The river was renamed San Mateo by the Spanish in honor of the Apostle Matthew, whose feast was the following day. Capturing Fort Caroline allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the river.

The French and Spanish continued to spar over who would control the natural resources and native peoples of the territory. The Timucua, who had initially befriended the French, were not encouraged to make the Spanish allies because of colonial governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés&#x27; abhorrence of French Protestantism and his view that the Timucuan beliefs were &quot;Satanic&quot;. By 1573, the Timucua were in outright rebellion, testing the governor&#x27;s patience and forcing Spanish settlers to abandon farms and garrisons in more interior parts of Florida; the Spanish could not persuade the Timucua to keep from attacking them.
Over a hundred years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on &quot;San Juan del Puerto&quot; (St. John of the Harbor), the mission established at the river&#x27;s mouth following the demise of the French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.

The Timucua, as other groups of indigenous people in Florida, began to lose cohesion and numbers by the 18th century. A tribe located in modern-day Georgia and Alabama called the Creeks assisted with this; in 1702, they joined with the Yamasee and attacked some of the Timucua, forcing them to seek protection from the Spanish who forced them into slavery. The Creeks began assimilating other people and spread farther south until they were known by 1765 as Seminoles by the British, a term adapted from &quot;cimarrones&quot; that meant &quot;runaways&quot; or &quot;wild ones&quot;. The Seminoles employed a variety of languages from the peoples the Creeks had assimilated: Hitchiti, Muskogee, as well as Timucua. Between 1716 and 1767, the Seminoles gradually moved into Florida and began to break ties with the Creeks to become a cohesive tribe of their own. The St. Johns provided a natural boundary to separate European colonies on the east bank and indigenous lands west of the river.
After Florida came under the Kingdom of Great Britain&#x27;s jurisdiction in 1763, Quaker father and son naturalists John and William Bartram explored the length of the river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by King George III to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward. William returned to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and wrote another journal about his travels, while he collected plants and befriended the Seminoles who called him &quot;Puc Puggy&quot; (flower hunter). William&#x27;s visit took him as far south as Blue Spring, where he remarked on the crystal clear views offered by the spring water: &quot;The water is perfectly diaphanous, and here are continually a prodigious number and variety of fish; they appear as plain as though lying on a table before your eyes, although many feet deep in the water.&quot; Bartram&#x27;s journals attracted the attention of such prominent Americans as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. The success of these journals inspired other naturalists such as André Michaux to further explore the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, sailing from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and gave names to some of the plants described by the Bartrams&#x27; journals. Michaux was followed by William Baldwin between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including John James Audubon, have carried William&#x27;s &quot;Travels Through North &amp; South Carolina, Georgia, East &amp; West Florida&quot; with them as a guide.

In 1795, Florida was transferred back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley seized the opportunity and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close to the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old Wolof girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (&quot;Gossypium barbadense&quot;). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.

=== Territorial Florida and statehood ===
The first years following Florida&#x27;s annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the Florida territory are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General Andrew Jackson was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the Suwannee River, either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson&#x27;s efforts became the First Seminole War, and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border—previously named Cowford—to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson&#x27;s offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S. Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. Steamboats heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races. By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, Charleston, and Savannah were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.

Florida&#x27;s involvement in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate states because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida&#x27;s role in the Civil War was the sinking of the , a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS &quot;Columbine&quot;, making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.

Confederate Captain John William Pearson named his militia after the Ocklawaha River called the Ocklawaha Rangers in the American Civil War. Prior to the civil war, Pearson ran a successful health resort in Orange Springs. After the civil war Pearson&#x27;s Orange Springs resort declined in popularity due to the increasing attention to nearby Silver Springs—the source of the Silver River—at the turn of the 20th century, popularizing the Ocklawaha. Georgia-born poet Sidney Lanier called it &quot;the sweetest waterlane in the world&quot; in a travel guide he published in 1876. The river gave Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings access to the St. Johns from her homestead at Orange Lake. The region served as a major fishing attraction until a decline in water quality occurred in the 1940s, and since then further degradation of the river and its sources have occurred. In particular, Lake Apopka earned the designation of Florida&#x27;s most polluted lake following a chemical spill in 1980 that dumped DDE in it. It has experienced chronic algal blooms caused by citrus farm fertilizer and wastewater runoff from nearby farms.

Although the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored. Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor William Bloxham in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named Hamilton Disston, initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the Caloosahatchee River, and later to drain lands in the central part of the state for agriculture. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made possible the efforts of railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, including a rail link between Sanford and Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of Kissimmee, St. Cloud, and several others on the west coast of Florida.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; story reporting on Disston&#x27;s progress in 1883 stated that before Disston&#x27;s purchase and the subsequent development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended south. More attention was paid to the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida &quot;a grotesque region&quot; that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste. Following the Civil War, however, famed author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing about it with affection: &quot;The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean is one of the most singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent.&quot; Her memoir &quot;Palmetto Leaves&quot;, published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.

One unforeseen aspect of more people coming to Florida proved to be an overwhelming problem. Water hyacinths, possibly introduced in 1884 by Mrs W. W. Fuller, who owned a winter home near Palatka, grow so densely that they are a serious invasive species. By the mid-1890s, the purple-flowered hyacinths had grown to reside in of the river and its arteries. The plants prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that it spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 in an unsuccessful bid to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them.

=== Land boom ===
An Englishman named Nelson Fell, persuaded by Disston&#x27;s advertisements to make his fortunes in Florida, arrived in the 1880s. An engineer by trade, Fell purchased near Lake Tohopekaliga to create a town named Narcoossee, which had a population of more than 200 English immigrants by 1888. A spate of poor luck and tense British-American relations followed, prompting Fell to spend some years investing in infrastructure in Siberia, but he returned in 1909 with ideas of developing wetlands in central Florida. He was further encouraged by the political promises of Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward to drain the Everglades during his 1904 campaign. In 1910 Fell purchased of land for $1.35 an acre and started the Fellsmere Farms Company to drain the St. Johns Marsh in 1911 and send water into the Indian River Lagoon, promoting the engineered canals and other structures as wondrously efficient in providing land to build a massive metropolis. Some progress was made initially, including the establishment of the town of Fellsmere in which land was sold for $100 an acre, but sales lagged because of a scandal regarding land sale fraud and faulty draining reports from the Everglades. The company then found itself short of funds due to mismanagement. Torrential rains ruptured the newly constructed levees and dikes and forced the company by 1916 to go into receivership. Fell left Florida for Virginia in 1917.

Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings used the St. Johns as a backdrop in her books &quot;South Moon Under&quot; and &quot;The Yearling&quot;, and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river&#x27;s ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled &quot;Hyacinth Drift&quot; in her memoir &quot;Cross Creek&quot; that she had the best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated. Rawlings wrote, &quot;If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, I think I might choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River.&quot;

Florida in the 20th century experienced a massive migration into the state. Undeveloped land sold well and draining to reclaim wetlands has often gone unchecked, and often encouraged by government. The St. Johns headwaters decreased in size from to one between 1900 and 1972. Much of the land was reclaimed for urban use, but agricultural needs took their toll as fertilizers and runoff from cattle ranching washed into the St. Johns. Without wetlands to filter the pollutants, the chemicals stayed in the river and flushed into the Atlantic Ocean. Boaters destroyed the floating islands of muck and weeds in the upper basin with dynamite, causing the lakes to drain completely.

What could have been the most serious human impact on nature in central Florida was the Cross Florida Barge Canal, an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by channeling the Ocklawaha River, first authorized in 1933. The canal was intended to be long, wide, and deep. Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state, and by 1964 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction, though the broader reasoning and feasibility of the project remained unclear. The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades at the same time and by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects. In 1969 the Environmental Defense Fund filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal, citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer, central and north Florida&#x27;s fresh water source.

A separate canal, the St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal, was planned to link the river with the Intracoastal Waterway; the project never broke ground, and was canceled soon after the Cross Florida Barge Canal was suspended.

=== Restoration ===
When steamboats were superseded by the railroad, the river lost much of its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there. Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.

Nitrates and phosphorus used as lawn and crop fertilizers wash into the St. Johns. Broken septic systems and seepage from cattle grazing lands create pollution that also finds its way into the river. Storm water washes from street drains directly to the river and its tributaries: in the 1970s, the Econlockhatchee River received of treated wastewater every day. Wetlands were drained and paved, unable to filter pollutants from the water, made worse by the river&#x27;s own slow discharge. Algal blooms, fish kills, and deformations and lesions on fish occur regularly in the river from Palatka to Jacksonville. Although most of the pollutants in the river are washed from the southern parts of the river, the Jacksonville area produces approximately 36 percent of them found in the lower basin.

The State of Florida implemented a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 to assist with river cleanups, particularly with nonpoint source pollution, or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping. SWIM assists local jurisdictions with purchasing land for wetlands restoration. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters. Around Lake Griffin in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased of land that was previously used for muck farming. More than have been purchased along Lake Apopka to restore its wetlands, and the SJRWMD has removed nearly of gizzard shad (&quot;Dorosoma cepedianum&quot;), a fish species that stores phosphorus and adds to algae problems. The SJRWMD has also set minimum levels for the lakes and tributaries in the St. Johns watersheds to monitor permitted water withdrawals and declare water shortages when necessary.

To assist with river cleanup and the associated funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor John Delaney of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an American Heritage River, beginning in 1997. The designation by the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to coordinate efforts among federal agencies to improve natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation. The campaign was controversial as the Republican mayor defended asking for federal government assistance, writing &quot;Other rivers have relied heavily on federal help for massive environmental clean-ups. It&#x27;s the St. Johns&#x27; turn now.&quot; Twenty-two towns along the St. Johns and environmental, sporting, recreation, boating, and educational organizations also supported its designation, but several prominent Republican politicians expressed concerns over increased federal regulations and restrictions on private property ownership along the river; the Florida House of Representatives passed a resolution asking President Bill Clinton not to include the St. Johns. Despite this, Clinton designated the St. Johns as one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers out of 126 nominated in 1998 for its ecological, historic, economic and cultural significance.

The continuing increase of population in Florida has caused urban planners to forecast that the Floridan Aquifer will no longer be able to sustain the people living in north Florida. By 2020, 7 million people are predicted to live in the St. Johns basins, double the number living there in 2008. Proposals to use a day from the St. Johns, and another from the Ocklawaha River, for fresh water are controversial, prompting a private organization named St. Johns Riverkeeper to nominate it to the list of the Ten Most Endangered Rivers by an environmental watchdog group named American Rivers. In 2008, it was listed as #6, which was met with approval from Jacksonville&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;, and skepticism from the SJRWMD.

The St. Johns River is under consideration as an additional water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river&#x27;s Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted in a series of four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District&#x27;s final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.

The report also noted concerns about the District&#x27;s conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion was based on the model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.

<doc id="437831" wikidata="Q2962001" url="?curid=437831" title="Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) is the professional head of the British Armed Forces and the most senior uniformed military adviser to the Secretary of State for Defence and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The chief of the defence staff is based at the Ministry of Defence and works alongside the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the ministry&#x27;s senior civil servant. The Chief of Defence is the highest ranking officer to currently serve in the armed forces. 

Constitutionally, the sovereign is the &quot;de jure&quot; commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. However, in practice, the Government of the United Kingdom &quot;de facto&quot; exercises the royal prerogative and provides direction of the Armed Forces through the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Defence Council, of which the chief of the defence staff is a member.

The current chief of the defence staff is Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, who succeeded General Sir Nick Carter in November 2021. Chiefs of the defence staff are appointed on the recommendation of the secretary of state for defence to the prime minister, before being approved by the monarch.

==Responsibilities==
The Chief of the Defence Staff&#x27;s responsibilities include:

* leading defence (with the Permanent Secretary (Perm Sec))
* setting strategy for defence, including the future development of the Armed Forces (subject to ministers’ direction, and together with Perm Sec)
* the conduct of current operations (as strategic commander)
* leading relationships with other countries’ Armed Forces

== Supporting and associated posts ==
The CDS is supported by a deputy, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff, who since 1997 (when the CDS post was downgraded) has been of equivalent rank but is ordinarily from a different service to the CDS. There are also several Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (DCDS) posts who support the VCDS. As of 2015 these are: 

*Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Military Strategy &amp; Operations) (DCDS (MSO))
*Chief of Defence People (CDP)
*Deputy Chief of Defence Staff for Military Capability (DCDS (Mil Cap)) 

The CDS maintains a close working relationship with the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Permanent Under Secretary, who is the Ministry&#x27;s senior civil servant, and they both report directly to the Secretary of State for Defence. The CDS focuses on military operations and strategy while the Permanent Under Secretary&#x27;s remit concerns administrative and financial policy.

Additionally, the CDS is supported by a Strategic Advisory Panel.

== History of the post ==
The post was created in 1959 to reflect the new concept of joint operations that had come to the fore in the Second World War. The first incumbent was Marshal of the RAF Sir William Dickson. Prior to the creation of the post, he had served as the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, from 1956 onwards. Before 1956, although no permanent post of chairman existed, the three service chiefs took it in turn to act as chairman at meetings. From the post&#x27;s inception until the mid-to-late 1970s, CDS appointments were granted on a strict rotational basis between the three services. The first break in rotational order was precipitated by the death of Marshal of the RAF Sir Andrew Humphrey.

From the creation of the post until 1997, the Chief of the Defence Staff was appointed to the highest rank in the respective branch of the British armed forces to which he belonged, being an admiral of the Fleet, a field marshal or marshal of the Royal Air Force, (NATO rank grade OF-10). However, with the post-Cold War reduction in the manpower strength of the British Armed Forces and the additional reasoning that no new &quot;Five-star&quot; appointments are to be made in peacetime, since 1997 the Chief of the Defence Staff has kept the rank of admiral, general or air chief marshal, (NATO OF-9), which he invariably already holds. However, during the 2010s Guthrie, Boyce, Walker and Stirrup were honorarily promoted to their respective services&#x27; senior ranks, sometime after they had each stepped down as CDS. Although there is no policy against a Royal Marines officer being appointed, few officers in the Corps attain a high enough rank to be considered for the post. However, in 2016, a Royal Marine officer Gordon Messenger was promoted to the rank of general and appointed as Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.

==List of Chiefs of the Defence Staff (1959–present)==










=== Timeline ===
== Peerage ==
Customarily, former Chiefs of Defence Staff receive a life peerage on retirement, sitting in the House of Lords as non-political crossbench peers. Their appointment is recommended not via the House of Lords Appointments Commission as is normal procedure, but is instead nominated directly to The King by the Prime Minister, who elects to nominate &quot;a limited number of distinguished public servants&quot; on retirement for a peerage. Sir Jock Stirrup was introduced to the House of Lords on 1 February 2010 as &quot;Baron Stirrup&quot;, of Marylebone in the City of Westminster.

<doc id="437832" wikidata="Q1592322" url="?curid=437832" title="Headingley">
<text>Headingley is a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, approximately two miles out of the city centre, to the north west along the A660 road. Headingley is the location of the Beckett Park campus of Leeds Beckett University and Headingley Stadium.

The area sits in the Headingley and Hyde Park ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds Central and Headingley parliamentary constituency.

==History==


Headingley is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as Hedingelei or Hedingeleia when Ilbert de Lacy held 7 carucates, equivalent to about 840 acres, of land. The name is believed to originate from Old English, combining Head(d)inga, meaning &#x27;of the descendants of Head(d)a,&#x27; with lēah, signifying &#x27;open ground.&#x27; In essence, it translates to &quot;the clearing of Hedda&#x27;s people&quot;. Headda has sometimes been identified with Saint Hædde. A stone coffin found near Beckett Park in 1995 suggests there may have been an earlier settlement in late Roman or post-Roman times.

From Viking times, Headingley was the centre of the Skyrack wapentake or &quot;Siaraches&quot;, the &quot;Shire oak&quot;. The name may refer to an oak tree that was a meeting place for settling legal disputes and raising armies. An ancient oak, said to be the Shire Oak, stood to the north of St Michael&#x27;s Church until 1941, and gives its name to two public houses, the Original Oak and the Skyrack.

During the 13th century, William de Poiteven gave land in Headingley to Kirkstall Abbey. In 1341, the monaster received the remainder of the township of Headingley-cum-Burley from John de Calverley.
A map of 1711 shows Headingley as having a chapel, cottages and farmsteads scattered around a triangle of land formed by the merging of routes from north, west and south. Enclosed fields were situated around the settlement with a large tract of common land, Headingley Moor, to the north. In an 1801 census, Headingley&#x27;s population was given as 300.

An 1829 Act of Parliament enclosed Headingley Moor and the land was placed for sale. Around 30 workers&#x27; cottages encroached on the fringes of the moor before 1829. Land here was generally cheaper than that at Headingley Hill as it failed to attract the building of affluent villas. This brought about the building of smaller terraced housing around Moor Road and Cottage Road. In the mid 19th century, Far Headingley had begun to develop over what was largely unclaimed common land.

Headingley was a village until the expansion of Leeds during the Industrial Revolution and became a popular suburb where the rich moved to escape the filth and pollution of the city.

In 1840, Leeds Zoological and Botanical Gardens opened but despite the opening of the nearby Headingley railway station in 1849, the zoo was loss-making and closed in 1858. The bear pit survives on Cardigan Road.

Meanwood Beck, to the east of the village, was a source of water for the early inhabitants and later provided a source of power for the Victorians of Leeds.

The Leeds Tramway terminated at a depot at Far Headingley between 1875 and 1959. The trams improved the accessibility of Headingley from Leeds city centre, which facilitated growth and attracted affluent middle class inhabitants. The tramway perhaps ended Headingley&#x27;s village status and made it into a suburb.

With exception of Beckett Park and the surrounding area, most of Headingley had been developed by the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1911 census the population of Headingley was in excess of 46,000.

Leeds Beckett University (formerly Leeds Metropolitan University) has a campus at Beckett Park in Headingley. Much of the housing around Kirkstall Lane is rented to students. The conversion of Leeds Polytechnic into a university and its subsequent growth brought about an increased student population.

Headingley Stadium hosts England test matches and rugby league matches bringing many spectators to the area. The cricket ground has been enlarged to maintain its eligibility for test matches and in 2006 the eastern terraces on the rugby ground were replaced with the Carnegie stand. The winter shed cricket pavilion has been replaced with a new stand and media centre.

==Sports==


===Professional===
Headingley is also known in sporting circles; its stadium is known as Headingley – earlier spelt Headingly. The stadium is home to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club, the Northern Superchargers franchise cricket team, the Leeds Rhinos rugby league and Yorkshire Carnegie rugby union clubs. Northern Diamonds play some of their games at Headingley in the Charlotte Edwards Cup and Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.

Since 2000, the stadium&#x27;s cricket ground has been nearly entirely rebuilt in order to retain Test match status. The winter shed was demolished in 2008 and replaced by a new stand and media centre. The rugby ground also saw development with the building of the Carnegie Stand which replaced the former Eastern Terraces. This was built with co-operation from Leeds Beckett University who retain lecture rooms in the building.

===Amateur===
Headingley is also home to an amateur association football team, Headingley AFC. The club nearly folded after losing its home ground, but was offered a new ground in 2008 by the University of Bradford. It nows plays in Weetwood Playing Fields, owned by the University of Leeds. They attracted media attention in January 2019 for featuring a shirt sponsor warning of the dangers of gambling. There are also two amateur cricket clubs (Headingley Bramhope CC &amp; St. Chads CC) in Far Headingley.

==Politics==
Headingley is in the Leeds Central and Headingley constituency. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Alex Sobel (Labour Party) who has represented the area since the 2017 general election. The ward of Headingley and Hyde Park has two Labour councillors, Abdul Hannan and Jonathan Pryor and one Green councillor, Tim Goodall.

==Amenities==

Headingley has two renowned fish and chip shops/fish restaurants which have been operating since the 1930s: Brett&#x27;s, a 19th-century stone building on North Lane, and the now permanently closed Catch Seafood Headingley (formerly Bryan&#x27;s and then The Fisherman&#x27;s Lodge), a more modern building on Weetwood Lane whose parent company entered administration in October of 2022. There are several pubs and bars plus extensive shopping areas. The pub Headingley Taps is so called because it was formerly a water pumping station. In Headingley Central (formerly the Arndale Centre) there are large retailers and several other chain shops as well as a small multi-storey car park. Headingley also has a small library on North Lane. There are many banks, building societies, restaurants, cafes and charity shops. Along Otley Road there is a large Oxfam bookshop. Until 2005, Headingley had two cinemas, &#x27;The Lounge&#x27; and &#x27;The Cottage Road Cinema&#x27; (usually referred to as &#x27;Cottage Road&#x27;). The Lounge Cinema in the centre of Headingley has since closed and is being redeveloped as office and living accommodation, leaving only Cottage Road in Far Headingley. The area&#x27;s Woolworths closed in the 1990s. Until the 1980s, the Arndale Centre boasted a bowling alley. The Arndale Centre began undergoing an external facelift in 2009. The nearest large supermarket is a Morrisons in Kirkstall, approximately a mile away from the centre of Headingley. There is a Premier Inn hotel above the Arndale Centre in the tallest building in Headingley, formerly an office block. Headingley is also famous for the Otley Run, which is a pub crawl starting at Woodies Ale House in Far Headingley and finishing at the Dry Dock near Leeds City Centre. Typically the Otley run is done in fancy dress.

==People==
Many famous writers, past and present, are connected with Headingley: Arthur Ransome, best known perhaps for the children&#x27;s classic &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;, was born there, J. R. R. Tolkien the writer and author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, lived there when he worked at the university, playwright Alan Bennett once lived over a butcher&#x27;s shop (now a dry cleaner&#x27;s) opposite the Three Horseshoes and TV writer Kay Mellor lived in Weetwood. Many writers and poets who currently live in the area participate in the annual Headingley LitFest, which takes place each March, using venues like the Heart Centre, The New Headingley Club, various cafés and private houses. The tenth LitFest took place in 2017. Reviews of all talks and performances are online on the LitFest blog.

In the time of Queen Victoria, Prince Alemayehu of Abyssinia, brought to England after the defeat of his father King Tewedros, died of pneumonia at an address in Hollin Lane, Far Headingley.

Edward Baines, editor of the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; in the 19th century, lived at Headingley Lodge, north of Kirkstall Lane, and then St Ann&#x27;s Hill on St Ann&#x27;s Lane.

The social reformer, suffragist and writer Isabella Ford was born in Headingley in 1855. 

Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe committed two of his 20 attacks in Headingley. He killed 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill – the last of the 13 women he killed – in the area on 17 November 1980. On 24 September that year, he had also attacked Singapore-born doctor Upadhya Bandara, 34, who survived the assault. Sutcliffe was arrested within two months of Hill&#x27;s murder and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for a total of 13 murders and seven attempted murders.

==Headingley Development Trust==

The Headingley Development Trust (HDT) is a community benefit society, founded in 2005 by local residents, organisations and small businesses. It is a community business that is self-financing and supports. a range of initiatives that benefit the local community. HDT has over 1,200 members, making it one of the largest Development Trusts of its kind in the UK. In 2018 it successfully raised over £480,000 through a community share offer to create the Headingley Investment Fund (HIF). Since 2011, HDT has operated the Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre (HEART). It also runs several publicly-operated local businesses and a variety of cultural initiatives. 

==Churches==

Headingley Parish Church is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. It is a large, grade II* listed, steepled church on the corner of Otley Road and St Michael&#x27;s Road, opposite the Skyrack public house. The Church was built between 1884 and 1886 as the third church on this site. There is a separate parish of Far Headingley, with its parish church of St Chad&#x27;s (also a large steepled church and grade II* listed).

South Parade Baptist church (1908 and 1925, part of Cornerstone Baptist Church since 2020) and Headingley Methodist Church (1840–45 and later extensions) are both grade II listed. St Columba&#x27;s United Reformed church is a modern building, as is the Roman Catholic parish church of St Urban&#x27;s, located to the east of the area. Hinsley Hall in Headingley is the pastoral and conference centre for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds. The small Lutheran church of St Luke&#x27;s in Alma Road was converted from the coach house and stable of a Victorian villa.

The Anglican Bishop of Leeds and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds both live within the Headingley area.
==Buildings of architectural interest==

According to one source &quot;Headingley has the most important group of large and small villas and mansions in the city.&quot; and has more than 100 listed buildings. Parts of Headingley are included in Conservation areas established by Leeds City Council.

Individual listed buildings include St Michael&#x27;s Church and associated buildings, the Hyde Park Picture House, the Elinor Lupton Centre, Moorfield House in Alma Road and the former St Margaret of Antioch church building on Cardigan Road.

The mid-19th century listed building Spring House in St Michael&#x27;s Road, Headingley, was the address for VAD nurses during this time; Olive Middleton, great-grandmother of the Princess of Wales, was attached to &quot;Spring House, St Michael&#x27;s Road, Headingley&quot; when 
working at Gledhow Hall and elsewhere as a VAD nurse during the Great War. Residing at Spring House were Olive&#x27;s two sisters-in-law; Gertrude Middleton (1876–1942), a former Oxford University student who also worked as a VAD nurse at Gledhow Hall and her sister Ellen Middleton (1872-1949) who volunteered as &quot;head cook&quot; at Gledhow Hall. Another of Olive&#x27;s sisters-in-law was Caroline Middleton (1876-1961) who worked as a VAD nurse at the 2nd Northern General Hospital, Leeds. A number of premises were named Spring House in and around Leeds, at times operating as a Home for Friendless Girls in the early decades of the 20th century.

Headingley Castle was built in 1846 and was owned in 1866 by cloth merchant Arthur Lupton (1809–1889) of the Lupton family. It was the home from 1909 to 1943 of entrepreneur and art collector Frank Harris Fulford, and later used to house a school for the blind.

Headingley also has a typical example of a 1960s Arndale Centre. Housing in Headingley is generally Victorian and early 20th century and mostly of little architectural note.

==Headingley in media==
The ITV television series &quot;Fat Friends&quot; was set in Headingley. Large amounts of the eighties ITV &quot;Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot; was filmed in and around Headingley and Beckett Park, along with Moor Grange and Pudsey. Parts of Headingley stood in for Northern Ireland in &quot;Harrys Game&quot;, and &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; used locations in the area.

<doc id="437840" wikidata="Q838514" url="?curid=437840" title="Drunken Master">
<text>Drunken Master (), also known as Drunken Master The Beginning, is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts comedy film directed by Yuen Woo-ping and produced and co-written by Ng See-yuen. The film features much of the same crew as Yuen&#x27;s &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; released earlier the same year, including lead actors Jackie Chan, Yuen Siu-tien (Woo-ping&#x27;s father), and Hwang Jang-lee; although narratively unrelated, &quot;Drunken Master&quot; bears similarities to its predecessor in its story and style.

&quot;Drunken Master&quot; features Chan and Yuen Siu-tien as fictionalized versions of martial artists Wong Fei-hung and Beggar So; in the film, Wong is an irreverent young man forced under the fierce tutelage of So, master of the drunken fighting style; although the two do not originally get along, Wong eventually gains humility and respect for So.

Considered an early milestone of martial arts comedy and one of the best films in the genre, the film was a large box-office success, earning two and a half times the revenue of the already-successful &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;; it had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous later films, music, manga, anime and video games with its depictions of teacher-student relationship and the drunken style, and helped establish Chan as one of Asia&#x27;s most popular actors. The film was followed by two sequels directed by Lau Kar-leung in 1994: the direct sequel &quot;Drunken Master II&quot;, in which Chan reprised his role, and the mostly-unrelated &quot;Drunken Master III&quot;. &quot;Drunken Master&quot; would be Yuen Siu-tien&#x27;s final film released during his lifetime, although he would portray Beggar So again in several films released posthumously, including the &quot;Drunken Master&quot; spin-off &quot;Dance of the Drunk Mantis&quot; (1979), also directed by Woo-ping.

==Plot==
Wong Fei-hung (sometimes dubbed as &quot;Freddie Wong&quot;) is a young and mischievous son, who runs into a series of troubles. Firstly, he teaches an overbearing assistant martial arts teacher a lesson, and later makes advances on a woman to impress his friends. He is consequently thrashed by her older female guardian. His shame is compounded when these two are later revealed to be his visiting aunt and cousin, whom he had not met before. Lastly, he beats up a hooligan, who turns out to be the son of an influential man in town. His father decides to punish him for his behavior by making him train harder in martial arts. Wong&#x27;s father arranges for Beggar So to train his son in martial arts. 

Beggar So has a reputation for crippling his students during training so Wong flees from home in an attempt to escape his punishment. Penniless, Wong stops at a restaurant and tries to trick a fellow patron into offering him a free meal. As Wong was about to leave after his meal, he discovers that the man is actually the owner of the restaurant. He fights with the owner&#x27;s lackeys in an attempt to escape. An old drunkard nearby is drawn into the fight and helps him escape. The drunkard turns out to be Beggar So (who is known in some versions of the film as Sam Seed, So-Hi or Su Hua-chi), the Drunken Master. Beggar So forces Wong into his brutal and rigorous training programme, but he flees again to avoid the torturous training and runs into the notorious killer Yim Tit-sam (known in some versions as Thunderfoot or Thunderleg) by accident. 

Yim is known for his &quot;Devil&#x27;s Kick&quot;, a swift and deadly kicking style which has never been defeated. Wong provokes and challenges him to a fight and is soundly defeated and humiliated. He makes his way back to Beggar So and decides to commit himself to the Drunken Master&#x27;s training program. The training resumes and soon Wong learns Beggar So&#x27;s secret style of martial arts, a form of Drunken Boxing called &quot;The Eight Drunken Immortals&quot;, named after the eight xian that the fighting style references. Wong masters seven of the eight styles with the exception of Drunken Miss Ho&#x27;s as he feels that her style of fighting is too feminine.

Meanwhile, Yim Tit-sam is contracted by a business rival to kill Wong&#x27;s father. Wong&#x27;s father fights with Yim and is defeated and injured by him. Wong and Beggar So arrive on time and Wong continues the fight with Yim. Beggar So promises not to interfere in the fight. Wong employs the new skills he has learned and outmatches Yim&#x27;s kicking style. Yim then resorts to his secret technique, the Devil&#x27;s Shadowless Hand, which is too fast for Wong to defeat. Wong confesses that he did not master the last style so Beggar So tells him to combine the seven styles and create his own version of the last style. Wong follows the instruction and discovers his own unique style of Drunken Miss Ho, which he uses to overcome the Shadowless Hand and finally defeats Yim.

==Background==
The film&#x27;s protagonist Wong Fei-hung was a Chinese martial artist, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and a revolutionary who lived towards the end of the Qing dynasty. He became a Chinese folk hero and the subject of several Hong Kong television programmes and films. Beggar So, who plays a supporting role in the film, is also another character from Chinese folklore and one of the Ten Tigers of Canton. The Beggar So character is often cast as an associate of Wong Fei-hung or Wong&#x27;s uncle.

==Cast==
*Jackie Chan as Wong Fei-hung / Freddy Wong (UK version)
*Yuen Siu-Tin (or Simon Yuen) as Beggar So / Su Hua Chi / Sam Seed 
*Hwang Jang-lee as Thunderleg Yen Tie Hsin / Yim Tit-sam / Thunderfoot
*Dean Shek as Professor Kai-Hsin
*Lam Kau as Wong Kei-Ying / Wong Chi-Ying / Robert Wong (UK version)
*Fung King-man as Mr. Lee Man-ho
*Hsu Hsia as King of Bamboo Hsu Ching-tien
*Linda Lin as Wong Fei-hung&#x27;s aunt

*Tino Wong as Jerry Lee

==Fight scenes and martial arts==
A number of notable fights are featured in the film, almost all of them with strong elements of comedy—from the game of Keep Away with Wong Kei-ying&#x27;s cocky, but incompetent, assistant kung fu instructor, to the novel &quot;head-fu&quot; fighting style used by one of his opponents. The film features the Hung Ga system of fighting, which was historically practiced by Wong Fei-hung and his father Wong Kei-ying, both of whom are major characters in the film. The animal styles of Snake, Crane, and Tiger performed in the film are derived wholly from the Hung Ga system and bear only a tangential relationship to the Fujian White Crane, Lama Pai (Tibetan White Crane), Black Tiger, and Snake systems of kung fu. Monkey style kung fu, popular in Southern Chinese martial arts performances, is also shown briefly.

Numerous systems of kung fu include &quot;Drunken Boxing&quot; forms (e.g. Choi Lei Fut and Drunken Monkey), and the Taoist Eight Immortals are popular staples of Chinese culture and art. However, the &quot;Eight Drunken Immortals&quot; forms depicted in this film are likely the creation of director and choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and based on routines found in other systems.

The primary villain in &quot;Drunken Master&quot; is played by Hwang Jang-lee, a Korean martial artist specialising in Taekwondo and known for his high-flying kicks, which are prominently displayed in the film. The systems of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Kick&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Shadowless Hands&quot; employed by Thunderleg are entirely fictitious.

According to his book &quot;I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action&quot;, Chan nearly lost an eye after his brow ridge was injured.

==Theme song==
The theme song of &quot;Drunken Master&quot; is based on a Chinese folk song, &quot;Under the General&#x27;s Orders&quot;. Since &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, the theme song has been popularly associated with the folk hero Wong Fei-hung, who Jackie Chan plays in the film. It was later used in the 1983 film &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot;, starring Sammo Hung; it was played in a market scene whilst the Five Lucky Stars are watching two men demonstrating the beneficial effects of their medicines and their martial arts stances, in reference to Wong Fei-hung. &quot;Under the General&#x27;s Orders&quot; later become the main theme song for the &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; series starring Jet Li, who also plays Wong Fei-hung.

==Box office==
At the Hong Kong box office, &quot;Drunken Master&quot; earned an impressive 6,763,793 (). It was the second most popular film in Hong Kong in 1978 behind the Hui brothers&#x27; &quot;The Contract&quot; and third on the all-time list.

In Japan, where it released on 21 July 1979, it became one of the year&#x27;s top ten highest-grossing films, earning (). In South Korea, it was the highest-grossing film of 1979, with 898,561 box admissions in Seoul City, equivalent to an estimated (). The film also broke records in Malaysia and Singapore.

In Germany, where it was released as &quot;Sie nannten ihn Knochenbrecher&quot; (&quot;They Called Him Bone Breaker&quot;) on 25 July 1980, it was the 41st highest-grossing film of the year, selling 584,312 tickets, equivalent to an estimated (US$2,063,606). In Spain, the film sold 823,203 tickets, equivalent to an estimated ().

Combined, the film grossed an estimated total of approximately in East Asia and Europe.

==Sequels and spinoffs==
*&quot;Drunken Master II&quot; (1994) stars Jackie Chan, and is considered the only official sequel. Chan portrays the same character, Wong Fei-hung. The US release of the film in 2000 was entitled &quot;The Legend of Drunken Master&quot;. In 2021, the film was released again in the United States on Blu-ray as part of the Warner Archive Collection under its original title with previously censored content added back into the film.
*In 1979, Yuen Siu-Tin reprised the role of Beggar So in the film &quot;Dance of the Drunk Mantis&quot;, which is entitled &quot;Drunken Master Part 2&quot; (not to be confused with the film &quot;Drunken Master II&quot; referenced above) in some releases. The film, which was again directed by his son, Yuen Woo-Ping, does not feature Jackie Chan, focusing instead on the drunken beggar character rather than on Wong Fei-hung. It is therefore generally considered to be a spinoff rather than a true sequel.
*Yuen played this same role again in the films &quot;Story of Drunken Master&quot; and &quot;World of the Drunken Master&quot;.

==Imitators==
As with several successful Hong Kong action films, a number of films were released in the wake of &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (and its sequel) that could be considered to trade on the fame of the original films. These had less in common with the original films than the spinoffs starring Yuen Siu-tien.
They include:
*&quot;5 Superfighters&quot; (aka &quot;The Drunken Fighter&quot;) (1978)
*&quot;Drunken Swordsman&quot; (aka &quot;Drunken Dragon Strikes Back&quot;) (1979)
*&quot;Drunken Arts and Crippled Fist&quot; (Featuring Li Yi Min) (1979)
*&quot;Drunken Master, Slippery Snake&quot; (Starring Cliff Lok) (1979)
*&quot;Shaolin Drunken Monkey&quot; (Starring Elton Chong) (1981)
*&quot;The Shaolin Drunken Monk&quot; (starring Gordon Liu) (1982)
*&quot;Drunken Tai Chi&quot; (directed by Yuen Woo-ping and starring Donnie Yen) (1984)
*&quot;Revenge of the Drunken Master&quot; (1984), starring Johnny Chan, whose name allowed him to trade off his more successful namesake in other low-budget martial arts films including &quot;Golden Dragon, Silver Snake&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Eagles Killer&quot; (1978)
*&quot;Drunken Master III&quot; (aka &quot;Drunken Master Killer&quot;) – starring Andy Lau (1994)
*&quot;The Little Drunken Masters&quot; (1995)

Not all films that feature the Zui Quan &quot;Drunken Fist&quot; style (or variations on it) can be considered as imitators of the &quot;Drunken Master&quot; films. Films such as &quot;Drunken Monkey&quot; (2002) may feature a drunken style of kung fu, and in the case of &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot; (2008), the same principal star, but they have a fundamentally different plot and sufficiently different title to separate them from &quot;Drunken Master&quot;.

==Home media==
*On 24 April 2000, Hong Kong Legends released a DVD in the United Kingdom. The image is cropped from 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 and has the Mandarin soundtrack with dubtitles. However, it has a number of additional features including a deleted scene and an interview with producer Ng See-yuen.
*On 2 April 2002, Columbia TriStar Home Video and Destination Films released a DVD in the United States. Despite a 2:35:1 image and the inclusion of the original Cantonese track, the audio is incomplete in some sections (reverting to the English dub) and contains dubtitles. There&#x27;s an audio commentary by Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang.
*On 18 March 2004, HKVideo released a &quot;Wong Fei Hung&quot; DVD boxset in France containing this film (French title: &quot;Le maître chinois&quot;) and two others. It contains a full 2:35:1 image and the Cantonese soundtrack. However, it contains slightly poorer image quality and no English subtitles.
*On 30 April 2004, Mei Ah Entertainment released a remastered DVD in Hong Kong (pictured right). It contains a 2:35:1 image, Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1 track, original Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track and Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track. Subtitles include Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. The missing Cantonese for the opening has been re-dubbed in Cantonese and the other missing Cantonese scenes as extended footage in Mandarin due to trouble of re-dubbing with new voice actors. Many short lines missing Cantonese had been removed. Special features include Extended footage, accessed during the film by selecting the wine jug icon when it appears on the right top corner, Mastering the Drunken Master, a 35-second music video with clips of Jackie Chan practicing the 8 Drunken Gods from the film, film synopsis and cast &amp; crew.
*PanMedia released a bootleg DVD that contains the complete Cantonese track.

==Cultural impact==
===Fashion===
*During the late 1970s to early 1980s, Jackie Chan&#x27;s shoulder-length hairstyle in &quot;Drunken Master&quot; became popular across Asia, widely adopted by both men and women across the region.

===Film===
In 2017, it was ranked number 3 on GamesRadar&#x27;s list of 50 greatest kung fu movies of all time.

*Edgar Wright&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013) had drunken pub fight scenes inspired by &quot;Drunken Master&quot;. The film&#x27;s fight scenes were choreographed by Brad Allan, who was part of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team during the 1990s to 2000s.

===Manga and anime===
*Manga author Akira Toriyama cited &quot;Drunken Master&quot; as one of his major inspirations for the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series of shōnen manga and anime, along with Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and the Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Toriyama said that he would never have come up with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; if he had not watched &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, and he was drawn to its more light-hearted tone. &quot;Drunken Master&quot; also served as a reference for the training scenes. The series pays homage to &quot;Drunken Master&quot; when the first tournament is held, where Kame-Sennin (Master Roshi) is disguised as &quot;Jackie Chun&quot; and he tries to use a Drunken Fist technique on Son Goku (Goku).
* In the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, the character Rock Lee is seen performing similar fighting styles after consuming alcohol. Known as the &#x27;Drunken Fist&#x27; in the series&#x27; Japanese version and the &#x27;Loopy Fist&#x27; in the English.

===Music===
*Jamaican musicians Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, and The Revolutionaries recorded a reggae song titled &quot;Drunken Master&quot; that was released by Island on the album &quot;Sly and Robbie Present Taxi&quot; in 1981.
*UK dubstep artist FuntCase used speech samples taken from the film in his song &quot;Half drunk&quot;.

===Video games===
*The PlayStation game &quot;Jackie Chan Stuntmaster&quot; includes a bonus level in which he wears his traditional Drunken Master dress and drinks wine while fighting. He even gives the Drunken Punch as his charge punch throughout the game.
*In popular PC online game &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, there is a stance-skill called &quot;Drunken Master&quot; which temporarily increases movement and attack speed. This effect is doubled if character is drunk.
*In &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, the character Chin Gentsai was modeled after Su Hua Chi.
*The &quot;Tekken&quot; video game series features a character named Lei Wu Long, a Hong Kong detective based on Jackie Chan&#x27;s Police Story films. While the character was originally nicknamed Supercop after the film Police Story 3: Supercop Lei Wu Long uses 5 to 6+ stances which have all of Jackie Chan&#x27;s signature film movies. Initially in the series it focused on the Snake style he created for &quot;Snake in The Eagles Shadow&quot;. In &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; released in 2012, Lei Wulong&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Stance&quot; is &quot;Drunken Fist&quot; based on his performance in the 1978 original and the 1994 sequel.
*The &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; video game franchise features a playable character named Brad Wong; a drunken wanderer introduced in Dead or Alive 3 who specializes in the zui quan fighting style, and was taught by a non-playable character named Chen.
*The &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; video game franchise introduced Bo&#x27; Rai Cho in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;; his name is a play on the word &quot;borracho&quot; (Spanish for &quot;drunk&quot;), and he is indeed usually depicted as intoxicated, and carrying a canister of alcohol. His fighting moves consist of drunken style fighting mixed with vulgar actions.

<doc id="437847" wikidata="Q7653860" url="?curid=437847" title="Swarf (band)">
<text>Swarf were an English electronic band from Brighton, Sussex, England.

==Background==
The lineup was Liz Green (vocals and lyrics), Andrew Stock (synths, programming) and Chris Kiefer (synths, programming). The band was formed in 2001 by Green and Stock, with Kiefer joining later.

After a 2004 UK tour with Ultravox veteran John Foxx the band released &quot;Art, Science, Exploitation&quot;, Swarf&#x27;s first and only full album to date. Several tracks were produced by Marc Heal of Cubanate.

The band&#x27;s original following stemmed from the goth and Industrial genres, but the band themselves never followed the scene&#x27;s usual clichés. More recently, the group have moved away from their original audience and seem to have found a niche in the dance scene, featuring on several trance compilation albums. BBC South have also broadcast a live session.

==Discography==
* &quot;Fall&quot; (Wasp Factory, 2001)
* &quot;Art, Science, Exploitation&quot; (Cryonica, 2004)

===Compilation albums===
*&quot;Working With Children And Animals Vol 2&quot; (Wasp Factory, 2002) – &quot;Drown&quot;, &quot;Shadows&quot;
*&quot;Cryotank Vol 1&quot; (Cryonica, 2003) – &quot;Supine&quot;, &quot;Grey (version)&quot;, &quot;Subtext (Weirdo Bold Mix)&quot;
*&quot;Interbreeding: Industrial Cyberlords&quot; (BLC Productions) – &quot;Shadows&quot;
*&quot;Whirly Waves 3&quot; Whirl-Y-Gig compilation album. &quot;Subtext&quot; (Weirdo mix)

<doc id="437855" wikidata="Q4499221" url="?curid=437855" title="Tom Holmes (British politician)">
<text>Thomas Frank Holmes (born 1931) is a British far-right politician. He was the chairman of the National Front between 1998 and 2009, and has been a long-standing member of the movement.

Holmes has been involved in nationalist politics since 1958.

== Views ==
Holmes is a strong supporter of European nationalism and has stated, &quot;I have contacts with people all over Europe: Austria, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Serbia, but none of these are official contacts, we have unofficial contacts, yes, we support any European nationalist party.&quot; He has also been highly critical of the British National Party, claiming that it is no longer truly white nationalist and condemning it for having a Sikh columnist in the party&#x27;s newspaper.

<doc id="437856" wikidata="Q189302" url="?curid=437856" title="Group 4 element">
<text>Group 4 is the second group of transition metals in the periodic table. It contains only the four elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), and rutherfordium (Rf). The group is also called the titanium group or titanium family after its lightest member.

As is typical for early transition metals, zirconium and hafnium have only the group oxidation state of +4 as a major one, and are quite electropositive and have a less rich coordination chemistry. Due to the effects of the lanthanide contraction, they are very similar in properties. Titanium is somewhat distinct due to its smaller size: it has a well-defined +3 state as well (although +4 is more stable).

All the group 4 elements are hard. Their inherent reactivity is completely masked due to the formation of a dense oxide layer that protects them from corrosion, as well as attack by many acids and alkalis. The first three of them occur naturally. Rutherfordium is strongly radioactive: it does not occur naturally and must be produced by artificial synthesis, but its observed and theoretically predicted properties are consistent with it being a heavier homologue of hafnium. None of them have any biological role.

==History==
Zircon was known as a gemstone from ancient times, but it was not known to contain a new element until the work of German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1789. He analysed the zircon-containing mineral jargoon and found a new earth (oxide), but was unable to isolate the element from its oxide. Cornish chemist Humphry Davy also attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed: he gave it the name zirconium. In 1824, Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius isolated an impure form of zirconium, obtained by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.

Cornish mineralogist William Gregor first identified titanium in ilmenite sand beside a stream in Cornwall, Great Britain in the year 1791. After analyzing the sand, he determined the weakly magnetic sand to contain iron oxide and a metal oxide that he could not identify. During that same year, mineralogist Franz Joseph Muller produced the same metal oxide and could not identify it. In 1795, chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently rediscovered the metal oxide in rutile from the Hungarian village Boinik. He identified the oxide containing a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. Berzelius was also the first to prepare titanium metal (albeit impurely), doing so in 1825.

The X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed that there was a missing element with atomic number 72. This spurred chemists to look for it. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on &quot;celtium&quot; in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy.

By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles Rugeley Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr&#x27;s theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth. Encouraged by this, and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain&#x27;s claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, &quot;Hafnia&quot;, the home town of Niels Bohr.

Hafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesy. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. The long delay between the discovery of the lightest two group 4 elements and that of hafnium was partly due to the rarity of hafnium, and partly due to the extreme similarity of zirconium and hafnium, so that all previous samples of zirconium had in reality been contaminated with hafnium without anyone knowing.

The last element of the group, rutherfordium, does not occur naturally and had to be made by synthesis. The first reported detection was by a team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), which in 1964 claimed to have produced the new element by bombarding a plutonium-242 target with neon-22 ions, although this was later put into question. More conclusive evidence was obtained by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who synthesised element 104 in 1969 by bombarding a californium-249 target with carbon-12 ions. A controversy erupted on who had discovered the element, which each group suggesting its own name: the Dubna group named the element &quot;kurchatovium&quot; after Igor Kurchatov, while the Berkeley group named it &quot;rutherfordium&quot; after Ernest Rutherford. Eventually a joint working party of IUPAC and IUPAP, the Transfermium Working Group, decided that credit for the discovery should be shared. After various compromises were attempted, in 1997, IUPAC officially named the element rutherfordium following the American proposal.

==Characteristics==

===Chemical===
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group; chemical properties of rutherfordium are not well-characterized, but what is known and predicted matches its position as a heavier homolog of hafnium.

Titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are reactive metals, but this is masked in the bulk form because they form a dense oxide layer that sticks to the metal and reforms even if removed. As such, the bulk metals are very resistant to chemical attack; most aqueous acids have no effect unless heated, and aqueous alkalis have no effect even when hot. Oxidizing acids such as nitric acids indeed tend to reduce reactivity as they induce the formation of this oxide layer. The exception is hydrofluoric acid, as it forms soluble fluoro complexes of the metals. When finely divided, their reactivity shows as they become pyrophoric, directly reacting with oxygen and hydrogen, and even nitrogen in the case of titanium. All three are fairly electropositive, although less so than their predecessors in group 3. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.

The chemistry of group 4 elements is dominated by the group oxidation state. Zirconium and hafnium are in particular extremely similar, with the most salient differences being physical rather than chemical (melting and boiling points of compounds and their solubility in solvents). This is an effect of the lanthanide contraction: the expected increase of atomic radius from the 4d to the 5d elements is wiped out by the insertion of the 4f elements before. Titanium, being smaller, is distinct from these two: its oxide is less basic than those of zirconium and hafnium, and its aqueous chemistry is more hydrolyzed. Rutherfordium should have a still more basic oxide than zirconium and hafnium.

The chemistry of all three is dominated by the +4 oxidation state, though this is too high to be well-described as totally ionic. Low oxidation states are not well-represented for zirconium and hafnium (and should be even less well-represented for rutherfordium); the +3 oxidation state of zirconium and hafnium reduces water. For titanium, this oxidation state is merely easily oxidised, forming a violet Ti3+ aqua cation in solution. The elements have a significant coordination chemistry: zirconium and hafnium are large enough to readily support the coordination number of 8. All three metals however form weak sigma bonds to carbon and because they have few d electrons, pi backbonding is not very effective either.

===Physical===
The trends in group 4 follow those of the other early d-block groups and reflect the addition of a filled f-shell into the core in passing from the fifth to the sixth period. All the stable members of the group are silvery refractory metals, though impurities of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen make them brittle. They all crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure at room temperature, and rutherfordium is expected to do the same. At high temperatures, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium transform to a body-centered cubic structure. While they are better conductors of heat and electricity than their group 3 predecessors, they are still poor compared to most metals. This, along with the higher melting and boiling points, and enthalpies of fusion, vaporization, and atomization, reflects the extra d electron available for metallic bonding.

The table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 4 elements. The four question-marked values are extrapolated.

==Production==
The production of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides, and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.

Further purification is done by a chemical transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500 °C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000 °C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.
::M + 2 I2 (low temp.) → MI4
::MI4 (high temp.) → M + 2 I2

==Occurrence==

The abundance of the group 4 metals decreases with increase of atomic mass. Titanium is the seventh most abundant metal in Earth&#x27;s crust and has an abundance of 6320 ppm, while zirconium has an abundance of 162 ppm and hafnium has only an abundance of 3 ppm.

All three stable elements occur in heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.

==Applications==

Titanium metal and its alloys have a wide range of applications, where the corrosion resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.

Smaller amounts of hafnium and zirconium are used in super alloys to improve the properties of those alloys.

==Biological occurrences==
The group 4 elements are hard refractory metals with low aqueous solubility and low availability to the biosphere. Titanium and zirconium are relatively abundant, whereas hafnium is rare in the environment, and rutherfordium non-existent.

Titanium has no known role in any organism&#x27;s biology. However, many studies suggest that titanium could be biologically active. Most titanium on Earth is stored within insoluble minerals, so it is unlikely to be a part of any biological system in spite of being potentially biologically active.

Zirconium plays no known role in any biological system, but is common in biological systems. Certain antiperspirant products use Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly to block sweat pores in the skin.

Hafnium plays no known role in any biological system, and has low toxicity.

Rutherfordium is synthetic, expensive, and radioactive: the most stable isotopes have half-lives under an hour. Few chemical properties and no biological functions are known.

==Precautions==
Titanium is non-toxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. 

Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5 mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10 mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. 

Only limited data exists on the toxicology of hafnium. Care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.

<text>U.S. Route 50 or U.S. Highway 50 (US 50) is a major east–west route of the U.S. Highway system, stretching from Interstate 80 (I-80) in West Sacramento, California, to Maryland Route 528 (MD 528) in Ocean City, Maryland, on the Atlantic Ocean. Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of I-70 and I-80 and north of I-64 and I-40.

The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the western United States, with the section through Nevada known as &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;. In the Midwest, US 50 heads through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio.

The route continues into the eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed partially limited access road. It crosses the Chesapeake Bay on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and then continues on Maryland’s eastern shore to Ocean City.

Signs at each end give the length as , but the current distance is slightly less due to realignments since that figure was calculated. US 50 passes through a total of 12 states; California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia.

US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada, east to Annapolis, Maryland, along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California, east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to US 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s, replacing US 48; this was reversed in 1964 when I-580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of US 213. US 50 had two split configurations into US 50N and US 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.

===Western U.S.===
US 50 begins as a major freeway at its junction with Interstate 80 in West Sacramento and continues into Sacramento. The portion of US 50 west of and including its interchange with California&#x27;s State Highway 99 in Sacramento is also designated, but not signed as, Interstate 305. The signage along this portion of the highway indicates Business Loop I-80 and a portion of the way (2 miles/3.33 km) as California State Highway 99. From Sacramento, the highway heads eastward as the William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. Memorial Highway, continuing as a freeway to the Gold Country foothills, then following the American River up the Sierra Nevada as a conventional highway, until cresting the Sierras at Echo Summit and descending to Lake Tahoe, where the highway enters Nevada. In Nevada, the highway crosses a series of north–south running mountain ranges that break up the Nevada desert which are called Basin and Range. East of Carson City, the road enters the heart of the Great Basin, passing by few communities and minimal services, giving it the name &quot;Loneliest Road in America&quot; until reaching Utah.

In Utah, US 50 also passes through desolate, remote areas with few inhabitants. After crossing the Confusion Range via Kings Canyon and the House Range, the road traverses the north shore of the endorheic Sevier Lake. In Holden, US 50 shortly overlaps Interstate 15 to cross the Pavant Range. The road begins a much longer overlap with Interstate 70 in Salina crossing the Wasatch Plateau and San Rafael Swell into Colorado. US 50 leaves I-70 upon entering the state and heads southeast through Grand Junction and into the southern part of Colorado. Once there, the road climbs to its highest elevation of over the Rocky Mountains and in Monarch Pass where it crosses the Continental Divide. After descending from the Rockies, US 50 passes by Royal Gorge near Cañon City and serves Pueblo. The route then joins U.S. Route 400 in Granada and follows the Arkansas River into Kansas.

===Midwestern U.S.===
Upon entering Kansas, US 50, concurrent with US 400, runs along the Arkansas River to Dodge City where US 50 splits from US 400 and takes a more northerly course. US 50 continues to traverse the farmlands and small towns of the Great Plains mostly as a straight two-lane road until Emporia where it joins Interstate 35 and splits onto Interstate 435 to bypass the center of the Kansas City Area. In Missouri, US 50 leaves I-435 for Interstate 470 splitting at Lee&#x27;s Summit. US 50 runs as a four-lane divided highway across the Western Plain to Sedalia where it continues as a two-lane road until reaching California, MO about 20 miles west of Jefferson City. The road continues as a four-lane divided highway into Jefferson City where it joins US 63 just south of the Missouri River Bridge. It continues 12 miles east of Jefferson City to the Osage River where US 63 splits off to the south. It then continues as a two-lane road as it traverses the northern sections of the Ozark Highlands east to Union where it begins an overlap with Interstate 44 which goes through Pacific. The routes separate in Sunset Hills where US 50 migrates southeast bypassing St Louis by joining Interstate 255 to cross Mississippi River into Illinois.

In that state, US 50 switches to Interstate 64 before splitting onto its own alignment in eastern O&#x27;Fallon. It heads east through Trenton, Breese, Carlyle crossing the Kaskaskia River, Salem, Flora and Lawrenceville to the Wabash River along a corridor between Interstates 64 and 70. US 50 enters Indiana at the Wabash River, bypassing Vincennes and Washington and passing through Bedford, Seymour, and Versailles. It meets the Ohio River at Aurora, and soon crosses into Ohio, running through downtown Cincinnati via Fort Washington Way (Interstate 71). The route crosses southern Ohio via Hillsboro, Chillicothe, and Athens, joining the four-lane divided Corridor D (State Route 32) west of Athens. It meets the Ohio River around Belpre, and crosses the newer Blennerhassett Island Bridge (previously crossing the Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge) into greater Parkersburg, West Virginia.

===Mid-Atlantic states===

The portion of US 50 from Parkersburg, West Virginia to Winchester, Virginia follows the historic Northwestern Turnpike, which crosses the southern tip of Garrett County, Maryland. From Parkersburg to Interstate 79 east of Clarksburg, US 50 has been upgraded as part of the four-lane divided Corridor D. US 50 is a curving two-lane mountain road, east of Clarksburg through Grafton, a bit of Maryland, and Romney to Winchester. This portion of the road is so curvy that locals claim &quot;you can meet yourself coming.&quot; The land flattens out after the route crosses the Blue Ridge Mountain east of Winchester, and it follows the old Little River Turnpike from Aldie to Fairfax City and the newer Arlington Boulevard to Rosslyn, where it crosses the Washington, D.C. line on the west shore of the Potomac River and joins Interstate 66 on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.

Within the District, US 50 immediately exits the freeway onto Constitution Avenue along the north side of the National Mall and south of the White House. After turning north on 6th Street Northwest, it exits the city to the northeast on New York Avenue. Upon crossing into Maryland, it passes the south end of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and becomes the John Hanson Highway, a freeway to Annapolis. The portion of this highway east of the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) is also designated, but not signed as, Interstate 595, and U.S. Route 301 joins from the south at Bowie. The freeway continues beyond Annapolis as the Blue Star Memorial Highway which crosses the Chesapeake Bay on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and continues to Queenstown. There the Blue Star Memorial Highway continues northeast as US 301, while US 50 turns south, passing through Easton to Cambridge, and then east through Salisbury to Ocean City on the four-lane divided Ocean Gateway. US 50 ends near the Atlantic Ocean shore at Baltimore Avenue (Maryland Route 378 northbound); its westbound beginning is one block to the west, at Philadelphia Avenue (Maryland Route 528 southbound).

==History==
Before the creation of the Interstate Highway System after World War II, US 50 was a major east–west route. Numbered highways in the United States follow a pattern of odd numbers for north–south routes and even numbers for east–west routes, hence the designation of &quot;50&quot; for this route. In the preliminary report, approved by the Joint Board on Interstate Highways in late 1925, US 50 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada to Annapolis, Maryland, passing through Pueblo, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri; Tipton, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Cincinnati, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. The route did not directly replace any auto trail, instead combining portions of many into one continuous route. It followed the historic Northwestern Turnpike across West Virginia, and portions of other historic roads. Major auto trails followed, including the Midland Trail in part of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and parts of Utah and Colorado. The National Old Trails Road (Old Santa Fe Trail) was designated in Kansas and eastern Colorado, and the Lincoln Highway was constructed in Nevada. In most states that had numbered their state highways, US 50 followed only one or two numbers across the state.

One major controversy related to the preliminary route of US 50. The through route had been assigned to the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway&#x27;s Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California.

The gap in Utah was soon bypassed by taking US 50 to the north, crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert with U.S. Route 40 to Salt Lake City, and using long portions of U.S. Route 93 in Nevada and U.S. Route 89 in Utah. U.S. Route 6 was marked along the direct, but still partially unimproved, route in 1937; it was finally paved in 1952, and US 50 was moved to it within a few years. Another straightening was made in 1976, when US 50 in central Utah was moved south onto the new extension of Interstate 70 at the request of the National Highway 50 Federation, a group dedicated to promoting US 50. Among other things, the group has unsuccessfully pushed for an extension of Interstate 70 west along US 50 to California.

The north–south split in Kansas was eliminated in the late 1950s, with the south route—which was to be US 250—becoming part of US 50, and most of US 50N becoming part of a new U.S. Route 56. Another split was located between Athens, Ohio and Ellenboro, West Virginia from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, when US 50 went back to its original southern route; that U.S. Route 50N is now Ohio State Route 550 and part of West Virginia Route 16.

At its west end, US 50 was extended south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and west to the San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580, but remained on maps and signs for several more years. US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three years prior to the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.

<text>Thomas Etholen Selfridge (February 8, 1882 – September 17, 1908) was an American first lieutenant in the U.S. Army and the first person to die in an airplane crash. He was also the first active-duty member of the U.S. military to die in a crash while on duty. He was killed while seated as a passenger in a Wright Flyer, on a demonstration flight piloted by Orville Wright.

==Biography==
Selfridge was born on February 8, 1882, in San Francisco, California. He was the nephew of Rear Admiral Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr., who was the son of another Rear Admiral, Thomas Oliver Selfridge Sr. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1903, and received his commission in the Artillery Corps. He was 31st in a class of 96; Douglas MacArthur was first. In 1907, when the Artillery Corps was separated into the Field Artillery and Coast Artillery Corps, Selfridge was assigned to the 5th Field Artillery Regiment and the following year to the 1st Field Artillery Regiment.

Selfridge was stationed at the Presidio during the great San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906. His unit participated in search and rescue, as well as cleanup operations. In 1907, he was assigned to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps at Fort Myer, Virginia, where he was later instructed in flying a dirigible. He was also the United States government representative to the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), which was chaired by Alexander Graham Bell, and he became its first secretary.

Selfridge took his first flight on December 6, 1907, on Bell&#x27;s tetrahedral kite, the &quot;Cygnet&quot;, made of 3,393 winged cells. It took him in the air above Bras d&#x27;Or Lake in Nova Scotia, Canada, and flew for 7 minutes. This was the first recorded passenger flight of any heavier-than-air craft in Canada. He also flew a craft built by a Canadian engineer, Frederick W. Baldwin, which flew off the ground for a distance of about .
Selfridge designed &quot;Red Wing&quot;, the AEA&#x27;s first powered aircraft. On March 12, 1908, the &quot;Red Wing&quot;, piloted by Frederick W. Baldwin, raced over the frozen surface of Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York, on runners, and managed to fly before crashing. &quot;Red Wing&quot; was destroyed in a crash on its second flight on March 17, 1908, and only the engine could be salvaged.

On May 19, 1908, Selfridge became the first US military officer to pilot a modern aircraft, when he flew solo in AEA&#x27;s newest craft, &quot;White Wing&quot;, traveling on his first attempt and on his second. Between May 19 and August 3, he made several flights at Hammondsport, culminating in a flight of 1 minute and 30 seconds at a height of . The next day, his final solo flight of 50 seconds covered a distance of . Although not fully trained as a pilot, Selfridge was nevertheless the first U.S. military officer to fly any airplane unaccompanied.

In August 1908, Selfridge was one of three pilots trained to fly the Army Dirigible Number One, purchased by the US Army from Thomas Scott Baldwin in July 1908; his training partners were Lieutenants Frank P. Lahm and Benjamin Foulois. The dirigible was scheduled to fly from Fort Omaha, Nebraska, to exhibitions at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia, Missouri, piloted by Foulois and Selfridge.The Army had tentatively agreed, however, to purchase an airplane from the Wright Brothers and had scheduled the acceptance trials in September. Selfridge, with an interest in both heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air ships, obtained an appointment and traveled to Fort Myer, Virginia.

==Death==


In September 1908, Orville Wright visited Fort Myer to demonstrate the 1908 Wright Military Flyer for the US Army Signal Corps division. On September 17, Selfridge arranged to be his passenger, and Wright piloted the craft. On this occasion, the Flyer was carrying more weight than it had ever done before; the combined weight of the two men was about .

The Flyer circled Fort Myer times at a height of . Halfway through the fifth circuit, at 5:14 in the afternoon, the right-hand propeller broke, losing thrust. This set up a vibration, causing the split propeller to hit a guy-wire bracing the rear vertical rudder. The wire tore out of its fastening and shattered the propeller; the rudder swiveled to the horizontal and sent the Flyer into a nose dive. Wright shut off the engine and managed to glide to about , but the craft hit the ground nose-first. Both men were thrown forward against the remaining wires, and Selfridge struck one of the wooden uprights of the framework, fracturing the base of his skull. He underwent neurosurgery, but died three hours later without regaining consciousness. Wright suffered severe injuries, including a broken left femur, several broken ribs, and a damaged hip, and was hospitalized for seven weeks.

Orville Wright later described the fatal accident in a letter to his brother, Wilbur Wright:

Two photographs taken of the Flyer just prior to the flight show that Selfridge was not wearing any headgear, while Wright was only wearing a cap. Following the crash, due to speculation that Selfridge would have survived had he worn headgear, first pilots of the US Army were instructed to wear large heavy headgear reminiscent of early football helmets.

Thomas Selfridge was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Section 3 Gravesite 2158, adjacent to Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.

==Legacy==

Selfridge Air National Guard Base is named after him. The base is located in Harrison Township, Michigan, near Mt. Clemens, 22 miles from downtown Detroit, Michigan (from the US Port of Entry at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel).

Though buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Selfridge is memorialized by a large cenotaph in Section XXXIV of West Point Cemetery.

The damaged propeller of the Wright Flyer wrecked at Fort Myer can be viewed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.

In 1965, Selfridge was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. 

A gate between Arlington National Cemetery and Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, located roughly halfway between the two chapels on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, is named Selfridge Gate, in his honor.

<doc id="437861" wikidata="Q14068679" url="?curid=437861" title="Atomic spectroscopy">
<text>In physics, atomic spectroscopy is the study of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by atoms. Since unique elements have unique emission spectra, atomic spectroscopy is applied for determination of elemental compositions. It can be divided by atomization source or by the type of spectroscopy used. In the latter case, the main division is between optical and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex. This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail. Because optical spectroscopy is often less expensive and has performance adequate for many tasks, it is far more common. Atomic absorption spectrometers are one of the most commonly sold and used analytical devices.

==Atomic spectroscopy ==
Electrons exist in energy levels (i.e. atomic orbitals) within an atom. Atomic orbitals are quantized, meaning they exist as defined values instead of being continuous (see: atomic orbitals). Electrons may move between orbitals, but in doing so they must absorb or emit energy equal to the energy difference between their atom&#x27;s specific quantized orbital energy levels. In optical spectroscopy, energy absorbed to move an electron to a higher energy level (higher orbital) and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is absorbed or emitted in the form of photons (light particles). Because each element has a unique number of electrons, an atom will absorb/release energy in a pattern unique to its elemental identity (e.g. Ca, Na, etc.) and thus will absorb/emit photons in a correspondingly unique pattern. The type of atoms present in a sample, or the amount of atoms present in a sample can be deduced from measuring these changes in light wavelength and light intensity.

Atomic spectroscopy is further divided into atomic absorption spectroscopy and atomic emission spectroscopy. In atomic absorption spectroscopy, light of a predetermined wavelength is passed through a collection of atoms. If the wavelength of the source light has energy corresponding to the energy difference between two energy levels in the atoms, a portion of the light will be absorbed. The difference between the intensity of the light emitted from the source (e.g., lamp) and the light collected by the detector yields an absorbance value. This absorbance value can then be used to determine the concentration of a given element (or atoms) within the sample. The relationship between the concentration of atoms, the distance the light travels through the collection of atoms, and the portion of the light absorbed is given by the Beer–Lambert law. In atomic emission spectroscopy, the intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms.

==Ion and atom sources==
Sources can be adapted in many ways, but the lists below give the general uses of a number of sources. Of these, flames are the most common due to their low cost and their simplicity. Although significantly less common, inductively-coupled plasmas, especially when used with mass spectrometers, are recognized for their outstanding analytical performance and their versatility.

For all atomic spectroscopy, a sample must be vaporized and atomized. For atomic mass spectrometry, a sample must also be ionized. Vaporization, atomization, and ionization are often, but not always, accomplished with a single source. Alternatively, one source may be used to vaporize a sample while another is used to atomize (and possibly ionize). An example of this is laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, where a laser is used to vaporize a solid sample and an inductively-coupled plasma is used to atomize the vapor.

With the exception of flames and graphite furnaces, which are most commonly used for atomic absorption spectroscopy, most sources are used for atomic emission spectroscopy.

Liquid-sampling sources include flames and sparks (atom source), inductively-coupled plasma (atom and ion source), graphite furnace (atom source), microwave plasma (atom and ion source), and direct-current plasma (atom and ion source). Solid-sampling sources include lasers (atom and vapor source), glow discharge (atom and ion source), arc (atom and ion source), spark (atom and ion source), and graphite furnace (atom and vapor source). Gas-sampling sources include flame (atom source), inductively-coupled plasma (atom and ion source), microwave plasma (atom and ion source), direct-current plasma (atom and ion source), and glow discharge (atom and ion source).

==Selection Rules==

For any given atom, there are quantum numbers that can specify the wavefunction of that atom. Using the hydrogen atom as an example, four quantum numbers are required to fully describe the state of the system. Quantum numbers that are eigenvalues of the operators that commute with the wavefunction to describe physical aspects of the system, and are called “good” numbers because of this. Once good quantum numbers have been found for a given atomic transition, the selection rules determine what changes in quantum numbers are allowed.

The electric dipole (E1) transition of a hydrogen atom can be described with the quantum numbers &quot;l&quot; (orbital angular momentum quantum number), &quot;ml&quot; (magnetic quantum number), &quot;ms&quot; (electron spin quantum number), and &quot;n&quot; (principal quantum number). When evaluating the effect of the electric dipole moment operator &quot;μ&quot; on the wavefunction of the system, we see that all values of the eigenvalue are 0, except for when the changes in the quantum numbers follow a specific pattern.

formula_1

For example in the E1 transition, unless Δ &quot;l&quot; = ± 1, Δ &quot;ml&quot; = 0 or ± 1, Δ &quot;ms&quot; = 0, and Δ &quot;n&quot; = any integer, the equation above will yield a value equal to zero and the transition would be known as a “forbidden transition”. For example, this would occur for certain cases like when Δ &quot;l&quot; = 2. In this case, the transition would not be allowed and therefore would be much weaker than an allowed transition. These specific values for the changes in quantum numbers are known as the selection rules for the allowed transitions and are shown for common transitions in the table below:

<doc id="437868" wikidata="Q30103" url="?curid=437868" title="Minority group">
<text>The term &quot;minority group&quot; has different usages, depending on the context. According to its common usage, the term minority group can simply be understood in terms of demographic sizes within a population: i.e. a group in society with the least number of individuals, or less than half, is a &quot;minority&quot;. Usually a minority group is disempowered relative to the majority, and that characteristic lends itself to different applications of the term minority. 

In terms of sociology, economics, and politics, a demographic that takes up the smallest fraction of the population is not necessarily labelled the &quot;minority&quot; if it wields dominant power. In the academic context, the terms &quot;minority&quot; and &quot;majority&quot; are used in terms of hierarchical power structures. For example, in South Africa, during Apartheid, white Europeans held virtually all social, economic, and political power over black Africans. For this reason, black Africans are the &quot;minority group&quot;, despite the fact that they outnumber white Europeans in South Africa. This is why academics more frequently use the term &quot;minority group&quot; to refer to a category of people who experience relative disadvantage, as compared to members of a dominant social group. To address this ambiguity, Harris Mylonas has proposed the term &quot;non-core group&quot;, instead of &quot;minority group&quot;, to refer to any aggregation of individuals that is perceived as an unassimilated ethnic group (on a linguistic, religious, physical, or ideological basis) by the ruling political elite of a country&quot; and reserves the term &#x27;minority&#x27; only for groups that have been granted minority rights by their state of residence.

Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: ethnicity (ethnic minority), race (racial minority), religion (religious minority), sexual orientation (sexual minority), or disability. The framework of intersectionality can be used to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority). Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others. 

The term &quot;minority group&quot; often occurs within the discourse of civil rights and collective rights, as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live. Minority group members often face discrimination in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others. While discrimination may be committed by individuals, it may also occur through structural inequalities, in which rights and opportunities are not equally accessible to all. Those in favour of minority rights often pursue laws designed to protect minority groups from discrimination and afford members of the minority group equal social status and legal protections as held by members of the dominant group.

== Definitions ==
Prior to the Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920), the term &quot;minority&quot; primarily referred to political parties in national legislatures, not ethnic, national, linguistic or religious groups. Such minority parties were powerless relative to the majority (or plurality) political group. The Paris Conference has been attributed with coining the concept of minority rights and bringing prominence to it. The League of Nations Minorities Commission defined minority in 1919 as &quot;nationals belonging to racial, religious, or linguistic minorities&quot;. Protection of minority groups, such as through careful drawing of boundaries of states and proportional representation, was seen as integral in preventing causes of future wars.

=== Sociological ===
Louis Wirth defined a minority group as &quot;a group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination&quot;. The definition includes both objective and subjective criteria: membership of a minority group is objectively ascribed by society, based on an individual&#x27;s physical or behavioral characteristics; it is also subjectively applied by its members, who may use their status as the basis of group identity or solidarity. Thus, minority group status is categorical: an individual who exhibits the physical or behavioral characteristics of a given minority group is accorded the status of that group and is subject to the same treatment as other members of that group.

Joe Feagin, states that a minority group has five characteristics: (1) suffering discrimination and subordination, (2) physical and/or cultural traits that set them apart, and which are disapproved by the dominant group, (3) a shared sense of collective identity and common burdens, (4) socially shared rules about who belongs and who does not determine minority status, and (5) tendency to marry within the group.

==== Criticisms ====
There is a controversy with the use of the word minority, as it has a generic and an academic usage. Common usage of the term indicates a statistical minority; however, academics refer to power differences among groups rather than differences in population size among groups.

The above criticism is based on the idea that a group can be considered a minority even if it includes such a large number of people that it is numerically not a minority in society.

Some sociologists have criticized the concept of &quot;minority/majority&quot;, arguing this language excludes or neglects changing or unstable cultural identities, as well as cultural affiliations across national boundaries. As such, the term historically excluded groups (HEGs) is often similarly used to highlight the role of historical oppression and domination, and how this results in the under-representation of particular groups in various areas of social life.

=== Political ===
The term national minority is often used to discuss minority groups in international and national politics. All countries contain some degree of racial, ethnic, or linguistic diversity. In addition, minorities may also be immigrant, indigenous or landless nomadic communities. This often results in variations in language, culture, beliefs, practices, that set some groups apart from the dominant group. As these differences are usually perceived negatively, this results in loss of social and political power for members of minority groups.

There is no legal definition of national minorities in international law, though protection of minority groups is outlined by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. International criminal law can protect the rights of racial or ethnic minorities in several ways. The right to self-determination is a key issue. The Council of Europe regulates minority rights in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.

In some places, subordinate ethnic groups may constitute a numerical majority, such as Blacks in South Africa under apartheid. In the United States, for example, non-Hispanic Whites constitute the majority (58.4%) and all other racial and ethnic groups (Central and South Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, American Indian, and Native Hawaiians) are classified as &quot;minorities&quot;. If the non-Hispanic White population falls below 50% the group will only be the &quot;plurality&quot;, not the majority.

== Examples==
===Racial and ethnic minorities===
Racial minorities, sometimes referred to synonymously as people of color or non-white people, are minority groups that are discriminated against on the basis of race. Though definitions vary cross-culturally, modern racism is primarily based on the European and American classifications of race that developed during the Age of Exploration, as European countries sought to categorize the nations they colonized into pseudo-scientific phenotypical groups. In the United States&#x27;s system, whiteness is at the top of a hierarchy that automatically classifies mixed-race individuals as their subordinate race.

Sometimes, racist policies explicitly codified pseudo-scientific definitions of race: such as the United States&#x27; one-drop rule and blood quantum laws, South Africa&#x27;s apartheid, and Nazi Germany Nuremberg race laws. Other times, race has been a matter of self-identification, with de facto racist policies implemented. In addition to governmental policy, racism may persist as social prejudice and discrimination.

There are also social groups that are usually identified through ethnicity. Like race, ethnicity is largely determined hereditarily. However, it can also be influenced by factors such as adoption, cultural assimilation, religious conversion, and language shift. As race and ethnicity often overlap, many ethnic minorities are also racial minorities. However, this is not always the case, and some people are ethnic minorities while also being classified as white, such as some Jews, Roma, and Sámi. In some cases, their ethnic identities have been seen as negating their whiteness, in both inter- and intra-group identification. 

In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, there is a preference to categorise people by ethnicity instead of race. Ethnicity encompasses a mix of &quot;long shared cultural experiences, religious practices, traditions, ancestry, language, dialect or national origins&quot;. The United Kingdom considers everyone but white British people to be an ethnic minority, including other white Europeans such as White Irish people (excluding in Northern Ireland).

=== National minorities ===
A national minority is a social group within a state that differs from the majority and/or dominant population in terms of ethnicity, language, culture, or religion, but also it also tends to have a close link with a specific territory from which the minority social group originates.

=== Involuntary minorities ===
Also known as &quot;castelike minorities&quot;, involuntary minorities are a term for people who were originally brought into any society against their will. In the United States, for instance, it includes but is not limited to Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans, African Americans, and in the 1800s, native-born Hispanics.

=== Voluntary minorities ===
Immigrants take on minority status in their new country, usually in hopes of a better future economically, educationally, and politically than in their homeland. Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities. Adapting to a very different culture and language makes difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country. Voluntary immigrants do not experience a sense of divided identity as much as involuntary minorities and are often rich in social capital because of their educational ambitions. Major immigrant groups in the United States include Mexicans, Central and South Americans, Cubans, Africans, East Asians, and South Asians.

=== Gender and sexuality minorities ===

The term sexual minority is frequently used by public health researchers to recognize a wide variety of individuals who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, including those who do not identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of gender variant people, such as intersex people, transgender people, or non-binary individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ+ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.

Though lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people have existed throughout human history, they represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ+ people. LGBTQ+ rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ+ people as members of a minority group. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.

=== Disabled people ===
Leading up to the Human Rights Act 1998 in the UK, a rise in the awareness relating to how disabled people were being treated began. Many started to believe that they were being denied basic human rights. This act had a section that stated if authorities did not protect people with learning disabilities from others&#x27; actions, such as harm or neglect, then they could be prosecuted.

The disability rights movement has contributed to an understanding of disabled people as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize the difference in physical or psychological functioning rather than inferiority. For example, some autistic people argue for acceptance of neurodiversity, much as opponents of racism argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The deaf community is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some deaf people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions designed to cater to the dominant group. (&quot;See the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&quot;.)

=== Religious minorities ===

People belonging to religious minorities have a faith that is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the West that people should have the freedom to choose their religion, including the right to convert from one religion to another, or not to have any religion (atheism and/or agnosticism). However, in many countries, this freedom is constricted. In Egypt, a new system of identity cards requires all citizens to state their religion—and the only choices are Islam, Christianity, or Judaism (See Egyptian identification card controversy).

=== Women as a disadvantaged group ===
In most societies, numbers of men and women are roughly equal. Though women are not considered to be a minority, the status of women, as a subordinate group, has led to many social scientists to refer to them as a disadvantaged group. Though women&#x27;s legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women often experience social inequalities, relative to men, in various societies. Women are sometimes denied access to education and access to the same opportunities as men, especially in under-developed countries.

== Law and government ==
In the politics of some countries, a &quot;minority&quot; is an ethnic group recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized minority language, for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions for minorities include Canada, China, Ethiopia, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Croatia, and the United Kingdom.

The various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check &quot;Other&quot; on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group.

Many contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for race and ethnicity on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. Spain does not divide its nationals by ethnic group or national minorities, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages, that is one of the criteria for to determine a national minority, upon the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.

Some especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina). However, other minorities such as Roma and Jews, are officially labelled &quot;foreign&quot; and are excluded from many of these protections. For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.

There is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One view is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European nation-state model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to separatism or supremacism. In Canada, some feel that the failure of the dominant English-speaking majority to integrate French Canadians has provoked Quebec separatism.

Others assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalized: for example, bilingual education may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.

<text>Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou (; born 14 February 1967) is a Greek Cypriot entrepreneur. Born into a wealthy ship-owning family, he is best known for founding the low-cost airline easyJet and the Stelmar shipping line with start-up funds provided by his father, Loucas. EasyJet&#x27;s foundation in 1995 marked the beginning of a series of ventures marketed under the &quot;easy&quot; brand, managed by easyGroup and chaired by Haji-Ioannou.

== Early life ==

Stelios Haji-Ioannou was born in Athens, Kingdom of Greece on 14 February 1967, the second of three children of Nedi (née Potsos) and Loucas Haji-Ioannou. He has an elder brother, Polys, and a younger sister, Clelia. Both of his siblings have a large stake in easyJet. His father&#x27;s family originates from the village of Pedoulas high in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, while his mother is from the village of Laneia at the foot of the mountains. After his secondary education in Athens, he studied economics at the London School of Economics, graduating with a BSc in 1987. He went on to obtain an MSc in Shipping, Trade &amp; Finance from Bayes Business School. He was later awarded four honorary doctorates from Bayes Business School, Liverpool John Moores University, Newcastle Business School, and Cranfield University.

== Early career ==

A self-labelled &quot;serial entrepreneur&quot;, Haji-Ioannou started working in 1988 for his father&#x27;s already successful shipping business, Troodos Shipping Co Ltd. At 25, Haji-Ioannou received £30 million from his father, that he used to set up his own shipping company, Stelmar Shipping. Haji-Ioannou floated the company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. In 2005, Stelmar Shipping was sold to the OSG Group for approximately $1.3 billion.

== MT Haven shipping accident ==

In April 1991, a Troodos-owned VLCC oil tanker suffered a disaster that resulted in six deaths and spilt about 50,000 tons of crude oil into the sea, becoming arguably the Mediterranean&#x27;s worst-ever ecological disaster. The tanker, M/T &quot;Haven&quot;, was an elderly vessel, formerly the &quot;Amoco Haven&quot;, sister ship of the ill-starred &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; that had foundered in 1978. Haji-Ioannou was accused of poor maintenance and charged in Italy with manslaughter, in addition to intimidating and attempting to bribe witnesses. Haji-Ioannou blamed the accident on an error by one of the surviving crew members. He and his father were acquitted by the jury. Subsequent civil demands for compensation were also dismissed by the courts.

== &quot;easy&quot; companies ==

Haji-Ioannou started easyJet in 1995 when he was 28 years old, running a service between Luton and Scotland. In 2000, easyJet PLC was partially floated on the London Stock Exchange. He and his family remain its largest single shareholders (34%) in the airline, capitalised at £4.17bn as of 9 May 2019.

Haji-Ioannou conducts business via his private investment vehicle, the easyGroup, which owns the &#x27;easy&#x27; brand and licenses it to the various &#x27;easy&#x27;-branded ventures, including the airline. Haji-Ioannou continues to extend his business interests, mainly in the field of travel and leisure by encouraging entrepreneurs to adopt the &quot;easy&quot; brand for their companies.

easyJet PLC is one of Europe&#x27;s largest airlines with a fleet of 323 aircraft carrying over 88.5m passengers annually (2018 figures).

Other travel/leisure-related businesses include:

* easyCar, which offers a peer-to-peer car sharing scheme as well as low cost car rental in 2,000 locations globally
* easyBus, which offers low cost bus transportation between London/Paris/Geneva airports and their respective city centres
* easyHotel, which offers low cost accommodation in city centres across Europe
* easyFoodstore was a concept that was trialled with a view to offering discounted, &quot;white-label&quot; groceries to low-income and benefit dependent groups. As of late 2021, its only location has closed.
* easyGym which offers low cost, no-contract gym memberships at 16 locations in the UK and five in France, while looking to expand further inside the EU.
* easyProperty which offers an online service to homeowners and prospective buyers as well landlords and tenants.
* easyCruise was a low-cost cruise line started in 2004. It was sold in August 2009 to Greek ferry operator Hellenic Seaways for £9 million and ran until it went defunct in 2010.
* easyCoffee owns a number of self-service coffee machines including a cafe in Central London.
* easyStorage offers low cost storage, some times referred to Self Storage. Customers pay a sensible margin for storage and then pay for all the extras as they need them. These would be packing materials, packing, insurance, as well as collection and deliver
* EasyInternetcafé a chain of internet cafés

== Fastjet ==

In September 2011 it was reported that Haji-Ioannou was working on Fastjet, a new low-cost airline serving routes within Africa, as part of a joint venture with Lonrho plc. The airline started operations on 29 November 2012 with Airbus A319 aircraft.

== Battle with Ryanair ==

In 2009, Haji-Ioannou brought proceedings in London&#x27;s High Court over Ryanair adverts which appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and on Ryanair&#x27;s website in January and February. The adverts featured a picture of Haji-Ioannou in the style of Pinocchio and referred to him as &quot;easyJet&#x27;s Mr Late Again&quot;. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Haji-Ioannou receiving an official apology from the airline and the sum of £50,100, which Haji-Ioannou announced he would donate to his philanthropic foundation.

== Disagreement with EasyJet ==

In 2010, Haji-Ioannou left the board of EasyJet, in order to attempt to force the management of the company to abort their expansion plans.

In an interview with &quot;Management Today&quot;, he said: &#x27;EasyJet is seen as a huge success, which I&#x27;m happy about, because I own the brand. But easyJet is a publicly listed company. The share price has gone up and down as it&#x27;s got bigger and things have happened – but overall, really it&#x27;s gone sideways.&#x27;

He then went on to say: &#x27;Basically, it&#x27;s created no shareholder value for 10 years.&#x27;

In 2013, Haji-Ioannou said he had become &quot;increasingly concerned&quot; at easyJet&#x27;s expansion plans. He announced that he sold 200,000 easyJet shares in protest against plans to buy more planes, while his siblings have done the same with their shares.

In April 2020, Haji-Ioannou publicly called for the removal of EasyJet PLC CEO Johan Lundgren and chairman John Barton over what he describes as a &quot;deliberate mistake&quot; in not terminating a £4.5 billion order for 107 planes from Airbus.

==Personal life==

Haji-Ioannou has lived in Monaco since his family moved there when he was a teenager.

In the 2006 Birthday Honours, Haji-Ioannou received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for &quot;services to entrepreneurship&quot;.

Haji-Ioannou was a member of the New Enterprise Council, a group set up to advise the Conservative Party on business policy. He stated at the time that this appointment did not reflect his political affiliations, adding, &quot;I agreed to be included in the group of entrepreneurs because I was assured it will be non-partisan. [There is] not much difference between left and right any more.&quot;

In an April 2010 letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Haji-Ioannou joined 23 other UK business leaders, including Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s Stuart Rose and Next&#x27;s Simon Wolfson, criticising the Brown government&#x27;s plans to raise National Insurance contribution rates.

The character of Omar Baba in the BBC comedy series &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; is reportedly based on Haji-Ioannou.

In 2018, he filed an infringement claim against Netflix over their series &quot;Easy&quot; in a UK court, saying that use of the name breaches the Easy Group&#x27;s European trademarks.

== Charity ==

His charitable foundation, the Stelios Philanthropic Foundation, supports education, as well as entrepreneurial and environmental initiatives through the provision of funding and advice in the UK, Greece and Cyprus. It also sponsors annual awards with cash prizes to entrepreneurs in the UK, Greece and Cyprus.

<doc id="437878" wikidata="Q1853349" url="?curid=437878" title="Borough of Melton">
<text>Melton is a local government district with borough status in north-eastern Leicestershire, England. It is named after its only town, Melton Mowbray. The borough also includes numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The north of the district includes part of the Vale of Belvoir. Melton is the least populous district of its type and the fourth least populous district in England overall.

The neighbouring districts are Harborough, Charnwood, Rushcliffe, Newark and Sherwood, South Kesteven and Rutland.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Melton Mowbray Urban District
*Melton and Belvoir Rural District

The new district was named Melton after the area&#x27;s only town, Melton Mowbray. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Melton Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Leicestershire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a joint administration of Labour and most of the independent councillors, led by Labour councillor Pip Allnatt.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Melton. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:

Of the eleven independent councillors, nine sit together as the &quot;Independent Group&quot; which forms the council&#x27;s administration with Labour. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 28 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The borough is part of the Melton and Syston parliamentary constituency.

===Premises===
The council is based at Parkside on Burton Street, adjoining Melton Mowbray railway station. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 2011.

When first created in 1974 the council inherited offices at Egerton Lodge on Wilton Road from Melton Mowbray Urban District Council and at Warwick Lodge on Dalby Road from Melton and Belvoir Rural District Council. In 1986 the council moved to a new building called Council Offices on Nottingham Road. The Nottingham Road building burnt down on 30 May 2008. The northern wing of the building was repaired and is now called Phoenix House, but the rest of the building was beyond repair and was demolished. The council instead chose to build new headquarters at Parkside, spending £5.6m on the new building.

East Midlands Councils is based at the Pera Business Park on Nottingham Road, opposite the former Melton borough offices. The former East Midlands Regional Assembly was based at the same site until it was abolished in 2010.

==Geography==
The district borders South Kesteven, in Lincolnshire, to the east, Rutland to the south, Charnwood to the west (along the A46 Fosse Way), and Rushcliffe and Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire to the north. The north part of the district is known as the Vale of Belvoir.

==Economy==
Farming and food production are the main industries with Pedigree Petfoods in Melton, and its Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition at Waltham on the Wolds. There is a large creamery (Long Clawson Dairy) at Long Clawson. Samworth Brothers are headquartered in Melton. The Royal Army Veterinary Corps and Defence Animal Training Regiment are also in Melton.

The Birmingham to Peterborough Line runs through the borough, and the borough is criss-crossed by the A607 (Leicester-Grantham) and the A606 (Nottingham-Oakham). Both these roads meet in the centre of Melton (outside Melton Brooksby College), with resulting congestion.

==Food==
The borough is the home of Stilton Cheese and Melton Mowbray Pork Pies.
==Media==
The area is served by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central with television signals received from the Waltham transmitter which is situated at Waltham-on-the-Wolds, 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Melton Mowbray. 

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Leicester on 104.9 FM
*Smooth East Midlands on 106.6 FM
*Capital Midlands on 96.2 FM
*Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106 FM
*The Eye, a community based station that serves Melton Mowbray and the Vale of Belvoir on 103 FM

Local newspapers are &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; and &quot;Melton Times&quot;

==Education==
Until September 2008, the district operated the three-tier education system, whereby there were three middle schools. All these schools fed into the same upper school in Melton from 14-18. At both GCSE and A level, the district&#x27;s results are above the England average. From age 16 Students can attend either Melton Vale Post 16 Centre for academic sixth form courses, or Brooksby Melton College for vocational courses.

==Demography==

The Borough of Melton has experienced steady population growth in recent times albeit at a rate lower than the other districts within Leicestershire.

===Highest rate of accidental death in England in 2010/11===
In March 2012, Melton was identified as having the highest rate of accidental death by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, with statistics over the period from 2010/11 showing an average of 29 deaths for 100,000 people.

<text>Blaby () is a town in the Blaby District in central Leicestershire, England, some five miles south of Leicester city centre. At the time of the 2011 census, Blaby had a population of 6,194, falling slightly from 6,240 in 2001. Given Blaby&#x27;s proximity to the city, it is part of the Leicester Urban Area.

Its name likely came from Old Norse. &quot;Blábýr&quot; = &quot;farmstead or village belonging to a man named Blár&quot; (where the &quot;-r&quot; is a case ending). There seems to have been a dense patch of Viking settlement in Leicestershire, although some records in the Blaby Library indicate the origin of the village&#x27;s name was from the first vicar. Blaby is twinned with the village of Villers-sous-Saint-Leu in France.

==Buildings==

While there are few buildings of outstanding historical or architectural interest, old Blaby is a conservation area. Old Blaby contains The Bakers Arms, a thatched public house that dates back to 1485. The other public houses to be found in Blaby are The Fox &amp; Tiger, The Bulls Head and The Black Horse. The Tom Thumb and The Egyptian Queen have been demolished. Blaby is home to three schools: Blaby Stokes CE Primary School, Blaby Thistly Meadow Primary School, and Foxfields Academy.

==Parks==
To the south of the Bakers Arms stands Bouskell Park, with a 19th-century ice house. Other parks include Northfield Park, used for football, cricket, fetes and fairs, and Oakfield Park, located off Hospital Lane.

==Shops==
Most shops and amenities stand on the old A426 road between Leicester to the north and Lutterworth to the south. Fosse Park shopping centre, the M1 motorway, and the M69 motorway are a few miles away.

==Surrounding area==
Blaby gives its name to the Blaby district and previously to the Parliamentary constituency that was held by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson between 1974 and 1992. Blaby is now part of the constituency of South Leicestershire and represented by Alberto Costa of the Conservative Party.

There was a railway station on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line, but it closed in 1968.

The &quot;Blaby Special&quot; heirloom tomato variety originates from the Shoults&#x27; Tomato Farm, which was located in Blaby from circa 1908 until 1948: the variety was thought to be extinct but was revived from a seed bank in 2005.

A new school was incorporated (Blaby Stokes C of E) to absorb the influx of children from families new to the village taking up residence in the new development.

==Sport==

Blaby is home to rugby union side, Leicester Lions, who play at the 2,000 capacity Westleigh Park.

==People associated with Blaby==
*Richard Duke clergyman of the Church of England
*Lord Lawson of Blaby (former MP for Blaby, and also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, under Margaret Thatcher)
*Tom Meighan lead singer with Kasabian (1997-2020)

<text>Tabitha Smith is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with The X-Men and related titles. Created by Jim Shooter and Al Milgrom, the character first appeared in &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #5 (Nov. 1985). She then appeared as a member of X-Force and later as a member of Nextwave.

Tabitha is mentally able to create variably-sized yellow orbs of pure energy that explode with concussive and destructive force. Since her first appearance, she has used a number of different codenames, including Time Bomb, Boom-Boom, Boomer, and Meltdown.

==Publication history==
Created by Jim Shooter and Al Milgrom, the character first appeared in &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #5 (Nov. 1985), in which she and the Beyonder are the primary characters. She next appears as a main character in the 1987 limited series &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. This led to her becoming a supporting character in the &quot;X-Factor&quot; series beginning with issue #11, which then led to a co-star role in the &quot;X-Terminators&quot; limited series. Following this series, she appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, initially guest-starring as a member of the X-Terminators, and eventually becoming a member of the titular group. The team then became X-Force and she remained a member of the team for most of the &quot;X-Force&quot; series. Sometime later, she appears as a member of Nextwave throughout the &quot;Nextwave&quot; series. Writer Warren Ellis said that he picked Boom-Boom to be in Nextwave because Boom-Boom is his favorite superhero name in the history of comics for its sheer oddness and silliness, and he loved it when she was in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; when Joe Madureira was the artist.

Despite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada stated that Nextwave&#x27;s setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity. However, &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; and &quot;Civil War: Battle Damage Report&quot; consistently place Nextwave&#x27;s activities in mainstream continuity. To further complicate matters, Nextwave&#x27;s entry in &quot;Civil War: Battle Damage Report&quot; states: &quot;Recent intelligence suggests some or all Nextwave members unknowingly had their memories and/or personalities altered by their new employers (H.A.T.E.).&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Tabitha Smith was born in Roanoke, Virginia and is depicted as a rebellious but normal teenager, and the daughter of divorced parents, in her first appearance. Her mutant powers manifest at age 13, and her parents immediately show their disgust, with her father even beating her. Running away from home, she gives herself the alias &quot;Time Bomb&quot; and meets the cosmic entity known as the Beyonder. He brings her to Charles Xavier, headmaster of the School for Gifted Youngsters, who ignores her to combat the Beyonder. Before she can commit suicide over this second rejection, the Beyonder stops her, taking her with him on his cosmic trip. The Beyonder confronts the Celestials, and at her behest, returns Tabitha to Earth. She helps the Avengers ambush the Beyonder and leaves the battlefield when she learns that the Beyonder felt betrayed by the actions of &quot;his only friend.&quot; When she was younger, she once unknowingly crossed paths with James Proudstar when they attended the same roadside carnival as children.

===Fallen Angels and X-Terminators===
Living on the streets, Tabitha becomes involved with Maurice &quot;Tiger&quot; Antonini and, after he threatens her and murders her friend Gina, she uses her powers to kill him. Then, the villain known as the Vanisher recruits her for his band of thieves, called the Fallen Angels, and she officially takes on the codename &quot;Boom-Boom.&quot; She eventually betrays the Vanisher, calling in the help of X-Factor, with whom she stays afterward. Tabitha&#x27;s former teammate in the Fallen Angels, the alien Ariel, kidnaps the Angels and takes them to her home where they are experimented on by her planet&#x27;s scientists. Ultimately, she can&#x27;t go through with the plan and helps them escape. The Angels return to Earth and go their separate ways. Tabitha is kidnapped by the Right, an anti-mutant organization. Tabitha, X-Factor, and other mutants regain their freedom.

When X-Factor wards Artie Maddicks and Leech are kidnapped by N&#x27;astirh&#x27;s demons, Tabitha joins her fellow X-Factor trainees in a mission to rescue them. Taking the situation less seriously than the others, Tabitha is quick to pronounce the five of them &quot;the newest super-mutant team in town&quot; and pick out costumes for them all. They adopt the name X-Terminators.

===New Mutants===
Following two successful team-ups with the New Mutants, Tabitha and some members of the X-Terminators, Rusty, Skids, and Rictor, join the group. During her time with the New Mutants, Tabitha falls in love with her teammate, Cannonball. When the team is transported to the mythical realm of Asgard, it is partially through Tabitha that the team is able to foil a plot to kill Odin. There she becomes close friends with the wolf-prince Hrimhari. They encounter the man known as Cable, and when he starts to mentor the team, Tabitha gains greater control of her powers. Tabitha is captured by Stryfe and the Mutant Liberation Front but is rescued.

During &quot;The X-Tinction Agenda&quot; crossover, in which the country of Genosha attacks mutants in the United States, the Genoshan Magistrates kidnap Boom-Boom and her teammates Rictor, Wolfsbane, and Warlock, transporting them to Genosha. The incident receives international coverage, and Tabitha&#x27;s father is interviewed, still voicing his disgust for his daughter. Although stripped of their powers, she and Rictor escape. Warlock does not survive. On the streets of Genosha, Rictor and Tabitha meet Jubilee, and Tabitha and Jubilee&#x27;s similar attitudes clash. They eventually make their way to the Genoshan citadel, where the other X-Teams gather to defeat Cameron Hodge, who orchestrated the entire ordeal. Once returned to the United States, Tabitha spreads the ashes of her friend Warlock over the grave of his best friend Doug Ramsey.

===X-Force===
The New Mutants team, under the continued tutelage of Cable, is reformed into X-Force. The team undergoes a revamp, employing new, more aggressive methods. During this time, Tabitha acts on her crush on Cannonball, and the two have a relationship. Although she questions the team&#x27;s new methods, Tabitha sticks with the team, rechristening herself &quot;Boomer.&quot; She battles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants alongside her new team in one of their early missions.

Following an attempted murder of Professor X, mutual distrust places X-Force in conflict with the X-Men and X-Factor, and X-Force is apprehended. Cannonball arranges for the team to be temporarily released so that they can help take down their arch-enemies, the Mutant Liberation Front. Among the MLF are two of Boomer&#x27;s former X-Terminators and New Mutants teammates, Rusty and Skids, who breaks Boomer&#x27;s jaw. After X-Force&#x27;s names are cleared, Tabitha is confronted by Cannonball&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Lila Cheney, who gives the couple her blessing. Showing how serious he is, Cannonball takes Tabitha along for a vacation on his family&#x27;s farm. During the stay, they are confronted by the Gamesmaster and the Upstarts, and team up with the New Warriors to defeat them.

Eventually, the team&#x27;s headquarters is blown up twice, and without a home, the team moves back into Xavier&#x27;s mansion. Shortly after, Cannonball graduates and becomes an X-Men member, and their relationship waters down. Seeking comfort, Tabitha spends most of her time caring for the lobotomized Sabretooth, also confiding in him. Her teammates attempt an unsuccessful intervention.

Sabretooth reveals that he is faking the ordeal, however, and fully healed, escapes by deceiving Tabitha into destroying his bonds. In his escape, he eviscerates the X-Man Psylocke, who barely survives her wounds.
In an effort to deal with the guilt from this incident, Tabitha travels home to visit her father. The two reconcile, but in a fight with Sebastian Shaw and Holocaust, her father is critically injured. With more guilt on her mind, Tabitha underwent a radical change, renaming herself &quot;Meltdown,&quot; designing a new costume, and gaining better control of her powers along with a more brash and assertive attitude. This new attitude is displayed by Meltdown when she fights the Blob, threatening to kill him, and eventually having two time-bombs explode near his eardrums.

With Cannonball spending his time with the X-Men, Tabitha grows closer to Sunspot and they begin a short-lived fling. Cannonball finds out and is initially angry but reconciles with both his friends, rejoining X-Force in the process. After an incident in which the High Evolutionary shut off all mutant powers, Tabitha and Cannonball come close to rekindling their relationship.

===Peter Wisdom===
In the meantime, the sudden power loss really hit home for Cannonball, as to just how little they had been doing lately to help mutant-kind. He got back in touch with Pete Wisdom, and together they devised a plan for reactivating X-Force as a covert strike team. Meltdown, along with Warpath and Bedlam, agreed to enter into this new arrangement, and they took up residence in an abandoned Nevada Hulkbuster base for extensive retraining for martial combat and the use of their powers. In particular, Tabitha learned how to direct the explosive force of her power into streams of guided energy and was also heavily trained in computer hacking and manipulating digital information. The revamped X-Force fought the shadow wars that other people couldn&#x27;t even see, against the likes of meat-spore storm-troopers, mutagenic bioreactors, and assassins who carried the mutant gene for murder. After she almost lost Sam to that last threat, Meltdown confessed she couldn&#x27;t bear to see him die, and the two of them became lovers again. While most of their missions were successful, they weren&#x27;t without their share of troubles. Wisdom was apparently killed on their first mission back in San Francisco since leaving, and on two separate occasions, their enemies tried to kill them in massive explosions.

The team&#x27;s undercover status turned out to be a weakness, though, for some new organization consisting of mutants that wanted to get rich and famous thought the name was up for grabs. After buying legal rights to use &quot;X-Force&quot; as their name, this group went public and soon became popular. When the original X-Force learned of this, they came out of hiding and confronted the new guys about the name and violating the original concept behind the team, but it was already too late. Apparently, the original X-Force disbanded after this, retreating from their recent hardcore offensive stance on mutant issues. Sam and Tabitha also went their separate ways.

===&quot;Weapon X&quot; and the &quot;X-Force&quot; mini===
When Cable discovers hints regarding the existence of a revamped Weapon X program, one designed to use mutants to hunt down and intern other mutants, he creates an organization to investigate the program and the existence of its internment camp, Neverland. He dubs the organization &quot;the Underground&quot; and invites Meltdown to join his elite group. Ultimately, Cable&#x27;s Underground group is joined by Weapon X agent Brent Jackson, who hopes to stage a coup against the project&#x27;s director and has formed his own resistance group with fellow agents Washout, Marrow, Wild Child, and Sauron. Jackson betrays the Underground team, however, after the coup is successful and alters/wipes their memories of the events.

Sometime thereafter, Cable learns of another threat to mutant-kind, the voracious creatures known as the Skornn, a creature that was going to threaten Earth. He gathers and reunites X-Force to deal with them. Meltdown is among the former members he recruits. While both Cannonball and Sunspot are also involved in the conflict, Tabitha&#x27;s feelings for either weren&#x27;t brought up. However, she reveals to have learned a new trick with her mutant powers when she channeled one of her time bombs through Shatterstar&#x27;s blade straight into the chest of a seemingly unbeatable opponent. After the Skornn was also defeated, some of X-Force remained together, assisting Cable on Providence, an island nation he created. Afterward, she helps them attack the headquarters of the Black Box, though the occupant turns out to be a robot.

Tabitha is one of the few mutants who retain her powers after the events of M-Day.

===&quot;Nextwave&quot;===
Shortly afterward, after an initial period of wild arrogance, Tabitha mellows out and settles back into her earlier more bubbly personality, developing a tendency to use chat room-like shorthand when speaking out loud, such as &quot;OMG,&quot; &quot;ZOMG,&quot; and &quot;OH NOES!&quot; She also begins to start saying &quot;Tick, tick, tick—BOOM!&quot; when using her powers. Tabitha grows her hair long, eschews her codename, and re-appears as a founding member of Nextwave, a new off-beat and more than slightly satirical superhero team featured in an eponymous comic book series created by Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen. The Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation©) formed the team. Tabitha Smith&#x27;s new team includes other second-string characters taken from Marvel limbo, including Monica Rambeau (formerly Captain Marvel, the leader of the Avengers), Elsa Bloodstone, Aaron Stack, and a new character The Captain.

Everything appeared to be fine until Tabitha started nosing around and discovered the marketing strategy of the Beyond Corporation, H.A.T.E.&#x27;s financial backers. Beyond Corp emerged from the former terrorist cell known as S.I.L.E.N.T. and intended to use H.A.T.E. and Nextwave to further its own sinister agendas. Tabitha brought the files she stole to the squad leader, Pulsar, and Nextwave hijacked a Shockwave Rider transport ship and defected from H.A.T.E. Tabitha and the others fought against their former employers, and defended the country from the unusual WMDs unleashed by the Beyond Corporation on the general populace; the first biological weapon was revealed to be Fin Fang Foom, a giant lizard which clambered from underground and proceeded to wreck the building site.

After putting an end to the threat of Fin Fang Foom in Abscess, North Dakota, Nextwave moved on to Illinois. Tabitha manages to subdue Mac Mangel, a corrupt police officer who had been taken as a hostage by the Ultra Samurai Seed. The Ultra Samurai metallic shell disintegrates, leaving Mangel crushed. Upon learning that he was a police officer, Tabitha and Aaron began to beat Mangel before Rambeau intervened, unknowingly handed him to his violent, vengeful victims. The team then go on to purge one of Beyond Corporation broccoli man operatives growing field, fending off H.A.T.E.&#x27;s full frontal attacks and defeating the employed Mindless One&#x27;s trap in Shot Creek, Colorado as well as then spitefully humiliating the contracted employee Rorkannu with a toilet brush.

The team was later attacked by The New Paramounts, a team consisting of &quot;Not Brand Echh&quot; characters including Forbush Man, The Inedible Bulk and Charlie America. Forbush Man attempted to use his mind control powers on Tabitha, but was shocked to find they didn&#x27;t work on her as she apparently has no mind. Tabitha subsequently killed Forbush Man, saving her teammates. When they awoke, she explained &quot;The little guy did something to your heads. I gave him the explodo because I am clever.&quot; Not long after, they eventually exposed and destroyed the true mastermind behind S.I.L.E.N.T. It would be revealed that Beyond Corporation actually kidnapped and brainwashed the team, placing them in this alternate universe for their own indulgence.

===Manifest Destiny===

Tabitha moves to San Francisco to help with the X-Men&#x27;s new relocation plans, and resumes using the codename Boom-Boom. While shopping in San Francisco, she confronts the mutant Nuwa. Forced by the Beast to confront Nuwa through research, instead of strength alone, she discovers - using a thinly veiled parody of MySpace and Facebook called &quot;FaceSpace&quot; - the true nature of Nuwa&#x27;s sedation powers, then nullifies them by consuming large quantities of stimulants, namely the caffeine in an unspecified number of espressos.

===Kidnapping, death and salvation===
Tabitha is later kidnapped, along with Surge and Hellion, by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen attempts to inject her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, a virus that had been cured years before and afflicted mostly mutants, when the members of X-Force arrive to try and save her. After Cyclops refuses to wait long enough for Wolverine and Domino to kill the Leper Queen, they are sent through time to help Cable, leaving the Leper Queen and Tabitha all alone. The Leper Queen reveals to Tabitha that she had intended using X-Force to kill her, since Bastion will not let her commit suicide and that the plan was for Wolverine to kill her and rescue Tabby. The Leper Queen shoots Tabitha between the eyes, saying that X-Force &quot;failed them both.&quot; After X-Force&#x27;s mission in the future is complete, X-23 emerges from the timestream seconds before the Leper Queen is about to kill Tabitha and shoots her in the head. With the Leper Queen dead and Boom-Boom saved, X-23 collapses in exhaustion just as a team of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents storm the building, providing Tabitha with medical care while taking X-23 into custody. The agents are given the order to take a genetic sample from Tabitha and then kill her, but one agent plans to rape her before killing her. She is saved from death yet again by Warpath, who kills the agents before they are able to defile her and takes her to the X-Force safehouse to see if she remembers anything else about her kidnapping.

===Utopia===
Boom-Boom is later seen during the events of &quot;Utopia,&quot; amongst the mutants assembled in Nightcrawler&#x27;s chapel as they all prepare to abandon San Francisco for the base that the X-Club has raised from the bottom of the ocean. She is among the first group of mutants teleported by Pixie to the new base. Boom-Boom was also one of the X-Men who defeated the invading Predator Xs who attacked Utopia. Boom-Boom, Iceman, and Colossus teamed up to defeat the first Predator. She joined fending off Nimrod Sentinels attacks in X-Men: Second Coming.

===&quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;===
Boom-Boom returned in the Marvel NOW! series &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;, aiding her old X-Force teammate Domino in her infiltration of a S.W.O.R.D. base. She remained with the team until its dissolution.

===&quot;All-New X-Men&quot;===
Tabitha later appeared in All-New X-Men as a member of the Utopians alongside Elixir, Karma, Madison Jeffries, Masque, and Random, taking down unwanted visitors such as S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s investigation team as they sought quiet refuge in the island ruins. S.H.I.E.L.D. asked X-Men for help on the issue, and after a brief fight and discussion, both teams came to an agreement and Tabitha&#x27;s crew was relocated to New Charles Xavier School.

===Krakoa===
Now a Krakoan citizen, Tabitha was accidentally caught snooping around in Sunspot&#x27;s room by Armor and was informed of her excursion to extend Krakoa&#x27;s citizenship to Beak&#x27;s family. She was able to rescue Armor and friends from an ambushed cartel hostage situation. She later led an unsanctioned mission to anti-mutant state Carnelia to extract a teen mutant who just awakened her power. It ended up with Cypher needing to bring in reinforcements and Magik bailing everybody out. With so much botched missions Tabitha wondered in her diary if she should move to Brazil to fight monsters instead. She was later recruited for a Breakworld mission by Cable, deliberately wearing her original X-Force costume. She was part of the new X-Terminators along with Jubilee, Dazzler and Wolverine. They teamed up again when vampires were targeting Dazzler&#x27;s fans.

==Powers and abilities==
Tabitha Smith possesses the ability to create variably-sized yellow orbs and spheres of pure plasma, fiery-like energy, which she calls her &quot;time bombs.&quot; These &quot;time bombs&quot; explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized energized &quot;bombs&quot; which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced &quot;time bombs&quot; ranging up to the size of beach balls, which are able to destroy durable objects, including a Predator X and a futuristic Nimrod. Tabitha can also control the amount of time before detonation. Finally, she can mentally muffle the sound of the detonation. Under the direction of Pete Wisdom she learns to focus her power as streams of concussive force.

<text>Fort Myer is the previous name used for a U.S. Army post next to Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, and across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Founded during the American Civil War as Fort Cass and Fort Whipple, the post merged in 2005 with the neighboring Marine Corps installation, Henderson Hall, and is today named Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall.

==History==
In 1861, the land that Fort Myer would eventually occupy was part of the Arlington estate, which Mary Anna Custis Lee, the wife of Robert E. Lee, owned and at which Lee resided when not stationed elsewhere (see Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial). When the Civil War began, the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded from the United States, Lee resigned his commission, and he and his wife left the estate. The United States Government then confiscated the estate and began to use it as a burial ground for Union Army dead (see Arlington National Cemetery), to house freed slaves (Freedmen&#x27;s Village), and for military purposes, including the Civil War defenses of Washington (see Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War).
===Fort Cass===

Shortly after the Union Army&#x27;s rout at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in late July 1861, the Army constructed in August 1861 a lunette (Fort Ramsay) on the future grounds of Fort Myer. One of the first fortifications built on the Arlington Line, the lunette was located at and near the present post&#x27;s Forest Circle. Later renamed to Fort Cass, the lunette had a perimeter of and emplacements for 12 guns.

A May 17, 1864, report from the Union Army&#x27;s Inspector of Artillery (see Union Army artillery organization) noted the following:

&quot;Fort Cass, Maj. N. Shatswell commanding.&quot;–Garrison, two companies First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery—8 commissioned officers, 1 ordnance-sergeant, 220 men. Armament, three 6-pounder field guns (smooth), five 20-pounder Parrotts (rifled), three 24-pounder siege guns (smooth), one 24-pounder F. D. howitzer (smooth), one 24-pounder Coehorn mortar. Magazines, two; dry and in good condition. Ammunition, full supply, well packed and in serviceable condition. Implements, complete and serviceable. Drill in artillery, fair. Drill in infantry, fair. Discipline, fair. Garrison sufficient for the work.

Although the Army abandoned the lunette in 1865 at the end of the Civil War, the United States War Department continued to control its property.

===Fort Whipple===


Following the Union Army&#x27;s defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in August 1862, the Army constructed Fort Whipple on the grounds of the former Arlington estate during the spring of 1863. The fort was located a short distance southeast of Fort Cass. The Army named the fort after Brevet Major General Amiel Weeks Whipple, who died in May 1863 of wounds received during the Battle of Chancellorsville. The fort was considered to be one of the strongest fortifications erected for the defense of Washington during the Civil War. It had a perimeter of 658 yards and places for 43 guns.

The May 17, 1864, report from the Union Army&#x27;s Inspector of Artillery noted the following:&quot;Fort Whipple, Major Rolfe commanding.&quot;–Garrison, three companies First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery– l major, 13 commissioned officers, 1 ordnance-sergeant, 414 men. Armament, six 12-pounder field guns (smooth), four 12-pounder field howitzers (smooth), eight 12-pounder James guns (rifled), eleven 4.5-inch ordnance Magazines, four; two not in a serviceable condition. Ammunition, full supply; good condition. Implements, complete and serviceable. Drill in artillery, fair. Drill in infantry, fair. Discipline, fair. Garrison sufficient; interior work.

The Civil War ended in 1865. Fort Whipple, with its fortifications abandoned, then became the home of the Signal School of Instruction for Army and Navy Officers, established in 1869.

===Fort Myer===
On February 4, 1881, the Army post containing Fort Whipple was renamed Fort Myer as an honor to Brigadier General Albert J. Myer, who had commanded the newly established Signal School of Instruction for Army and Navy Officers from 1869 until he died in August 1880. Since then, the post has been a Signal Corps post, a showcase for the US Army&#x27;s cavalry, and, since the 1940s, home to the Army&#x27;s elite ceremonial units—The United States Army Band (&quot;Pershing&#x27;s Own&quot;) and the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (&quot;The Old Guard&quot;).

The National Weather Service was originated there by General Albert J. Myer in 1870.

Fort Myer was the site of the first flight of an aircraft at a military installation. Several exhibition flights by Orville Wright took place there in 1908. On 17 September 1908 it became the location of the first airplane fatality, as Lt. Thomas Selfridge was killed when on a demonstration flight with Orville, at an altitude of about , a propeller split, sending the aircraft out of control. Selfridge suffered a concussion in the crash and later died, the first person to die in powered fixed-wing aircraft. Orville was badly injured, suffering broken ribs and a leg.

Quarters One on Fort Myer, which was originally built as the garrison commander&#x27;s quarters, has been the home of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army since 1908 when Major General J. Franklin Bell took up residence. It has been the home of every succeeding Chief of Staff, except for General John J. Pershing.

The United States Navy established the nation&#x27;s first radio telecommunications station, NAA, near Fort Myer in 1913. In 1915, the station&#x27;s radio towers, &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, transmitted to Paris the first wireless communication that crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
During World War I, Fort Myer was a staging area for a large number of engineering, artillery, and chemical companies and regiments. The area of Fort Myer now occupied by Andrew Rader Health Clinic and the Commissary were made into a trench-system training grounds where French officers taught the Americans about trench warfare.

General George S. Patton Jr., who was posted at Fort Myer four different times, started the charitable &quot;Society Circus&quot; after World War I. He ultimately was post commander and commanded the 3rd Cavalry Regiment that was stationed at Fort Myer from the 1920s to 1942 when the regiment was sent to Georgia to get mechanized.

In late 2001, troops, deployed in response to the September 11th attacks, were bivouacked at Fort Myer. These troops were under Operation Noble Eagle. These included both active and National Guard Military Police units from around the nation. In 2005 the last remaining deployed responders were demobilized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Responders of the 9/11 attacks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall===

As a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission initiative to create more efficiency of efforts, the Army&#x27;s Fort Myer and the Marines&#x27; Henderson Hall became the first Joint Base in the Department of Defense. Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall (JBMHH) consists of military installations at Fort Myer, Henderson Hall, The Pentagon, and Fort Lesley J. McNair. These installations and departments serve over 150,000 active duty, DoD civilian, and retired military personnel in the region.

==Commemorative==
The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972, for its well-preserved concentration of cavalry facilities and officers&#x27; quarters, and for its importance in military aviation history. On September 1, 1970, the United States Postal Service issued its first day cover of a postcard celebrating the 100th anniversary of Weather Services at Fort Myer.

A pamphlet and one book have been published about Fort Myer. The book, &quot;Images of America: Fort Myer&quot;, contains a copy of a handwritten letter from Abraham Lincoln that appointed General Whipple&#x27;s oldest son to the United States Military Academy at West Point.

<doc id="437887" wikidata="Q758870" url="?curid=437887" title="Audio editing software">
<text>Audio editing software is any software or computer program which allows editing and generating audio data. Audio editing software can be implemented completely or partly as a library, as a computer application, as a web application, or as a loadable kernel module. Wave editors are digital audio editors. There are many sources of software available to perform this function. Most can edit music, apply effects and filters, and adjust stereo channels.

A digital audio workstation (DAW) is software-based and typically comprises multiple software suite components, all accessible through a unified graphical user interface. DAWs are used for recording or producing music, sound effects and more.

== Music software capabilities ==
Audio editing software typically offer the following features:
*The ability to import and export various audio file formats for editing.
*Record audio from one or more inputs and store recordings in the computer&#x27;s memory as digital audio.
*Edit the start time, stop time, and duration of any sound on the audio timeline.
*Fade into or out of a clip (e.g. an S-fade out during applause after a performance), or between clips (e.g. crossfading between takes).
*Mix multiple sound sources/tracks, combine them at various volume levels and pan from channel to channel to one or more output tracks
*Apply simple or advanced effects or filters, including amplification, normalization, limiting, panning, compression, expansion, flanging, reverb, audio noise reduction, and equalization to change the audio.
*Playback sound (often after being mixed) that can be sent to one or more outputs, such as speakers, additional processors, or a recording medium
*Conversion between different audio file formats, or between different sound quality levels.
Typically these tasks can be performed in a manner that is non-linear. Audio editors may process the audio data non-destructively in real-time, or destructively as an &quot;off-line&quot; process, or a hybrid with some real-time effects and some offline effects.

==Plug-ins==
Audio plug-ins are small software programs that can be &quot;plugged in&quot; to use inside the main workstation. Plug-ins are used in DAWs to allow more capabilities when it comes to audio editing. There are several different types of plug-ins. For example, stock plug-ins are the plug-ins that come already installed with a DAW, and Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-ins. Invented by Steinberg, VST plug-ins allow producers to apply simple or advanced effects such as filters, limiting, compression, reverb, flanging, panning, noise reduction, and equalizers.

==MIDI vs. audio==
MIDI (pronounced &quot;middy&quot;) and audio are both compressed digital formats that are used within a Digital Audio Workspace (DAW). MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI is used with plug-ins that allow the user to control the notes of various plug-in instruments. MIDI is universally accepted and if one plug-in or synthesizer is used using MIDI, then it can be modified with another synthesizer. The filename extension of MIDI format is .MIDI or .MID. Unlike MIDI, Digital audio contains a recording of sound. Audio files are a lot larger than MIDI files, and while MIDI is smaller, MIDI can have variations from the original sounds.

==Comparison of destructive and real-time editing==
Destructive editing modifies the data of the original audio file, as opposed to just editing its playback parameters. Destructive editors are also known as &quot;sample editors&quot;. Destructive editing applies edits and processing directly to the audio data, changing the data immediately. If, for example, part of a track is deleted, the deleted audio data is immediately removed from that part of the track.

Real-time editing does not apply changes immediately but applies edits and processing on the fly during playback. If, for example, part of a track is deleted, the deleted audio data is not actually removed from the track, but is hidden and will be skipped on playback.

===Advantages of destructive editing===
*In graphical editors, every change to the audio is usually visible immediately as the visible waveform is updated to match the audio data.
*The number of effects that may be applied is virtually unlimited (though may be limited by disk space available for &quot;undo&quot; data).
*Editing is usually precise down to exact sample intervals.
*Effects may be applied to a precisely specified selected region.
*Mixing down or exporting the edited audio is usually relatively quick as little additional processing is required.

===Limitations of destructive editing===
*Once an effect has been applied, it cannot usually be changed. This is usually mitigated by the ability to &quot;undo&quot; the last performed action. Typically a destructive audio editor will maintain many levels of &quot;undo history&quot; so that multiple actions may be undone in the reverse order that they were applied.
*Edits can only be undone in the reverse order that they were applied (undoing the most recent edit first).

===Advantages of non-destructive (real-time) editing===
*Effects can usually be adjusted during playback, or at any other time.
*Edits may be undone or adjusted at any time in any order.
*Multiple effects and edits may be &#x27;stacked&#x27; so that they are applied to the audio as an effect chain.
*A stack of effects may be changed so that effects are applied in a different order, or effects inserted or removed from the chain.
*Some real-time editors support effect automation so that changes to effect parameters may be programmed to occur at specified times during audio playback.

=== Limitations of non-destructive (real-time) editing ===
*The waveform may not show the effect of processing until the audio has been rendered to another track.
*The number of effects that may be applied is limited by the available processing power of the computer or editing hardware. In some editors, this may be mitigated by rendering to another track.
*It may not be possible to have an effect only on part of a track. Applying a real-time effect to part of a track usually requires that the effect is set to turn on at one point and turn off at another.
*In multi-track editors, if audio is copied or moved from one track to another, the audio in the new track may sound different from how it sounded in the original track as there may be different real-time effects in each track.
*In some applications, mixing down or exporting the edited audio may be slow as all effects and processing need to be applied.

<text>The cotton pygmy goose or cotton teal (Nettapus coromandelianus) is a small perching duck which breeds in Asia, Southeast Asia extending south and east to Queensland where they are sometimes called white-quilled pygmy goose. They are among the smallest waterfowl in the world and are found in small to large waterbodies with good aquatic vegetation. They are usually seen in pairs or larger groups of pairs, roosting and nesting on trees near water. They are strong fliers and are known to disperse widely, especially in winter. Their breeding season coincides with the rains.

== Taxonomy==
The cotton pygmy goose was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the ducks, swans and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas coromandeliana&quot;. Gmelin based his description on &quot;La Sarcelle de Coromandel&quot; that had been described in 1783 by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. Hand-coloured plates had been published separately. The cotton pygmy goose is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Nettapus&quot; that was introduced in 1836 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;nētta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. Members of the genus are sexually dimorphic, with the cotton pygmy goose the only species in which there is a marked difference in the non-breeding plumage of the males. 

Two subspecies are recognized. The nominate form is found in India, Asia extending east to New Guinea. The population in eastern Australia is placed in the subspecies &quot;albipennis&quot; (first described by John Gould in 1842). It is marginally larger in dimensions.

==Description==
Small individuals of this species are the smallest waterfowl on earth, at as little as and . The goose-like bill is short and deep at the base. Males have a dark brown forehead and crown and a blackish green broad collar at the base of the neck. The sides of the head and neck are whitish. The back, wing coverts and scapulars are dark brown with green and purple gloss. The female has a duller cap and a brown line through the eye. The collar is replaced by spots and the face is flecked and neck finely vermiculated unlike the male. The non-breeding or eclipse male resembles the female except that it has the broader white wing band. In flight the male has dark wings with white flight feathers tipped in black. The female has dark wings and a white trailing edge to the secondaries and a few inner primaries. They have a red iris and black legs (greenish in breeding males) and bill. The hind toe is narrowly lobed. The nostril is small and oval and opens close to the base of the commissure of the bill.

Downy chicks have white superciliary stripes that meet at the back of the head which is black. A short dark eye stripe is present on the whitish face. The upperside of the neck is grey. The mantle is grey brown and two white patches are present on the scapulars. The tail is dark grey to black. The underside is buff.


==Distribution and habitat==
This species is widely distributed across Asia, its distribution extending to Australia. Population move in response to rain and water availability. Some populations disperse further in summer (and are found only seasonally, for instance in Afghanistan). Winter dispersal is also wide and individuals have been seen as far west as Arabia, and Jordan and they are regularly found on islands in the region such as the Maldives and the Andamans. They are found especially in lakes and ponds with emergent vegetation amid which they forage. They can be found even in small village ponds in South Asia. In Australia they are found mainly in lagoons. They are said to roost on trees.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Several pairs of the bird may forage in close proximity on a single waterbody. Large flocks form in winter and a flock of nearly 6000 was recorded at Chilka lake. This species feeds mainly at the surface of the water. Stomach analysis showed that they fed on small fishes &quot;Puntius&quot;, &quot;Mystus&quot;, &quot;Oryzias&quot;, molluscs, crustaceans, insect larvae as well as plant matter from species such as &quot;Ipomoea&quot;, &quot;Hydrilla&quot; and &quot;Ruppia&quot;. They do not dive or up-end and take to flight from the water surface without having to run or patter on the surface. They fly swiftly, often low over water, and are agile enough to escape falcons.

===Breeding===
Courtship displays are largely undocumented but a post-copulatory display involves the male arching neck, displaying the white neck feathers and the white wing patches. They pair up during the breeding season which is mainly during the rains (monsoons in June–August India and January to March in Australia) and build their nests mainly in natural tree hollows, such as tree trunks. The males assist in locating nests but incubation is thought to be by the female alone which lays 6 to 12 ivory-colored eggs per clutch. The nest may as high as five metres from the ground and chicks leap off to follow their parents into water. Larger clutches have been recorded and are thought to be due to intraspecific brood-parasitism.

==Predators and parasites==
Rock pythons have been recorded preying on Cotton pygmy goose&quot;.&quot; &quot;Plasmodium circumflexum&quot; was found in their blood of a specimen examined in Bangladesh. Three species of parasitic cestode &quot;Hymenolepis smythi&quot;, &quot;H. fista&quot; and &quot;Retinometra fista&quot; are known from hosts of the species. The trematode &quot;Cyclocoelum&quot; sp. was recorded as a parasite in Queensland. &quot;Paramonostomum thapari&quot; was described from a cotton teal.

== In culture ==
They were hunted with shotguns especially in British India, although they were not considered particularly good eating. Eggs were collected for food and the birds were sold in large numbers in the birds markets of Calcutta in the 19th century. Fishermen in the Sunderbans set up twenty-foot high nets and drove birds on the water toward the nets before alarming them and getting them to fly into the nets. Injured birds were noted to submerge and hide themselves with only the head or bill out of water. In Burma, birds have been recorded nesting within buildings. Sir Harcourt Butler noted a nest at a height of under the eaves of the roof of the residence of the governor in Rangoon. Hume noted that the numbers of migratory ducks sold in the Calcutta markets declined over ten years but not those of the cotton teal. He also noted their tameness, dabbling about within ten yards of a village washerman noisily thrashing clothes.

The Sinhala name of or flower teal is based on the colours and possibly the habitat of lily-covered ponds. Many native names (such as &quot;lerreget-perreget&quot;) are onomatopoeic. The name &quot;cotton teal&quot; was used by Europeans near Bombay who noted that the bird had a lot of white feathers. They produce a low quacky call which has been likened to &quot;quacky duck, quacky duck&quot; or &quot;fixed bayonets&quot; (in British India). Samuel Tickell recorded a Kol name from Singhbum of &quot;Merom-derebet&quot;, merom being a goat and the call likened to a bleat.

<text>Henry Fairfield Osborn, Sr. (August 8, 1857 – November 6, 1935) was an American paleontologist, geologist and eugenics advocate. He was professor of anatomy at Columbia University, president of the American Museum of Natural History for 25 years and a cofounder of the American Eugenics Society. 

Among his significant contributions include naming the dinosaurs &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, his widely used system of names for dental cusps of mammalian teeth, as well as his research on fossil proboscideans (elephants and their extinct relatives).

Active during the eclipse of Darwinism, Osborn was a prominent opponent of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution, favouring the now discredited orthogenesis theory of which he was one of the most prominent advocates. 

Osborn was one of the most well known scientists in the United States during his own lifetime, “second only to Albert Einstein&quot;, and was a prominent public advocate for the existence of evolution. In addition to being an advocate of eugenics, he was a Nordicist, viewing the white race as superior, and supported immigration controls. 

Osborn&#x27;s political connections allowed him to gain significant funding for the American Museum of Natural History, using this to considerably improve the quality of the museums exhibits, which he used to reflect his own views on &quot;racialism, eugenics, and immigration&quot;. 

==Early life and education==
===Family===
Henry Fairfield Osborn was born in Fairfield, Connecticut on August 8, 1857, in a family of distinction. He was the eldest son of shipping magnate and railroad tycoon William Henry Osborn and Virginia Reed (née Sturges) Osborn.

His maternal grandparents were Jonathan Sturges, a prominent New York businessman and arts patron who was a direct descendant of Jonathan Sturges, a U.S. Representative from Connecticut, and Mary Pemberton Cady, a direct descendant of prominent educator Ebenezer Pemberton. His maternal aunt, Amelia Sturges, was the first wife of J. P. Morgan, but died of tuberculosis soon after their wedding.

His younger brother was William Church Osborn, who served as president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and married philanthropist and social reformer Alice Clinton Hoadley Dodge, a daughter of William E. Dodge Jr.

===Education===
From 1873 to 1877, Osborn studied at Princeton University, obtaining a B.A. in geology and archaeology, where he was mentored by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Two years later, Osborn took a special course of study in anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Bellevue Medical School of New York under Dr. William H. Welch, and subsequently studied embryology and comparative anatomy under Thomas Huxley at London, as well as Francis Maitland Balfour at Cambridge University, England.

In 1880, Osborn obtained a doctorate in paleontology from Princeton, becoming a lecturer in biology and professor of comparative anatomy from the same university between 1883 and 1890.

==Career==

In 1891, Osborn was hired by Columbia University as a professor of zoology; simultaneously, he accepted a position at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, where he served as the curator of a newly formed Department of Vertebrate Paleontology.

===Fossil hunting===
As a curator, he assembled a remarkable team of fossil hunters and preparators, including William King Gregory, Roy Chapman Andrews, Barnum Brown, and Charles R. Knight.
Long a member of the US Geological Survey, Osborn became its senior vertebrate paleontologist in 1924. He led many fossil-hunting expeditions into the American Southwest, starting with his first to Colorado and Wyoming in 1877. Osborn conducted research on &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; brains by cutting open fossilized braincases with a diamond saw. (Modern researchers use computed tomography scans and 3D reconstruction software to visualize the interior of dinosaur endocrania without damaging valuable specimens.)

On November 23, 1897, he was elected member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell. Thanks to his considerable family wealth and personal connections, he succeeded Morris K. Jesup as the president of the AMNH&#x27;s Board of Trustees in 1908, serving until 1933, during which time he accumulated one of the finest fossil collections in the world.

Additionally, Osborn served as president of the New York Zoological Society from 1909 to 1925.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1886. He accumulated a number of prizes for his work in paleontology. In 1901, Osborn was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He described and named &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; in 1903, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; in 1905, &quot;Pentaceratops&quot; in 1923, and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in 1924.

In 1929 Osborn was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

===American Museum of Natural History===
His legacy at the American Museum has proved more enduring than his scientific reputation. Edward J. Larson described Osborn as &quot;a first-rate science administrator and a third-rate scientist.&quot; Indeed, Osborn&#x27;s greatest contributions to science ultimately lay in his efforts to popularize it through visual means. At his urging, staff members at the American Museum of Natural History invested new energy in display, and the museum became one of the pre-eminent sites for exhibition in the early twentieth century as a result. The murals, habitat dioramas, and dinosaur mounts executed during his tenure at the museum attracted millions of visitors, and inspired other museums to imitate his innovations. But his decision to invest heavily in exhibition also alienated certain members of the scientific community and angered curators hoping to spend more time on their own research. Additionally, his efforts to imbue the museum&#x27;s exhibits and educational programs with his own racist and eugenist beliefs disturbed many of his contemporaries and have marred his legacy.

=== Research ===
Osborn was a supporter of the &quot;tritubercular (or tri-tubercular) theory&quot; of the evolution of mammalian teeth, originally proposed by Edward Drinker Cope based on fossil tooth morphology, and a rival to the &quot;concrescence theory&quot; proposed by German dentist and physician Carl Röse based on analysis of the development of modern mammal teeth. The tritubercular theory held that the multicusped molar teeth of mammals evolved from single cusped teeth like those found in reptiles, and that a three-cusped (tritubercular) pattern is the ancestral organisation of mammalian molars. The tritubercular theory was criticised by Röse and other contemporary scholars for being incogruent with knowledge obtained from analysis of modern tooth development, and was corrected to fix some issues by later scholars. Osborn&#x27;s system of naming for the cusps and other elements of mammalian teeth has been widely adopted by later scholars.

In 1922, Osborn named &quot;Hesperopithecus&quot; (also known as &quot;Nebraska Man&quot;)&quot;,&quot; a supposed genus of North American ape from Nebraska, based on an isolated tooth. It later turned out to be a junior synonym of &quot;Prosthennops&quot;, a peccary (a group closely related to and resembling pigs), to Osborn&#x27;s considerable embarassment.

Osborn&#x27;s research on proboscideans, the group containing elephants and their extinct relatives has been described as a &quot;modern stimulus and driving force for research&quot; on the group. In particular, his posthumous monograph on the group, published in two volumes in 1936 and 1942, has been called a &quot;landmark of evolution and natural history of the Proboscidea&quot;. While the monograph has been regarded as being a monumental and significant work, later researchers have criticised Osborn for overestimating the number of proboscidean species. His work on North American mammoth taxonomy has been described as introducing considerable taxonomic confusion for arbitrarily naming a neotype specimen for the Columbian mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;) without adequate justification, as well as introducing several mammoth species that are now regarded as synonymous with the Columbian mammoth. Osborn largely failed to take into account the effect of tooth wear on the shape of mammoth teeth, which was a partial cause of the confusion.

=== Public outreach ===
Osborn was one of the most well known scientists in the United States during his own lifetime, “second only to Albert Einstein&quot;, and was the author of a number of books aimed at popular audiences. During the 1920s, Osborn became an outspoken public advocate of evolution against religious critics. During the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial regarding the teaching of human evolution, Osborn wrote a book &quot;The Earth Speaks to Bryan&quot; responding to the lawyer William Jennings Bryan, a critic of evolution and prosecutor on the case (who Osborn had debated in writing for several years prior to the trial), a compilation of speeches defending evolution and suggesting that evolution and religion were compatible.

==Theories==
===Dawn Man Theory===
Osborn developed his own evolutionary theory of human origins called the &quot;Dawn Man Theory&quot;. His theory was founded on the discovery of Piltdown Man (&quot;Eoanthropus&quot;) which was dated to the Late (Upper) Pliocene. Writing before Piltdown was exposed as a hoax, the &quot;Eoanthropus&quot; or &quot;Dawn Man&quot; Osborn maintained sprang from a common ancestor with the ape during the Oligocene period which he believed developed entirely separately during the Miocene (16 million years ago). Therefore, Osborn argued that &quot;all&quot; apes (Simia, following the pre-Darwinian classification of Linnaeus) had evolved entirely parallel to the ancestors of man (homo). Osborn himself wrote:

While believing in common ancestry between man and ape, Osborn denied that this ancestor was ape-like. The common ancestor between man and ape Osborn always maintained was more human than ape. Writing to Arthur Keith in 1927, he remarked &quot;when our Oligocene ancestor is found it will not be an ape, but it will be surprisingly pro-human&quot;. His student William K. Gregory called Osborn&#x27;s idiosyncratic view on man&#x27;s origins as a form of &quot;Parallel Evolution&quot;, but many creationists misinterpreted Osborn, greatly frustrating him, and believed he was asserting humankind had never evolved from a lower life form.

===Evolutionary views===
Osborn was originally a supporter of Edward Drinker Cope&#x27;s neo-Lamarckism, however he later abandoned this view. Osborn became a proponent of organic selection, also known as the Baldwin effect.

Osborn was a believer in orthogenesis; he coined the term &quot;aristogenesis&quot; for his theory. His aristogenesis was based on a &quot;physicochemical approach&quot; to evolution. He believed that aristogenes operate as biomechanisms in the geneplasm of the organism. He also held the view that mutations and natural selection play no creative role in evolution and that aristogenesis was the origin of new novelty. Osborn equated this struggle for evolutionary advancement with the striving for spiritual salvation, thereby combining his biological and spiritual viewpoints.

==Eugenics, racialism and immigration==
Osborn, who cofounded the American Eugenics Society in 1922, advocated that heredity is superior to influences from the environment. As an extension of this, he accepted that distinct races existed with fixed hereditary traits, and was a Nordicist, regarding, the Nordic or Anglo-Saxon &quot;race&quot; to be highest. Osborn therefore supported eugenics to preserve &quot;good&quot; racial stock. Due to this, he endorsed Madison Grant&#x27;s &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;, writing both the second and fourth prefaces of the book, which argued for such views. The book was praised by Adolf Hitler who called the book &#x27;his bible&#x27; for it advocated a rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who, according to the writer&#x27;s opinion, are to be seen as &#x27;weak&#x27; or &#x27;unfit&#x27;. Osborn also advocated for immigration controls.

==Personal life==
In June 1881, Osborn was married to writer Lucretia Thatcher Perry (1858–1930) at the military chapel on Governors Island. She was the daughter of Brigadier General Alexander James Perry and Josephine (Adams) Perry, and a descendant of Justice Christopher Raymond Perry). Lucretia&#x27;s sister, Josephine Adams Perry, was the wife of banker Junius Spencer Morgan II. Thatcher Perry had five children with Osborn, including Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., the naturalist and conservationist.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1894, Osborn inherited his Rhenish style home, Castle Rock, in Garrison, New York in the Hudson Highlands, which his father had purchased in 1859, and where he concentrated on his philanthropy after his 1882 retirement. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1902, the remainder of his parents&#x27; estate was equally divided between Henry and his brother William.

Following an &quot;illness of nearly a year&quot;, his wife died at their country home in August 1930. Osborn died suddenly on November 6, 1935, in his study at Castle Rock, overlooking the Hudson River.

==Eponyms==
The dinosaur &quot;Saurolophus osborni&quot; was named after Osborn by Barnum Brown in 1912.

An African dwarf crocodile, &quot;Osteolaemus osborni&quot;, was named in his honor by Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1919.

Also named in his honor is the early canid genus &quot;Osbornodon&quot;.

<doc id="437905" wikidata="Q7225235" url="?curid=437905" title="Politics of England">
<text>Politics of England forms the major part of the wider politics of the United Kingdom, with England being more populous than all the other countries of the United Kingdom put together. As England is also by far the largest in terms of area and GDP, its relationship to the UK is somewhat different from that of Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The English capital London is also the capital of the UK, and English is the dominant language of the UK (not officially, but &quot;de facto&quot;). Dicey and Morris (p26) list the separate states in the British Islands. &quot;England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark... is a separate country in the sense of the conflict of laws, though not one of them is a State known to public international law.&quot; But this may be varied by statute.

The United Kingdom is one state for the purposes of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882. Great Britain is a single state for the purposes of the Companies Act 1985. Traditionally authors referred to the legal unit of England and Wales as &quot;England&quot; although this usage is becoming politically unacceptable in the last few decades. The Parliament of the United Kingdom is located in London, as is its civil service, HM Treasury and most of the official residences of the monarchy. In addition, the state bank of the UK is known as the &quot;Bank of &quot;England&quot;&quot;.

Though associated with England for some purposes, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey have their own parliaments, and are not part of the United Kingdom, the European Union or England.

Prior to the Union, in 1707, England was ruled by a monarch and the Parliament of England. Since the Union, England has not had its own government.

==History==

=== Pre-Union politics ===


The English Parliament traces its origins to the Anglo-Saxon &quot;&quot;. Hollister argues that:
:In an age lacking precise definitions of constitutional relationships, the deeply ingrained custom that the king governed in consultation with the Witan, implicit in almost every important royal document of the period, makes the Witenagemot one of Anglo-Saxon England&#x27;s fundamental political institutions.

In 1066, William of Normandy brought a feudal system, where he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured the Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which slowly developed into a parliament.

In 1265, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester summoned the first elected Parliament. The franchise in parliamentary elections for county constituencies was uniform throughout the country, extending to all those who owned the freehold of land to an annual rent of 40 shillings (Forty-shilling Freeholders). In the boroughs, the franchise varied across the country; individual boroughs had varying arrangements.

This set the scene for the so-called &quot;Model Parliament&quot; of 1295 adopted by Edward I. By the reign of Edward II, Parliament had been separated into two Houses: one including the nobility and higher clergy, the other including the knights and burgesses, and no law could be made, nor any tax levied, without the consent of both Houses as well as of the Sovereign.

The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535–42 annexed Wales as part of England and brought Welsh representatives to Parliament.

When Elizabeth I was succeeded in 1603 by the Scottish King James VI, (thus becoming James I of England), the countries both came under his rule but each retained its own Parliament. James I&#x27;s successor, Charles I, quarrelled with the English Parliament and, after he provoked the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, their dispute developed into the English Civil War. Charles was executed in 1649 and under Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth of England the House of Lords was abolished, and the House of Commons made subordinate to Cromwell. After Cromwell&#x27;s death, the Restoration of 1660 restored the monarchy and the House of Lords.

Amidst fears of a Roman Catholic succession, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 deposed James II (James VII of Scotland) in favour of the joint rule of Mary II and William III, whose agreement to the English Bill of Rights introduced a constitutional monarchy, though the supremacy of the Crown remained. For the third time, a Convention Parliament, i.e., one not summoned by the king, was required to determine the succession.

===Post-Union politics===

* Treaty of Union agreed by commissioners for each parliament on 22 July 1706.
* Acts of Union 1707, passed by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.
* Act of Union 1800, passed by both the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Once the terms of the Treaty of Union were agreed in 1706, Acts of Union were passed in both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, which created a new Kingdom of Great Britain. The Acts dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new &quot;Parliament of the Kingdom of Great Britain&quot; based in the former home of the English parliament. All the traditions, procedures, and standing orders of the English parliament were retained, as were the incumbent officers, and English members comprised the overwhelming majority of the new body. It was not even considered necessary to hold a new general election. While Scots law and Scottish legislation remained separate, new legislation for both former kingdoms was now dealt with by the new parliament.

After the Hanoverian George I ascended the throne in 1714 through an Act of Parliament, power began to shift from the Sovereign, and by the end of his reign the position of the ministers – who had to rely on Parliament for support – was cemented. Towards the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over Parliament, which was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage, but had ceased to exert direct power: for instance, the last occasion Royal Assent was withheld, was in 1708 by Queen Anne. At general elections the vote was restricted to freeholders and landowners, in constituencies that were out of date, so that in many &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; seats could be bought while major cities remained unrepresented. Reformers and Radicals sought parliamentary reform, but as the Napoleonic Wars developed the government became repressive against dissent and progress toward reform was stalled.

=== European Parliament ===
When the United Kingdom was a member of the European Union, members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom were elected by twelve European constituencies, of which nine were within England, the others being one each covering Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Gibraltar, the only British Overseas Territory that was then part of the European Union, was included in the South West England European Constituency. At the last European Parliamentary election in which the United Kingdom participated, the English European constituencies were

=== Post-devolution politics ===
While Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland voted for devolved legislatures in referendums in 1997 and 1998 (see 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, and 1998 Northern Irish Belfast Agreement referendum) England has never had any referendum for Independence or devolved Assembly/Parliament.

The Scottish Parliament, Senedd and Northern Ireland Assembly were created by the UK parliament along with strong support from the majority of people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and are not independent of the rest of the United Kingdom. However, this gave each country a separate and distinct political identity, leaving England (83% of the UK population) as the only part of the UK directly ruled in nearly all matters by the UK government in London, although London itself is devolved (see below).

While Scotland and Northern Ireland have always had separate legal systems to England (see Scots law and Northern Ireland law), this has not been the case with Wales (see English law, Welsh law and Contemporary Welsh Law). However, laws concerning the Welsh language, and also the Senedd, have created differences between the law in Wales, and the law in England, as they apply in Wales and not in England.

Regarding parliamentary matters, an anomaly called the West Lothian Question had come to the fore as a result of legislative devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland without corresponding legislative devolution for England. Before devolution, for example, purely &#x27;Scottish&#x27; legislation was debated at Westminster in a Scottish Grand Committee composed of just those MPs representing Scottish constituencies.

However, legislation was still subject to a vote of the entire House of Commons and this frequently led to legislation being passed despite the majority of Scottish MPs voting against. (This was especially true during the period of Conservative rule from 1979 to 1997 when the Conservative Party had an overall majority of MPs but only a handful representing Scotland and Wales.) Now that many Scottish matters are dealt with by the Scottish Parliament, the fact that MPs representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can not vote on those issues as they affect Scotland, but can vote on those same issues as they affect England caused some disquiet. In 2015 English votes for English laws was passed by Westminster to solve this by giving English MPs a veto on legislation through Legislative Grand Committees. This system was discontinued in 2021.

The Campaign for an English Parliament is a proponent of a separate English parliament.

==Parliament of the United Kingdom==
The Parliament of the United Kingdom is located at Westminster in London.

===House of Commons===
English members of parliament are elected at the same time as those for the rest of the UK. There are 533 English constituencies. Because of their large number, they form an inbuilt majority in the House of Commons. Even though Clause 81 of the Scotland Act 1998 equalised the English and Scottish electoral quota, and thereby reduced the number of Scottish members in the House of Commons from 72 to 59 MPs. 

There is no English Grand Committee, however there is a Regional Affairs Committee which every English member can attend. For many years an anomaly known as the West Lothian question where MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are able to vote on matters which only affect England only when those same issues are devolved to their own institutions and has become a major issue in recent years. In May 2015 the Conservative Party won an unexpected overall majority and pledged to commit to a manifesto promise to change parliamentary procedures and create a Legislative Grand Committee to give English MPs a much greater role in issues which affect only England (or England and Wales) as a solution to this issue known as &quot;English votes for English laws&quot; (EVEL). On 22 October 2015 following a heated debate in the House of Commons the Conservative Government led by David Cameron by 312 votes to 270 votes approved the proposals which came into effect immediately. The legislative grand committee system was abolished in July 2021.

===House of Lords===
The House of Lords also has an inbuilt English majority.

Members of the House of Lords who sit by virtue of their ecclesiastical offices are known as the Lords Spiritual. Formerly, the Lords Spiritual comprised a majority in the House of Lords, including the Church of England&#x27;s archbishops, diocesan bishops, abbots, and priors. After 1539, however, only the archbishops and bishops continued to attend, for the Dissolution of the Monasteries suppressed the positions of abbot and prior. In 1642, during the English Civil War, the Lords Spiritual were excluded altogether, but they returned under the Clergy Act 1661.

The number of Lords Spiritual was further restricted by the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847, and by later acts. Now, there can be no more than 26 Lords Spiritual in the Lords, but they always include the five most important prelates of the Church: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham, and the Bishop of Winchester. Membership of the House of Lords also extends to the 21 longest-serving other diocesan bishops of the Church of England. The current Lords Spiritual, therefore, represent only the Church of England, although members of other churches and religions are appointed by the Queen as individuals and not &quot;ex officio&quot;.

===Former regional chambers===
After power was to be devolved to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales without a counterweight in England, a series of referendums were planned to establish elected regional assemblies in some of the regions. The first was held in London in 1998 and was passed. The London Assembly and Mayor of London of the Greater London Authority were created in 2000.

A referendum was held in North East England on 4 November 2004 but the proposal for an elected assembly was rejected. Plans to hold further referendums in other regions were then cancelled. The remaining eight Partnership Regional Assemblies were abolished in 2010 as part of a &quot;Sub-National Review of Economic Development and Regeneration&quot; with most of their functions transferring to the relevant Regional Development Agency and to Local Authority Leaders&#x27; Boards.

===Greater London Authority===


Greater London has a certain amount of devolution, with the London Assembly and the directly elected Mayor of London. The Assembly was established on 3 July 2000, after a referendum in which 72% of those voting supported the creation of the Greater London Authority, which included the Assembly along with the Mayor of London. The referendum and establishment were largely contiguous with Scottish and Welsh devolution.

In Greater London, the 32 London borough councils have a status close to that of unitary authorities, but come under the Greater London Authority, which oversees some of the functions performed elsewhere in England by Counties including transport, policing, the fire brigade and also economic development.

The Mayor of London is also referred to as the &quot;London Mayor&quot;, a form which helps to avoid confusion with the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the ancient and now mainly ceremonial role in the City of London. The Mayor of London is mayor of Greater London, which has a population of over 7.5 million while the City of London is only a small part of the modern city centre and has a population of fewer than 10,000.

===Combined Authorities and Metro Mayors===
Localism saw limited return of regional devolution, with devolved powers for combined authorities. The first Combined Authority, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, was formed in 2011.

In 2014 it was announced that a Mayor of Greater Manchester would be created as leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. In 2017 elections were held for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region, the Tees Valley, West of England and the West Midlands as part of the devolution deals allowed by the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016. The delayed election for the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority followed in May 2018. The East Midlands Combined Authority (covering Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire) and the North East Mayoral Combined Authority were established in May 2024.

In September 2024, mayoral combined authorities were approved for Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire with mayors for these authorities expected to be elected in May 2025. Non-mayoral combined authorities were also agreed for Devon and Torbay and Lancashire.

As of October 2024, in addition to the Greater London Authority there are 11 mayoral Combined Authorities in England. There are additional proposals for more combined authorities to be established in the future.

===Mayoral Council for England===

In 2012, prime minister David Cameron had proposed that directly elected mayors sit within a &quot;Cabinet of Mayors&quot; giving them the opportunity to share ideas and represent their regions at national level. The cabinet of mayors would be chaired by the prime minister and would meet at least twice a year. 

In 2022, Labour also proposed a similar body to be known as the &quot;Council of England&quot;, chaired by the prime minister, to bring together combined authority mayors, representatives of local government and other stakeholders. 

In 2024, the new Labour government established a UK-wide Council of the Nations and Regions including the Prime Minister, the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, the First and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Mayor of London and the Mayors of Combined Authorities, and an England only Mayoral Council including ministers from the UK government and Mayors of England&#x27;s Combined Authorities. As the Labour government hopes that combined authorities will be established throughout England, the Mayoral Council would enventually evolve into an all England forum. As of October 2024, 48% of the population and 26% of the land area of England is represented on the Mayoral Council.

== Local government ==


For the purposes of local government, England is divided into as many as four levels of administrative divisions. At some levels, various legislation has created alternative types of administrative division.

Districts in England may also have the status of borough, city or royal borough.

The metropolitan counties were divided into metropolitan districts which are usually called boroughs. When the county councils were abolished the metropolitan districts gained much of their powers and therefore function similar to other unitary authorities.

Shire counties are divided into non-metropolitan districts. Power is shared with the county council, but shared differently from the metropolitan counties when first created.

The civil parish is the most local unit of government in England. Under the legislation that created Greater London, they are not permitted within its boundary. Not all of the rest of England is parished, though the number of parishes and total area parished is growing.

==Political parties==

The Green Party of England and Wales had an amicable split from Scottish counterpart in 1990, and the Wales Green Party section is semi-autonomous.

The Conservative Party adopted a policy of English Votes on English Legislation (EVoEL), to prevent non-English constituency MPs voting on exclusively English legislation. Despite &#x27;One Nation&#x27; Conservativism, some have flirted with devolution factors like the Barnett-Formula.

The Labour Party have devolved sub-parties for Scotland and Wales. Labour tried unsuccessfully to devolve power to the Regions of England, on the basis of England being dis-proportionately large as a single entity within the United Kingdom. Lord Falconer, a Scottish peer claimed a devolved English parliament would dwarf the rest of the United Kingdom.

The Liberal Democrats have nominally separate Scottish, Welsh and English parties.

In spite of seeking independence of the United Kingdom from the European Union, both the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and Reform UK do not support further onward devolution to England, although support scrapping the Barnett formula.

=== Minor political parties ===
Most of the parties that only operate within England alone tend to be purely interested in English issues, like English independence or an English Parliament. Examples include the English Democrats, One England, the English People&#x27;s Party, the English Radical Alliance, the England First Party, and the English Independence Party.

==Church of England==

The Church of England is the officially established Christian church in England. King Charles III is the official head of the church, with the title Supreme Governor of the Church of England, while the Archbishop of Canterbury is the head clergyman. The canon law of the Church of England states, &quot;We acknowledge that the King&#x27;s most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil.&quot; In practice this power is often exercised through Parliament and the Prime Minister.

Of the forty-four diocesan archbishops and bishops in the Church of England, twenty-six are permitted to sit in the House of Lords. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester. The remaining twenty-one seats are filled in order of seniority by consecration. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a Lord Spiritual.

==Monmouthshire==

The historic county of Monmouthshire, lying in the Welsh Marches (the Anglo-Welsh border), is a bone of contention for some English nationalists. Although the county is now mostly in Wales, to add to the confusion, Welsh Bicknor was an exclave of the county, and is in Herefordshire (England). The Welsh Border has historically been more fluid than the Anglo-Scottish border

Monmouthshire&#x27;s Welsh status was ambiguous until relatively recently, with it often thought of as part of England. The entirety of Wales was made part of the Kingdom of England by the Statute of Rhuddlan, but did not adopt the same civil governance system, with the area of Monmouthshire being under the control of Marcher Lords.

The Laws in Wales Act 1535 integrated Wales directly into the English legal system and the &quot;Lordships Marchers within the said Country or Dominion of Wales&quot; were allocated to existing and new shires. Some lordships were annexed to existing counties in England and some were annexed to existing counties in Wales, with the remainder being divided up into new counties. Despite Monmouthshire being a new county, it was given two Knights of the Shire in common with existing counties in England, rather than one as in the counties in Wales.

The relevant section of the Act states that &quot;one Knight shall be chosen and elected to the same Parliaments for every of the Shires of Brecknock, Radnor, Montgomery and Denbigh, and for every other Shire within the said Country of Dominion of Wales&quot;. As Monmouthshire was dealt with separately it cannot be taken to be a shire &quot;within the said Country of Dominion of Wales&quot;. The Laws in Wales Act 1542 specifically enumerates the Welsh counties as twelve in number, excluding Monmouthshire from the count.

The issue was finally clarified in law by the Local Government Act 1972, which provided that &quot;in every act passed on or after 1 April 1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) &quot;Wales&quot;, subject to any alterations of boundaries...&quot; included &quot;the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport&quot;. The name passed onto a district of Gwent between 1974 and 1996, and on 1 April 1996, a local government principal area named Monmouthshire, covering the eastern 60% of the historic county, was created.

However, the issue has not gone completely away, and the English Democrats nominated candidates for the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections in three of six constituencies in the area of the historic county with a view to promoting a referendum on &#x27;Letting Monmouthshire Decide&#x27; whether it wished to be part of Wales or England. The party received between 2.2% and 2.7% of the vote (a much lower total than Plaid Cymru) and failed to have any members elected.

==Berwick-upon-Tweed==

The status of Berwick, north of the River Tweed is controversial, especially amongst Scottish nationalists. Berwick remained a county in its own right until 1885, when it was included in Northumberland for Parliamentary purposes. The Interpretation Act 1978 provides that in legislation passed between 1967 and 1974, &quot;a reference to England includes Berwick upon Tweed and Monmouthshire&quot;.

In 2008, SNP MSP Christine Grahame made calls in the Scottish Parliament for Berwick to become part of Scotland again, saying

:&quot;Even the Berwick-upon-Tweed Borough Council leader, who is a Liberal Democrat, backs the idea and others see the merits of reunification with Scotland.&quot;

However, Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick, said the move would require a massive legal upheaval and is not realistic. However he is contradicted by another member of his party, the Liberal Democrat MSP Jeremy Purvis, who was born and brought up in Berwick. Purvis has asked for the border to be moved &quot;twenty&quot; miles south (i.e., south of the Tweed) to include Berwick borough council rather than just the town, and has said:

:&quot;There&#x27;s a strong feeling that Berwick should be in Scotland, Until recently, I had a gran in Berwick and another in Kelso, and they could see that there were better public services in Scotland. Berwick as a borough council is going to be abolished and it would then be run from Morpeth, more than 30 miles away.&quot;.

According to a poll conducted by a TV company, 60% of residents favoured Berwick rejoining Scotland.

==Cornwall==

Most English people and the UK government regard Cornwall as a county of England, but Cornish nationalists believe that the Duchy of Cornwall has a status deserving greater autonomy. Campaigners including Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party, and all five Cornish Liberal Democrat MPs opposed participation in the South West Regional Assembly alongside Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire in favour of a democratically elected Cornish Assembly.

<text>The 1929 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday, 30 May 1929, and resulted in a hung parliament. Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour Party won the most seats in the House of Commons for the first time despite receiving fewer votes than the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. The Liberal Party, led again by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, regained some of the ground lost in the 1924 general election and held the balance of power. Parliament was dissolved on 10 May.

The election was often referred to as the &quot;Flapper Election&quot;, because it was the first in which women aged 21–29 had the right to vote (owing to the Representation of the People Act 1928). Women over 30, with some property qualifications, had been able to vote since the 1918 general election, but the 1929 vote was the first general election with universal suffrage for adults over 21, which was then the age of majority.

The election was fought against a background of rising unemployment, with the memory of the 1926 general strike still fresh in voters&#x27; minds. By 1929, the Cabinet was being described by many as &quot;old and exhausted&quot;.

The Liberals campaigned on a comprehensive programme of public works under the title &quot;We Can Conquer Unemployment&quot;. There was anticipation of a potential revival of the Liberal Party after the reunification of Independent Liberals and National Liberals now under Lloyd George&#x27;s leadership since 1926 and following some victories in a series of recent by-elections after 1926. The incumbent Conservatives campaigned on the theme of &quot;Safety First&quot;, with Labour campaigning on the theme of &quot;Labour &amp; the Nation&quot;.

This was the first general election to be contested by the newly formed Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru.

It stood as the last time when a third party polled more than one-fifth of the popular vote until 1983. The Liberals performed more successfully than at the previous general election in 1924, but could not regain their pre-World War I status as a party of government.

<text>The 1924 United Kingdom general election was held on Wednesday 29 October 1924, as a result of the defeat of the Labour minority government, led by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, in the House of Commons on a motion of no confidence. It was the third general election to be held in less than two years. Parliament was dissolved on 9 October.

The Conservatives, led by Stanley Baldwin, performed better, in electoral terms, than in the 1923 general election and obtained a large parliamentary majority of 209. Labour, led by MacDonald, lost 40 seats. The election also saw the Liberal Party, led by H. H. Asquith, lose 118 of their 158 seats which helped to polarise British politics between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.

The Conservative landslide victory and the Labour defeat in this general election have been, in part, attributed to the Zinoviev letter, a forged document that was published as if it were genuine and sensationalised in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; four days before the election. The Labour vote increased by around one million in comparison to the 1923 general election, but this was largely due to the party putting up 87 more candidates than it had in the previous election.

The Conservatives had called the previous 1923 election early to get a mandate for moving to a protectionist trade policy of imperial preference, but had lost their majority. In 1924, they reverted to free trade and regained power. They would propose protectionism at the next general election in 1929, again losing.

Along with 1964 and 1992 this is the first of three elections in the 20th Century to take place in the same year as a United States presidential election. This is also the closest instance in which both elections overlapped with the latter’s election taking place a week later.

== Overview ==
After the previous general election, the Labour Party had finished as the second-largest party, but formed their first-ever government with the support of the Liberal Party, after the ruling Conservative Party&#x27;s shock loss of their majority made it untenable for Baldwin to continue as Prime Minister. However, relations between Labour and the Liberals proved stormy, eventually resulting in Liberal M.P. Sir John Simon calling a motion of no confidence in MacDonald&#x27;s government, which was carried by a large majority. Asquith had gambled that neither Baldwin nor MacDonald would want to put the country through a third general election in two years, and that one of them would be forced to enter into a formal coalition with the Liberals. However, the gambit backfired when MacDonald instead called an election, knowing full well that a Conservative landslide was the only likely outcome, but himself gambling that it would be primarily at the expense of the Liberals. MacDonald&#x27;s judgement proved correct, as the Liberals, who were still mostly dependent on former Prime Minister David Lloyd George for funds, ended up financially crippled from the very start of the campaign, while Labour were actually able to expand the scope of their own campaign thanks to increasing support from the workers&#x27; unions.

It is speculated that the combination of Labour forming its first government in January 1924 and the Zinoviev letter helped to stir up anti-socialist fears in Britain among many traditional anti-socialist Liberal voters, who then switched their support to the Conservative Party. This partly helps to explain the poor performance of the Liberal Party in the general election. The party also had financial difficulties which allowed it to contest only 339 seats, a lack of distinctive policies after the Conservative Party dropped their support for protected trade, and poor leadership under Asquith, who lost his own seat for the second time in six years. It would be the final election for Asquith, who was subsequently forced to lead the party from the House of Lords after being elevated to the Earldom of Oxford and Asquith the following year, with Lloyd George as Liberal chairman in the House of Commons. Declining health saw Asquith replaced as party leader by Lloyd George in 1926.

The fourth party in terms of number of candidates, number of seats and number of votes were not a party but a group of former National Liberals standing under the Constitutionalist label, led by Winston Churchill. They favoured Conservative/Liberal co-operation and had intended to formally organize as a party, but the election was called before they had the opportunity to actually do so. Three of the seven Constitutionalists elected, including Churchill, had been opposed by official Liberal candidates, and sat as Conservatives after the election. The other four sat as Liberals.

The refounded Sinn Féin ran Westminster candidates for the first time since March 1919; none came close to winning, with six of the eight losing their deposits. Its next Westminster election was in 1950.
The election was the first in the United Kingdom to feature party political broadcasts, with the parties making short appeals to voters via BBC Radio.

<text>In the United States, FFA competitions are judging contests (otherwise known as Career Development Events) organized by the U.S. National FFA Organization, in which High School students compete based on their knowledge of a particular subject, usually for their school teams. The contests are organized by FFA advisors and local experts. The competitions determine which team and individuals have the best aptitude for evaluating a particular animal or item as compared to an &quot;official&quot;. The official placings and answers are set by an expert in the discipline. Officials are often from agricultural universities or USDA employees.

==Types of competition==
One of the most common types of competition is Livestock judging, in which teams of four students judge a series of classes (usually of four animals each) and rank them based on criteria to choose the most superior animal (e.g. muscling, conformation). In Livestock judging, students only judge cattle, pigs and lambs; classes consist of animals from across the region. An element of the contest is the reasons that students give to justify their choices, delivered in a short persuasive speech in which the contestant explains their evaluation of the animals to an official for a score (0-50).

Another common competition is Horse judging, which is similar to livestock, but for horses. Competitors evaluate the animals based on criteria such as conformation, gait, and muscling, again giving reasons.

Meat judging consists of teams of four students judging pork, beef and lamb, and is based on several contest areas, including class placing (four similar cuts or carcasses of meat evaluated on muscle, fat and bone), identification (correctly identifying the type of cut and where it came from on the animal) and carcass grading (determining the quality and yield grading of a beef carcass).

Each state has statewide competitions each year in which students compete for the state title in each contest area. The state winners can go on to compete in national competitions, some of which are held at the National FFA convention.

Other contest areas include: Agricultural Mechanics, Agronomy, Wool, Land, Homesite, Pasture &amp; Range, Horticulture, Wildlife, Floriculture, Farm Business Management, Landscape Design, Crops, Entomology, Dairy Foods, Poultry Judging, Vet Science, Food Science and Forestry

== In popular culture ==
In the 2004 comedy film, &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, the title character tastes defects in milk while competing in a Dairy Competition.

Although native to an area ranging from France eastward to Ukraine, northern Turkey and the Caucasus, and southward to the mountains of Italy and northern Iberia, the sycamore establishes itself easily from seed and was introduced to the British Isles by 1500. It is now naturalised there and in other parts of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, where it may become an invasive species.

The sycamore can grow to a height of about and the branches form a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey, smooth when young and later flaking in irregular patches. The leaves grow on long leafstalks and are large and palmate, with five large radiating lobes. The flowers are greenish-yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles. They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects. The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and twirl to the ground when ripe. They germinate freely in the following spring.

In its native range, the sycamore is associated with a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an ornamental. It produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and can be processed into a syrup similar to that of the sugar maple. Bees often collect the nectar to make honey.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot; was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. It is the type species in the maple genus &quot;Acer&quot;, which is in the soapberry family Sapindaceae. Many forms and varieties have been proposed, including natural varieties such as var. &quot;macrocarpum&quot; Spach, var. &quot;microcarpum&quot; Spach, and var. &quot;tomentosum&quot; Tausch, and forms such as f. &quot;erythrocarpum&quot; (Carrière) Pax, f. &quot;purpureum&quot; (Loudon) Rehder, and f. &quot;variegatum&quot; (Weston) Rehder. These are all now considered to be synonyms of &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot; L.

The specific name &quot;pseudoplatanus&quot; refers to the superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus &quot;Platanus&quot;, the prefix &quot;pseudo-&quot; (from Ancient Greek) meaning &quot;false&quot;. However, the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related. &quot;Acer&quot; and &quot;Platanus&quot; differ in the position in which leaves are attached to the stem (alternate in &quot;Platanus&quot;, paired or opposite in &quot;Acer&quot;) and in their fruit, which are spherical clusters in &quot;Platanus&quot; and paired samaras (winged fruit) in &quot;Acer&quot;.

The common name &quot;sycamore&quot; was originally applied to the fig species &quot;Ficus sycomorus&quot;, the sycamore or sycomore referred to in the Bible, that is native to Africa and Southwest Asia. Other common names for the tree include false plane-tree, great maple, Scottish maple, mount maple, mock-plane, or Celtic maple.

== Description ==

The sycamore is a large, broad-leaved deciduous tree that reaches tall at maturity, the branches forming a broad, domed crown. The bark of young trees is smooth and grey but becomes rougher with age and breaks up into scales, exposing the pale-brown-to-pinkish inner bark.

The buds are produced in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose and protect the bud) green, edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips, . When the leaves are shed they leave horseshoe-shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem. The leaves are opposite, large, long and broad, palmate with 5 pointed lobes that are coarsely toothed or serrated. They have a leathery texture with thick veins protruding on the underside. They are dark green in colour with a paler underside. Some cultivars have purple-tinged or yellowish leaves. The leaf stalk or petiole is long, is often tinged red with no stipules or leaf-like structures at the base.

The functionally monoecious or dioecious yellow-green flowers are produced after the leaves in early summer, in May or June in the British Isles, on pendulous panicles long with about 60–100 flowers on each stalk. The fruits are paired winged seeds or samaras, the seeds in diameter, each with a wing long developed as an extension of the ovary wall. The wings are held at about right angles to each other, distinguishing them from those of &quot;A. platanoides&quot; and &quot;A. campestre&quot;, in which the wings are almost opposite, and from those of &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, in which they are almost parallel. When shed, the wing of the samara catches the wind and rotates the fruit as it falls, slowing its descent and enabling the wind to disperse it further from the parent tree. The seeds are mature in autumn about four months after pollination.

The sycamore is tetraploid (each cell having four sets of chromosomes, 2n=52), whereas &quot;A. campestre&quot; and &quot;A. platanoides&quot; are diploid (with 2 sets of chromosomes, 2n=26).

== Botany ==
Sycamore trees produce their flowers in hanging branched clusters known as panicles that contain a variety of different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.

Sycamore trees are very variable across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic variation of the progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates in different parts of the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.

The sycamore may hybridise with other species in &quot;Acer&quot; section Acer, including with &quot;A. heldreichii&quot; where their natural ranges overlap and with &quot;A.velutinum&quot;. Intersectional hybrids with &quot;A. griseum&quot; (&quot;Acer&quot; section Trifoliata) are also known, in which the basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size, making the leaves appear almost three-lobed (trifoliate).

== Distribution ==
The sycamore is native to central and eastern Europe and western Asia. Its natural range includes Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, southern Russia, Spain, Switzerland, East Thrace and the former Yugoslavia. Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey have been found to refer to &quot;A. heldreichii&quot; subsp. &quot;trautvetteri&quot;.
It was probably introduced into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first recorded in the wild in 1632 in Kent. The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear, but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century. It was introduced into Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland.

The lack of old native names for it has been used to demonstrate its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, &quot;fior chrann&quot; which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least as far back as the Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.

The sycamore has been introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At the time of its introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom.

In about 1870, the sycamore was introduced into the United States, and was planted in New York state and New Jersey. It was later cultivated as a park or street tree in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. By the early part of the 21st century, it was naturalised in fourteen states (Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C.), and in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Ontario. The United States Department of Agriculture considers it an invasive species.

== Ecology ==
In its native range, the sycamore is a natural component of birch (&quot;Betula&quot; sp.), beech (&quot;Fagus&quot; sp.) and fir (&quot;Abies&quot; sp.) forests. It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations, abandoned farmland and brownfield land, railway lines and roadsides verges, hedgerows, native and semi-natural woodland. In New Zealand, it invades the high country tussock grassland. As an introduced, invasive species, it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare endemic Madeiran orchid, &quot;Dactylorhiza foliosa&quot;.

It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH, except heavy clay, and is at its best on nutrient-rich, slightly calcareous soils. The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial mycorrhizal associations with the fungus &quot;Glomus hoi&quot;, which promotes phosphorus uptake from the soil. Sycamore mycorrhizas are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex.

The larvae of a number of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the sycamore moth (&quot;Acronicta aceris&quot;), the maple prominent (&quot;Ptilodon cucullina&quot;) and the plumed prominent (&quot;Ptilophora plumigera&quot;). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (&quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot;) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.

The tree may also be attacked by the horse chestnut scale insect (&quot;Pulvinaria regalis&quot;), which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.

The sycamore gall mite &quot;Eriophyes macrorhynchus&quot; produces small red galls, similar to those of the nail gall mite &quot;Eriophyes tiliae&quot;, on leaves of sycamore and field maple, &quot;Acer campestris&quot; from April onwards. Another mite, &quot;Aceria pseudoplatani&quot; causes a &#x27;sycamore felt gall&#x27; on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (&quot;Acer platanoides&quot;). The sycamore aphid &quot;Drepanosiphum platanoidis&quot; sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath.

The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus &quot;Cryptostroma corticale&quot;. This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper&#x27;s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus &quot;Rhytisma acerinum&quot; which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus &quot;Cristulariella depraedans&quot;, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.

Fungal species &quot;Coniothyrium ferrarisianum&quot; has also been isolated from leaves of &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot; in Italy in 1958.

== Toxicity ==
Horses eating seeds or emergent seedlings of &quot;A. pseudoplatanus&quot; can suffer from an often fatal condition of atypical myopathy.

== Cultivation ==

Sycamore self-seeds very vigorously, the seeds germinating en masse in the spring so that there is little, or no, seed bank in the soil. It is readily propagated from seed in cultivation, but varieties cannot be relied on to breed true. Special cultivars such as &quot;A. pseudoplatanus&quot; &#x27;Brilliantissimum&#x27; may be propagated by grafting. This variety is notable for the bright salmon-pink colour of the young foliage and is the only sycamore cultivar to have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. A rare weeping form with dangling branches, &quot;A. pseudoplatanus&quot; var. &quot;pendulum&quot;, was first sold by Knight &amp; Perry&#x27;s exotic nursery in Chelsea, England, before 1850 when the name was published by W.H. Baxter in the Supplement to Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Hortus Brittanicus&quot;, but no specimens of this cultivar are known to survive.

The sycamore is noted for its tolerance of wind, urban pollution, salt spray, and low summer temperatures, which makes it a popular tree for planting in cities, along roads treated with salt in winter, and in coastal localities. It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø, Norway (seeds can ripen as far north as Vesterålen); Reykjavík, Iceland; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands. It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been probably introduced in the 16th century.

Sycamores make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can therefore be coppiced to produce poles and other types of small timber. Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly, reaching as much as in length in the first year after initial harvesting.

It is grown as a species for medium-to-large bonsai in many areas of Europe, where some fine specimens can be found.

== Uses ==
Sycamore is planted in parks for ornamental purposes, and sometimes as a street tree, for its tolerance of air pollution makes it suitable for use in urban plantings. Owing to its tolerance to wind, it has often been planted in coastal and exposed areas as a windbreak.

It produces a hard-wearing, white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age. The wood can be worked and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and parquetry. Because it is non-staining, is used for kitchen utensils, wooden spoons, bowls, rolling pins and chopping boards. In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes, sometimes in association with contrasting, dark-coloured laburnum wood.

Occasionally, trees produce wood with a wavy grain, greatly increasing the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630 kg per cubic metre. It is a traditional wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles can be made from straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.

In Scotland, sycamores were once a favoured tree for hangings, because their lower branches rarely broke under the strain. Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar, which makes a fragrant, delicately flavoured and pale-coloured honey. The nectar and copious dull yellow ochre pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources. The sap rises vigorously in the spring and like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink, as a source of sugar and to make syrup or beer.

== Notable specimens ==
=== Tolpuddle Martyrs&#x27; Tree ===
Under this sycamore tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. They were found to have breached the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, which has pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.

=== Corstorphine Sycamore Tree ===
An ancient sycamore (sometimes described as a &quot;plane&quot;) with distinctive yellow foliage formerly stood in the village of Corstorphine, now a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. The tree was reputedly planted in the 15th century and is named as the form &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot; f. &quot;corstorphinense&quot; Schwer. Not only was it claimed to be the &quot;largest sycamore in Scotland&quot; but also the scene of James Lord Forrester&#x27;s murder in 1679. The tree was blown down in a storm on Boxing Day 1998, but a replacement, grown from a cutting, now stands in the churchyard of Corstorphine Kirk. The tree is commemorated in the badge of the Corstorphine Bowling Club of Edinburgh, designed in 1950 to feature the Corstorphine sycamore tree and a single horn, and redesigned in 1991 for the club&#x27;s centenary.

=== Newbattle Abbey sycamore ===
The Newbattle Abbey sycamore near Dalkeith, planted in 1550, was the specimen with the earliest known planting date in Scotland. It had achieved a girth of and a height of by the time it was toppled by a gale in May 2006 at the age of 456 years.

=== Clonenagh Money Tree ===
Saint Fintan founded a monastery at Clonenagh in County Laois, Ireland, in the sixth century and it had a spring beside it. This was considered holy and was visited by pilgrims. In the nineteenth century, a Protestant land owner, annoyed at people visiting the site, filled the well in, whereupon the water started to flow into the hollow interior of a sycamore tree on the other side of the road. Filled with amazement, people hung rags on the tree and pressed coins into its trunk as votive offerings and it became known as the &quot;Money Tree&quot;. Some years later, it fell down, but new shoots appeared from its base, and the water still welled up. It remains a place of veneration on St Fintan&#x27;s day, February 17.

===Sycamore Gap Tree===

The Sycamore Gap Tree or Robin Hood Tree was a sycamore tree standing next to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland, England. It was located in a dramatic dip in the landscape and was a popular photographic subject, described as one of the most photographed trees in the country. It derived its alternative name from featuring in a prominent scene in the 1991 film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;. The tree was a few hundred years old and once stood with others, but they had been removed over time, possibly to improve sightlines or for gamekeeping purposes. It was felled overnight on 28 September 2023; a police investigation was launched the following day.

<text>Acer campestre, known as the field maple, is a flowering plant species in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to much of continental Europe, Britain, southwest Asia from Turkey to the Caucasus, and north Africa in the Atlas Mountains. It has been widely planted, and is introduced outside its native range in Europe and areas of USA and Western Australia with suitable climate.

==Description==
It is a deciduous tree reaching tall, with a trunk up to in diameter, with finely fissured, often somewhat corky bark. The shoots are brown, with dark brown winter buds. The leaves are in opposite pairs, long (including the petiole) and broad, with five blunt, rounded lobes with a smooth margin. Usually monoecious, the flowers are produced in spring at the same time as the leaves open, yellow-green, in erect clusters across, and are insect-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged achenes aligned at 180°, each achene is wide, flat, with a wing.

The two varieties, not accepted as distinct by all authorities, are:
* &quot;Acer campestre&quot; var. &quot;campestre&quot; - downy fruit
* &quot;Acer campestre&quot; var. &quot;leiocarpum&quot; (syn. &quot;A. campestre&quot; subsp. &quot;leiocarpum&quot;) - hairless fruit

The closely related &quot;Acer miyabei&quot; replaces it in eastern Asia.

==Distribution==
The native range of field maple includes much of Europe, including Denmark, Poland and Belarus, England north to southern Scotland (where it is the only native maple), southwest Asia from Turkey to the Caucasus, and north Africa in the Atlas Mountains. In many areas, the original native range is obscured by widespread planting and introductions. In North America it is known as hedge maple and in Australia, it is sometimes called common maple. In Nottinghamshire, England it was known locally as dog oak.

==Ecology==
Field maple is an intermediate species in the ecological succession of disturbed areas; it typically is not among the first trees to colonise a freshly disturbed area, but instead seeds in under the existing vegetation. It is very shade-tolerant during the initial stages of its life, but it has higher light requirements during its seed-bearing years. It exhibits rapid growth initially, but is eventually overtaken and replaced by other trees as the forest matures. It is most commonly found on neutral to alkaline soils, but more rarely on acidic soil.

Diseases include a leaf spot fungus &quot;Didymosporina aceris&quot;, a mildew &quot;Uncinula bicornis&quot;, a canker &quot;Nectria galligena&quot;, and verticillium wilt &quot;Verticillium alboatrum&quot;. The leaves are also sometimes damaged by gall mites in the genus &quot;Aceria&quot;, and the aphid &quot;Periphyllus villosus&quot;.

==Cultivation==
The field maple is widely grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens. The wood is white, hard and strong, and used for furniture, flooring, wood turning and musical instruments, though the small size of the tree and its relatively slow growth make it an unimportant wood. It has an OPALS rating of 7.

It is locally naturalised in parts of the United States and more rarely in New Zealand.
The hybrid maple &quot;Acer&quot; × &quot;zoeschense&quot; has &quot;A. campestre&quot; as one of its parents.

The tree has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Cultivars===
Over 30 cultivars of &quot;Acer campestre&quot; are known, selected for their foliage or habit, or both; several have been lost to cultivation.

==Bonsai==
&quot;Acer campestre&quot; (and the similar &quot;A. monspessulanum&quot;) are popular among &quot;bonsai&quot; enthusiasts. The dwarf cultivar &#x27;Microphyllum&#x27; is especially useful in this regard. &quot;A. campestre&quot; &quot;bonsai&quot; have an appearance distinct from those selected from some other maples such as &quot;A. palmatum&quot; with more frilly, translucent, leaves. The shrubby habit and smallish leaves of &quot;A. campestre&quot; respond well to techniques encouraging ramification and leaf reduction.

* J. H. van &#x27;t Hoff proposes the Arrhenius equation for the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant, and therefore, rate of a chemical reaction.
* Hermann Emil Fischer proposes the structure of purine, a key component in many biomolecules, which he synthesizes in 1898; he also begins work on the chemistry of glucose and related sugars.
* Henry Louis Le Chatelier develops Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, which explains the response of dynamic chemical equilibria to external stresses.
* Paul Vieille invents Poudre B, the first smokeless powder for firearms.

==Climatology==

Loeffler also discovers the causative organism for diphtheria, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;.
* Dr Takaki Kanehiro of the Imperial Japanese Navy conducts a controlled experiment demonstrating that deficient diet is the cause of beriberi, but mistakenly concludes that sufficient protein alone would prevent it.
* Georg Theodor Gaffky isolates the pathogenic bacillus &quot;salmonella typhi&quot; as the cause of typhoid fever.
* Ophthalmologist Karl Koller announces his use of a local anesthetic (cocaine) in surgery; Jellinek also demonstrates cocaine&#x27;s effects as an anesthetic on the respiratory system.
* Friedrich Schultze first describes the disorder that will become known as Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease.
* First known case of artificial insemination by sperm donation: William H. Pancoast, a professor in Philadelphia, takes sperm from his &quot;best looking&quot; student to inseminate an anesthetized woman without her knowledge, not reported for 25 years.
* Among the papers on brain function published by Vladimir Bekhterev is a study on the formation of the human conception of space.

==Physics==
* Ludwig Boltzmann derives the Stefan–Boltzmann law on blackbody radiant flux from thermodynamic principles.

==Technology==
* February 12 – Lewis Waterman gets his first patent for a capillary feed fountain pen in the United States.
* May 16 – Angelo Moriondo of Turin is granted a patent for an espresso machine.
* June 13 – LaMarcus Adna Thompson opens the &quot;Gravity Pleasure Switchback Railway&quot; at Coney Island, New York City.
* October – Hiram Maxim first demonstrates the Maxim gun, the first self-powered machine gun (using recoil operation).
* Fall – Chester H. Pond invents the first electrical self-winding clock.
* Charles Parsons invents the modern steam turbine.
* Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs make a fully controllable free-flight in French Army airship &quot;La France&quot; with an electric motor.

<text>Tilia cordata, the small-leaved lime or small-leaved linden, is a species of tree in the family Malvaceae, native to much of Europe. Other common names include little-leaf or littleleaf linden, or traditionally in South East England, pry or pry tree. Its range extends from Britain through mainland Europe to the Caucasus and western Asia. In the south of its range it is restricted to high elevations.

==Description==

&quot;Tilia cordata&quot; is a deciduous tree growing to tall, diameter 1/3 to 1/2 the height, with a trunk up to diameter. The largest known trunk circumference was a specimen in Närke, Sweden, that measured circumference at chest height. There are lime trees in Germany that are said to be over 1000 years old. The bark is smooth and grayish when young, firm with vertical ridges and horizontal fissures when older. The crown is rounded in a formal oval shape to pyramidal. Branching is upright and increases in density with age. The leaves are alternately arranged, rounded to triangular-ovate, long and broad, mostly hairless (unlike the related &quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot;) except for small tufts of brown hair in the leaf vein axils – the leaves are distinctively heart-shaped. The buds are alternate, pointed egg shaped and have red scales. It has no terminal bud. The small yellow-green hermaphrodite flowers are produced in clusters of five to eleven in early summer with a leafy yellow-green subtending bract, and have a rich, heavy scent; the trees are much visited by bees, the erect flowers of which being held above the bract. It&#x27;s in this way that the flower arrangements of &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; are distinct from that of the Common Lime (&quot;Tilia × europaea&quot;), where the flowers are held beneath the bract. The fruit is a dry nut-like drupe, 6–7 mm long by 4 mm broad, containing 1-2 brown seeds (infertile fruits are globose), downy at first becoming smooth at maturity, and (unlike &quot;T. platyphyllos&quot;, &quot;T.&quot; × &quot;europaea&quot;) not ribbed but very thin and easily cracked open.

==Ecology==
The trees favour good, loamy sites, but can also be found on sandy, infertile soils, and are not thought to be drought resistant. Dormant shoots of &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; can resist winter frost temperatures as low as .

In Britain &quot;Tilia cordata,&quot; traditionally called pry, is considered an indicator of ancient woodland, and is becoming increasingly rare. Owing to its rarity, a number of woods have been given SSSI status. Cocklode Wood, part of the Bardney Limewoods in Lincolnshire, is the best surviving spread of medieval small leaved limes in England. Another site is Shrawley Wood in Worcestershire. Small-leaved lime was once regarded as holy and good for carving.

Trees in northern England were found to have established when the climate was warmer and have adapted to the cooling climate. Paleobotanical analysis of tree pollen preserved in peat deposits demonstrates that &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; was present as a woodland tree in the southern Lake District c 3100 B.C. In spite of the late migration of &quot;T. cordata&quot; into the Lake District, pollen diagrams from many sites show rapid expansion so that, within a few centuries, it had become plentiful and even locally dominant in the southern valleys. Maximum values for &quot;Tilia&quot; from all pollen diagrams available for the north of England show a conspicuous concentration of high values in the southern Lake District. At several sites among the limestone hills on both sides of the estuary of the River Kent, the curves for &quot;Tilia&quot;, although beginning about 4800 to 4000 B.C. then achieve values of at least 10% within a few centuries. At Witherslack in Cumbria, values of this magnitude persist for a depth of which represents about 4000 years. For much of this period &quot;Ulmus&quot; is approximately 10%, &quot;Quercus&quot; 20% and the remaining arboreal pollen is largely that of &quot;Alnus&quot;. For a shorter period &quot;Tilia&quot; exceeds &quot;Quercus&quot; and reaches a maximum of 30%. The (Witherslack) basin is about in width, so that with distance correction factors applied this indicates that the surrounding woodlands on well-drained soils contained &quot;Tilia&quot;, &quot;Quercus&quot; and &quot;Ulmus&quot; in the proportions 4 : 1 : 1. Modern mature woodland trees were estimated to have germinated between 1150 and 1300 AD, making them around 800 years old. Precise age determination is impossible as heartwood at the centre disintegrates and therefore rings cannot be counted, and other methods are used.

==Pests and diseases==
The tree is fairly disease-resistant, though a common problem is leaf scorch where planted on dry soils, however leaf scorch is not a long-term problem as the leaves are lost in the autumn. Pests include Japanese beetles, aphids, lace bugs and various species of moths, such as &quot;Lymantria dispar dispar&quot; (Gypsy moth). This moth is one of the top 100 invasive species in North America, introduced by Étienne Léopold Trouvelot, and citizens are encouraged to remove Gypsy moth egg masses and cocoons from tree bark in order to help prevent the spread of this species.

==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;Tilia cordata&quot; is widely grown as an ornamental tree. It was much planted to form avenues in 17th and early 18th century landscape planning. A famous example is Unter den Linden in Berlin. It is also widely cultivated in North America as a substitute for the native &quot;Tilia americana&quot; (American linden or basswood) which has a larger leaf, coarser in texture; there it has been renamed &quot;Little-leaf Linden&quot;. It is popular as a shade tree with its dense canopy, as an ornamental tree with its architectural shape, and as a street tree. In the US, &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; has been planted in Wellesley, MA; Modesto, CA; Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN; and Atlanta, GA as street trees. In Europe, there are espaliered trees owing to the ability to survive heavy pruning. &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; is an easy tree to train for bonsai when the training is not done all at once. Letting the tree recoup in between sessions over a period of several months creates a healthy, good-looking miniature tree. Prior to the advent of firearms, it was also commonly used for making shields (as referenced in &quot;Beowulf&quot;).

&quot;Tilia cordata&quot; survives best in a soil pH range of 5.0 to 8.0. and in USDA Hardiness Zones 3–7. The tree prefers moist, well drained soil, but can survive flooding; it is not highly drought tolerant. It does not do well in soils with high salinity.

===Notable trees===
The Najevnik linden tree (), about 700 years old, has the broadest trunk of any tree in Slovenia at . It is a place of cultural events and every June, a national meeting of Slovene politicians takes place under it.

===Hybrids===
*Common lime: &quot;T. cordata&quot; readily hybridises with &quot;Tilia platyphyllos&quot;; the hybrid is commonly known as common lime, &quot;Tilia&quot; × &quot;europaea&quot; (syn. &quot;T.&quot; × &quot;vulgaris&quot;).

===Cultivars===
*&#x27;Corinthian&#x27; (&#x27;Corzam&#x27;) – dense, uniform limb spacing creates a compact, pyramidal, formal shape; darker and smaller leaves; resistant to Japanese beetles. 
*&#x27;Greenspire&#x27; – the most common, a cross between the cultivar &#x27;Euclid&#x27; and a selection from the Boston Parks, broadly used as a street tree, survives better under difficult conditions, overall a good looking, quick growing tree. 
*&#x27;June Bride&#x27; – significantly pyramidal habit, evenly spaced branches around a very straight central leader, glossier leaves, and 3 to 4 times as many flowers. 
*&#x27;Winter Orange&#x27; – rich red-orange-brown stems with reddish buds, can be cut back to grow long shoot extensions. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

 In the countries of Central, Southern and Western Europe, linden flowers are a traditional herbal remedy made into an herbal tea called lime tea or linden tea in Britain, tilleul in France, tila in Spain.

===Honey===
A monofloral honey is produced by bees using the trees and is widely used all over Europe. &quot;Linden honey&quot; is said to be nutritious and to have medicinal qualities.

=== Leaves ===
The young leaves can be eaten as a salad vegetable. Cattle often graze upon them.

===Linden wood===
The white, finely-grained wood is not a structurally strong material but a classic choice for refined woodcarvings such as those by Grinling Gibbons for ornate altarpieces, and the Veit Stoss altarpiece in Kraków, southern Poland. Linden wood was the prime choice for the carvings in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Windsor Castle, and Chatsworth House. It is also commonly used for lightweight projects such as carved spoons, light furniture, bee hives and honeycomb frames.

==Cultural significance==

&quot;Tilia cordata&quot; is the national tree of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and one of two national trees in Latvia.
The leaf of &quot;Tilia cordata&quot; is also considered a national symbol of Slovenia.

<text>Alnus glutinosa, the common alder, black alder, European alder, European black alder, or just alder, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to most of Europe, southwest Asia and northern Africa. It thrives in wet locations where its association with the bacterium &quot;Frankia alni&quot; enables it to grow in poor quality soils. It is a medium-sized, short-lived tree growing to a height of up to 30 metres (98 feet). It has short-stalked rounded leaves and separate male and female flowers in the form of catkins. The small, rounded fruits are cone-like and the seeds are dispersed by wind and water.

The common alder provides food and shelter for wildlife, with a number of insects, lichens and fungi being completely dependent on the tree. It is a pioneer species, colonising vacant land and forming mixed forests as other trees appear in its wake. Eventually common alder dies out of woodlands because the seedlings need more light than is available on the forest floor. Its more usual habitat is forest edges, swamps and riverside corridors. The timber has been used in underwater foundations and for manufacture of paper and fibreboard, for smoking foods, for joinery, turnery and carving. Products of the tree have been used in ethnobotany, providing folk remedies for various ailments, and research has shown that extracts of the seeds are active against pathogenic bacteria.

==Description==

&quot;A. glutinosa&quot; is a tree that thrives in moist soils, and grows under favourable circumstances to a height of and exceptionally up to . Young trees have an upright habit of growth with a main axial stem but older trees develop an arched crown with crooked branches. The base of the trunk produces adventitious roots which grow down to the soil and may appear to be propping the trunk up. The bark of young trees is smooth, glossy and greenish-brown while in older trees it is dark grey and fissured. The branches are smooth and somewhat sticky, being scattered with resinous warts. The buds are purplish-brown and have short stalks. Both male and female catkins form in the autumn and remain dormant during the winter.

The leaves of the common alder are short-stalked, rounded, up to long with a slightly wedge-shaped base and a wavy, serrated margin. They have a glossy dark green upper surface and paler green underside with rusty-brown hairs in the angles of the veins. As with some other trees growing near water, the common alder keeps its leaves longer than do trees in drier situations, and the leaves remain green late into the autumn. As the Latin name &quot;glutinosa&quot; implies, the buds and young leaves are sticky with a resinous gum.

The species is monoecious and the flowers are wind-pollinated; the slender cylindrical male catkins are pendulous, reddish in colour and long; the female flowers are upright, broad and green, with short stalks. During the autumn they become dark brown to black in colour, hard, somewhat woody, and superficially similar to small conifer cones. They last through the winter and the small winged seeds are mostly scattered the following spring. The seeds are flattened reddish-brown nuts edged with webbing filled with pockets of air. This enables them to float for about a month which allows the seed to disperse widely.

Unlike some other species of tree, common alders do not produce shade leaves. The respiration rate of shaded foliage is the same as well-lit leaves but the rate of assimilation is lower. This means that as a tree in woodland grows taller, the lower branches die and soon decay, leaving a small crown and unbranched trunk.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;A. glutinosa&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, as one of two varieties of alder (the other being &quot;Alnus incana&quot;), which he regarded as a single species &quot;Betula alnus&quot;. In 1785, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck treated it as a full species under the name &quot;Betula glutinosa&quot;. Its present scientific name is due to Joseph Gaertner, who in 1791 accepted the separation of alders from birches, and transferred the species to &quot;Alnus&quot;. The epithet &quot;glutinosa&quot; means &quot;sticky&quot;, referring particularly to the young shoots.

Within the genus &quot;Alnus&quot;, the common alder is placed in subgenus &quot;Alnus&quot; as part of a closely related group of species including the grey alder, &quot;A. incana&quot;, with which it hybridizes to form the hybrid &quot;A. &quot;× &quot;hybrida&quot;. Both species are diploid. In 2017, populations formerly considered to be &quot;A. glutinosa&quot; were found to be separate, polyploid species: &quot;A. lusitanica&quot;, which is native to the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, and &quot;A. rohlenae&quot;, which is native to the western part of the Balkan Peninsula.

==Distribution and habitat==

The common alder is native to almost the whole of continental Europe (except for both the extreme north and south) as well as the United Kingdom and Ireland. In Asia its range includes Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan, and in Africa it is found in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. It is naturalised in the Azores. It has been introduced, either by accident or by intent, to Canada, the United States, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Its natural habitat is in moist ground near rivers, ponds and lakes but it can also grow in drier locations and sometimes occurs in mixed woodland and on forest edges. It tolerates a range of soil types and grows best at a pH of between 5.5 and 7.2. Because of its association with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium &quot;Frankia alni&quot;, it can grow in nutrient-poor soils where few other trees thrive.

European alder does not usually grow in areas where the average daily temperature is above freezing for longer than six months; its range is mainly restricted in Scandinavia, but it also habitats other regions.

It requires 500 millimeters of rain to fall annually in the southeastern boundary distribution of Eurasia. Although European alder can withstand winter temperatures as low as -54°C, winter damage causes 80% of young European alder plantings in North Carolina to die back.

Given the overwinter minimum of -18°C, early low temperatures in November and December may have caused more damage than the intense cold.

==Ecology==


The common alder is most noted for its symbiotic relationship with the bacterium &quot;Frankia alni&quot;, which forms nodules on the tree&#x27;s roots. This bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and fixes it in a form available to the tree. In return, the bacterium receives carbon products produced by the tree through photosynthesis. This relationship, which improves the fertility of the soil, has established the common alder as an important pioneer species in ecological succession.

The common alder is susceptible to &quot;Phytophthora alni&quot;, a recently evolved species of oomycete plant pathogen probably of hybrid origin. This is the causal agent of phytophthora disease of alder which is causing extensive mortality of the trees in some parts of Europe. The symptoms of this infection include the death of roots and of patches of bark, dark spots near the base of the trunk, yellowing of leaves and in subsequent years, the death of branches and sometimes the whole tree. &quot;Taphrina alni&quot; is a fungal plant pathogen that causes alder tongue gall, a chemically induced distortion of female catkins. The gall develops on the maturing fruits and produces spores which are carried by the wind to other trees. This gall is believed to be harmless to the tree. Another, also harmless, gall is caused by a midge, &quot;Eriophyes inangulis&quot;, which sucks sap from the leaves forming pustules.

The common alder is important to wildlife all year round and the seeds are a useful winter food for birds. Deer, sheep, hares and rabbits feed on the tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter. It shades the water of rivers and streams, moderating the water temperature, and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood. The common alder is the foodplant of the larvae of a number of different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of plant-eating insect. The tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in the humid moist environment of streamside trees. Some common lichens found growing on the trunk and branches include tree lungwort (&quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot;), &quot;Menneguzzia terebrata&quot; and &quot;Stenocybe pullatula&quot;, the last of which is restricted to alders. Some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with the common alder, both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients. As well as several species of &quot;Naucoria&quot;, these symbionts include &quot;Russula alnetorum&quot;, the milkcaps &quot;Lactarius obscuratus&quot; and &quot;Lactarius cyathula&quot;, and the alder roll-rim &quot;Paxillus filamentosus&quot;, all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders. In spring, the catkin cup &quot;Ciboria amentacea&quot; grows on fallen alder catkins.

As an introduced species, the common alder can affect the ecology of its new locality. It is a fast-growing tree and can quickly form dense woods where little light reaches the ground, and this may inhibit the growth of native plants. The presence of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the annual accumulation of leaf litter from the trees also alters the nutrient status of the soil. It also increases the availability of phosphorus in the ground, and the tree&#x27;s dense network of roots can cause increased sedimentation in pools and waterways. It spreads easily by wind-borne seed, may be dispersed to a certain extent by birds and the woody fruits can float away from the parent tree. When the tree is felled, regrowth occurs from the stump, and logs and fallen branches can take root. In the Midwestern United States, &quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot; is a highly invasive terrestrial plant and is prohibited in Indiana. &quot;A. glutinosa&quot; is classed as an environmental weed in New Zealand.

== Toxicity ==

Pollen from the common alder, along with that from birch and hazel, is one of the many sources of tree pollen allergy. As the pollen is often present in the atmosphere at the same time as that of birch, hazel, hornbeam and oak, and they have similar physicochemical properties, it is difficult to separate out their individual effects. In central Europe, these tree pollens are the second most common cause of allergic conditions after grass pollen.

== Uses ==

The common alder is used as a pioneer species and to stabilise river banks, to assist in flood control, to purify water in waterlogged soils and to moderate the temperature and nutrient status of water bodies. It can be grown by itself or in mixed species plantations, and the nitrogen-rich leaves falling to the ground enrich the soil and increase the production of such trees as walnut, Douglas-fir and poplar on poor quality soils. Although the tree can live for up to 160 years, it is best felled for timber at 60 to 70 years before heart rot sets in.

On marshy ground it is important as coppice-wood, being cut near the base to encourage the production of straight poles. It is capable of enduring clipping as well as marine climatic conditions and may be cultivated as a fast-growing windbreak. In woodland natural regeneration is not possible as the seeds need sufficient nutrients, water and light to germinate. Such conditions are rarely found at the forest floor and as the forest matures, the alder trees in it die out. The species is cultivated as a specimen tree in parks and gardens, and the cultivar &#x27;Imperialis&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Timber===
The wood is soft, white when first cut, turning to pale red; the knots are attractively mottled. The timber is not used where strength is required in the construction industry, but is used for paper-making, the manufacture of fibreboard and the production of energy. Under water the wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings. The piles beneath the Rialto in Venice, and the foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentioned that the timber was used in the construction of the causeways across the Ravenna marshes. The wood is used in joinery, both as solid timber and as veneer, where its grain and colour are appreciated, and it takes dye well. As the wood is soft, flexible and somewhat light, it can be easily worked as well as split. It is also valued in turnery, carving, furniture making, window frames, clogs, toys, blocks, pencils and bowls.

European (common) Alder is a tonewood commonly used in the manufacture of electric guitars. It exhibits a balanced, even tone with a good mid-midrange projection making it suitable for a wide variety of musical applications. It&#x27;s relatively lightweight, easy to work and sand, accepts glue, stain, paint and finish very well and is inexpensive. All this has made it a favourite of large factories mass producing instruments. Fender has been continuously and uninterruptedly using Alder to make electric guitars since 1956.

===Tanning and dyeing===
The bark of the common alder has long been used in tanning and dyeing. The bark and twigs contain 16 to 20% tannic acid but their usefulness in tanning is limited by the strong accompanying colour they produce. Depending on the mordant and the methods used, various shades of brown, fawn, and yellowish-orange hues can be imparted to wool, cotton and silk. Alder bark can also be used with iron sulphate to create a black dye which can substitute for the use of sumach or galls. The Laplanders are said to chew the bark and use their saliva to dye leather. The shoots of the common alder produce a yellowish or cinnamon-coloured dye if cut early in the year. Other parts of the tree are also used in dyeing; the catkins can yield a green colour and the fresh-cut wood a pinkish-fawn colour.

===Medicine===
The bark of common alder has traditionally been used as an astringent, a cathartic, a hemostatic, a febrifuge, a tonic and a restorative (a substance able to restore normal health). A decoction of the bark has been used to treat swelling, inflammation and rheumatism, as an emetic, and to treat pharyngitis and sore throat. Ground up bark has been used as an ingredient in toothpaste, and the inner bark can be boiled in vinegar to provide a skin wash for treating dermatitis, lice and scabies. The leaves have been used to reduce breast discomfort in nursing mothers and folk remedies advocate the use of the leaves against various forms of cancer. Alpine farmers are said to use the leaves to alleviate rheumatism by placing a heated bag full of leaves on the affected areas. Alder leaves are consumed by cows, sheep, goats and horses though pigs refuse to eat them. According to some people, consumption of alder leaves causes blackening of the tongue and is harmful to horses.

In a research study, extracts from the seeds of the common alder have been found to be active against all the eight pathogenic bacteria against which they were tested, which included &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). The only extract to have significant antioxidant activity was that extracted in methanol. All extracts were of low toxicity to brine shrimps. These results suggest that the seeds could be further investigated for use in the development of possible anti-MRSA drugs.

===Other uses===
It is also the traditional wood that is burnt to produce smoked fish and other smoked foods, though in some areas other woods are now more often used. It supplies high quality charcoal.

The leaves of this tree are sticky and if they are spread on the floor of a room, their adhesive surface is said to trap fleas.

Chemical constituents of &quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot; include hirsutanonol, oregonin, genkwanin, rhododendrin {3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-l-methylpropyl-β-D-glucopyranoside} and (penta-2,3-dienedioic acid).

&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot; is planted on semi-coke dumps as part of environmental restoration projects because it encourages other plants to grow.

<text>Richard Manning Jr. (born November 18, 1980) is an American football coach and former cornerback who most recently served as the cornerbacks coach for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as an assistant coach for the New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks, and at California State University, Fresno.

Manning played college football for the UCLA Bruins and was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the third round of the 2003 NFL draft. Along with the Panthers he also played for the Chicago Bears, St. Louis Rams, Oakland Raiders, and the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League (UFL).

==Early life==
Manning played high school football at Edison High School in Fresno.

==Playing career==
===College===
Manning started 45 consecutive games for UCLA, which ranks as the second longest streak in school history. His 13 interceptions tie him for seventh all-time among Bruin players. In addition, he made first-team All-Pac-10 for his last three years.

===Professional===
====Carolina Panthers====
Manning was taken in the third round (82nd overall) of the 2003 NFL draft by Carolina. His first pick came in only his second game, as he intercepted Atlanta Falcons quarterback Doug Johnson. With injuries to the secondary, Manning eventually took over a starting role. His first interception to be returned for a touchdown came against the New York Giants. But he will be forever remembered by Panthers fans for his performance during the 2003-04 NFL playoffs. In the NFC Divisional game against the St. Louis Rams, Manning&#x27;s timely interception of Marc Bulger set up the game-winning touchdown to propel the Panthers into the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles. There, Manning made a permanent mark on Panther history by intercepting Donovan McNabb three times en route to the Panthers&#x27; victory. Manning became the first rookie to win Defensive Player of the Week honors twice in the same postseason. &#x27;s NFL off-season, Manning&#x27;s 4 postseason interceptions in 2003 remain franchise records for both a career and single season, as do his 3 interceptions in the Philadelphia game.

During the Panthers&#x27; injury-riddled 2004 season, Manning helped anchor a defense that ranked first in the league in interceptions. Against the Rams, Manning and teammate Dan Morgan picked off two passes each, the first game where a pair of teammates had a pair of interceptions in three years.

====Chicago Bears====
Ricky became a restricted free agent in the following offseason, and the Bears signed him to an offer sheet on April 21. The Panthers declined to match Chicago&#x27;s offer, and received a third round pick (88th overall, later used to select James Anderson) from the Bears in the 2006 NFL draft. Manning intercepted five passes during the 2006 season. He intercepted two passes from Matt Hasselbeck, and later returned an interception for a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings during week thirteen. He also had an interception during the Divisional Playoffs against the Seattle Seahawks.

Manning saw minimal playtime during the 2007 season, and was used at nickelback. He later worked with the team&#x27;s third string defense, and tutored Danieal Manning, who would eventually replace him as the team&#x27;s nickelback. On August 26, 2008, the Chicago Bears released Manning after a two-year stint.

====St. Louis Rams====
On August 31, 2008, Manning agreed to terms with the St. Louis Rams. He officially signed the following day. Then on October 14, 2008, Manning was placed on injured reserve after injuring his foot in a game against the Washington Redskins.

====Oakland Raiders====
Manning signed with the Oakland Raiders on August 15, 2009, after the team released tight end John Paul Foschi. Manning was released on August 24.

====Legal troubles====
In 2002 Manning was convicted of assault as a result of a fight with cheerleaders Brian Herbert and Seth Spiker outside a Westwood bar. Originally charged with two counts of felony assault, Manning pleaded not guilty to one count and the other count was dismissed. He received probation.

On April 23, 2006, Manning attacked Soroush Sabzi, in a Denny&#x27;s restaurant after first teasing him for working on a laptop computer. He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Two days before the incident, the Bears had signed Manning to a $21 million offer sheet. In light of the assault charge, the Panthers declined to match Chicago&#x27;s offer and Manning signed with the Bears.

Facing up to 4 years in prison, Manning pleaded no contest in September 2006 to felony assault in exchange for another probation deal. Later, Manning proclaimed his innocence. He acknowledged having words with the victim then pushing him in the head—but after that, according to him, his former UCLA teammates did the damage. &quot;Yeah, I did it&quot; explained Manning (AP report). &quot;If I don&#x27;t plea to this I have to go through trial. We&#x27;re in season now. Then I&#x27;d have to put it in the hands of a jury. There are tons of things that can happen with a jury... I just can&#x27;t risk that.&quot;

The NFL suspended him for one game for this, his second felony assault conviction.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
In 2012 Manning was hired to coach his high school alma mater&#x27;s varsity football team. He was the head coach of the Edison High Tigers, in Fresno, California, for just one year. From there Manning went on to coach 2 seasons at Fresno City College as defensive backs and special teams coach before going back to school at Fresno State and working as a graduate assistant.

===Seattle Seahawks===
In 2016 Manning was hired as an assistant coach with the Seattle Seahawks. It was announced in February 2018, that Manning would not return to the Seahawks for the 2018 season.

===New York Jets===
Manning was named a defensive assistant on the New York Jets staff in 2021.

===Las Vegas Raiders===
On February 23, 2024, Manning was hired by the Las Vegas Raiders as their cornerbacks coach under head coach Antonio Pierce. On February 4, 2025, Manning was dismissed by the Raiders.

<text>MewithoutYou, usually stylized as mewithoutYou, was an American rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The band consisted of Aaron Weiss (vocals), Michael Weiss and Brandon Beaver (guitars), Greg Jehanian (bass guitar), and Rickie Mazzotta (drums). The band&#x27;s music is generally dominated by spoken-word vocals and free-ranging drums, bass, and guitar.

==History==
===Early years, first albums: 2001–2008===
The band was originally conceived as a side project. The Weiss brothers, Aaron and Michael, together with guitarist Christopher Kleinberg, were playing together in another band, called the Operation, with bassist Greg Jehanian. Aaron wanted to start another project, to experiment with new sounds. With the help of Ricky Mazzotta, Ray Taddeo, and his brother Mike, Aaron formed what is now formally known as mewithoutYou. At first, the band was a four-piece, with Aaron on both bass and vocals. However, in only a few months, Chris Kleinberg joined to play third guitar. The band released their first EP, &quot;I Never Said That I Was Brave&quot;, in 2001 and shortly thereafter signed to Tooth &amp; Nail Records after a show at Cornerstone Festival the same year. Around this time, Taddeo had moved on, and Daniel Pishock was recruited to be the first official bass player of the band. The Operation disbanded soon after, and mewithoutYou&#x27;s debut full-length album, &quot;[A→B] Life&quot;, was released in 2002. The band garnered more attention for their second release, 2004&#x27;s&quot; Catch for Us the Foxes&quot;, which was produced by Brad Wood. In December 2004, Pishock had made the decision to retire bass duties in order to pursue a career in teaching and explore other musical ventures, and former Operation frontman, Greg Jehanian, was selected to replace him. In 2005, they won mtvU&#x27;s Left Field award for most original artist, for their song &quot;January 1979&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Brother, Sister&quot;, again produced by Wood, was released on September 26, 2006. In late 2007, Kleinberg left the band to pursue a degree in medicine. Pete Syoum filled in on guitar in the fall of 2007, but later, Kleinberg returned to play with the band on their 2008 summer tour.

===New sound, new music, and touring: 2008–2012===
In September 2008, the band finished recording the follow-up to &quot;Brother, Sister&quot;, titled &quot;It&#x27;s All Crazy! It&#x27;s All False! It&#x27;s All a Dream! It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. The name of the album is taken from parable 518 in the book &quot;The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh&quot;, by Bawa Muhaiyaddeen. The album was a departure from Weiss&#x27; trademark shouting and the band&#x27;s rough grooves. The fast rants, thick with lyrical angst, were traded for simpler melodies with lyrics about anthropomorphic food and animals. Similarly, the band scaled back their edgier post-hardcore sound, at times trading riffs for chords and guitars for pianos and harp; a classical composer was called into their Fishtown, Philadelphia studio for various arrangements on several tracks. The album was produced by Dan Smith and Brian McTear, and mixed by Brad Wood.

The band toured in a 42-foot 1976 MC8 Charter bus that ran on vegetable oil.

In 2011, they added Brandon Beaver of Buried Beds to play second guitar, as stated on their blog by Rickie Mazzotta. In August 2011, Mazzotta stated in an interview that the band had parted ways with Tooth &amp; Nail Records, due to perceived restrictions placed on them by the label. They hinted at starting their own label as they prepared to release their fifth album. Other band members, however, expressed satisfaction with and gratitude and affection toward their old label, citing different reasons for ceasing to work with them: namely, having completed their contract, the declining relevance of record labels in the current music world, and simply the excitement to try something new.

In February 2011, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; announced that the band&#x27;s fifth album, due in early 2012, would be produced by Daniel Smith. Thirteen songs were recorded in the studio sessions, eleven planned for the album, and two b-sides. On May 8, 2012, the band announced on their blog that a pre-release of &quot;Ten Stories&quot; could be streamed in its entirety on Spotify.

===Anniversaries and farewell: 2014–2022===
In April 2014, the band announced a &quot;Catch for Us the Foxes&quot; ten-year anniversary tour along the US west coast and southwest, followed by a second leg along the east coast. In September 2014, they announced a vinyl reissue of the album.

In March 2015, they stated that their sixth album would be released in mid-2015 on Run For Cover Records, and in April 2015, they announced that they would support their album &quot;Pale Horses&quot; with a mid-year tour and revealed that the record would be released on June 16.

On August 11, 2017, the band announced an &quot;[A→B] Life&quot; 15th-anniversary tour with Pianos Become the Teeth, Strawberry Girls, and Slow Mass and also reissued the album on vinyl and cassette.

On August 13, 2018, they touted the release of a new single, &quot;Julia (or, &#x27;Holy to the LORD&#x27; on the Bells of Horses)&quot;, from their seventh album. The single was published on Run for Cover Records. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, the band confirmed that Will Yip would be returning to produce the new record. The album &quot;[Untitled]&quot; was released on October 5, 2018.

In October 2019, they announced that 2020 would be their final year as an active band. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they extended the timeline of their farewell, stating that 2022 would be their last active year. The band played their final gigs in August 2022.

==Lyrical themes==
The Weiss brothers are of Jewish descent and their songs use Jewish, Muslim, and Christian imagery to explore spiritual themes. The two were raised in a Sufi Muslim household; their mother had converted from the Episcopal church and their father from Judaism. Due to the Christian imagery in some of Aaron Weiss&#x27; lyrics, the band has been categorized as a Christian band, although in an interview, Aaron stated he does not think they are a Christian band. He added that their lyrics reflect a personal relationship with God and are not evangelistic. Other lyrical themes explored include suffering and self-doubt.

Many lyrics are taken from the Sufi poet Rumi, including the song &quot;The Cure for Pain&quot; from &quot;[A→B] Life&quot; and a line in the song &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; from &quot;Catch for Us the Foxes&quot;.

In the song &quot;Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt&quot;, from their album &quot;[A→B] Life&quot;, Aaron&#x27; lyrics are based on a poem from the metaphysical poet John Donne, called &quot;A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot;. Donne wrote the poem to his wife to explain that there is no need for dreading their physical separation or distance because their spiritual love will always keep them together.

The title of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Catch for Us the Foxes&quot;, is taken directly from Song of Songs 2:15: &quot;Catch for us the foxes, / the little foxes / that ruin the vineyards, / our vineyards that are in bloom&quot; (&quot;New International Version&quot;).

In a 2007 interview, Aaron Weiss stated that the title of their third album, &quot;Brother, Sister&quot;, comes from a verse in the Bhagavad Gita.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;It&#x27;s All Crazy! It&#x27;s All False! It&#x27;s All a Dream! It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, explores many of the teachings of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen. The Sufi teacher&#x27;s story of &quot;The Fox, the Crow, and the Cookie&quot; from &quot;My Love You My Children: 101 Stories for Children&quot; is told, as well as his story about the &quot;King Beetle&quot; from &quot;The Divine Luminous Wisdom that Dispels Darkness&quot;. Other concepts from the teacher are explored in &quot;Allah, Allah, Allah&quot;, about seeing God in every blade of grass and in &quot;Fig with a Bellyache&quot;, dealing with sexual temptation from &quot;The Divine Luminous Wisdom&quot; and &quot;The Golden Words of a Sufi Sheikh&quot;. Guitarist Mike Weiss has been quoted as saying that the themes of the album reflect a time in Aaron&#x27;s life where he is &quot;sort of revisiting [religion] and holding himself up to those teachings that there&#x27;s no one religion that&#x27;s going to be the only way to God [...]&quot;. He adds, &quot;If you really want to just try to follow a path to God, I don&#x27;t believe you need anything beyond [Jesus Christ], but it&#x27;s just the idea that you&#x27;re fixed on the only way and that everybody else is just completely misguided [...] that is a sort of obtuse attitude that can hurt your own spirit&quot;.

<text>Franc Frakelj (a.k.a. Peter Skalar) (19 January 1917–?) was a member of the collaborationist Slovene Home Guard (after the Italian fascist capitulation in 1943) and a member of a secret murderous militia called Črna roka (&quot;Black Hand&quot;) who is accused of killing over 60 people during the Second World War. He and his group used wooden sticks to massacre local people in the winter of 1943–44 in Kosler&#x27;s Thicket in the marshes south of Ljubljana.

Frakelj was born in Dražgoše (a part of Železniki), a village in northwestern Slovenia, which was destroyed in 1942 by the German Army. Before the Battle of Turjak Castle (September 19, 1943) Frakelj was the commander of a stronghold of village guards in Tomišelj south of Ljubljana.

He died in Canada living under the name Peter Markis.

<text>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetic disease resulting in impaired response to DNA damage in the FA/BRCA pathway. Although it is a very rare disorder, the study of this and other bone marrow failure syndromes has improved scientific understanding of the mechanisms of normal bone marrow function and the development of cancer. Among those affected, the majority develop cancer, most often acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and liver tumors. 90% develop aplastic anemia (the inability to produce blood cells) by age 40. About 60–75% have congenital defects, commonly short stature, abnormalities of the skin, arms, head, eyes, kidneys, and ears, and developmental disabilities. Around 75% have some form of endocrine problem, with varying degrees of severity. 60% of FA is FANC-A, 16q24.3, which has later onset bone marrow failure.
FA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair via homologous recombination. The well-known cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also examples of FA genes (FANCS and FANCD1 respectively), and biallelic mutation of any of the two genes usually results in an embryonically lethal outcome, and should the proband come to term, experience a severe form of Fanconi anemia.
Treatment with androgens and hematopoietic (blood cell) growth factors can help bone marrow failure temporarily, but the long-term treatment is bone marrow transplant if a donor is available. Because of the genetic defect in DNA repair, cells from people with FA are sensitive to drugs that treat cancer by DNA crosslinking, such as mitomycin C. The typical age of death was 30 years in 2000.
FA occurs in about one per 130,000 live births, with a higher frequency in Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners in South Africa. The disease is named after the Swiss pediatrician who originally described this disorder, Guido Fanconi. Some forms of Fanconi anemia, such as those of complementation group D1, N, and S, are embryonically lethal in most cases, which might account for the rare observation of these complementation groups. It should not be confused with Fanconi syndrome, a kidney disorder also named after Fanconi.

FA is characterized by bone marrow failure, AML, solid tumors, and developmental abnormalities. Classic features include abnormal thumbs, absent radii, short stature, skin hyperpigmentation, including café au lait spots, abnormal facial features (triangular face, microcephaly), abnormal kidneys, and decreased fertility. Many FA patients (about 30%) do not have any of the classic physical findings, but diepoxybutane chromosome fragility assay showing increased chromosomal breaks can make the diagnosis. About 80% of FA will develop bone marrow failure by age 20.

The first sign of a hematologic problem is usually petechiae and bruises, with later onset of pale appearance, feeling tired, and infections. Because macrocytosis usually precedes a low platelet count, patients with typical congenital anomalies associated with FA should be evaluated for an elevated red blood cell mean corpuscular volume.

==Genetics==
FA is primarily an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that two mutated alleles (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease. The risk is 25% that each subsequent child will have FA. About 2% of FA cases are X-linked recessive, which means that if the mother carries one mutated Fanconi anemia allele on one X chromosome, a 50% chance exists that male offspring will present with Fanconi anemia.

Scientists have identified 21 FA or FA-like genes: &quot;FANCA&quot;, &quot;FANCB&quot;, &quot;FANCC&quot;, &quot;FANCD1 (BRCA2)&quot;, &quot;FANCD2&quot;, &quot;FANCE&quot;, &quot;FANCF&quot;, &quot;FANCG&quot;, &quot;FANCI&quot;, &quot;FANCJ (BRIP1)&quot;, &quot;FANCL&quot;, &quot;FANCM&quot;, &quot;FANCN (PALB2)&quot;, &quot;FANCO (RAD51C),&quot; &quot;FANCP (SLX4)&quot;, &quot;FANCQ&quot; (&quot;XPF), FANCS (BRCA1), FANCT (UBE2T), FANCU (XRCC2), FANCV (REV7),&quot; and &quot;FANCW (RFWD3)&quot;. &quot;FANCB &quot;is the one exception to FA being autosomal recessive, as this gene is on the X chromosome. These genes are involved in DNA repair.

The carrier frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is about one in 90. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of Fanconi anemia.

Because of the failure of hematologic components—white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets—to develop, the body&#x27;s capabilities to fight infection, deliver oxygen, and form clots are all diminished.

==Pathogenesis==

Clinically, hematological abnormalities are the most serious symptoms of FA. By the age of 40, 98% of FA patients will have developed some type of hematological abnormality. However, a few cases have occurred in which older patients have died without ever developing them. Symptoms appear progressively and often lead to complete bone marrow failure. While at birth, blood count is usually normal, macrocytosis/megaloblastic anemia, defined as unusually large red blood cells, is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years). Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed pancytopenia, defined as abnormalities in two or more blood cell lineages. This is in contrast to Diamond–Blackfan anemia, which affects only erythrocytes, and Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, which primarily causes neutropenia. Most commonly, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) precedes a low neutrophil count (neutropenia), with both appearing with relatively equal frequencies. The deficiencies cause an increased risk of hemorrhage and recurrent infections, respectively. 

As FA is now known to affect DNA repair, specifically homologous recombination, and given the current knowledge about dynamic cell division in the bone marrow, patients are consequently more likely to develop bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

===Myelodysplastic syndromes===

MDSs, formerly known as preleukemia, are a group of bone marrow neoplastic diseases that share many of the morphologic features of AML, with some important differences. First, the percentage of undifferentiated progenitor cells, blast cells, is always less than 20%, with considerably more dysplasia, defined as cytoplasmic and nuclear morphologic changes in erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic precursors, than what is usually seen in cases of AML. These changes reflect delayed apoptosis or a failure of programmed cell death. When left untreated, MDS can lead to AML in about 30% of cases. Due to the nature of the FA pathology, MDS diagnosis cannot be made solely through cytogenetic analysis of the marrow. Indeed, it is only when morphologic analysis of marrow cells is performed, that a diagnosis of MDS can be ascertained. Upon examination, MDS-affected FA patients will show many clonal variations, appearing either prior or subsequent to the MDS. Furthermore, cells will show chromosomal aberrations, the most frequent being monosomy 7 and partial trisomies of chromosome 3q 15. Observation of monosomy 7 within the marrow is well correlated with an increased risk of developing AML and with a very poor prognosis, death generally ensuing within 2 years (unless prompt allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant is an option).

===Acute myeloid leukemia===
FA patients are at elevated risk for the development of AML defined as the presence of 20% or more of myeloid blasts in the marrow or 5 to 20% myeloid blasts in the blood. All of the subtypes of AML can occur in FA with the exception of promyelocytic. However, myelomonocytic and acute monocytic are the most common subtypes observed. Many MDS patients&#x27; diseases evolve into AML if they survive long enough. Furthermore, the risk of developing AML increases with the onset of bone marrow failure.

Although the risk of developing either MDS or AML before the age of 20 is only 27%, this risk increases to 43% by the age of 30 and 52% by the age of 40. Historically, even with a marrow transplant, about a quarter of FA patients diagnosed with MDS/ALS have died from MDS/ALS-related causes within two years, although more recent published evidence suggests that earlier allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in children with FA is leading to better outcomes over time.

===Bone marrow failure===
The last major haematological complication associated with FA is bone marrow failure, defined as inadequate blood cell production. Several types of failure are observed in FA patients and generally precede MDS and AML. Detection of decreasing blood count is generally the first sign used to assess the necessity of treatment and possible transplant. While most FA patients are initially responsive to androgen therapy and haemopoietic growth factors, these have been shown to promote leukemia, especially in patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and have severe side effects, including hepatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The only treatment left would be a bone marrow transplant; however, such an operation has a relatively low success rate in FA patients when the donor is unrelated (30% 5-year survival). It is, therefore, imperative to transplant from an HLA-identical sibling. Furthermore, due to the increased susceptibility of FA patients to chromosomal damage, pretransplant conditioning cannot include high doses of radiation or immunosuppressants, thus increasing the chances of patients developing graft-versus-host disease. If all precautions are taken, and the marrow transplant is performed within the first decade of life, a two-year probability of survival can be as high as 89%. However, if the transplant is performed at ages older than 10, two-year survival rates drop to 54%.

A recent report by Zhang et al. investigates the mechanism of bone marrow failure in FANCC-/- cells. They hypothesize and successfully demonstrate that continuous cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation, such as those seen by haemopoietic and progenitor cells as they migrate between hyperoxic blood and hypoxic marrow tissues, leads to premature cellular senescence and therefore inhibition of haemopoietic function. Senescence, together with apoptosis, may constitute a major mechanism of haemopoietic cell depletion occurred in bone marrow failure.

===Molecular basis===
There are 22 genes responsible for FA, one of them being the breast-cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2. They are involved in the recognition and repair of damaged DNA; genetic defects leave them unable to repair DNA. The FA core complex of 8 proteins is normally activated when DNA stops replicating because of damage. The core complex adds ubiquitin, a small protein that combines with BRCA2 in another cluster to repair DNA (see Figure Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage). At the end of the process, ubiquitin is removed.

Recent studies have shown that eight of these proteins, FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and -M, assemble to form a core protein complex in the nucleus. According to current models, the complex moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus following nuclear localization signals on FANCA and FANCE. Assembly is activated by replicative stress, particularly DNA damage caused by cross-linking agents (such as mitomycin C or cisplatin) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is detected by the FANCM protein.

Following assembly, the protein core complex activates FANCL protein which acts as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase and monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI.

Monoubiquitinated FANCD2, also known as FANCD2-L, then goes on to interact with a BRCA1/BRCA2 complex (see Figure Recombinational repair of DNA double-strand damage). Details are not known, but similar complexes are involved in genome surveillance and associated with a variety of proteins implicated in DNA repair and chromosomal stability. With a crippling mutation in any FA protein in the complex, DNA repair is much less effective, as shown by its response to damage caused by cross-linking agents such as cisplatin, diepoxybutane and Mitomycin C. Bone marrow is particularly sensitive to this defect.

In another pathway responding to ionizing radiation, FANCD2 is thought to be phosphorylated by protein complex ATM/ATR activated by double-strand DNA breaks and takes part in S-phase checkpoint control. This pathway was proven by the presence of radioresistant DNA synthesis, the hallmark of a defect in the S phase checkpoint, in patients with FA-D1 or FA-D2. Such a defect readily leads to uncontrollable replication of cells and might also explain the increased frequency of AML in these patients.

FA proteins have cellular roles in autophagy and ribosome biogenesis in addition to DNA repair. FANCC, FANCA, FANCF, FANCL, FANCD2, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are required to clear damaged mitochondria from the cell (a process called mitophagy). BRCA1 (also known as FANCS) interacts with the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter and terminator in the nucleolus, the cellular location where ribosome biogenesis initiates, and is required for transcription of rDNA. FANCI functions in the production of the large ribosomal subunit by processing pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), the transcription of pre-rRNA by RNAPI, maintaining levels of the mature 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and the global cellular translation of proteins by ribosomes. In the nucleolus, FANCI is predominantly in the deubiquitinated form. In addition, FANCA is required to maintain normal nucleolar morphology, for transcription of pre-rRNA, and global cellular translation. FANCC, FANCD2, FANCG are also required to maintain normal nucleolar morphology and FANCG is also required for global cellular translation. There may be a role for FA proteins outside the nucleolus in ribosome biogenesis or protein translation as FANCI and FANCD2 were the only FA proteins associated with polysomes. Other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes also have defects in ribosome biogenesis or protein translation, including dyskeratosis congenita, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and Shwachman Diamond Syndrome, and like these other diseases, FA may also be a ribosomopathy.

===Spermatogenesis===

In humans, infertility is one of the characteristics of individuals with mutational defects in the FANC genes. In mice, spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and spermatocytes in the meiotic stages of leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene are enriched for FANC proteins. This finding suggests that recombinational repair processes mediated by the FANC proteins are active during germ cell development, particularly during meiosis, and that defects in this activity can lead to infertility.

===Neural stem cell homeostasis===

Microphthalmia and microcephaly are frequent congenital defects in FA patients. The loss of FANCA and FANCG in mice causes neural progenitor apoptosis both during early developmental neurogenesis and later during adult neurogenesis. This leads to depletion of the neural stem cell pool with aging. Much of the Fanconi anemia phenotype might be interpreted as a reflection of premature aging of stem cells.

==Treatment==
The first line of therapy is androgens and hematopoietic growth factors, but only 50–75% of patients respond. A more permanent cure is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. If no potential donors exist, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to match the recipient&#x27;s HLA type.

==Prognosis==
Many patients eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Older patients are extremely likely to develop head and neck, esophageal, gastrointestinal, vulvar and anal cancers. Patients who have had a successful stem cell transplant and, thus, are cured of the blood problem associated with FA still must have regular examinations to watch for signs of cancer. Many patients do not reach adulthood.

The overarching medical challenge that Fanconi patients face is a failure of their bone marrow to produce blood cells. In addition, Fanconi patients normally are born with a variety of birth defects. A significant number of Fanconi patients have kidney problems, trouble with their eyes, developmental delay, and other serious defects, such as microcephaly (small head).
