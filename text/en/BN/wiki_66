<text>The Allied invasion of Italy was the Allied amphibious landing on mainland Italy that took place from 3 September 1943, during the Italian campaign of World War II. The operation was undertaken by General Sir Harold Alexander&#x27;s 15th Army Group (comprising General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s American Fifth Army and General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army) and followed the successful Allied invasion of Sicily. The main invasion force landed on the west coast of Italy at Salerno on 9 September as part of Operation Avalanche, while two supporting operations took place in Calabria (Operation Baytown) and Taranto (Operation Slapstick).

==Background==

===Allied plan===
Following the defeat of the Axis powers in North Africa in May 1943, there was disagreement between the Allies about the next step. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to invade Italy, which in November 1942 he had called &quot;the soft underbelly of the axis&quot; (American General Mark W. Clark would later call it &quot;one tough gut&quot;). Churchill noted that Italian popular support for the war was declining and an invasion would remove Italy from the Axis, thus weakening Axis influence in the Mediterranean Sea and opening it to Allied traffic. This would allow the reduction of shipping capacity needed to supply Allied forces in the Middle East and Far East theaters. at a time when the disposal of Allied shipping capacity was in crisis and permit an increase of British and American supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, it would tie down German forces in Italy. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, had been strongly pressuring Churchill and Roosevelt to open a &quot;second front&quot; in Europe, which would lessen the German Army&#x27;s focus on the Eastern Front, where the bulk of its forces were fighting in the largest armed conflict in history against the Soviet Red Army.

However, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall and much of the American staff wanted to avoid operations that might delay the main invasion of Europe, which had been planned as early as 1942, and which finally materialized as Operation Overlord in 1944. When it became clear that no cross-channel invasion of occupied France could be undertaken in 1943, both parties agreed to an invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, with no commitment made to follow-up operations. After the highly successful outcome of the Sicilian campaign had become clear, both Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the U.S. President, accepted the necessity of continuing to engage the Axis before the start of the campaign in northwest Europe. Discussions had been ongoing since the Trident Conference held in Washington, D.C., in May, but it was not until late July, with the fall of Italian Fascist Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, that the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean theater, to go ahead.

Despite the overwhelming success of the Sicilian campaign, a significant number of Axis forces managed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. Contemporary Axis propaganda portrayed this as a success. In late July, the fascist government fell and Mussolini was removed as head of the Italian government, envoys of which soon began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian (and more so German) resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin in April 1945. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden that would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the German commander-in-chief (C-in-C), Albert Kesselring.

The Allies had originally planned to cross from the island of Sicily into the &quot;arch&quot; area (Taranto) of the Italian mainland, envisioning a limited invasion of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;, whence they would advance up the western coast, anticipating a strong defense by both German and Italian forces. The overthrow of Mussolini made a more ambitious plan feasible, and the Allies decided to make their invasion two-pronged by combining the crossing of the British Eighth Army under General Sir Bernard Montgomery into the mainland with the simultaneous seizure of the port of Naples further north. Although the Americans were mindful of Napoleon&#x27;s maxim that Italy, like a boot, should be entered from the top, the range limits of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily reduced their choices to two landing areas: one at the Volturno River basin to the north of Naples and the other south of Naples at Salerno (though separated from Naples by the mountainous Sorrento peninsula). They chose Salerno because it was closer to their air bases. Operation Baytown was the preliminary step in the plan in which the British Eighth Army would depart from the port of Messina, Sicily, across the narrow Straits and land near the tip of Calabria (the &quot;toe&quot; of Italy), on 3 September 1943. The short distance meant landing craft could launch from there directly, rather than be carried by ship. The British 5th Infantry Division (Major-general Gerard Bucknall) of XIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, would land on the north side of the &quot;toe&quot; while its 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Guy Simonds) would land at Cape Spartivento on the south side. Montgomery was strongly opposed to Operation Baytown. He predicted it would be a waste of effort since it assumed the Germans would give battle in Calabria; if they failed to do so, the diversion would not work, and the only effect of the operation would be to place the Eighth Army south of the main landing at Salerno. He was proved correct; after Operation Baytown, the British Eighth Army moved 480 km north to the Salerno area against no opposition other than engineering obstacles.

Plans for the use of Allied airborne forces took several forms, all of which were cancelled. The initial plan to land glider-borne troops in the mountain passes of the Sorrento Peninsula above Salerno was abandoned on 12 August. Six days later it was replaced by Operation Giant, in which two regiments of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division (Major General Matthew Ridgway) would seize and hold crossings over the Volturno River. This was at first expanded to include the entire division, including an amphibious landing by the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, then deemed logistically unsupportable and reduced to a two-battalion drop at Capua to block the highway there. The Italian surrender on 3 September led to the cancellation of Operation Giant I and its replacement by Operation Giant II, a drop of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment on and Cerveteri airfields, northwest of Rome. This was intended to aid Italian forces in saving Rome, one of the most culturally significant cities in the western world, from German razing, a condition of the Italian armistice. Because the distance from the Allied beachheads precluded any substantial Allied support of the airborne troops, Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor, the acting assistant division commander (ADC) of the 82nd Airborne Division, was spirited into Rome to assess the willingness of Italian troops to cooperate with the Americans. Taylor&#x27;s judgment was that the operation would be a trap and he advised cancellation, which occurred late on the afternoon of 8 September after pathfinders had already taken off aboard their troop carrier aircraft.

The main landings (Operation Avalanche) were scheduled to take place on 9 September, during which the main force would land around Salerno on the western coast. It would consist of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, comprising the U.S. VI Corps under Major General Ernest J. Dawley, the British X Corps under Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery, with the 82nd Airborne Division in reserve, a total of eight divisions and two brigade-sized units. Its primary objectives were to seize the port of Naples to ensure resupply, and to cut across to the east coast, trapping Axis troops further south. The naval task force of warships, merchant ships and landing craft totaling 627 vessels came under the command of Vice Admiral Henry K. Hewitt. Following the disappointing air cover from land-based aircraft shown during the battle of Gela in the Sicily landings, Force V of and four escort carriers augmented the cruisers , , , and fourteen destroyers of Hewitt&#x27;s command. Cover for the task force was provided by Force H under the command of Vice Admiral Algernon Willis, a group of four British battleships and two fleet carriers with destroyers, which was directly subordinate to the C–in–C Mediterranean Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham.

In the original planning, the great attraction of capturing the important port of Taranto in the &quot;heel&quot; of Italy had been evident and an assault had been considered but rejected because of the very strong defenses there. However, with the signing of the armistice with the Italians on 3 September, the picture changed. It was decided to carry the British 1st Airborne Division (Major-General George Hopkinson) to Taranto using British warships, seize the port and several nearby airfields and follow up by shipping in Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey&#x27;s British V Corps and a number of fighter squadrons. The airborne division, which was undergoing training exercises in two locations apart, was ordered on 4 September to embark on 8 September. With such short notice to create plans, Operation Slapstick was soon nicknamed Operation Bedlam.

The Avalanche plan (using less than half the troops landed during Operation Husky) was daring, considering possible resistance by six German divisions. The Fifth Army would be landing on a very broad front, using only three assault divisions (one American, the 36th, under Major General Fred L. Walker, in VI Corps, and two British: the 46th, under Major-General John Hawkesworth, and 56th (London), under Major-General Douglas Graham, in X Corps), and the two corps were widely separated, both in distance () and by the Sele River. Clark initially provided no troops to cover the river, offering the Germans an easy route to attack, and only belatedly landed two battalions to protect it. Furthermore, the terrain was highly favorable to the defender. Planning for the Salerno phase was accomplished in only forty-five days, rather than the months that might be expected. A U.S. Army Ranger force, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Darby, consisting of three U.S. Ranger battalions (the 1st, 3rd and 4th), and two British Commando units, under Brigadier Robert Laycock (consisting of No. 2 (Army) Commando and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando), was tasked with holding the mountain passes leading to Naples, but no plan existed for linking the Ranger force up with X Corps&#x27; follow-up units. Finally, although tactical surprise was unlikely, Clark ordered no naval preparatory bombardment or naval gunfire support take place, despite experience in the Pacific Theater demonstrating it was necessary. (Major General Walker, commanding the U.S. 36th &quot;Arrowhead&quot; Division, believed the defenders, from Traugott Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps, were too scattered for it to be effective.) The element of surprise was further limited by belated discovery of naval minefields off Salerno requiring landing craft to spend two hours traveling from the transports to the landing beaches.

On the German side, Kesselring lacked the strength to push the Salerno landing back, and was refused two panzer divisions from northern Italy to assist him.

Operation Avalanche was planned under the name Top Hat and supported by a deception plan, Operation Boardman, a false threat of an Allied invasion of the Balkans.

===Axis defensive organization===
In mid-August, the Germans had activated Army Group B under Erwin Rommel with responsibility for German troops in Italy as far south as Pisa. Army Command South under Albert Kesselring continued to be responsible for southern Italy and the German High Command formed a new army headquarters to be Army Command South&#x27;s main field formation. The new German 10th Army headquarters, commanded by Heinrich von Vietinghoff, was activated on 22 August. The German 10th Army had two subordinate corps with a total of six divisions which were positioned to cover possible landing sites. Under Hermann Balck&#x27;s XIV Panzer Corps was the Hermann Göring Airborne Panzer Division (under Wilhelm Schmalz), 15th Panzergrenadier Division (Eberhard Rodt) and 16th Panzer Division (Rudolf Sieckenius); and under Traugott Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps was 26th Panzer Division (Heinrich Freiherr von Luttwitz), 29th Panzergrenadier Division (Walter Fries) and 1st Parachute Division (Fritz-Hubert Graser). Von Vietinghoff specifically positioned the 16th Panzer Division in the hills above the Salerno plain.

==Battle==

===Operations in southern Italy===
On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army&#x27;s XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and composed of the 1st Canadian and British 5th Infantry Divisions, launched Operation Baytown under General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s direction. Opposition to the landings was light and the Italian coastal units surrendered almost immediately. Except to the Italian paratroopers of the 185th Infantry Regiment &quot;Nembo&quot; which was attached to the 211th Coastal Division had provided stiff resistance in the Aspromonte, but was able to overcome their resistance. Albert Kesselring and his staff did not believe the Calabria landings would be the main Allied point of attack, the Salerno region or possibly even north of Rome being more logical. He had already therefore ordered General Traugott Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps to pull back from engagement with the Eighth Army, leaving only 29th Panzergrenadier Division&#x27;s 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment in the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy. By 3 September, most of this unit was in prepared positions at Bagnara Calabra, from the landings which it had orders to hold until 6 September. After this they were to withdraw to join the rest of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division which was concentrating at Castrovillari, to the rear. The Krüger Battle Group (two battalions of 71st Panzergrenadier Regiment, 129th Reconnaissance Battalion and detachments of artillery and engineers) under 26th Panzer Division, would then stand at Nicotera, roughly up the coast from Bagnara.

On 4 September, the British 5th Infantry Division reached Bagnara Calabra, linked up with 1st Special Reconnaissance Squadron (which arrived by sea) and drove the 3rd Battalion, 15th Panzergrenadier Regiment from its position. On 5 September the allies flew above Soveria Mannelli (central Calabria) and bombed all along the downstream area of the town, where Nazi bases and warehouses stood. Fortunately, the urban area was barely damaged. On 7 September, contact was made with the Krüger Battle Group. On 8 September, the 231st Independent Brigade Group, under Brigadier Robert &quot;Roy&quot; Urquhart, was landed by sea at Pizzo Calabro, behind the Nicotera defenses. They found themselves attacked from the north by a mobile force from 26th Panzer Division and from the south by the Krüger Battle Group which was withdrawing from the Nicotera position. After an initial attack that made no headway, the Krüger Battle Group veered away but the northern attack continued throughout the day before the whole German force withdrew at dusk.

Progress was slow as demolished bridges, roadblocks and mines delayed the Eighth Army. The nature of the countryside in the toe of Italy made it impossible to by-pass obstacles and so the Allies&#x27; speed of advance was entirely dependent on the rate at which their engineers could clear obstructions. Thus, Montgomery&#x27;s objections to the operation were proved correct: the Eighth Army could not tie down German units that refused battle and the main obstacle to their advance was the terrain and German demolitions of roads and bridges.

By 8 September, Kesselring had concentrated Heinrich von Vietinghoff&#x27;s 10th Army, ready to make a rapid response to any Allied landing. In Calabria, Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps had two divisions concentrated in the Castrovillari area. Its third division, 1st Parachute Division (&quot;1. Fallschirmjäger-Division&quot;), was deployed toward Taranto. The rearguard in the toe was BattleGroup von Usedom, comprising a single battalion (1/67th Panzergrenadier Regiment) with detachments of artillery and engineers. Meanwhile, Balck&#x27;s XIV Panzer Corps was positioned to face possible landings from the sea with 16th Panzer Division in the Gulf of Salerno, the Hermann Göring Division near Naples and the 15th Panzergrenadier Division to the north in the Gulf of Gaeta.

On 8 September (before the main invasion), the armistice of Italy to the Allies was announced, first by General Eisenhower, then in the Badoglio Proclamation by the Italian government. Italian units ceased combat and the Navy sailed to Allied ports to surrender. The German forces in Italy were prepared for this and implemented Operation Achse to disarm Italian units and occupy important defensive positions.

Operation Slapstick commenced on 9 September. The first echelon of the British 1st Airborne Division arrived on four British cruisers, a U.S. cruiser, and the British fast minelayer . The Italian battleships &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; and with two cruisers passed by, en route to surrender in Malta. There were no Germans in Taranto and so disembarkation was unopposed. The only casualties occurred when &quot;Abdiel&quot;, at anchor, struck a mine and sank in minutes, with 168 killed and 126 injured. On 11 September, as patrols were sent further afield, there were some sharp encounters with elements of the German 1st Parachute Division. But 1st Parachute could do little but skirmish and fall back because most of its strength was attached to the 26th Panzer and Hermann Göring Divisions at Salerno. Major-General George Frederick Hopkinson, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British 1st Airborne Division, was killed in one of these actions. By 11 September the ports of Bari and Brindisi, still under Italian control, were occupied.

===Salerno landings===

Operation Avalanche–the main invasion at Salerno by the American Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark Clark–began on 9 September 1943, and in order to secure surprise, it was decided to assault without preliminary naval or aerial bombardment. However, as Admiral Henry Hewitt, the amphibious force commander, had predicted, tactical surprise was not achieved. As the first wave of Major General Fred L. Walker&#x27;s U.S. 36th Infantry Division approached the Paestum shore at 03:30 a loudspeaker from the landing area proclaimed in English: &quot;Come on in and give up. We have you covered.&quot; The Allied troops attacked nonetheless.

Major General Rudolf Sieckenius, commander of the 16th Panzer Division had organised his forces into four mixed arms battle groups which he had placed roughly apart and between back from the beaches. The &quot;Dőrnemann&quot; group was just east of Salerno (and therefore were opposite Major General John Hawkesworth&#x27;s British 46th Infantry Division when it landed), the &quot;Stempel&quot; battle group was between Pontecagnano and Battipaglia (and so faced Major General Douglas Graham&#x27;s British 56th Infantry Division), the &quot;Holtey&quot; battle group was in a reserve role at Persano on the Sele river which formed the corps boundary between Lieutenant General Richard McCreery&#x27;s British X Corps and Major General Ernest Dawley&#x27;s U.S. VI Corps, while the &quot;von Doering&quot; battle group responsible for the Albanella to Rutino sector was south-east of Ogliastro, somewhat south of the U.S. 36th Division&#x27;s beaches.

The British X Corps, composed of the British 46th and 56th Infantry Divisions and a light infantry force of U.S. Army Rangers and British Commandos of Brigadier Robert &quot;Lucky&quot; Laycock&#x27;s 2nd Special Service Brigade, experienced mixed reactions to its landings. The U.S. Rangers met no opposition and with support from the guns of seized their mountain pass objectives while the Commandos, from No. 2 (Army) Commando and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, were also unopposed and secured the high ground on each side of the road through Molina Pass on the main route from Salerno to Naples. At first light units of No. 2 Commando moved towards Salerno and pushed back a small force of tanks and armoured cars from the 16th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. The British Commandos captured the town of Salerno after some serious fighting that cost 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and 41 Commando nine killed and thirty-seven wounded.

The two British infantry divisions, however, met determined resistance and had to fight their way ashore with the help of naval bombardments. The depth and intensity of German resistance forced British commanders to concentrate their forces, rather than driving for a linkup with the Americans to the south.

At Paestum, the two lead battalions of the 36th (Texas) Division (from the 141st and 142nd Infantry Regiments) received stiff resistance from two companies of the &quot;von Doering&quot; group. German observers on Monte Soprano directed fire onto the landing craft. LST 336 took 18 hits, and some LCTs and DUKWs sheered away to avoid German shellfire. The division had not been in combat before and as a result of the Italian surrender, there was a general belief amongst the soldiers that the landings would be routine. The 141st Infantry lost cohesion and failed to gain any depth during the day which made the landing of supporting arms and stores impossible, leaving them without artillery and anti-tank guns. However, the 142nd Infantry fared better and with the support of the 143rd Infantry, the reserve formation which had landed by 08:00, were able to push forward. Minesweepers cleared an inshore channel shortly after 09:00; so by late morning destroyers could steam within of the shoreline to shell German positions on Monte Soprano. USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Savannah&quot; focused their guns on concentrations of German tanks, beginning a barrage of naval shells which would total eleven-thousand tons before the Salerno beachhead was secured.

By the end of the first day the Fifth Army, although it had not gained all its objectives, had made a promising start: the British X Corps&#x27; two assault divisions had pushed between inland and the special forces had advanced north across the Sorrento Peninsula and were looking down on the Plain of Naples. To the south, the U.S. 36th Division had established itself in the plain to the right of the Sele river and the higher ground to a depth of , although the 141st Infantry was still stuck near the beach. However, the XIV Panzer Corps commander, Hermann Balck, had seen the 16th Panzer Division&#x27;s battle groups perform as intended and he had ordered both the Hermann Göring Division south to the battle and later in the day had been able to order 15th Panzergrenadier likewise. Meanwhile, to the south, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division from LXXVI Panzer Corps had also been directed to Salerno. Neither side had gained the initiative.

===&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; response===
&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; planes began strafing and bombing the invasion beaches shortly after 04:00 on the morning of 9 September before X Corps seized the Montecorvino airfield inland later that day, destroying three dozen German planes. However, failure to capture the high ground inland left the airfield within easy range of German artillery and therefore unusable by Allied aircraft. On 10 September, German bombers began targeting Admiral Hewitt&#x27;s flagship while the ship was serving as General Clark&#x27;s headquarters. The flagship called thirty &quot;red alerts&quot; over a period of 36 hours in response to 450 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; flying sorties. Admiral Hewitt reported: &quot;Air situation here critical.&quot; The Allied aircraft carriers had intended to withdraw on 10 September, but remained with the invasion so that their Supermarine Seafires could provide the air cover which invasion planners had expected to operate from Montecorvino.

Eighty-five Allied vessels were hit by German bombs off Salerno. Fritz X glide bombs dropped by Dornier Do 217s disabled USS &quot;Savannah&quot; and narrowly missed USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; on the morning of 11 September. The following morning, Clark moved his headquarters ashore, and Hewitt transferred with his staff to the small amphibious force flagship so the large &quot;Ancon&quot; could retire to North Africa.

===Consolidation of the beachhead===
The Allies fought to expand their beachhead for three days while the Germans defended stubbornly to mask the build-up of their reinforcements for a counter-offensive. On 10 September, Clark visited the battlefield and judged that it was unlikely that X Corps would be able to push quickly east past Battipaglia to link with VI Corps. Since X Corps&#x27; main line of thrust was to be north towards Naples, he decided to move the VI Corps left hand boundary north of the Sele river and move the bulk of Major General Troy Middleton&#x27;s U.S. 45th Division into the gap. In view of the enemy reinforcements approaching from the north he also ordered a battalion-sized mixed arms group to reinforce the Rangers the next day. Over the same period, German reinforcements filtered into the battlefield. Units, short of transport and subjected to other delays, arrived piecemeal and were formed into ad hoc battle groups for immediate action. By 13 September, all the immediately available reinforcements had arrived including additional elements from the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division which had been released by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Kesselring from further north near Rome. By contrast, the Allied build-up was constrained by the limited transport available for the operation and the pre-determined schedule of the build-up based on how, during the planning phase, it had been anticipated the battle would develop. By 12 September, it had become clear that the Fifth Army had an acute shortage of infantry on the ground. That day, General Sir Harold Alexander, the 15th Army Group commander, reported to General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), in London: &quot;I am not satisfied with the situation at Avalanche. The build-up is slow and they are pinned down to a bridgehead that has not enough depth. Everything is being done to push follow-up units and material to them. I expect heavy German counter-attack to be imminent.&quot;

By 12 September, X Corps had taken a defensive posture because every battalion was committed and there were no reserves available to form an attack. In the south, the 36th Division made some progress but towards midday a counterattack by elements of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division overran the 1st Battalion, 142nd Infantry Regiment.

===German counterattacks===
On 13 September, the Germans launched their counteroffensive. While the Hermann Göring battle groups attacked the northern flank of the beachhead, the main attack was on the boundary between the two Allied Corps which ran roughly from Battipaglia to the Tyrrhenian sea, with the greatest weight due to fall on the VI Corps side On the morning of 13 September, elements of Major General Walker&#x27;s 36th Division attacked and captured Altavilla from the high ground behind Paestum, but a counterattack forced them to withdraw as darkness fell. During the afternoon, two German battlegroups, the Kleine Limburg and the Krüger, had attacked Persano and overrun the 1st Battalion, 157th Infantry before crossing the Sele to engage the 2nd Battalion of the 143rd Infantry and virtually wipe it out.

The battle groups continued their strike south and south-west until reaching the confluence of the Sele and its large tributary the Calore, where it was stopped by artillery firing over open sights, naval gunfire and a makeshift infantry position manned by artillerymen, drivers, cooks and clerks and anyone else that Major General Walker could scrape together. Clark&#x27;s staff formulated various evacuation plans: Operation Brass Rail envisioned Clark and his 5th Army headquarters staff leaving the beachhead to establish headquarters afloat aboard . Operation Sealion envisioned shifting British X Corps to Paestum with VI Corps, while the alternative Operation Seatrain envisioned shifting VI Corps to the X Corps sector. The navy protested that reversing the landing process would be impossible since loading beached landing craft would make them heavier and unable to withdraw from the beach. Advice from superiors and subordinates convinced Clark to continue fighting, and he later denied seriously considering evacuation.

The U.S. VI Corps had by this time lost the best part of three battalions, and so the forward units of both its divisions were withdrawn to reduce the length of the defensive line. The 45th Division consolidated at the Sele - Calore position while the 36th Division was on the high ground on the seaward side of the La Caso stream (which flowed into the Calore). The new perimeter was held with the assistance of Major General Matthew Ridgway&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division. Two battalions (roughly 1,300 paratroopers) of Colonel Reuben Tucker&#x27;s 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), after the cancellation of Giant II, had been assigned to execute the final version of Operation Giant I at Capua on the evening of 13 September. Instead, they jumped inside the beachhead, guided by Rebecca/Eureka beacons and moved immediately into the line on the right of VI Corps. The next night, with the crisis past, 2,100 paratroops of Colonel James Gavin&#x27;s 505th PIR also parachuted into the beachhead and reinforced the two battalions of the 504th. A clear sign of the crisis passing was when, on the afternoon of 14 September, the final unit of 45th Division, the 180th Infantry Regiment, landed, Clark was able to place it in reserve rather than in the line. The 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, 504th PIR, landed by sea on 15 September. A night drop of 600 paratroops of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion to disrupt German movements behind the lines in the vicinity of Avellino was widely dispersed and failed, incurring significant casualties. In the X Corps sector the lead elements of Major General George Erskine&#x27;s British 7th Armoured Division began to land, along with the 23rd Armoured Brigade.

With strong naval gunfire support from the Royal Navy and well-served by Fifth Army&#x27;s artillery, the reinforced and reorganized infantry units defeated all German attempts on 14 September to find a weak spot in the lines. German losses, particularly in tanks, were severe. On 14 September and the following night, Tedder ordered every available aircraft to support the Fifth Army, including the strategic bomber force. Over 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped during the daylight hours.

On 15 September both the 16th Panzer and 29th Panzergrenadier Divisions went on the defensive, marking the end to the thrust towards Paestum. Further north the Schmalz group of the Hermann Göering Division achieved surprise, attacking the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (comprising three battalions, the 2nd, 1/4th and 5th, of the Hampshire Regiment), of the British 46th Division, on the high ground east of Salerno. The armoured column following up was intercepted and driven back, leaving the German infantry exposed.

The Allied bomber effort continued on 15 September, although slightly less intensively than the previous day, as did the naval bombardment. The arrival of the British battleships and , with guns, off the beaches provided the Allied troops with a morale boost, although &quot;Valiant&quot; was not required to shoot and &quot;Warspite&quot;″s 29 rounds were awe-inspiring but a minor contribution to the 2,592 naval rounds fired that day.

On 15 September, Kesselring reported to the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; that the Allied air and naval superiority had forced LXXVI Panzer Corps onto the defensive, and that a decisive success would depend on the attack by XIV Panzer Corps. If this failed, the 10th Army must break off the battle to avoid being &#x27;mangled&#x27;.

On 16 September, the Schmalz group renewed its efforts on the X Corps front but with no more success, although No. 2 Commando suffered casualties, including 31-year-old Captain Henry Wellesley, the then-Duke of Wellington, who was killed. The Allied air forces and navies continued to batter enemy targets, although during an air attack by Dornier Do 217 K-2 bombers armed with Fritz X radio-controlled glide bombs, &quot;Warspite&quot; was hit and disabled, which required her to be towed to Malta for repair.

===Eighth Army ordered to apply pressure===
On 9 September, Montgomery&#x27;s formations had been strung out along the coastal roads in the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy. The build-up across the Straits of Messina had proved slow; he was therefore short of transport and decided to halt his formations to reorganize before pushing on. However, General Alexander issued orders on 10 September that &quot;It is of the utmost importance that you maintain pressure upon the Germans so that they cannot remove forces from your front and concentrate them against Avalanche&quot;. This message was further reinforced on 12 September by a personal visit from Alexander&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Brigadier A. A. Richardson. Montgomery had no choice- while reorganizing the main body of his troops, he sent light forces up the coast which reached Castrovillari and Belvedere on 12 September, still some from the Salerno battlefield. On 14 September, he was in a position to start a more general advance, and by 16 September the British 5th Infantry Division had reached Sapri, beyond Belvedere, where forward patrols made contact with patrols from VI Corps&#x27; 36th Division.

===German withdrawal===

On 16 September, the overall commander of forces in the Salerno area, General von Vietinghoff, reported to Field Marshal Kesselring that the Allied air and naval superiority were decisive and that he didn&#x27;t have the power to neutralize it. The 10th Army had succeeded in preventing troops from being cut off, and continuing the battle would invite heavy losses. The approach of the Eighth Army was also posing a threat. He recommended breaking off the battle, pivoting on Salerno to form a defensive line, preparatory to a withdrawal on 18/19 September. Kesselring&#x27;s agreement reached von Vietinghoff early on 17 September.

General Hermann Balck, commanding XIV Panzer Corps - the principal armoured formation near Salerno - wrote that his tanks ‘suffered heavily under Allied naval gunfire, with which [they] had nothing to counter&#x27;. This triggered an Axis forces retreat from areas which were covered by Allied naval gunfire.

General von Vietinghoff then reported to his superior that his attacks ‘were unable to reach their objective owing to the fire from naval guns and low-flying aircraft&#x27;. Allied air and naval support lines, aided by the Italian partisan movement, proved far superior to the German support, and were able to aid the Allied advance to a substantial degree.

===Salerno mutiny===

The Salerno battle was also the site of the Salerno Mutiny instigated by about 500 men of the British X Corps, which had by this time suffered over 6,000 casualties, who, on 16 September, refused assignment to new units as battle casualty replacements. They had previously understood that they would be returning to their original units, from which they had been separated during the fighting in the North African campaign. Eventually, the corps commander, Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery, persuaded about half of the men to follow their orders. The remainder were court-martialled. Three NCOs who led the mutiny were sentenced to death but the sentence was not carried out and they were eventually allowed to rejoin units.

===Further Allied advances=== 

With the Salerno beachhead secure, the Fifth Army began its attack northwest towards Naples on 19 September. On 20 September, Major General Ernest J. Dawley, the U.S. VI Corps commander, was relieved of his command by Clark and replaced by Major General John P. Lucas. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, after suffering serious casualties near Altavilla, was merged with British X Corps, joining the U.S. Army Rangers and the British 23rd Armoured Brigade on the Sorrento Peninsula to flank the German defenses at Nocera Inferiore, Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate, and Angri, which the British 46th Infantry Division attacked. The British 7th Armoured Division, passing through the 46th Division, was assigned the task of taking Naples, while the newly landed U.S. 3rd Infantry Division took Acerno on 22 September and Avellino on 28 September.

The Eighth Army made good progress from the &quot;toe&quot; in spite of German demolitions and linked with the British 1st Airborne Division at Taranto. Its left linked up with the Fifth Army&#x27;s right on 16 September. The Eighth Army now concentrated its forces east of the Apennine Mountains and pushed north along the Adriatic coast through Bari. On 27 September, the Eighth Army captured the large airfield complex near Foggia, a major Allied objective.

At the same time British X Corps made good progress; they pushed through the mountain passes of Monti Lattari and captured a vital bridge over the Sarno River at Scafati. They surrounded Mount Vesuvius and prepared to advance on Naples. The Fascist troops occupying the city provoked a rebellion by the population which started on 27 September. With the swift advance by British X Corps and Naples in rebellion, the Germans were forced to evacuate. On 1 October, &quot;A&quot; Squadron of the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards entered Naples, the first Allied unit to do so. The entire Fifth Army, now consisting of five American and three British divisions, reached the line of the Volturno River on 6 October. This provided a natural defensive barrier, securing Naples, along with the Campanian plain and the vital airfields on it, from a German counterattack.

Meanwhile, on the Adriatic Coast, the Eighth Army advanced to a line from Campobasso to Larino and Termoli on the Biferno river.

==Aftermath==

The 10th Army had come close to defeating the Salerno beachhead. The stubborn initial resistance by 16th Panzer Division&#x27;s battlegroups and the Germans&#x27; ability to move land reinforcements more quickly than the Allies could land follow-up forces by sea or air nearly tipped the battle. The Fifth Army planners had concentrated the main weight of its forces in X Corps on its left-wing, in line with its major objective of advancing on Naples. However, this had left its right-wing too thinly manned to defend X Corps&#x27; right flank and left a particular weakness at the corps boundary. The Germans, aware of the limited time available to deal with the Salerno landings because of the inevitable arrival of the Eighth Army, were obliged to make hurried and uncoordinated attempts to force a quick decision, having failed to break through Allied lines and exploit the gains in the face of Allied air and naval superiority. It was at this time Adolf Hitler sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Erwin Rommel, and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not feasible. As a result, Kesselring was forbidden to call upon reserves from the Northern Army Group.

Kesselring&#x27;s strategic arguments persuaded Hitler that the Allies should be kept away from German borders and prevented from gaining the oil resources of the Balkans. On 6 November, Hitler ordered Rommel to withdraw to Northern France and gave Kesselring command of the whole of Italy, instructing him that he keep Rome in German hands for as long as possible.

By early October 1943, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands. The Allied armies stood facing the Volturno Line, the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the Winter Line, their strongest defensive line south of Rome. The next stage of the Italian campaign became a grinding and attritional slog against well-prepared defenses in terrain and weather conditions which favored defense. Weather conditions hampered the Allied advantages in mechanized equipment and air superiority. It took until mid-January 1944 to fight through three auxiliary defensive lines to reach the Gustav Line, the backbone of the Winter Line defenses, setting the scene for the four battles of Monte Cassino which took place between January and May 1944.

===Clark&#x27;s award===
Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, the U.S. Fifth Army commander, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest U.S. award for valor in combat, for his front-line leadership during this crisis. He was frequently seen in the most forward positions encouraging the troops.

<text>An incubus (: incubi) is a male demon in human form in folklore that seeks to have sexual intercourse with sleeping women; the corresponding spirit in female form is called a succubus. Parallels exist in many cultures.

In medieval Europe, union with an incubus was supposed by some to result in the birth of witches, demons, and deformed human offspring. Legendary magician Merlin was said to have been fathered by an incubus. Walter Stephens writes in his book &quot;Demon Lovers&quot; that some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, an impaired mental state, or even death.

==Etymological, ancient, and religious descriptions==
The Late Latin word &quot;incubus&quot; (&quot;a nightmare induced by a demon&quot;) is derived from Latin &quot;incubō&quot; (&quot;nightmare, what lies down on one whilst one sleeps&quot;) and further from &quot;incubāre&quot; (&quot;to lie upon, to hatch&quot;). One of the earliest evident mentions of a demon sharing qualities with an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian King List, &quot;circa&quot; 2400 BC, where the hero Gilgamesh&#x27;s father is listed as Lilu. Lilu is described as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;seducing&quot; women in their sleep, while Lilitu, a female demon, is described as appearing to men in erotic dreams. Two other corresponding demons appear as well: Ardat lili, who visits men by night, and Idlu lili, a male counterpart to Ardat lili who visits women by night and begets from them. &quot;Ardat lili&quot; is derived from &quot;ardatu&quot;, the word for &quot;a woman of marriageable age&quot;, while &quot;idlu lili&quot; is derived from &quot;idlu&quot;, meaning a &quot;grown man&quot;. These demons were originally storm demons. They eventually became regarded as night demons, potentially due to mistaken etymology.

The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion. An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman to father a child, as in the legend of Merlin, which was the first popular account of demonic parentage in Western Christian literature.

In the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, exorcism is presented as one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of incubi. The others are Confession, the Sign of the Cross or recital of the Hail Mary, moving the afflicted to another location, and by excommunication of the attacking entity, &quot;which is perhaps the same as exorcism&quot;. In contrast, the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi &quot;do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed&quot;.

One scientific explanation for the incubus concept could fall under the scope of sleep paralysis, as well as hypnagogia, as it is common to experience auditory and visual hallucinations in both states. Typical examples include a feeling of being crushed or suffocated, electric &quot;tingles&quot; or &quot;vibrations&quot;, imagined speech and other noises, the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity, and sometimes intense emotions of fear or euphoria and orgasmic feelings. These often appear quite real and vivid, especially auditory hallucinations of music, which can be quite loud, indistinguishable from music being played in the same room. Humanoid and animal figures, often shadowy or blurry, are often present in hypnagogic hallucinations, more so than other hallucinogenic states.

The combination of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination could cause someone to believe that a &quot;demon was holding them down&quot;. Nocturnal arousal etc. could be explained by creatures causing otherwise guilt-producing behavior. Add to this the common phenomena of nocturnal arousal and nocturnal emission, and all the elements required to believe in an incubus are present.

Additionally, some crimes of sexual assault were likely passed off as the actions of incubi. Some authors speculate that rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping men and women to demons to escape punishment. Robert Masello asserts that a friend or relative is at the top of the list in such cases, and that the assault would be kept secret by the intervention of &quot;spirits&quot;.

==Regional variations==
A number of variations on the incubus theme are seen around the world. The alp of Teutonic or German folklore is one of the better known. In Zanzibar, Popo Bawa primarily attacks men and generally behind closed doors. &quot;The Trauco&quot;, according to the traditional mythology of the Chiloé Province of Chile, is a hideous deformed dwarf who lulls nubile young women and seduces them. The Trauco is said to be responsible for unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women. Perhaps another variation of this conception is the &quot;Tintín&quot; in Ecuador, a dwarf who is fond of abundant-haired women and seduces them at night by playing the guitar outside their windows — a myth that researchers believe was created during the colonial period to explain pregnancies in women who never left their houses without a chaperone. In Hungary, a &quot;lidérc&quot; can be a Satanic lover that flies at night and appears as a fiery light (an &quot;ignis fatuus&quot; or will o&#x27; the wisp) or, in its more benign form as a featherless chicken.

In Brazil and the rainforests of the Amazon basin, the Amazon river dolphin (or &quot;boto&quot;) is believed to be a combination of siren and incubus that shape-shifts into a very charming and handsome man who seduces young women and takes them into the river. It is said to be responsible for disappearances and unwanted pregnancies. According to legend, a boto always wears a hat to disguise the breathing hole at the top of its head while in human form, metamorphosing back into a dolphin during the day.

The Southern African incubus demon is the Tokolosh. Chaste women place their beds upon bricks to deter the rather short fellows from attaining their sleeping forms. They also share the hole in the head detail and water-dwelling habits of the boto.

In Swedish folklore, the mara or mare is a spirit or goblin that rides on the chests of humans while they sleep, giving them bad dreams (or &quot;nightmares&quot;). Belief in the mare goes back to the Norse Ynglinga saga from the 13th century, but the belief is probably even older. The mare was likely inspired by sleep paralysis.

In Assam, a northeastern state of India, it is mostly known as &quot;pori&quot; (Assamese: পৰী, meaning &quot;angel&quot;) (&quot;pari &quot;in Hindi and etymological cousin of fairy). According to the mythology, Pori comes to a man at night in his dreams and seduces him. Gradually, the victim&#x27;s health deteriorates, and in some cases, he develops suicidal tendencies.

In Turkish culture, the incubus is known as &quot;Karabasan&quot;. It is an evil being that descends upon some sleepers at night. These beings are thought to be spirits or &quot;jinns&quot;. It can be seen or heard in the nightmare and a heavy weight is felt on the chest. Yet, people cannot wake up from that state. Some of the causes are sleeping without adequately covering the body (especially women) and eating in bed.

In Ukrainian folklore, the &quot;perelesnyk&quot; is a significant figure resembling an incubus and associated with meteors, lightning, and fire. This supernatural being was believed to transform into a fiery dragon or young man, entering homes through chimneys, doors, or windows to seduce women by taking on the appearance of deceased spouses or lovers. Considered both seductive and perilous, the perelesnyk gifted treasures at night that turned to worthless items by daybreak. Its touch could drain vitality and hasten death. Countermeasures included uttering &quot;amen&quot; or wearing a crucifix. The character&#x27;s appearance in Ukrainian literature, such as Lesya Ukrainka&#x27;s &quot;The Forest Song&quot;, illustrates the cultural impact of this entity, showcasing its role in shaping perceptions of the supernatural and influencing creative works.

In the Xhosa, Pondo and Zulu cultures of South Africa, some variations of the&quot; impundulu&quot; resemble incubi as they are believed to appear as handsome men to seduce women and drink their blood.

<text>The A3W reactor was a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. Like all operational U.S. naval reactors it was a pressurized water reactor (PWR) design. The A3W designation stands for:

* A = Aircraft carrier platform.
* 3 = Third generation core designed by the contractor.
* W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer.

== History ==
The reactor was intended for use aboard USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. This four-reactor design was intended to reduce the cost involved in the construction and operation, as compared with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and its eight nuclear reactors.

Early in the construction, the United States Secretary of the Navy had the plans changed to save money, and fossil fuel boilers were installed on the Kennedy. Because the plans for the ship did not include a funnel, the funnel on the Kennedy protrudes out from the ship at an angle.

The return to nuclear power for carriers came with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class&#x27;s A4W reactor&#x27;s two reactor per ship design. While the two reactor configuration, with each core providing a much greater thermal output, is relatively less expensive than earlier designs, the power plant still represents about half the total cost of the ship.

<doc id="439247" wikidata="Q351985" url="?curid=439247" title="Charlie Haas">
<text>Charles Doyle Haas II (born March 27, 1972) is an American professional and former amateur wrestler. He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2000 to 2009 and Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2010 to 2013. In WWE he was a member of Team Angle, which later became a Tag Team duo with Shelton Benjamin known as &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team&quot;.

Haas was an amateur wrestler in high school, and attended Seton Hall University on a wrestling scholarship, before becoming a stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and regularly teamed with his brother, Russ, with the two winning numerous championships on the independent circuit, including the CZW World Tag Team Championship and the JAPW Tag Team Championship. After signing contracts with WWE, The Haas Brothers were assigned to WWE&#x27;s developmental territories, where they won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. After Russ died in 2001 due to a heart attack, Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the HWA Heavyweight Championship once.

Haas formed a team with Shelton Benjamin and the two debuted on &quot;SmackDown&quot; in December 2002. They won the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, and dubbed themselves The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team before they split in 2004. Haas won the WWE Tag Team Championship once more with Rico, and gained Miss Jackie, whom he later married, as a valet. Haas then transferred into singles competition before being released from WWE in 2005. After a short stint in Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) and other independent promotions, Haas was re-signed to WWE in April 2006. He formed a short-lived team with Viscera, before reforming the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team with Benjamin. After Benjamin transferred to the ECW brand, Haas began wrestling with a comical luchador persona, before developing a character where he imitated other wrestlers and WWE Hall of Famers. In addition, Haas won the last match on &quot;WWE Heat&quot; when the show ended on May 30, 2008.

Haas was released from WWE in February 2010. He soon returned to the independent circuit, including returning to JAPW and appearing for Ring of Honor. In September 2010, he won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. On April 1, 2011, Haas and Benjamin won the ROH World Tag Team Championship and held it until December 2011. Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling in March 2013, but returned to competition in August that same year. Aside from wrestling, Haas and his then-wife Jackie ran a nutritional store, Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop, in Frisco, Texas, which they opened in October 2008 but has since closed.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Early career (1996–2000) ===

After debuting in 1996 as a professional wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship for the second time on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating The Backseat Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere).

The Haas brothers began competing for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at &quot;The War Begins&quot; on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, and won the CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at &quot;Climbing The Ladder&quot; by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to The Backseat Boyz at &quot;Caged To The End&quot;, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000–2005) ===

After a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tryout match at Madison Square Garden on August 7, 2000, they signed a developmental contract with WWF. The two worked their way through the tag ranks in the WWF&#x27;s developmental territories, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) and the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). Also competed in dark matches and house shows for WWF. The brothers won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during early 2001, defeating The Dupps the first time and The Island Boyz and Joey Matthews and Christian York in a three-way match on both the second and third occasions. Russ died from a heart attack due to a pre-existing heart condition, on December 15, 2001 at age 27. The brothers fought in house shows and dark matches in the WWF up until Russ died. After Russ&#x27; death, Charlie continue to fight in dark matches. After Russ&#x27; death as a tribute to him, Haas wrote Russ&#x27; name on his wrist tape, and used the name &quot;R.C. Haas&quot; (standing for Russ–Charlie) before being called up to the main WWE roster. On January 2, 2002, Haas won the HWA Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship, by defeating Val Venis. He was later stripped of the title on January 29 due to a scripted contract loophole. After World Wrestling Entertainment (renamed from the WWF) ended its affiliation with the HWA, Haas was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he competed until December 2002.

Haas debuted on WWE&#x27;s main roster on the December 26, 2002 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a heel (villainous character) along with Shelton Benjamin as Team Angle. The tag team was the &quot;contingency plan&quot; of Paul Heyman, and were intended to help WWE Champion Kurt Angle retain his title, attacking Chris Benoit and Brock Lesnar in an attempt to soften them up. They quickly won the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 6, 2003, by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero Jr.). They held the championship for three months, including a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, before losing the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri in a ladder match on May 18 at Judgment Day. On the June 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle fired Haas and Benjamin after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership. The duo then dubbed themselves The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team, although announcers made sure to add &quot;Self Proclaimed&quot; to the name. Haas and Benjamin regained the championship from Guerrero and Tajiri on the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but lost it to the reformed Los Guerreros on September 18. The team was separated when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 Draft Lottery.
After Benjamin&#x27;s draft, Haas turned into a fan favorite and gained Miss Jackie as a valet. He teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22, 2004. The pair lost the championship to the Dudley Boyz on June 17, and shortly afterwards, Haas became a singles wrestler, although he retained Miss Jackie as his valet. Haas lost a match to Luther Reigns at the Great American Bash.

Haas was later involved in an angle in which he was in a love triangle with Miss Jackie, who was acknowledged on-screen as his fiancée, and Dawn Marie. The storyline culminated when Haas served as the special-guest referee in a match at Armageddon between the two women. After the match, Haas left both women in storyline, although he continued his relationship with Miss Jackie off-screen. In early 2005, he formed a tag team with Hardcore Holly. They were involved in a feud (scripted rivalry) with MNM for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but never won the championship.

On July 8, 2005, Haas was released by World Wrestling Entertainment along with his real-life wife Jackie Gayda.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2006) ===
He returned to JAPW later in July 2005, and began a feud for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship with Jay Lethal. On September 10 at &quot;JAPW Haas of Pain&quot;, Lethal defeated Haas to retain his title. In JAPW, on October 27, 2007, Haas was inducted along with his late brother Russ into the first class of the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame.

He won the New Legacy Championship at &quot;Ballpark Brawl V&quot; on August 13, 2005, defeating then-champion Christopher Daniels and Chris Sabin in a triple threat match. He successfully defended the title the next night at &quot;Ballpark Brawl VI&quot; against Harry Smith with Mick Foley as a referee.

During his time back in the independent circuit, Haas competed in the East Coast Wrestling Association&#x27;s (ECWA) Super 8 Tournament in 2006, where he advanced all the way to the finals before losing to Davey Richards.

=== Return to WWE (2006–2010) ===

Haas returned to WWE in 2006, appearing on the April 17, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as Rob Van Dam&#x27;s handpicked opponent for his former partner, Shelton Benjamin. Haas defeated Benjamin in the ensuing match. Haas continued to wrestle on the lower midcard spot, becoming a regular fixture on &quot;Heat&quot;.

On the June 5, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Haas inadvertently knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron as he was entering the ring. It was announced on WWE&#x27;s official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As a result of the legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia&#x27;s onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia&#x27;s affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be &quot;just friends&quot;. Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot; until splitting in December 2006.

After Shelton Benjamin won a match against Super Crazy on the December 4, 2006, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Haas came out to celebrate his win with a bewildered Benjamin. Haas and Benjamin announced the return of the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team on the December 11, 2006 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, and they defeated The Highlanders in their return match. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme. They continued to compete on &quot;Raw&quot; through the start of 2007, facing teams including John Cena and Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair and Carlito. In mid-2007, The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team feuded briefly with The Hardys in storyline; at the One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 3, 2007, they challenged The Hardys for the World Tag Team Championship in a ladder match but were unsuccessful. The team broke up once again when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand on November 20, 2007.

Early in 2008, Haas developed a gimmick in which he would go under the ring in the middle of his matches and re-emerge wearing a mask. In this &quot;alter-ego&quot;, Haas would sometimes perform luchador-esque maneuvers in a comical fashion (such as attempting a diving splash, but instead landing on his feet and hitting a standing splash). The opponent would often unmask Haas mid-match, returning him to his normal demeanor. During this persona, Haas usually competed in dark matches before the live broadcast of &quot;Raw&quot; or on &quot;Heat&quot;.
Beginning in late August, Haas turned into a face and began a storyline in which he began to impersonate other wrestlers, a concept created by John Laurinaitis, a WWE executive. His first match on August 25, 2008 under this gimmick was a loss to Carlito&#x27;s real-life brother Primo Colón, while Haas was parodying Carlito with the name &quot;Charlito&quot;. He has portrayed such superstars as John Cena, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, Jim Ross, The Great Khali, Montel Vontavious Porter, legends such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bret Hart, &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; Curt Hennig, Jimmy &quot;Superfly&quot; Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, the Undertaker, Hulk Hogan and even WWE Diva Beth Phoenix for which he won a Slammy Award.

On April 15, 2009, Haas was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On the May 8, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Haas made his in-ring return to the brand as a heel, abandoning his persona of imitating other wrestlers, and losing to John Morrison in a match where he was accompanied by his former World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team partner, Shelton Benjamin. The following week on the May 15, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Benjamin and Haas unofficially reunited and competed against John Morrison and CM Punk in a losing effort, but Benjamin was traded to the ECW brand in June.

On July 24, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Haas competed against R-Truth in a losing effort. The following week, on July 31, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he competed against The Great Khali, ending in a no-contest due to Kane being involved in the match by attacking Ranjin Singh at Khali&#x27;s corner. After an absence of several months, Haas made his return to television by teaming with Mike Knox in a losing effort against Cryme Tyme on the December 31, 2009 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;. This marked Haas’ last match in WWE. On February 28, 2010, WWE announced that Haas had been released from his contract.

=== Return to Independent circuit (2010) ===
On March 20, 2010, Haas made a surprise return to Jersey All Pro Wrestling and defeated Devon Moore for the JAPW New Jersey State Championship. On May 22 Haas and JAPW Heavyweight Champion Dan Maff put their titles on the line in a tag team match against the Hillbilly Wrecking Crew (Brodie Lee and Necro Butcher). In the end, Maff turned on Haas and hit him with a chair, after which Lee pinned him to win the JAPW New Jersey State Championship.

On September 10, 2010, Haas won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship by defeating Michael Faith in Amarillo. In May 2011, Haas took part in New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s first tour of the United States, the Invasion Tour 2011. In their opening show on May 13 in Rahway, New Jersey, Haas teamed with Rhyno in a tag team main event, where they defeated IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and Togi Makabe. The following day in New York City, Haas unsuccessfully challenged Tanahashi for his title. On August 20, 2011, Haas became the inaugural Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) Heavyweight Champion by defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. He held the championship for four months before losing it to Young on December 17.

===Ring of Honor (2010–2013)===

On September 11, 2010, Haas and Shelton Benjamin made their debut as Wrestling&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team in Ring of Honor (ROH) losing to The Kings of Wrestling at the Glory By Honor IX pay-per-view. They returned to ROH at the &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; television tapings on December 9, where they defeated the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance). The following day, at the second set of television tapings, Haas and Benjamin defeated the All-Night Xpress of Kenny King and Rhett Titus, and participated in an eight-man tag team match, teaming with the Briscoe Brothers against the Kings of Wrestling and the All-Night Xpress, which ended in a no contest. At the Final Battle 2010 pay-per-view on December 18, Haas and Benjamin announced they would be wrestling regularly for ROH in 2011. At the following pay-per-view, 9th Anniversary Show, on February 26, 2011, Haas and Benjamin defeated the Briscoe Brothers in the main event of the evening to earn another shot at the Kings of Wrestling and the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On April 1, at the first night of the Honor Takes Center Stage pay-per-view, Haas and Benjamin defeated the Kings of Wrestling to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On June 26 at Best in the World 2011, Haas and Benjamin successfully defended the ROH World Tag Team Championship in a four-way match against the Briscoe Brothers, the Kings of Wrestling and the All-Night Express. The following day ROH announced that both Haas and Benjamin had signed contracts with the promotion. At Final Battle 2011, Haas and Benjamin lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the Briscoes despite severely attacking them before the match started, turning them into villainous characters. On May 12, 2012, at Border Wars, Haas and Benjamin regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from the Briscoe Brothers. On June 24 at Best in the World 2012, Haas and Benjamin lost the title to Kenny King and Rhett Titus. Shortly after their loss, Benjamin was suspended in storyline, to explain his absence while wrestling in Japan. Benjamin returned at the Death Before Dishonor X pay-per-view, accompanying Haas and Rhett Titus in a tag team championship match. Following Death Before Dishonor, Haas and Benjamin would continue to feud with Titus and his new tag team partner B. J. Whitmer defeating them at Glory By Honor XI. They defeated them again in a street fight at Final Battle, where Haas won the match after sent BJ against a table. On February 2, 2013, Haas turned on Benjamin during an ROH World Tag Team Championship match against the Briscoe Brothers. He continued his feud with BJ, fighting in the 11th Anniversary Show in a No Holds Barred Match. BJ won the match when the referee stopped the match.

=== Late career (2013-present)===
On March 30, 2013, Haas announced his retirement from professional wrestling, which coincided with him leaving Ring of Honor. He returned to the ring several months later.

At JAPW 18th Anniversary Show in November 2014, Haas, Benjamin, and Angle reunited, as Team Angle, for the first time in 11 years. In the main event, Benjamin and Haas defeated Chris Sabin and Teddy Hart.

On the January 13, 2022 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Haas made his Impact Wrestling debut by challenging Josh Alexander to a match. The following week on &quot;Impact!!&quot;, Haas lost to Alexander, and after the match, they embraced in the middle of the ring.

== Personal life ==
Haas married fellow professional wrestler Jackie Gayda in 2005. The couple have four children, born in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. In December 2020, Haas announced that he and Gayda were divorced.

Following the death of his brother, Haas has wrestled with Russ (his brother&#x27;s name) written on his wrist tape as a tribute.

<text>Shelton James Benjamin (born July 9, 1975) is an American professional wrestler and former amateur wrestler. , he is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is a member of The Hurt Syndicate and is one-half of the AEW World Tag Team Champions with stablemate Bobby Lashley. Benjamin is best known for his tenures with WWE, first from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2017 to 2023. He is also known for his appearances in Ring of Honor (ROH), and in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah under the ring name Shelton X Benjamin.

Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, Benjamin was a two-sport athlete in college, having won an NJCAA championship in both track and field and collegiate wrestling. After attending junior college, he completed his degree from the University of Minnesota. Benjamin started his professional wrestling career in WWE&#x27;s developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he held the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship four times. WWE then moved him to the main roster in 2002, where he formed an alliance with Kurt Angle and Charlie Haas, known as Team Angle, and later, The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team with Haas. During his first tenure with the company, he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship three times, with his first title reign lasting 244 days, the longest reign in this century until 2023, the WWE United States Championship once, and the WWE Tag Team Championship two times with Haas.

== Amateur wrestling ==
Benjamin was born and raised in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He began wrestling his sophomore year at Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School. Benjamin recorded a 122–10 overall win–loss record in his high school wrestling career and was a two-time South Carolina heavyweight wrestling state champion (1993 &amp; 1994).

Benjamin then attended Lassen Community College in Susanville, California, winning National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) championships in wrestling and 100 meters. After his freshman year at Lassen, he briefly went to North Carolina State University on a full football scholarship in 1995, before returning back to finish out his sophomore year.

He then transferred to the University of Minnesota on a wrestling scholarship for his junior and senior years of college. He achieved All-American status twice in wrestling, placing fifth in the heavyweight division of the NCAA Championships in 1997, then improving to third place in 1998. After graduation, he served as an assistant wrestling coach at his alma mater and trained future Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) tag team partner Brock Lesnar. Benjamin thought about trying to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics but decided instead to pursue a professional wrestling career.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000–2010) ===

==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
On January 10, 2000, Benjamin signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was placed in its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). OVW booker Jim Cornette paired Benjamin with his former college roommate Brock Lesnar after he felt Lesnar was &quot;boring&quot; as a wrestler and had &quot;no personality&quot;, while Benjamin was &quot;exciting&quot;. Together, they were known as the &quot;Minnesota Stretching Crew,&quot; and they held the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. The first two reigns occurred during February and July 2001. They won the title for a third time from Rico Constantino and The Prototype on October 29, 2001. After Lesnar was called up to the main roster in November 2001, Benjamin formed a tag team with Redd Dogg Begnaud called &quot;The Dogg Pound&quot; and once again won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on July 17, 2002. Benjamin then wrestled at several house shows for the main WWE roster and eventually made his WWE television debut on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; as a face on July 29 defeating Justin Credible. A week later he defeated Shawn Stasiak on Heat. He was taken off WWE TV that September and returned to Ohio Valley.

==== Team Angle / World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (2002–2004) ====

Benjamin joined WWE&#x27;s SmackDown! brand on the December 26, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, forming an alliance with Charlie Haas with Olympic gold-medalist Kurt Angle as their mentor known as &quot;Team Angle&quot;. Their first televised match together in WWE was on the January 2, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; against Edge and Chris Benoit.

The duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship just a month after their debut by defeating the champions, Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero Jr.) on the February 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. They continued their feud with Benoit until No Way Out, when Benoit teamed with Brock Lesnar to defeat Team Angle. The two then went on to compete in their first WrestleMania match at WrestleMania XIX, retaining the WWE Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat match against Los Guerreros, and Chris Benoit and Rhyno. Team Angle later lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day in a ladder match. The storyline concluded on the June 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas and fired them from Team Angle. They then began referring to themselves as &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team&quot; and won the WWE Tag Team Championship back from Guerrero and Tajiri on the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. They lost the titles to Los Guerreros on the September 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after Benjamin suffered a legitimate knee injury during the match. Benjamin was sidelined for approximately one month, but the pair competed together again, taking part in a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XX.

==== Intercontinental Champion (2004–2006) ====
On the March 22, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 WWE draft lottery. After arriving, Benjamin quickly became a face when he scored an upset victory over Triple H. Benjamin then feuded with Triple H, beating him three times in total: once by pinfall, once by countout and once by disqualification. As part of the storyline, Benjamin then feuded with the other members of Triple H&#x27;s stable Evolution. Benjamin defeated Ric Flair at Backlash and lost to Randy Orton in an Intercontinental Championship match at Bad Blood.

During a match with Garrison Cade on &quot;Heat&quot;, Benjamin punched Cade&#x27;s knee brace, breaking his hand in the process and briefly taking him out of action. Benjamin returned in the fall of 2004 helping Randy Orton fight off Evolution and was later chosen by the fans to compete for the Intercontinental Championship in a match against then-champion Chris Jericho at Taboo Tuesday. Benjamin won the match, giving him his first singles title in the company. During his reign as Intercontinental Champion, Benjamin retained the title against challengers such as Christian at Survivor Series, Maven at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, and Chris Jericho at Backlash. On May 2, Benjamin faced and lost against Shawn Michaels in a critically acclaimed match. Benjamin lost the title to Carlito on the June 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (Carlito used the ropes during the pinfall), ending the longest Intercontinental Championship reign of that decade and the 21st century overall at 244 days (that record has since been broken by Gunther in 2023).

Benjamin was then depicted as having a &quot;losing streak&quot; over the next several weeks, which led to Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Momma&quot; (played by comedian/actress Thea Vidale) coming to &quot;Raw&quot; to confront Benjamin. Momma slapped and yelled at Benjamin every time he lost a match. Before long, she assisted Benjamin in his matches, often interfering on his behalf. This led to Benjamin turning heel for the second time in his career. In 2006, Benjamin then began a rivalry with then-Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair. On the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin defeated Flair to win his second Intercontinental Championship after Momma faked a heart problem, causing enough of a distraction to allow Benjamin to cheat and win the title. Benjamin continued to feud with Flair, but Momma no longer accompanied him to ringside. Benjamin explained her absence by stating that she was undergoing heart surgery in the hospital. She actually left due to being sexually harassed by someone in WWE.

Benjamin competed in the second Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 22. Benjamin then began a rivalry with Rob Van Dam, the winner of the match, in an attempt to take Van Dam&#x27;s Money in the Bank contract. During this time, Benjamin emphasized his new heel persona by now wearing shades, jewelry, and occasional colored shirts while entering the ring. At one point, Benjamin was defeated by his former tag team partner, the returning Charlie Haas, on the April 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A stipulation added to the match meant that due to this loss, Benjamin had to defend the Intercontinental Championship in the same match as his shot at Van Dam&#x27;s contract, meaning at Backlash it would be a &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; match. Van Dam won at Backlash and became Intercontinental Champion. On the May 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin regained the title from Van Dam in a Tornado Tag Team match, pitting Benjamin, Triple H and Chris Masters against Van Dam and WWE Champion John Cena; both the WWE Championship and WWE Intercontinental Championship could be won by whoever pinned the appropriate champion. Benjamin pinned Van Dam, picking up his third Intercontinental Championship. Subsequently, Benjamin feuded with Carlito and others for his Intercontinental Championship before losing the title to Johnny Nitro in a Triple Threat match also involving Carlito at Vengeance.

==== World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team reunion (2006–2007) ====

On the December 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin&#x27;s former tag team partner Charlie Haas came out to celebrate with Benjamin after he defeated Super Crazy. On the December 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin announced the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team was officially back in a segment with Cryme Tyme. They defeated The Highlanders in a match later that same night. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme, but were largely unsuccessful in defeating them, including a tag team turmoil match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 7, 2007, where they were eliminated by Cryme Tyme. Benjamin entered the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, but was eliminated by Shawn Michaels. They finally managed a win over Cryme Tyme, ending their undefeated streak, on the January 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

On the April 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team was unsuccessful in defeating the team of Ric Flair and Carlito, but defeated them in a rematch the following week when Haas distracted Carlito, allowing Benjamin to gain the pin over Flair. They won again two weeks later when Carlito turned on Flair, attacking him and allowing The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team to win via countout. They then challenged The Hardys for the World Tag Team Championship at One Night Stand in a ladder match, but were unsuccessful.

Following this, the World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team began a rivalry with Paul London and Brian Kendrick after losing to the duo in their debut match on the June 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A few weeks later, London defeated Benjamin in a singles match, however, on the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team got a tag team win over London and Kendrick to end the rivalry.

Benjamin and Haas then routinely competed against the teams of Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes and Super Crazy and Jim Duggan until November, when the team was disbanded due to Benjamin joining the ECW roster.

==== The Gold Standard (2007–2010) ====
On the November 20, 2007, airing of &quot;WWE ECW&quot;, Elijah Burke introduced Benjamin as the newest member of the ECW brand. Benjamin, who had dyed his hair blond before leaving &quot;Raw&quot;, began wearing gold wrestling attire and referring to himself as &quot;The Gold Standard&quot;. On &quot;ECW&quot;, Benjamin began once again receiving more airtime and higher profile matches, defeating Tommy Dreamer in his debut. Benjamin then qualified for the Royal Rumble match and won an over the top rope preview. Benjamin appeared in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, entering at number 17, but was eliminated by Shawn Michaels. He suffered his first loss since coming to ECW to Kane by count-out, on the January 29, 2008, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;. On the February 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Benjamin defeated Jimmy Wang Yang in a qualifying match for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXIV, which was won by CM Punk. After WrestleMania, Benjamin briefly feuded with Punk, before he began an on-screen rivalry with Kofi Kingston, who defeated Benjamin on the April 22 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;. On ECW&#x27;s 100th episode, however, Benjamin defeated Kingston, thus ending Kingston&#x27;s undefeated streak. To end the feud, Kingston then defeated Benjamin in an Extreme Rules match.

As part of the 2008 supplemental draft, Benjamin was drafted to the SmackDown brand. On the July 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Benjamin defeated United States Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match, earning himself a future title shot. At The Great American Bash, Benjamin once again defeated Hardy to win the United States Championship. Throughout his reign as champion, he retained the title several times against competitors such as R-Truth and Hurricane Helms. On the 500th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, on March 20, 2009, Benjamin lost his United States Championship to Montel Vontavious Porter, ending Benjamin&#x27;s reign at 240 days. Benjamin then participated in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 25, but failed to win as CM Punk won the match for the second year in a row. On June 29, 2009, Benjamin was traded to the ECW brand. The following night, Benjamin returned to the brand in a losing effort to the debuting Yoshi Tatsu. He defeated Tatsu in a rematch the following week on &quot;ECW&quot;. After a tag team match, Benjamin abandoned his partner Zack Ryder during a tag team match, turning Benjamin face for the first time since 2006. He would soon feud with Ryder and Sheamus over the following weeks. Benjamin and Sheamus began feuding with and traded wins against each other on &quot;ECW&quot; and &quot;Superstars&quot; and the feud lasted until Sheamus was moved to the Raw brand on October 26. The next night on &quot;ECW&quot;, Benjamin lost to Sheamus in Sheamus&#x27; final match on the brand.

Benjamin wrestled Christian at for the ECW Championship in a ladder match, but came up on the losing end. At the Royal Rumble on January 31, 2010, Benjamin entered the Royal Rumble match at entry number 20, but was eliminated by John Cena in under a minute. On the final episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Benjamin formed an alliance with Vladimir Kozlov. Together, they defeated three members of the ECW roster: Vance Archer, Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta. On the February 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Benjamin returned to the SmackDown brand and once again qualified for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI, beating CM Punk. However, Benjamin failed to win the match. He defeated the returning Joey Mercury in his last match at the &quot;SmackDown&quot; tapings on April 20 in a dark match. On April 22, Benjamin was released from his WWE contract, ending his decade-long tenure with the company.

The following week on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, the duo turned heel when they insulted the referee of their title match the week before, demoralized the fans, and accused general manager Daniel Bryan of being biased, which resulted in Bryan booking them for a two out of three falls match against The Usos at Royal Rumble, where they lost in two straight falls. At WrestleMania 34 on April 8, Benjamin competed alongside Gable in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, but neither won. On April 16, Gable would be traded to &quot;Raw&quot; during the 2018 WWE Superstar Shake-up, thus disbanding the team.

This would also make him a 3-time WWE (Raw) Tag Team Champion. Benjamin and Alexander would later drop the titles back to Kingston and Woods on the March 15 episode of Raw.

On the March 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lashley lambasted Alexander and Benjamin due to them losing the Raw Tag Team Championships and losing to Drew McIntyre in a 2-on-1 handicap match, a loss that meant they would be barred from ringside at Lashley&#x27;s WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 37 against McIntyre. This led to Lashley attacking Alexander and Benjamin, thus kicking them out of the faction in the process. They started a losing streak, lost to the teams such as The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar) twice, and to RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) once. On the May 3 episode of Raw, Alexander turned on Benjamin after losing to Lucha House Party. On the May 10 episode of Raw, Benjamin fought Alexander in a match with Alexander losing to Benjamin.

On the February 6 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Benjamin and Alexander defeated Alpha Academy with MVP in their corner further hinting at a possible reunion. However, the reunion angle was quietly dropped shortly after although Alexander and Benjamin would continue teaming together.

Benjamin was released from his WWE contract on September 21, 2023, ending his second tenure of six years with the company and effectively disbanding the tag team of Alexander and Benjamin.

On the October 16 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Benjamin made his AEW in-ring debut, where he defeated Lio Rush. On October 30 at Fright Night Dynamite, Benjamin was defeated by Swerve Strickland, suffering his first loss in AEW. After the match, Benjamin, MVP, and a debuting Bobby Lashley attacked Strickland, with Lashley subsequently joining The Hurt Syndicate. On November 24, Benjamin was announced as a participant in the 2024 Continental Classic, where he was placed in the Blue league. Benjamin finished the tournament with 6 points, but failed to advance to the playoff stage.

On the January 22, 2025 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Benjamin and Lashley defeated Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) to win the AEW World Tag Team Championship. On the February 12 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Benjamin and Lashley defeated The Gunns (Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn) in their first title defense.

== Personal life ==
Benjamin is a fan of video games. He won WWE&#x27;s THQ Superstar Challenge, a video game tournament that took place every year during WrestleMania weekend, four years in a row before retiring from the event in 2007. He has the Guinness World Record for &quot;wrestler who won the most WWE THQ Superstar Challenges&quot;. In April 2020, during the nationwide quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Benjamin jokingly asked parents via Twitter to keep their children from playing online games due to younger players beating his records.

Since 2002, Benjamin has maintained a close friendship with Charlie Haas, who often refers to him as his &quot;brother.&quot; He served as the best man at Haas and Jackie Gayda&#x27;s wedding, and is the godfather to Haas&#x27; oldest daughter. Benjamin is also close friends with Brock Lesnar, having met him at the University of Minnesota and roomed with him. He once let Lesnar stay in his basement when Lesnar was out of money. In 2004, Benjamin visited Four Dwellings Primary School in Birmingham, UK, to teach students about reading week.

Benjamin, along with Candice Michelle, Dave Bautista and Josh Mathews, represented WWE at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, in an effort to encourage fans to register to vote in the 2008 Presidential election.

Benjamin has revealed on Lilian Garcia&#x27;s podcast &quot;Chasing Glory&quot; in 2020 that he has two daughters.

Benjamin has said he has vertigo, which can make his in-ring performance difficult.

<doc id="439251" wikidata="Q7291842" url="?curid=439251" title="Randolph Jefferson">
<text>Randolph Jefferson (October 1, 1755 – August 7, 1815) was the younger brother of Thomas Jefferson, the only male sibling to survive infancy. He was a planter and owner of the Snowden plantation that he inherited from his father. He served the local militia for about ten years, making captain of the local militia in 1794. He also served during the Revolutionary War.

Randolph, known as &quot;Uncle Randolph&quot; when he visited Monticello, was considered as a candidate for the father of Sally Hemings&#x27;s children following DNA studies that found that the Hemings children descended from the Jefferson line. The theory that Randolph Jefferson fathered Hemings children is discounted by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation and most scholars of Jefferson, given that evidence strongly suggests Randolph was not physically present at Monticello at any of the periods in question. Upon a through review of the archival record, oral history, and genetic science, Thomas Jefferson, though, was found by The Monticello Jefferson-Hemings Report (2000) to be the likely father of Sally Hemings&#x27; children. Other scholars contend otherwise and find Randolph an attractive candidate.

== Early life ==
Born at Shadwell, the Jefferson family plantation in Albemarle County, Virginia, his parents were Peter Jefferson, who died when Randolph was two years old, and Jane Randolph Jefferson. He was a twin to Anne Scott Jefferson and the only male sibling of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s to survive infancy. The twins were Thomas&#x27; youngest siblings, about 13 years younger than him. After Peter Jefferson&#x27;s death, and while Randolph was a child, his affairs were managed by John Harvie Sr., the executor of Peter Jefferson&#x27;s estate. After he died, his brother Thomas managed his affairs, such as his education and property, until he came of age in 1776. He assisted in management of his younger brother&#x27;s affairs after 1776.

In 1764 and 1765, Randolph Jefferson studied with Ben Snead at the residence of his uncle Charles Lewis, Jr. and aunt Mary Randolph Lewis at Buck Island, which was a 960-acre tract located near Monticello and the Rivanna River in Albemarle County. He lived again at Shadwell with his mother in 1769, when he was taught by Patrick Morton. In 1770, the main house at Shadwell was destroyed in a fire, and his mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, had a house built there as a replacement. He left Shadwell for Williamsburg when he was 16 to reside and study at the College of William &amp; Mary from October 1771 until September 1772. He attended The Grammar School at the College of William &amp; Mary and was tutored in higher subjects by Thomas Gwatkin, who taught mathematics and natural philosophy at the college. Additionally, he took violin lessons from Frances Alberti, as did his brother. Randolph Jefferson continued to “fiddle” throughout his life and willed his violin to his son, Robert Lewis Jefferson. 
== Description ==
Thomas Jefferson described Randolph posthumously in a deposition that was taken as Randolph&#x27;s sons contested the will that favored their stepmother, Mitchie Pryor Jefferson. Thomas was considerate and affectionate toward Randolph; they addressed each other as &quot;Dear Brother,&quot; and exchanged visits and services with each other. Letters document that Thomas lent Randolph the harness for a gig, had his watch repaired, gave him a dog, sent him vegetable seeds, and gave him a spinning jenny. At Monticello, he was called &quot;Uncle Randolph&quot;. A former Monticello enslaved man, Isaac Jefferson, recalled in 1847 that Randolph &quot;used to come out among black people, play the fiddle and dance half the night...&quot;

Historian Dumas Malone states that Randolph did not share his older brother&#x27;s eloquence. His letters to Thomas show a disregard of grammar and the use of colloquialisms such as &quot;tech&quot; instead of &quot;touch.&quot; His &quot;rustic sense of humor&quot; may have caused people to underestimate his intelligence, yet he lacked his brother&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.

==Military service==

In 1776, Randolph Jefferson served in Captain Wingfield&#x27;s Company of the Albemarle militia. He served with William Fossett and Joseph Nielson who had worked at Monticello and had live-in relationships with members of the Hemings family. He was a member of the local militia in 1779.

Along with his brother, Jefferson signed an Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1777, He, his brother, and Charles Lewis also signed the Albemarle County Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth on April 21, 1779. It was also called the Albemarle Declaration of Independence.

During the Revolutionary War (1775–1783), he served under General Thomas Nelson with the Virginia Light Dragoons. In the fight against Tarleton, in the summer of 1781, he provided provisions for the Virginia troops, volunteered a slave from Snowden to help move items from military stores at Scotts Ferry in Albemarle County to Bedford County, and allowed the 3rd Regiment of Light Dragoons to camp at Snowden for over a month and a half.

Following the war, Jefferson served in the Buckingham County Militia, achieving the rank of Lieutenant in 1787 and, in 1794, was recommended to rank of Captain. After at least nine years of service in the Militia, Randolph&#x27;s reason for not continuing remains a mystery. He was content to enjoy the title of Captain the remainder of his life.

==Plantation owner==
In 1776, Randolph inherited the Snowden plantation in Buckingham County, Virginia. with 2,291⅔ acres called &quot;Fluvanna lands&quot; located near the Hardware River and Scottsville, from his father, Peter Jefferson&#x27;s estate. More specifically, the plantation was located along the James River, about twenty miles south of Monticello and across from Scott&#x27;s Ferry and on the south side of Horseshoe Bend. His life at Snowden was relatively simple compared to life at Monticello; however, he was an affluent planter and dependent on enslaved labor. He had 2,000 acres, 30 slaves, 6 horses, and 42 cattle in 1782. Months after Randolph&#x27;s death, the dwelling house at Snowden burned to the ground. Ultimately, none of Randolph Jefferson&#x27;s sons could afford to purchase Snowden from their father&#x27;s estate and it was sold to Capt. John Harris of Albemarle County. Most of them, eventually settled nearby in Scottsville, Albemarle and Fluvanna County, Virginia. 

==Marriage and family==
On July 30, 1781, Jefferson married his first cousin, Anne Lewis, the daughter of Colonel Charles Lewis of Buck Island and Mary Randolph, the sister of Jane Randolph Jefferson. Isham Randolph of Dungeness was the grandfather of both Randolph Jefferson and Anne Jefferson Lewis. They had six children: Thomas, Robert Lewis, Peter Field, Isham Randolph, James Lilburne and Anna Scott. Anna Scott Jefferson married Zachariah Nevil (d.1830), who represented Nelson County in the Virginia state legislature.

Randolph was a widower for about ten years after his wife died about 1799. He periodically suffered from ill health beginning in 1807, which precluded his ability to travel at times. Randolph remarried about 1809 to Mitchie Ballow Pryor of Buckingham County, who did not get along with her stepsons and convinced Randolph to favor her in a rewrite of his will that was dated May 28, 1808. Mitchie, whose father was David Pryor, was in her early twenties, perhaps not yet age 21, when she married Randolph, who was in his mid-50s. She created disruption within the Jefferson family, including communicating her concerns about Randolph&#x27;s management of the Snowden estate with her brother-in-law, Thomas Jefferson. She was also prone to heavy spending, responsible for large bills with local merchants. She conceived a son named John before Randolph died at Snowden on August 17, 1815. Randolph suffered an illness in the Spring of 1815, but told his brother in June of that year that he was feeling fine and was involved in the wheat harvest. Randolph&#x27;s sons and Thomas Jefferson tried to break Randolph&#x27;s last will, which favored Mitchie. Mitchie and John then moved to Tennessee, where John died unmarried at age 29. Randolph&#x27;s will called for his property to be sold and the funds divided up among his sons and his slaves were to stay with the family.

==Suggested paternity of Sally Hemings&#x27;s children==
The Jefferson–Hemings controversy concerns the question of whether U.S. President Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children of Sally Hemings, a mixed-race slave. Alternate theories suggest that Randolph Jefferson, or his nephew, Peter Carr, fathered the Hemings children. Carr, though, was ruled out in genetic testing — but there was a match to the Jefferson male line to descendants of Sally Hemings&#x27; son Eston. 

The DNA study, published in &quot;Nature&quot; on November 5, 1998, titled &quot;Jefferson Fathered Slave&#x27;s Last Child&quot;, led to speculation about whether Randolph was the Jefferson who fathered the Hemings children. The Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, formed in 1999, commissioned its own independent scholars&#x27; report that was completed in 2001. While the report suggested that Randolph Jefferson, or one of his sons, could have fathered Hemings&#x27;s children, it is more likely that Thomas Jefferson was the father. Noting that Thomas Jefferson invited Randolph to Monticello 15 days before Eston&#x27;s estimated date of conception, that an oral tradition among Eston&#x27;s descendants identified their ancestor not as Thomas Jefferson, but rather as an &quot;uncle&quot; (at Monticello Randolph was called &quot;Uncle Randolph&quot;), that enslaved Monticello blacksmith Isaac Jefferson reported that Randolph socialized with the Monticello slaves, and that Randolph (a widower at the time of Eston&#x27;s conception) was reported to have fathered children with other enslaved women, a 13-member Scholars&#x27; Commission chaired by University of Virginia Law School professor Robert F. Turner concluded in a report issued in April 2001, that Randolph was likely the father of Eston Hemings.

<text>Scott Oliver Hall (October 20, 1958 – March 14, 2022) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his tenures with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) under the ring name Razor Ramon.

Born in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, Hall began his career in 1984. He rose to prominence after signing with the WWF in May 1992, assuming the name Razor Ramon. While within the company, he won the WWF Intercontinental Championship four times. He departed the company in May 1996, and subsequently signed with rival promotion WCW, where he became a founding member of the New World Order (nWo) faction, along with Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash. In the company, he became a two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCW World Television Champion, and a seven-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. He left WCW in February 2000, returning to the WWF (later renamed WWE) for a brief stint in 2002.

He spent the rest of his career wrestling for various promotions, such as Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he held the TNA World Tag Team Championship once, with Kevin Nash and Eric Young. He wrestled his final match in June 2016. Although he never won a world championship in a major promotion, Hall held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once for the Puerto Rico–based promotion World Wrestling Council. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a singles competitor in 2014, and as a member of the nWo in 2020. Hall struggled with alcoholism and substance abuse for much of his career and later life, and died in March 2022, at the age of 63.

== Early life ==
Hall was born in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, on October 20, 1958. He grew up as a military brat, attending high school in Munich and moving once every year before he was 15.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1984–1985) ===
Hall began his career in 1984 in the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s (NWA) Florida territory Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) and soon began a feud with Dusty Rhodes. He and Dan Spivey trained together in Florida (mainly under Rhodes, but also under Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham). When it was time for the two to debut as a tag team, Rhodes sent them to work in Jim Crockett Jr.&#x27;s Charlotte, North Carolina–based territory. They debuted as American Starship, Hall under the ring name Starship Coyote and Spivey under the ring name Starship Eagle.

At first, American Starship were booked to wrestle infrequently, so much so that the two were given ground crew jobs for the Charlotte Orioles (which Jim Crockett owned at the time). When they did get in the ring, it was with little success. The highlight of their stay in Crockett&#x27;s Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling was a losing challenge to Arn and Ole Anderson for the NWA National Tag Team Championship. After leaving Crockett, the duo joined Bob Geigel&#x27;s NWA Central States territory (based in Kansas City) in 1985.

They received a shot at NWA Central States Tag Team Champions Marty Jannetty and &quot;Bulldog&quot; Bob Brown, but lost the match. Dan Spivey&#x27;s stay in the Central States territory was brief. He returned to the Carolinas and Crockett, jobbing in the freshly rebranded Jim Crockett Promotions as &quot;American Starship&quot; Eagle. Hall, meanwhile, stayed in Central States.

=== American Wrestling Association (1985–1989) ===

Hall joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1985, where he wrestled as &quot;Magnum&quot; Scott Hall and, later, &quot;Big&quot; Scott Hall. He wrestled as a babyface wrestler. Verne Gagne, the owner and promoter of the AWA, had wanted to push Hall to the same heights as he had Hulk Hogan, following Hogan&#x27;s departure for Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Gagne had Hall use mannerisms and moves similar to Hogan. Hall also traveled to Japan, where he wrestled several matches for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) between 1987 and 1990.

Hall formed a tag team with his more experienced friend Curt Hennig, whom he later would credit for cultivating his early professional wrestling career. The team defeated Jimmy Garvin and Steve Regal for the AWA World Tag Team Championship on January 18, 1986, in a 58-minute match in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The champions defended against such challengers as Buddy Rose and Doug Somers, Nord the Barbarian and Boris Zhukov, and Bill and Scott Irwin. They lost the belts to Rose and Somers by countout (an unusual and unexplained deviation from the standard rule of pro wrestling) on May 17, after interference by Colonel DeBeers. After losing the title, Hall and Hennig soon parted ways. Hall then received shots at the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, against Stan Hansen and Rick Martel. Although Gagne wanted to put the belt on Hall, Hall hated the cold weather in the territory, recognized the AWA as a &quot;sinking ship&quot;, and left for the NWA in 1989.

=== World Wrestling Federation Tryouts (1987, 1990) ===
Hall received a tryout at a house show in August 1987 teaming with Jerry Allen losing to Iron Mike Sharpe and Barry Horowitz. On January 23, 1990, Hall received another tryout at a &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping in Fort Myers, Florida. At the event, Hall was defeated by Paul Roma, and was not signed by the company.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989) ===
Hall was brought into the NWA&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW) territory by Jim Ross in 1989, as part of the NWA&#x27;s initiative to develop new, young stars (also including Brian Pillman and Sid Vicious). He made his debut on the June 3 edition of World Championship Wrestling (the predecessor to WCW Saturday Night) in a vignette that showed Scott &quot;Gator&quot; Hall swimming and playing volleyball at a beach, riding boats, fishing, and scaring alligators. His in-ring debut came on June 16 on a house show in Cleveland, OH, where he teamed with Randy Rose in a losing effort against WCW World Tag-Team Champions The Freebirds. While waiting for his first television match, he continued to wrestle on the road and was winless in tag-team and singles action, facing Norman, The Freebirds, and former tag partner, Dan Spivey. Hall finally gained his first victory on June 29 when he pinned Rip Morgan in Salisbury, MD, and then entered a successful house show series with Bill Irwin.

His television debut finally came on the July 9 edition of World Championship Wrestling where he was pinned by The Great Muta. On the July 9 edition of WCW Pro he faced Terry Funk and was defeated. His PPV debut came at The Great American Bash: The Glory Days, where he participated in a King of the Hill battle royal. He then began jobbing regularly, losing to The Great Muta, Mike Rotunda, Sid Vicious, Ron Simmons, and Butch Reed. His final match came on November 7 when he was defeated by Butch Reed at a house show in Chicago, IL. After this, he went on hiatus.

=== International promotions (1990–1991) ===
Shortly afterwards Hall joined New Japan Pro-Wrestling, teaming with Larry Cameron and defeating Hiroshi Hase &amp; Kuniaki Kobayashi March 2, 1990, at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. He wrestled numerous times for the company, facing a diverse group of opponents including Bam Bam Bigelow, Koji Kitao, Nord the Barbarian, and Shinya Hashimoto.

Scott Hall, as Texas Scott, competed for the Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) at the &quot;Catch Cup &#x27;90&quot; tournament on December 22, 1990, in Bremen, Germany before 6,000 fans. Hall was defeated by the Soul Taker in the tournament final.

From 1990 to 1991, Hall had a stint in the Puerto Rican promotion World Wrestling Council (WWC). On March 3, he defeated Miguel Pérez, Jr. for the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship. He lost it to Super Medic III on April 20.

=== Return to WCW (1991–1992) ===

After wrestling a dark match on April 29, 1991, in Atlanta, GA at a taping of World Championship Wrestling, Hall made his official return to WCW and was renamed &quot;The Diamond Studd&quot;, a gimmick similar to Rick Rude&#x27;s (both were cocky, vain and would invite attractive women from the audience into the ring). He was managed by Diamond Dallas Page, and made his first appearance on May 19 at SuperBrawl 1. In his debut match, he squashed Tommy Rich on the June 14 episode of &quot;Clash of the Champions XV: Knocksville USA&quot;. He defeated Tom Zenk at The Great American Bash. It was during his time as &quot;The Diamond Studd&quot; that he also began sporting his trademark toothpicks and also debuted his trademark toothpick fling at television cameras; Page has publicly stated that he got the idea for Hall&#x27;s on-screen toothpick after the two used toothpicks at a Waffle House and that he was originally supposed to flick toothpicks at cameras with Hall, but couldn&#x27;t because one fell out of his mouth before the first toothpick promo. At &quot;Clash of the Champions XVI: Fall Brawl&quot; on September 2, The Diamond Studd lost to Ron Simmons. At Halloween Havoc 1991, the team of Studd, Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack, and Big Van Vader lost to Sting, El Gigante, and The Steiner Brothers in a &quot;Chamber of Horrors Match&quot;. On the November 19 episode of &quot;Clash of the Champions XVII&quot;, Studd lost to Zenk in a rematch from The Great American Bash.

After an injury sidelined him for Starrcade in December 1991, Studd entered 1992 forming short-lived tag teams with Vinnie Vegas and Scotty Flamingo (as part of The Diamond Mine stable), as well as with members of Paul E. Dangerously&#x27;s Dangerous Alliance. Studd began a feud with Dustin Rhodes in April 1992 when he interfered in two televised matches Rhodes had with Bobby Eaton. The idea of adding him to the Dangerous Alliance was contemplated, but fell through, and Hall left WCW shortly after a final televised match against Rob Campbell on May 8.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1992–1996) ===
==== Debut and various feuds (1992–1993) ====

Hall joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) later that month, as &quot;Razor Ramon&quot;, a shady and stylish Cuban American bully from Miami. The character was modeled after the characters Tony Montana and Manny Ribera from the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. Ramon&#x27;s nickname (The Bad Guy) and catchphrase (&quot;Say hello to The Bad Guy&quot;) derived from Montana&#x27;s quotes: &quot;Say hello to my little friend&quot; and &quot;Say goodnight to the bad guy&quot;. However, &quot;Inside The Ropes&quot; journalist Adam Morrison noted in March 2022 that Hall&#x27;s Razor Ramon character also maintained &quot;cocky and cool&quot; aspects which were similar to his WCW &quot;Diamond Studd&quot; character. Morrison also stated that Hall&#x27;s Diamond Studd character &quot;laid the very foundations upon which he would create ‘The Bad Guy’ under Vince McMahon&#x27;s empire.&quot;

He made his first appearance as Razor Ramon in a dark match on a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping against Chris Hahn on May 18, 1992. Later in his career, Hall claimed he pitched the idea of a &quot;Scarface&quot;-like character during a meeting with Vince McMahon and Pat Patterson, as a joke. Hall quoted lines from the movie with a Cuban accent and gave ideas for vignettes that would recreate several of the movie’s scenes, such as driving around South Florida in a convertible with a leopard-skin interior. Although taken right from the movie, Hall claims McMahon and Patterson were nevertheless floored by the ideas and called him a &quot;genius&quot;. Hall later learned that McMahon and Patterson had neither seen nor heard of the movie, and believed that Hall was coming up with the ideas himself. Patterson and McMahon came up with the name &quot;Razor&quot;, but agreed with Hall&#x27;s suggestion that it should be a nickname, and that the character should have a proper given name. Hall later asked Tito Santana for a Latino-sounding name that started with &quot;R&quot;. Santana suggested &quot;Ramon&quot;, Hall brought it back to McMahon and the name stuck. The Razor Ramon logo and costume were designed by Tom Fleming.

After weeks of introductory vignettes, Razor Ramon made his in-ring debut on the August 8, 1992, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, defeating local jobber Paul Van Dale (the father of future WWE wrestler Carmella) with his finishing move, &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (previously called &quot;The Diamond Death Drop&quot; in WCW). Early on, Ramon wore large gold chain necklaces to the ring. While handing them to an attendant at ringside he would threaten &quot;Something happens to this, something gonna happen to you&quot;, and then flick his toothpick at the hapless attendant.

Razor&#x27;s first major angle began on the September 14 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, when he interfered in a WWF Championship match between champion Randy Savage and Ric Flair, attacking Savage on the floor and enabling Flair to win the title. As a result, Razor and Savage started a feud, which later involved The Ultimate Warrior, after Warrior saved Savage from a post-match beating by Razor. Razor and Flair were scheduled to face The Ultimate Maniacs (Savage and Warrior) at Survivor Series. Warrior was fired from the WWF prior to the event and replaced by Flair&#x27;s &quot;executive consultant&quot;, Mr. Perfect. Razor and Flair lost to Savage and Perfect via disqualification, for constantly double-teaming them.

WWF Champion Bret Hart was scheduled to defend his title against The Ultimate Warrior at the Royal Rumble, but Razor Ramon replaced Warrior after the latter left the company. During the feud, Razor verbally disrespected Hart and the Hart wrestling family. Razor lost to Hart at the Royal Rumble, submitting to the Sharpshooter. Razor made his WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania IX, pinning former WWF Champion Bob Backlund with a roll-up.

On the May 17 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; he suffered an upset loss to jobber &quot;The Kid&quot; (who consequently became known as &quot;The 1–2–3 Kid&quot;), beginning a feud between the two. It carried into the King of the Ring tournament and triggered a slow fan favorite turn for Razor, as he gained respect for The 1–2–3 Kid and support from the crowd. Ted DiBiase showed no respect for Razor, making fun of him for losing to such a small jobber. Ramon helped The 1–2–3 Kid defeat DiBiase, solidifying his face turn. The feud culminated at SummerSlam, where Ramon defeated DiBiase in DiBiase&#x27;s final WWF match.

==== Record-setting Intercontinental Champion (1993–1996) ====

On the October 4, 1993, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, a 20-man battle royal was held; the last two participants would face each other the next week for the vacant WWF Intercontinental Championship. Razor and Rick Martel were those final two. The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Razor pinned Martel after a Razor&#x27;s Edge to win the Intercontinental Championship.

Razor Ramon successfully defended his title against Irwin R. Schyster at Royal Rumble 1994. He also began a feud with Shawn Michaels over which man had the stronger claim to the Intercontinental Championship. Michaels had been stripped of the title months before due to &quot;inactivity&quot; (he was actually suspended during that time). He returned to television with his own version of the belt, claiming he was still the champion, since he hadn&#x27;t been beaten for it. The matter was settled when Ramon defeated Michaels in a ladder match at WrestleMania X, becoming the undisputed Intercontinental Champion after retrieving both belts. This match was critically acclaimed, and was voted as the Match of the Year for 1994 by readers of &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;, and it was also the first WWF match to receive a five star rating from sports journalist Dave Meltzer in his &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. On WWE.com, this match is ranked No. 5 of the Top 24 Matches in WrestleMania History.

Razor continued to feud with Michaels and his bodyguard Diesel. On the April 30 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, he lost the Intercontinental Title to Diesel, after interference from Michaels. At SummerSlam, Razor (with Walter Payton in his corner) defeated Diesel to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship for a second time, after Shawn Michaels accidentally hit Diesel with Sweet Chin Music.

At Survivor Series, he captained a team called &quot;The Bad Guys&quot;, consisting of himself, The 1–2–3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Fatu and Sione). They faced The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Jeff Jarrett). Ramon ended up the sole survivor of the match. This began a feud with Jeff Jarrett, which led into the next year. At the 1995 Royal Rumble, Razor lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jarrett, in controversial fashion; Jarrett had originally won the match by count-out, but demanded that the match be restarted so he could win the title. It was, and Jarrett pinned Razor with a small package.

Razor faced Jarrett in a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania XI, winning by disqualification when Jarrett&#x27;s assistant The Roadie interfered. Jarrett retained the title, as a title cannot change hands by countout or disqualification. Razor defeated Jarrett and The Roadie at In Your House 1, in a handicap match.

Razor defeated Jarrett in a ladder match at a May 19, 1995 house show to win his third WWF Intercontinental Championship. Razor Ramon was the first man to win the Intercontinental Title three times. On May 22, he re-lost the title to Jarrett. On June 9, Razor suffered a rib injury during a ladder match rematch against Jarrett. Around this time, he had formed a team with Savio Vega, and Vega replaced Razor to defeat Irwin R. Schyster in the Free for All tournament match before the King of the Ring pay-per-view. Razor managed Vega throughout the tournament. He lost to Mabel in the final match. Razor and Vega lost to Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo) at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks, and lost a WWF (World) Tag Team Championship match to Owen Hart and Yokozuna on the August 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

Razor had an Intercontinental Championship ladder match (a rematch from WrestleMania X) against the new champion Shawn Michaels at SummerSlam, but lost. He then began a feud with Dean Douglas. Razor defeated Douglas at In Your House 4 to win the Intercontinental Championship, after Michaels had just forfeited the title to Douglas. This win made him the first four-time Intercontinental Champion in WWF history.

In early 1996, Razor feuded with newcomer Goldust, leading to an Intercontinental Championship match at the Royal Rumble. Razor lost the title to Goldust after Razor&#x27;s former partner The 1–2–3 Kid attacked him. Ramon was originally scheduled to face Goldust in a rematch for the title at WrestleMania XII in a Miami Street Fight, but Hall was suspended for six weeks by the WWF due to his drug use. Reporting at the time had Hall as already having given his notice via telegram as he looked to leave for WCW. The suspension meant he would sit out the rest of his contractual obligations and miss the opportunity to receive the higher Wrestlemania payday. Hall returned to WWF television at April&#x27;s In Your House 7, where he lost to Vader.

By March, rumors ran that the WWF would protect the Razor Ramon character from being used by Hall as being their own intellectual property. It became true in September 1996 in the form of Rick Bognar playing the part of Razor as part of a revenge storyline where the return of &quot;Razor Ramon&quot; was revealed by an angered Jim Ross.

He became associated with the backstage group known as The Kliq (also consisting of Kevin Nash (Diesel), Paul Levesque (Hunter Hearst Helmsley), Shawn Michaels, and Sean Waltman (The 1–2–3 Kid)). Hall was involved in an incident dubbed the &quot;Curtain Call&quot; at a MSG show in May 1996. Because Hall and fellow Kliq member Kevin Nash were departing for WCW, the pair (along with Michaels and Levesque) broke kayfabe by celebrating and embracing in the ring together, though the characters they portrayed were supposed to be enemies. According to Hall, he went to WCW not for the money, but because they offered him days off. Other reporting claimed he resigned due to being unhappy with his booking and a drop in yearly pay from 1994 to 1995.

=== Second return to WCW (1996–2000) ===
==== New World Order (1996–1998) ====

Hall&#x27;s first appearance on the WCW television show after leaving WWF was an unannounced promo on May 27, 1996, appearing from the crowd in street clothes and claimed to be &quot;an outsider&quot;. On June 10, he was joined by Kevin Nash. They stated they were undertaking a hostile takeover of WCW, then slammed interviewer Eric Bischoff through the commentator&#x27;s table. The angle paralleled the real-life competition between WCW and the WWF. At Bash at the Beach, Nash and Hall (now known as The Outsiders) challenged Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage to a six-man tag team match, saying they had a mystery partner. That partner turned out to be Hulk Hogan, and the three formed the New World Order (nWo). The stable stormed WCW, recruiting such stars as Syxx (formerly 1-2-3 Kid) and The Giant.

The Outsiders closed out 1996 with a victory over Sting and Lex Luger at Hog Wild, and a WarGames match win at Fall Brawl. They defeated Harlem Heat at Halloween Havoc for their first WCW World Tag Team Championship. They successfully defended the title against The Nasty Boys and The Faces of Fear in a three-way match at World War 3, and then again defeated The Faces of Fear at Starrcade. They lost the title to The Steiner Brothers at Souled Out, but two days later Eric Bischoff returned the title due to the fact that the referee was not the official referee for the match. The Outsiders held the World Tag Team Championship from February 24, 1997, to October 13, 1997, often facing The Steiner Brothers, Lex Luger and The Giant, and combinations of The Four Horsemen. In May 1997, Hall and Nash teamed with Masahiro Chono to defeat the Steiner Brothers and Keiji Mutoh at New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)&#x27;s Strong Style Evolution in the Osaka Dome.

In late March 1997, Hall failed a drug test and was forced into a rehab and was written off television for a month which forced him to miss Spring Stampede, Hall came back on the April 21st edition of Monday Nitro.

Since Eric Bischoff (the Executive Vice President of WCW) was a member of the nWo, he used his power to return the title to The Outsiders on a technicality whenever they lost it. The Outsiders would also use the Freebird Rule to defend their title. With Nash and Syxx out with injuries, Hall mostly wrestled singles matches in the last quarter of 1997, and in one of them he submitted to Lex Luger in a grudge match at Halloween Havoc, with Larry Zbyszko as the guest referee. Hall won the 60-man battle royal at World War 3 in November 1997 to earn a shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

On the January 12, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, The Outsiders defeated The Steiner Brothers to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship for a fourth time. Hall wrestled Larry Zbyszko at Souled Out and lost by disqualification. The Outsiders lost the title back to The Steiner Brothers on the February 9 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. At SuperBrawl VIII, The Outsiders won the WCW World Tag Team Championship for a fifth time, again by defeating The Steiner Brothers. At Uncensored, Hall got his WCW World Heavyweight Championship shot against Sting, losing the match despite interference on his behalf from Dusty Rhodes. Hall was (legitimately) taken off TV for a short while and forced by WCW to enter rehab, after he and Nash showed up to the March 16, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; heavily intoxicated and under the influence of painkillers. While Hall was absent, the nWo split into two feuding factions. At Slamboree, Hall returned to team with Kevin Nash, for a tag team title defense against Sting and The Giant. Hall turned on Nash, costing them the title, and switched sides to align himself with Hulk Hogan and his splinter faction, nWo Hollywood.

On the July 6 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall was handpicked by Hogan to wrestle United States Heavyweight Champion Bill Goldberg. Hall lost the match, giving Goldberg a shot at Hogan&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship later that night (which Goldberg won). Hogan publicly blamed Hall for the loss, and Hall was treated as a &quot;weak link&quot; by the rest of the nWo, especially Scott Steiner. On July 13, Hogan challenged Hall to a match on &quot;Nitro&quot;, during which Kevin Nash (leader of the nWo &quot;Wolfpac&quot; faction) interfered, but as he was apparently about to Jacknife Powerbomb Hogan and regain Hall as his friend, Hall viciously attacked him, proving his allegiance to Hogan and nWo Hollywood. In the following weeks, Hall mocked Nash, calling himself &quot;Medium Sexy (later &quot;Super Sexy&quot;), the Nash Killer&quot;. On the July 20 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall (with The Giant) won the WCW World Tag Team Championship for a sixth time, defeating Sting and Nash after outside interference from Bret Hart (who was feuding with Sting at the time). This reign ended at Halloween Havoc, when Rick Steiner defeated The Giant and Scott Steiner (who replaced Hall) to win the title, even after Rick&#x27;s partner Buff Bagwell had turned on him. Hall and Nash faced each other on October 25 at Halloween Havoc. After hitting Hall with two Jacknife Powerbombs, Nash left the ring and lost the match by countout, in what was described by the commentators as an act of mercy.

Hall was ejected from nWo Hollywood in late 1998, after Scott Steiner took control of the group in Hogan&#x27;s absence, and then referred to himself as &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot;. On November 30, 1998, Hall needed a tag team partner to face Steiner and Horace Hogan. Initially, Hall said he would do it alone, but Kevin Nash came to the entrance and offered his help. The team (no longer billed as The Outsiders) won the match. At Starrcade, Hall, disguised as a security guard, used a stun gun on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg during his title defense against Kevin Nash. Not having seen the interference, Nash powerbombed and covered Goldberg to become the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and break Goldberg&#x27;s 173 match winning streak.

==== nWo reunion and championship reigns (1999–2000) ====
Hall and Nash were allied again and, in January 1999, the two nWo factions rejoined. Hall feuded with Goldberg and faced him in a ladder taser match on January 19 at Souled Out. He lost the match when Goldberg used the taser gun on him.

At SuperBrawl IX, Hall defeated Roddy Piper for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Shortly after, he suffered a foot injury which forced him to forfeit the title. Hall was not seen again until October 1999, when he and Kevin Nash began sitting at ringside during WCW television, proclaiming &quot;the band was getting back together.&quot;

On the November 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall defeated Goldberg, Bret Hart, and Sid Vicious in a Texas tornado ladder match to regain the United States Heavyweight Championship. Two weeks later, at Mayhem, he won the WCW World Television Championship after Rick Steiner forfeited the match due to injury. He successfully defended both titles against Booker T later that night. Eight days later, on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall vacated the Television title by throwing it into a trash can. He was soon stripped of his United States title, after being sidelined with a knee injury.

Hall and Nash teamed up to defeat Bret Hart and Goldberg on the December 13 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship for the sixth time. After the nWo returned in December 1999, Hall joined Nash, Bret Hart, Jeff Jarrett, and Scott Steiner in what was coined &quot;nWo 2000&quot;. However, Hall was injured again thereafter and the tag team titles were vacated.

In 2000, Hall feuded with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sid Vicious and nWo teammate Jeff Jarrett over the world title, but he was pinned by Sid in a three-way match with Jarrett at SuperBrawl on February 20, 2000, in what would be his last match with the company.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling and Japan (2000–2001) ===

After departing WCW in early 2000, Hall was inactive for several months. On November 10, 2000, he made a surprise appearance at an Extreme Championship Wrestling house show in Schenectady, New York, teaming with Jerry Lynn to defeat Justin Credible and Rhino. The following day, in Poughkeepsie, New York, Hall defeated Justin Credible, then lost to Sal E. Graziano.

In March 2001, Hall returned to New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he joined the Team 2000 stable. During his tenure with NJPW, Hall primarily teamed with Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima, Scott Norton, and his other stablemates in a series of tag team matches and six-man tag team matches. Hall wrestled for NJPW until September 2001, with his final bout being a title match against Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Keiji Muto.

=== Return to WWF/E (2002) ===

On the January 24, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, WWF co-owner Vince McMahon stated that his company had a &quot;cancer&quot;, and that he would inject the WWF with a &quot;lethal dose of poison&quot;, so he would no longer have to share ownership of the WWF with Ric Flair. He then revealed the &quot;poison&quot; to be the nWo, who would help McMahon destroy his own company, before it could be ruined by anyone else. Six years after defecting from the promotion, Hall returned to the WWF on February 17 at the No Way Out pay-per-view, and was reunited with Kevin Nash and Hollywood Hogan in a repackaged nWo. Later on the February 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the nWo attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hall destroyed a cinder block on Austin&#x27;s leg. On the March 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hall wrestled his first WWF match since May 1996, defeating Spike Dudley.

At WrestleMania X8, Hall lost to Austin, his first loss at a WrestleMania. Later in the night, after Hollywood Hogan had lost to the Rock, Hogan proceeded to shake the Rock&#x27;s hand out of respect, thus turning his back on the nWo. Hall and Nash then attempted to attack Hogan and Rock, but were promptly dispatched by the duo. Hall and Nash later recruited X-Pac (formerly Syxx and 1-2-3 Kid) into the nWo on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On the March 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hall was drafted to the Raw brand with the rest of the nWo, as a result of the WWF draft lottery. Hall faced Bradshaw in a match at Backlash, which he won with help from X-Pac. On the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hall and X-Pac took on Austin and Big Show. Late in the match Big Show chokeslammed Austin and joined the nWo.

On May 5, on a flight back from England (following a tour leading to the Insurrextion pay-per-view) to the United States, retroactively dubbed &quot;The Plane Ride From Hell&quot;, Hall became intoxicated. Taralyn Cappellano and Heidi Doyle, who served as flight attendants during the flight, accused Hall and several other wrestlers of behaving in a sexually inappropriate manner during the trip. In Hall&#x27;s case, he was accused of licking Doyle&#x27;s face, and making sexual remarks to the two women. The case was ultimately settled out of court. The incident would have renewed interest in September 2021 after it was featured in the documentary series &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;. Hall&#x27;s last appearance for the company was the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, wrestling in a six-man tag match with Big Show and X-Pac against Austin, Bradshaw and Ric Flair, which ended in a no contest. He was released from the promotion the following day due to ongoing issues stemming from his substance abuse.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2005, 2007–2008) ===

Hall worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) briefly in 2002, appearing on their first pay-per-view event. On the July 31 NWA-TNA PPV, Hall lost to his former WWE rival Jeff Jarrett in a Stretcher match. On the September 18 NWA-TNA PPV, Hall and Syxx-Pac competed in the Tag Team Gauntlet for the Gold Match but did not win. On the September 25 NWA-TNA PPV, Hall and Syxx-Pac defeated Elix Skipper and Brian Lawler. On October 23 NWA-TNA PPV, Hall defeated Jeff Jarrett. On October 30 NWA-TNA PPV, Hall got a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but lost to Ron Killings. Hall would leave NWA-TNA after his match with Killings.

In late 2004, Hall returned to TNA, along with Kevin Nash, as TNA prepared for their first monthly pay-per-view, Victory Road. Hall joined Nash and Jeff Jarrett in the stable The Kings of Wrestling. On the November 26 episode of Impact, Hall defeated A.J. Styles. At Turning Point, The Kings of Wrestling lost to Randy Savage, Jeff Hardy, and A.J. Styles. On the December 24 episode of Impact, Hall interrupted a &quot;In The Pit with Piper&quot; and confronted Héctor Garza which led to a match a week later on the December 31 episode of Impact where Hall won the match. Hall lost to Hardy at Final Resolution on January 16, 2005. After this, he took some time off.

On the November 1, 2007, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kevin Nash &quot;predicted&quot; Hall would be Sting&#x27;s mystery partner at Genesis. The next week, Hall made his return, rebuffing the romantic advances of Kurt Angle&#x27;s wife, Karen, then battling Kurt in his dressing room. He stated he was in TNA solely to confront Nash. Hall asked Nash why he was not there to help him in his troubled past, and Nash responded that it was a result of his own nonstop partying and risk of losing his family. Hall then claimed that all was forgiven and the two embraced in the ring. He also revealed that he was not Sting&#x27;s mystery partner. On the November 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The reunited Outsiders and Samoa Joe began a feud with The Angle Alliance. On the November 29 episode of Impact, Hall and Nash came out to the stage and clapped for Samoa Joe after his match. They were scheduled to compete together at Turning Point, but Hall no-showed. At Turning Point (2008), Hall and the Insane Clown Posse (ICP) were seen in attendance. This was later revealed to have been scripted to occur, as TNA had asked ICP to attend the event, but were unaware of Hall being their guest.

=== Return to the WWC (2007) ===

On July 13, Hall made his return to wrestling for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) as Razor Ramon (though wearing WolfPac themed attire). He wrestled the main event of a WWC Anniversary tour show at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, against Carlito. He lost after Apollo interfered on Carlito&#x27;s behalf.

The next night, Hall won his second World Championship, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, by defeating Carlito and champion Apollo in a Three-Way Dance main event. On August 4 and September 23, Hall successfully defended the title against Eddie Colón. On October 27, managed by Rico Casanova, he retained the title at WWC&#x27;s &quot;Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza&quot;, defeating Orlando &quot;Fireblaze&quot; Colon. Razor Ramon was scheduled to fight on December 14 in Ponce and December 15 in Caguas but did not show up. Hall began to have emotional problems, and with the drink, eventually he could not compete leaving the strap thus his scheduled opponent Biggie Size proclaimed himself champion.

=== Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007–2009) ===
Hall made his Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) debut on August 12, 2007, at &quot;Bloodymania&quot;, losing to JCW Heavyweight Champion Corporal Robinson. In this match, Hall took his first ever bump on thumbtacks.

On October 6, 2007, at &quot;Evansville Invasion&quot;, Corporal Robinson, Hall, and Violent J formed the Juggalo World Order (JWO) stable. At the 2007 &quot;Hallowicked After Party&quot;, on October 31, Shaggy 2 Dope was introduced as a member of the group. After the main event, special guest referee Nosawa ripped off his referee shirt to reveal that he, too, was a member of the JWO. At &quot;Bloodymania II&quot;, Hall teamed with Kevin Nash, who proclaimed himself a member of the group. At the 2008 &quot;Hallowicked After Party&quot;, the JWO inducted its newest member, 2 Tuff Tony.

On November 9, the JWO &quot;invaded&quot; Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s Turning Point PPV, by purchasing front row tickets to the event. They promoted their faction by flashing their JWO jerseys, before being removed from the building. The group expressed interest in &quot;invading&quot; WWE&#x27;s 2009 Royal Rumble, but were unable, due to filming commitments for Big Money Rustlas in Los Angeles. They have also shown interest in &quot;invading&quot; Ring of Honor and Ultimate Fighting Championship.

=== Return to TNA (2010) ===

On the January 4, 2010, three-hour Monday night live episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hall and Waltman returned to TNA. That same night, Hulk Hogan made his TNA debut. Hall, Nash and Waltman quickly reformed their alliance, but Hogan kept himself out of the group, claiming &quot;times have changed&quot;. The following week, the revived alliance was named &quot;The Band&quot;.

Hall was scheduled to team with Nash at Genesis in a match against Beer Money, Inc., but was replaced by Waltman (as Syxx-Pac). In the end, Hall inadvertently cost his stablemates the match. On the next episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hogan, displeased with the actions of The Band, had security remove Hall and Waltman from the arena, since they were not under contract with TNA. Despite this, Hall and Syxx-Pac continued returning to &quot;Impact!&quot; to assault various wrestlers. On the February 4 episode, they turned on Nash and beat him down. On the February 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hall and Waltman attacked Kurt Angle until Hogan made the save. On the February 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hall and Waltman had a brawl with Nash and Eric Young. On the February 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hall and Waltman had a brawl with Nash and Young in the parking lot. On the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hall defeated Nash in a 5-Min $25,000 challenge after interference from Waltman. At Destination X, Hall and Syxx-Pac faced Nash and Young in a tag team match, with The Band&#x27;s TNA future on the line. In the end, Nash turned on Young and helped The Band win, earning them contracts with TNA.

On the March 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band lost a six-man tag team steel cage match to Eric Young, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy. On the April 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band interfered in a match and attacked both Team 3D and The Motor City Machine Guns. On the April 12 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band (Hall, Nash, Waltman) defeated Team 3-D and Jesse Neal in a Street Fight. At Lockdown, Hall and Nash lost to Team 3D in a Steel Cage match. On the May 3 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Eric Young turned on Team 3D and joined The Band. On May 4, at the taping of the May 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hall teamed with Nash, cashed in his &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; contract and defeated Matt Morgan to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Nash later declared Young one third of the champions, citing the &quot;Freebird Rule&quot;.

At Sacrifice on May 16, Hall and Nash defeated Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) to retain the titles. On the June 10 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band defeated Matt Morgan (by himself) to retain their titles and this was Hall&#x27;s final appearance in TNA. On the June 14 &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band was stripped of the Tag Team Championship, due to Hall&#x27;s real-life legal problems. The next day, it was announced that Hall had been released from TNA after 8 years of working part-time for the company and subsequently retired from professional wrestling.

=== Late career (2010–2021) ===

On March 24, 2014, Razor Ramon was announced as the seventh and final inductee into that year&#x27;s class of the WWE Hall of Fame. He was inducted in New Orleans on April 5, the night before WrestleMania XXX. Shawn Michaels, Triple H, X-Pac and Kevin Nash joined Hall onstage after his speech, reuniting The Kliq. WWE promotional material for the event referred to him solely as Razor Ramon, without footage or mention of his work under his real name. At WrestleMania XXX, Hall, as Razor Ramon, appeared onstage with the other Hall of Fame inductees. Hall appeared on the August 11, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; for the first time since 2002 to reunite the New World Order with Nash and Hulk Hogan to celebrate Hogan&#x27;s birthday.

On the January 19, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hall appeared with X-Pac and Nash to reunite the nWo, and along with the APA and The New Age Outlaws they beat down The Ascension, who had been insulting legends from past years.

On May 13, 2015, Global Force Wrestling (GFW) announced Hall as part of their roster. On May 18, 2015, Hall was released from GFW.

At WrestleMania 31 in March 2015, Hall, along with Nash and Hogan, reunited as the nWo to help their old foe Sting in his match against Triple H, who had D-Generation X helping on his behalf. On January 30, 2016, Hall took part in World Association of Wrestling television tapings at Epic Studios in Norwich, England. It was aired on Mustard TV on September 10. In March 2016, Razor Ramon was backstage at WrestleMania 32 celebrating with the new Intercontinental Champion Zack Ryder. The following night on an online &quot;Raw Fallout&quot; segment, he asked The Miz to give Ryder a rematch for the Intercontinental Championship.

Hall wrestled his last match on June 17, 2016, defeating Chuck Taylor for the DDT Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship at F1RST Wrestling in Des Moines, Iowa. He would lose the title the same day by forfeit after getting tricked into saying &quot;I give up&quot; off a sheet of paper.

On &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; on January 22, 2018, Hall (as &quot;Razor Ramon&quot;) returned in a segment featuring D-Generation X, The Bálor Club, and The Revival. Hall also returned to WWE for the RAW Reunion show on July 22, 2019. Hall was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame a second time as a member of the New World Order, together with stablemates Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Sean Waltman, as part of the Hall&#x27;s class of 2020. The induction of the 2020 honorees took place in April 2021 due to the previous year&#x27;s ceremony being canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Legal issues==
In 1983, after wrestling a gun away from a man in an altercation outside of a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Hall was charged with second-degree murder after shooting the man in the head with his own gun. According to Hall, this was done in self-defense. The charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In a 2011 interview for ESPN, Hall said he was unable to forget the incident.

In 1998, Hall was arrested for groping a 56-year-old woman outside a hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

On October 10, 2008, Hall was arrested during a roast of The Iron Sheik held at a Crowne Plaza hotel in New Jersey. A comedian, Jimmy Graham, had joked about Owen Hart&#x27;s death by saying, &quot;After The Sheik and Hacksaw Jim Duggan got caught snorting coke in the parking lot, his career fell faster than Owen Hart.&quot; An enraged Hall charged at Graham, knocked down a lectern, grabbed the microphone from Graham, and yelled about how the joke was disrespectful to Hart. Graham described the incident on his MySpace page, claiming Hall was drunk at the time of the attack.

Hall was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting a police officer on May 14, 2010. Police were called to the Hitching Post Bar in Chuluota, Florida, after Hall &quot;became aggressive&quot;. According to the police report, he had been &quot;drinking heavily&quot;. When they arrived, they found him yelling and cursing at independent professional wrestling personalities and bar staff. Hall was told he was not allowed to return to the establishment. In his police statement, Hall described himself as an unemployed professional wrestler, despite having a job with TNA Wrestling, who would release him a month later.

On April 6, 2012, Hall was again arrested in Chuluota, Florida. The arrest was later reported to be for a domestic disturbance involving his girlfriend, Lisa Howell; Hall allegedly choked Howell while he was drunk. He was taken to a hospital to be medically cleared prior to being taken to a drunk tank. Hall denied the choking allegations. The prosecutor dropped the charges, citing insufficient evidence.

== Personal life ==
Hall married Dana Lee Burgio in 1990. They divorced in 1998 due to Hall&#x27;s drug use. They remarried in 1999 and divorced again in 2001. They had a son named Cody (born 1991), who also became a wrestler, and a daughter named Cassidy (born 1995). In January 2024, Hall became a grandfather posthumously through his daughter. Hall married his second wife, Jessica Hart, in 2006. They divorced in 2007.

Hall&#x27;s problems with drugs and alcohol were made public in the late 1990s and were incorporated into a controversial WCW storyline. While the storyline was playing out, Hall was legitimately arrested for a limousine while intoxicated outside of a night club in Orlando, Florida, causing $2,000 in damages.

After his release from TNA in 2010, Hall checked into rehab paid for by WWE. Hall checked out of the rehab facility in early October 2010. Weeks after he checked into rehab, Hall had both a defibrillator and a pacemaker implanted in his chest. He was hospitalized twice in 2010 for double pneumonia. During this time, Hall started having seizures and was soon diagnosed with epilepsy, resulting in him requiring to take eleven different medications on a daily basis to treat his heart and seizure problems. On April 6, 2011, Hall was reportedly taken to the hospital due to a seizure. Hall&#x27;s representative, Geena Anac, said Hall was in the hospital that night to be treated for extremely low blood pressure, and that Hall visited his doctor on a regular basis for blood work and checkups while recovering from double pneumonia. Three days later, TMZ reported Hall had been taken to a hospital, treated for cardiac issues and remained in the hospital for three days. According to medical reports, Hall was being treated after overdosing on both opioids and benzodiazepines. During an interview which took place on Kayfabe Commentaries journalist Sean Oliver&#x27;s &quot;YouShoot&quot; segment in 2009, Hall admitted that he had a history of smoking marijuana as well.

Longtime friend Kevin Nash claimed Hall&#x27;s substance abuse stemmed from post-traumatic stress disorder when he was forced to use an assailant&#x27;s gun against him in self-defense. In October 2011, ESPN&#x27;s &quot;&quot; featured a documentary detailing Hall&#x27;s experience with drugs and alcohol. It included interviews with several of Hall&#x27;s family members including his ex-wife and his son, Cody, as well as several prominent figures and close friends from the wrestling industry such as Hogan, Nash, Waltman, Bischoff, and Stephanie McMahon. In early 2013, former professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page invited Hall into his home in order for Hall to stay sober and &quot;rebuild his life from the ground up... physically, mentally, professionally, and spiritually&quot;. Page also initiated a fundraising drive, which raised nearly $110,000 ($30,000 over their $80,000 goal) to pay for hip replacement surgery and dental work for Hall.

== Death ==
In March 2022, Hall was hospitalized after falling and breaking his hip. He was immobile on the floor for days before being discovered during a wellness check by his friend Diamond Dallas Page, who took him to the hospital. After Hall underwent hip replacement surgery, a blood clot was dislodged, and resulted in Hall having three heart attacks on March 12, 2022, after which he was put on life support at WellStar Kennestone Hospital in Marietta, Georgia. He was taken off life support on March 14, 2022, after his family had traveled to the hospital to see him and be with him at his bedside. He died about 4 or 6 hours later at the age of 63. WWE announced his death later during that day&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; episode with a tribute video.

Four days after Hall&#x27;s death, Sean Waltman revealed to the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; that Hall had relapsed back into alcohol abuse when the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns rendered him unable to have social interactions, and at one point he had dropped weight down to from his usual . Waltman also revealed that Hall was in particularly bad shape the night before the 2021 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and even passed out at a bar. Waltman also stated Hall&#x27;s condition worsened throughout the two years prior to his death and that he had offered to move in with Hall in February 2022 to help with his health issues. Page also returned to help with Hall&#x27;s alcoholism.

Hall was buried on April 8, 2022, at Trinity Church Cemetery at St. Mary&#x27;s, Maryland, his hometown, and the service was attended by fellow wrestlers Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Page.

==Other media==
During Hall&#x27;s fourth reign as WWF Intercontinental Champion, he appeared in character as Razor Ramon on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. As part of his appearance, Hall handed the Intercontinental Championship belt, T-shirts, chain necklaces, and tickets to WrestleMania XII to two preteens that had gotten ceremonially—but not legally—married on an episode of the show two years prior. Both of the preteens had AIDS, and one of them was a wrestling fan who liked Ramon. Hall did not work at WrestleMania XII due to his suspension.

On August 24, 2009, Hall began hosting a show on YouTube called &quot;Last Call with Scott Hall&quot;. Guests included Sid Vicious, Kevin Nash, Ricky Ortiz, Larry Zbyszko, and Sean Waltman.

On August 20, 2013, Hall appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, along with Diamond Dallas Page and Jake Roberts to talk about how he and Roberts had been recuperating since moving in with Page.

In 2015, Hall was a subject in the film &quot;The Resurrection of Jake the Snake&quot;, which chronicled his time with DDP and Roberts.

<doc id="439256" wikidata="Q6053106" url="?curid=439256" title="International Sculpture Symposium">
<text>The International Sculpture Symposium movement was spearheaded by Karl Prantl in Austria in 1959.
This initiative grew from the need to facilitate communication and exchange between members of the international sculpture community. It was also rooted in Cold War tensions, which lent a particular urgency to the need for cross-cultural dialogue on a person-to-person basis.
The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland.

Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. 
Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including Lindabrunn, Austria and Hagi, Japan (a town known for its pottery) and in Scotland (Scottish Sculpture Workshop, Lumsden and other locations).

The first international sculpture symposia in the United States (and the first on a college campus) was in the summer of 1965 on the California State University, Long Beach campus in Long Beach, California. The symposium was under the direction of Sculpture Professor Kenneth Glenn, University President Carl W. McIntosh, and architect Edward Killingsworth. Several sculptures were created by world-renowned artists. Glenn actively sought “sculptors with international reputations from a large number of countries”. The list of artists included Andre Bloc (France), Kosso Eloul (Israel), J.J. Beljon (Netherlands), Gabriel Kohn (United States), Robert Murray (Canada), Piotr Kowalski (France and Poland), Kengiro Azuma (Japan), Claire Falkenstein (United States). In addition to the artists, “thirty-two upcoming young sculptors and graduate students were selected from all over the country to participate in the symposium as apprentices while earning college credits”. The symposium was the first to partner with industrial companies to explore recent technology and new materials. The collection incorporates a global theme and artists from all over the world who came to work together. After the symposium, the artworks became a &quot;Museum Without Walls,&quot; a permanent exhibit on campus. .” (Far-Sited 2018, ix) Its goal was to combine technology and new materials and artists with local industrial sponsors. In an effort to offset the cost of materials, Glenn sought the contribution of resources from local shipping, manufacturing, and aerospace industries. Partnerships with the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, Paramount Steel, North American Aviation (Boeing), and NASA, marked the first coordinated collaboration between artists, industry, and technology on such a large scale. Materials used were paints, glass, plastics, lights, metals, and bonding agents used during WWII. Participants also included students and volunteers. The symposium took place during a historical time with social movements that included the grape boycott with labor activist Cesar Chavez, the Watt Riots in Los Angeles which to date is the largest and most damaging race riot in the nation, and the Vietnam War.

The 1965 Long Beach Sculpture Symposium was not only the United States’ first international sculpture symposium but the first to occur at a university. It was also the first to partner with industrial partners to create technologically advanced works. Such industrial partners include Bethlehem Steel, Fellows and Stewart Shipyard, and North American Aviation. The symposium was organized by the Cal State Long Beach professor Kenneth Glenn and the Israeli artist Kosso Eloul. It lasted 12 weeks and included artists from Poland, Canada, Japan, Israel, and American artists. There were nine artists who participated whom all produced large scale abstract pieces made from concrete, steel, and earth. At the time, the symposium responded to the war and politics occurring which centered around human cooperation and engagement. Each artist was matched with a new age industrial representative. For example, Piotr Kowallski worked with the North American Aviation Corporation. Robert Murray worked with Bethlehem Steel. Murray’s piece, Duet is a large-scale piece that is made of three sheets of painted steel. The thick sheets were painted in a unique tangerine shade that was accurately restored in the year 2015 due to the work done by the Getty Conservation Institute. Beyond the pieces, California architect, Edward Killingsworth, utilized CSULB’s 350 acre campus and made all the works and their sites on the campus connect to Modernist architecture and an effort to showcase monumental outdoor sculpture. Most of the campus is designed in a mid-century modern style with an emphasis of an open landscaped area to develop almost a sprawling park feeling. Working with outdoor sculpture proved some challenges such as damage and exposure to outside elements. More importantly, the pieces worked towards a greater goal of conserving art in public places. In addition to constructing consistent color ties across campus through modernist proportioning and close connections to landscape.

The International Sculpture Symposium (Vermont International Sculpture Symposium) in the United States was held in Proctor, Vermont in 1968 under the joint sponsorship of Vermont Marble Company, National Endowment for the Arts, and Vermont Council on the Arts. Participating sculptors were from the United States, Austria, Japan, Germany, and Yugoslavia. The sculptures were displayed at the Vermont Marble Company.

Another symposium was held in Vermont in 1971, with sponsorship from S.D. Griswald, a local concrete company, with artists producing brutalist sculptures with concrete. Following the symposium, the sculptures were displayed along the state&#x27;s rest stops along I-89 and I-91. As of 2024, the state plans to clean and restore them.

The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. 
It was followed by the Barossa International Sculpture Symposium in Mengler Hill near Tanunda in the Barossa in South Australia in 1988. Nine sculptures in Marble and Granite were carved by sculptors from France, the United States, Japan and Australia. The site is now the Barossa Sculpture Park.

As part of the program in 2001, the Republic of South Africa War Memorial &quot;Reconciliation&quot; by sculptor Strijdom van der Merwe was created for the sculpture park at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea.

The Scottish Sculpture Workshop organised a series of international symposia through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly focused on stone carving. These attracted artists from across Europe, North America and Japan. Some were linked to the Scottish Sculpture Open exhibition.

<text>David Cameron Chatters (April 15, 1946 – January 25, 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2006, representing the riding of Athabasca until the 2004 election, after which he represented Westlock—St. Paul.

Born in Westlock, Alberta, Chatters, formerly a farmer and rancher, was first elected as a member of the Reform Party of Canada (1993–2000), which became the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which became the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. For over 10 years, he was the Senior Opposition Critic for Natural Resources and was a Deputy Whip of the Official Opposition. He was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy, and Ethics, but health reasons made Chatters retire at the 2006 election.

In May 1996, he was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for asserting, in the wake of the Delwin Vriend case on LGBT human rights, that schools should have the right to fire openly gay teachers. Another caucus colleague who had made a similar comment, Bob Ringma, was suspended at the same time; a third caucus colleague, Jan Brown, was also suspended at the same time for publicly criticizing Chatters and Ringma. All three were readmitted to the Reform caucus by September of that year. He died at the age of 69 on January 25, 2016. He had pancreatic cancer.

<doc id="439260" wikidata="Q280793" url="?curid=439260" title="Kevin Nash">
<text>Kevin Scott Nash (born July 9, 1959) is an American actor and retired professional wrestler signed to WWE under a legends contract. He is also known for his tenures with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Nash first gained exposure in the professional wrestling industry by performing for WCW from 1990 to 1993 under multiple ring names. In 1993, Nash signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) under the name Diesel (nicknamed &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot; and &quot;Big Sexy&quot;). While performing as Diesel, he achieved status as a top star in the company, winning the WWF World, Intercontinental and Tag Team Championships (the WWF Triple Crown). His 358-day reign as WWF Champion is the longest of the 1990s. While in the WWF, Nash was part of The Kliq, an influential backstage group that included Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Scott Hall and Sean Waltman.

Nash left the WWF and returned to WCW in 1996, where he performed under his real name, partnering with Hall as the Outsiders and founding the New World Order (nWo) with Hulk Hogan. As the nWo storyline became one of the most prominent of the Monday Night War, Nash maintained his status as a top star, winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship four times and the WCW World Tag Team Championship nine times. After WCW went out of business, Nash returned to the WWF in 2002, where he briefly reformed the nWo and feuded with Triple H over the World Heavyweight Championship. He then performed in TNA for seven years, and he held their Legends and Tag Team championships once each. In 2011, Nash returned to WWE under a legends contract and he continues to make sporadic appearances for the promotion.

During his in-ring career, Nash won 20 major championships, including six world championships and twelve world tag team championships. Furthermore, he is a two-time WWE Hall of Famer, as he was inducted individually into the class of 2015 and in 2020 as an nWo member alongside Hogan, Hall and Waltman. He headlined numerous pay-per-view events for WCW, WWF/WWE and TNA, including WCW&#x27;s flagship event, Starrcade, where he ended Bill Goldberg&#x27;s undefeated streak after 173 wins in 1998.

== Early life ==
Nash was born on July 9, 1959, to a devout Christian family in southwest Detroit, Michigan. Nash&#x27;s father, Robert, died of a heart attack on April 4, 1968, aged 36, when Nash was eight years old. On December 27, 1994, Nash&#x27;s mother, Wanda, died after a four-year struggle against breast cancer. He attended Aquinas High School and the University of Tennessee, where he majored in psychology and minored in educational philosophy. At the University of Tennessee, Nash was a center for the Tennessee Volunteers basketball team. He remained on the team from 1977 to 1980, during which time the team made it to the NCAA Sweet 16. Following a physical altercation with head coach Don DeVoe and a series of other on-campus incidents, Nash did not play a fourth year for the Volunteers, and he attempted to transfer to Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio.

Nash reconsidered his options and instead moved to Europe, where he played basketball professionally for various teams. His career ended just one year later in 1981 in Germany (while playing for the Gießen 46ers) when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament. With his basketball career over, Nash enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the 202nd Military Police Company in Giessen, West Germany. He served in a secure NATO facility for two years, during which time he was promoted to the rank of specialist. After the Army, he worked on an assembly line at Ford Motor Company and as the floor manager of a strip club in Atlanta, Georgia. He then decided to try professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Championship Wrestling (1990–1993) ===
==== Master Blasters (1990–1991) ====
Nash debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as the orange-mohawked &quot;Steel&quot;, one half of the tag team known as the Master Blasters. He was initially partnered with Master Blaster Iron, with whom he made his debut at the Clash of the Champions XII on September 5, 1990, defeating Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner. At the following &quot;Worldwide&quot; taping on September 7, the Masters Blasters began a feud with Tim Horner and Mike Rotunda. They beat Horner and Rotunda on several house shows. On September 22, Nash&#x27;s partner Master Blaster Iron was replaced by &quot;Blade&quot;.

The reconstituted Master Blasters continued their undefeated streak in October. Meanwhile, Steel had his first singles match on September 28 by defeating Tom Zenk. At Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1990, the Blasters upended the Southern Boys and began to move up the WCW tag team ratings. Their winning streak ended on November 22, when Tom Zenk and Brian Pillman handed them their first defeat with Pillman pinning Blade. They rebounded to go on another undefeated streak by defeating the Southern Boys as well as Alan Iron Eagle and Tim Horner, and earning a NWA United States Tag Team Championship title shot against then champions the Steiner Brothers, but were defeated in two occasions. They were squashed on television in 52 seconds by the Steiners in a match that aired on &quot;Worldwide&quot; on February 2, 1991. Following this loss, their momentum dissipated as they lost to the Southern Boys and Ricky Morton and Tommy Rich, and they disbanded at the end of the month.

Nash was then rebranded as the Master Blaster in February 1991, who was pinned by Junkyard Dog on February 27. He also lost to Brian Pillman in house show matches, while appearing in tag team matches with Stan Hansen and Arn Anderson. His final match in this guise was against Pillman at a house show on May 12.

==== Oz (1991–1992) ====
A week later, Nash reappeared under his new gimmick, having been repackaged as the silver-haired Oz, a character based on the Wizard of Oz from the 1900 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Oz, managed by The Great Wizard, was pushed strongly for about a month, he squashed several wrestlers before losing to Ron Simmons at The Great American Bash on July 14. In reality, all plans for Oz were immediately scrapped when Nash refused to sign a $300/night guarantee as WCW was cutting costs. A decision was made to retain Nash until a new gimmick could be developed. On October 27, he lost to Bill Kazmaier at Halloween Havoc. Nash wrestled as Oz throughout the remainder of 1991 and went on a lengthy losing streak, suffering defeats by Kazmaier, Rick Steiner, Dustin Rhodes, and Arachnaman.

He later used the gimmick for New Japan Pro Wrestling as the Great Oz in May 1992.

==== Vinnie Vegas (1992–1993) ====

On January 21, 1992, at Clash of the Champions XVIII, he was repackaged as Vinnie Vegas, a wisecracking pseudo-mobster based on Steve Martin&#x27;s character in the 1990 film &quot;My Blue Heaven.&quot; Vegas was quickly recruited into &quot;A Half-Ton of Holy Hell&quot;, a stable of large wrestlers created by Harley Race which included WCW World Champion Lex Luger, Big Van Vader and Mr. Hughes. The stable separated in February 1992 after Luger left, and Vegas joined the Diamond Mine, a stable led by Diamond Dallas Page that also included the Diamond Studd and Scotty Flamingo. In the summer of 1992, after Studd and Flamingo left the stable (Studd leaving for the WWF and Flamingo striking out on his own), Page and Vegas began teaming together as the Vegas Connection. The tag team split in late 1992 after Page was fired by Bill Watts.

Nash spent the first half of 1993 teaming with Big Sky. In June, he decided to depart for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and had his final WCW match on June 3, teaming with Big Sky in a losing effort against The Cole Twins, this match would air on &quot;Worldwide&quot; after his WWF debut.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1993–1996) ===

==== Two Dudes with Attitudes (1993–1994) ====
In June 1993, Nash left WCW, signing a contract with the WWF at the request of Shawn Michaels. He was given the stage name of &quot;Big Daddy Cool Diesel&quot; (&quot;Diesel&quot; or &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot; for short), with an alpha-male gimmick. For the role, he grew long hair, taking on the appearance and demeanor of a cocky thug from Detroit, sporting black sunglasses and leather garments. The name of Diesel, suggested by Shane McMahon, was a play on the fact that Nash was from Detroit, known famously as the &quot;Motor City&quot;. His initial entrance music was a series of truck engine and horn noises.

Diesel started out as the bodyguard/best friend of Shawn Michaels, with the two being known as Two Dudes with Attitudes. He made his WWF debut at a house show on June 6, 1993, by assisting Michaels in defeating Marty Jannetty for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. He first appeared on television the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, June 7, as he was introduced as Michaels&#x27;s bodyguard. In January 1994, Diesel appeared at the Royal Rumble, first as one of the many wrestlers who assisted WWF Champion Yokozuna in defeating The Undertaker in their casket match and then in the Royal Rumble match, eliminating seven men in under 18 minutes of in-ring time. Diesel won the Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon, following interference from Michaels on the April 30, 1994 episode (taped April 13, 1994) of &quot;Superstars.&quot; The duo of Diesel and Michaels defeated The Headshrinkers to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on August 28, making Nash a double champion. However, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Ramon the following night at SummerSlam. The alliance between Diesel and Michaels dissolved after Survivor Series, when Michaels accidentally performed a superkick on Diesel. Diesel then chased Michaels, and despite failing to catch him, the reaction from the crowd turned him babyface. However, Nash was no longer a tag team champion, as Michaels&#x27; actions resulted in the team being forced to vacate the titles.

==== WWF Champion (1994–1995) ====

On November 26, 1994, Diesel faced Bob Backlund for the WWF Championship he had won from Bret Hart three days prior at Survivor Series. In the match at Madison Square Garden, Diesel defeated Backlund in the first ten seconds of the bout. Diesel then promised Hart a match for his title, which they had the next month at the Royal Rumble. The match ended in a draw due to interference from several wrestlers, including Shawn Michaels. Michaels was irate about his former bodyguard having beaten him to the WWF Championship and was sufficiently motivated to win the Royal Rumble match later that evening, earning himself a title shot at WrestleMania XI.

At WrestleMania XI on April 2, Nash, accompanied to ringside by actress Pamela Anderson (who was supposed to valet for Michaels), defeated Michaels to retain the title. After the match, he left the ring with both Anderson and Michaels&#x27; replacement for her, Jenny McCarthy. The next night on &quot;Monday Night Raw,&quot; Michaels was betrayed by his new bodyguard, Sycho Sid, prompting Diesel to come to his rescue and thus reunited the tag team. Diesel successfully defended the WWF Championship against Sycho Sid at the inaugural In Your House pay-per-view on May 14, and at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks on July 23. At SummerSlam, Diesel retained the WWF Championship by defeating King Mabel, who had won the King of the Ring tournament.

On September 24 at In Your House 3 in Saginaw, Michigan, Diesel and Michaels challenged the reigning WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and Yokozuna. The match had a winner-take-all stipulation, as in addition to the tag belts, Diesel&#x27;s WWF Championship and Michaels&#x27; recently won Intercontinental Championship were also on the line. When Hart did not show up at the event, he was replaced by Davey Boy Smith. In the course of the match, Hart arrived at ringside, entered the ring and was pinned by Diesel for the win and the title, making him and Michaels holders of all three major WWF championships. The reign did not last long, however, as Hart and Yokozuna had the titles returned to them the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; due to Hart not being an official part of the match when he was pinned.

Diesel&#x27;s WWF Championship reign continued until November 19, when he was defeated by Bret Hart at Survivor Series. Following the loss, Diesel attacked Hart and began a tweener turn.

==== Final feuds; departure (1995–1996) ====
At In Your House 5 in December 1995, Diesel defeated Owen Hart, who had injured Diesel&#x27;s ally Shawn Michaels in a match the prior month. In January 1996, Diesel competed in the Royal Rumble, entering at number 22. Diesel was the last man to be eliminated from the Royal Rumble, being superkicked over the top rope by the winner, Shawn Michaels. Following the match, Diesel teased attacking Michaels before instead giving him a high five. Diesel went on to interfere in the main event between The Undertaker and WWF Champion Bret Hart, costing The Undertaker the title. At In Your House 6 on February 18, Diesel attempted to regain the WWF Championship from Hart in a steel cage match, losing after The Undertaker attacked him in retaliation for his actions at the Royal Rumble.

Shortly before WrestleMania XII, Nash&#x27;s contract status was in a state of flux. At the time, WCW was offering large amounts of money to the WWF&#x27;s talent by Eric Bischoff, WCW Executive Vice President, to jump ship. In fact, Bischoff had succeeded in convincing several high-profile WWF stars to sign with WCW over the previous two years, including five-time former WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and his on-again, off-again friend and two-time former WWF Champion Randy Savage, and was in the process at the time of talking to Nash&#x27;s friend Scott &quot;Razor Ramon&quot; Hall about a contract as Hall&#x27;s too was set to expire. Nash explained on the WWE Classics on Demand exclusive series &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot; that Hall had been the first to sign with the company and was offered a contract that paid him &quot;above Sting money&quot; (at the time, Sting was one of the highest paid wrestlers in the company and although Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, and Randy Savage had been making more, Sting&#x27;s contract was used as a measuring stick). Hall also informed Nash that he had been given &quot;most favored nation&quot; status, which meant that if someone new was hired for more money, Hall&#x27;s contract would increase to match that contract. Bischoff ended up offering Nash a three-year guaranteed contract with a $1.2 million annual salary. Nash said to Vince McMahon that he did not want to leave the WWF and that if McMahon was willing to match the offer, he would stay. McMahon said no because, according to Nash, he would have had to offer matching contracts to other wrestlers and with the promotion in a bad financial situation, he simply could not afford it. Nash signed his contract shortly thereafter.

Diesel lost to The Undertaker at WrestleMania XII on March 31, after which he finally turned heel and went on to feud with Shawn Michaels once again after he turned on him at a Madison Square Garden live event. In his last televised WWF appearance until 2002, Diesel challenged Michaels for the WWF Championship (which he had won from Hart at WrestleMania XII) at In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies on April 28. He wrestled Michaels for the title once again in a steel cage match at a house show on May 19, but was again defeated. After the match, Diesel, Michaels, Razor Ramon, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley, a group of off-screen friends known collectively as &quot;The Kliq&quot;, hugged one another in the ring and wished each other farewell. This incident, later referred to as the &quot;Curtain Call&quot; or &quot;MSG Incident&quot;, was a serious breach of character, as it showed heels and babyfaces consorting with one another. Shortly thereafter, with his obligations to the WWF now completely fulfilled, Nash left for WCW.

=== Return to WCW (1996–2001) ===

==== New World Order (1996–1999) ====

After two weeks of Scott Hall returning on WCW programming and taunting announcers, wrestlers, and the company, Nash also returned alongside his friend on June 10, 1996, after Hall interrupted Eric Bischoff. The duo were known as The Outsiders, and the storyline originally pushed them as &quot;invaders&quot; from the WWF (which WCW eventually had to scale back due to legal concerns from the WWF). At Bash at the Beach, Hall and Nash fought the team of Lex Luger, Sting, and Randy Savage and promised to add one more man to their entourage. After Luger was taken out of the match, Hulk Hogan came out to make the save, only to turn on Savage and reveal himself as Nash and Hall&#x27;s third man. Immediately after this, they began cutting promos calling themselves the New World Order (nWo). During his return, he had dyed his hair blonde. Through late 1996 and into 1997, Nash normally teamed with Hall as the Outsiders, and they held the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Nash also began to show his leadership qualities in the nWo, and became a sort of &quot;second in command&quot; alongside Hogan. Nash, Hall, and Sean Waltman distinguished themselves from the rest of the nWo, calling themselves the &quot;Wolfpac&quot; in 1997.

After a while, however, the nWo began to fight within its ranks, with Hogan and Nash battling for control. The situation came to a head on April 20, 1998, during a match between Hogan and recent nWo inductee (and rival) Randy Savage for Savage&#x27;s recently won WCW World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Nash interfered on Savage&#x27;s behalf and jackknifed Hogan to the mat, signaling the breakup of the nWo into two separate factions (Nash&#x27;s interference was not enough to prevent Hogan from regaining his championship, thanks to Bret Hart&#x27;s interference shortly thereafter). Nash became the leader of nWo Wolfpac, alongside Savage, Curt Hennig, and Konnan. Hennig, however, shortly thereafter defected over to Hogan&#x27;s nWo Hollywood faction. Then, during a match between Hall, Nash, Sting and The Giant (who had recently rejoined the nWo after being kicked out two years prior), Hall turned on Nash by hitting him with his tag team title belt and leaving the ring. The Wolfpac, however, was not down for long as Lex Luger joined Nash&#x27;s team. Sting would eventually become a member as well, after being recruited heavily by both sides towards the middle of 1998. After Sting won Giant&#x27;s half of the tag team title at the Great American Bash that June, Nash became Sting&#x27;s partner. They defended the championship until July 20, when they were defeated by Hall and The Giant. Nash then set his sights on his former partner, and the rivalry came to a head at Halloween Havoc on October 25. During the course of the match, Nash jackknifed Hall twice but, instead of pinning him, left the ring and lost via countout. In November 1998, Nash and Diamond Dallas Page became a part of a loosely organised &quot;creative team&quot; which also included Dusty Rhodes and Kevin Sullivan.

The following month at World War 3, Nash entered the 60-man, three ring battle royal that was a staple of the pay-per-view, with the winner getting a shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade the following month. Nash survived to the end after literally clearing his ring out and big booting Lex Luger, who had Scott Hall in the Torture Rack, over the top rope, and earned his shot at the title. At Starrcade, Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (who had an officially given 173–0 win–loss record before the match) after Hall shocked Goldberg with a stun gun. In doing so, Nash broke Goldberg&#x27;s long running undefeated streak. On January 4, 1999, Nash and Goldberg were set to meet in a rematch, but the match did not happen because of Goldberg being arrested for stalking Miss Elizabeth. That night also marked the return of Hulk Hogan after his &quot;retirement&quot; two months prior. With Goldberg unable to wrestle, Nash challenged Hogan instead. Hogan simply poked Nash in the chest, who proceeded to fall down and willingly allow Hogan to pin him for the title. The gesture marked the reunion of the feuding nWo factions into one. The return, however, was short-lived, and by May 1999, the nWo reunion was over due to injuries to Hogan, Hall, Luger and Steiner. Meanwhile, backstage, Nash became WCW&#x27;s head booker in February 1999 and helped write some of the later angles for WCW.

==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1999–2001) ====
In May 1999, Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the second time by defeating Diamond Dallas Page at Slamboree. He then appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and put up a $250,000 challenge to Bret Hart for its May 24 program. However, Bret&#x27;s brother, Owen, died in a wrestling stunt just as Bret was flying to Los Angeles; this immediately canceled their match and the feud. Nash then entered a feud with the returning Randy Savage, who was later joined by a returning Sid Vicious at The Great American Bash in June when he powerbombed Nash during the match, thus giving Nash a disqualification victory (as the signature move of both men, the Jackknife Powerbomb, had been ruled an &quot;illegal&quot; move by WCW leadership due to its high potential for injury). This rivalry culminated in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach in July 1999 which pitted Nash and Sting against Savage and Sid. A stipulation was added that whoever got the pin in the match would become WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Nash was pinned by Savage and lost his championship, but would get his revenge the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot; in a title match between Savage and a returning Hulk Hogan, and in a similar situation to Savage&#x27;s first title defense from the previous year, he used a Jackknife Powerbomb on Savage, preserving the victory for Hogan. The following week, however, Nash attacked Hogan during a match pitting Hogan against Vicious. Nash, Sid, and Rick Steiner then feuded with Hogan, Sting, and a returning Goldberg until Road Wild, where Hogan defeated Nash in a &quot;retirement&quot; match.

On October 4, 1999, Nash returned to WCW along with Scott Hall, which was later revealed to be a new version of the nWo involving Nash, Hall, Bret Hart, and Jeff Jarrett called &#x27;nWo 2000&#x27;. This would not last long either due to the injury of Hart, and Nash spent most of 2000 feuding with the likes of Terry Funk, Mike Awesome, Scott Steiner, and Booker T.

Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship again from Booker T on the August 28, 2000 episode of Monday Nitro in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He eventually lost it to Booker T later on at Fall Brawl. He even had a stint as WCW Commissioner, and he served as a coach/mentor to the Natural Born Thrillers, who would eventually turn on Nash. Nash aligned himself with Diamond Dallas Page, reuniting the Vegas Connection, but renamed the Insiders. They feuded with the Perfect Event (Shawn Stasiak and Chuck Palumbo) and won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Mayhem on November 26, 2000. Shortly after, they were stripped of the title by Commissioner Mike Sanders in mid-December. Weeks later, they won the title back at Starrcade. In 2001 (WCW&#x27;s final months), the Insiders continued their feud with the Natural Born Thrillers. Nash lost another &quot;retirement&quot; match to Scott Steiner at SuperBrawl Revenge, but it would not be long before WCW announced the sale of the company to the World Wrestling Federation. As he had a guaranteed contract with AOL Time Warner, Nash elected to wait out the remainder of his contract, which expired on December 31, 2001.

=== Return to WWF/E (2002–2003) ===
==== New World Order reunion (2002) ====

Following the expiration of his AOL Time Warner contract, Nash, along with Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan, were rehired by the WWF. Their rehiring was announced several weeks before their debut, with Vince McMahon claiming to have hired the nWo in order to destroy the WWF – of which Ric Flair was now a co-owner, which McMahon could not tolerate. Billed as the original nWo, Nash, Hall, and Hogan returned to the WWF at No Way Out on February 17, 2002. In the course of the evening, the nWo delivered an interview in which they claimed to have reformed, gave a six pack of beer to Stone Cold Steve Austin (which he refused), and traded insults with The Rock. They interfered in the main event of the evening, helping Chris Jericho retain his Undisputed WWF Championship against Austin. At WrestleMania X8 on March 17, Nash continually interfered in the match between Hall and Austin to the point where he was forced to return backstage. Later that night, he and Hall turned on Hogan after he had offered congratulations to The Rock for defeating him. In March, Nash suffered a biceps injury that put him out of action for several months and almost immediately upon returning, suffered a quadriceps tear in a tag match on the July 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the July 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the nWo was officially disbanded by Vince McMahon as Eric Bischoff became Raw general manager.

==== Feud with Triple H (2003) ====
After a nine-month injury, Nash returned as a face on the April 7, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, much to the delight of both Shawn Michaels and Triple H, who were feuding with each other when Nash returned. As part of the storyline, Nash was given a choice to remain friends with either Michaels or Triple H. After Nash would not make the decision, Triple H made the decision for him and turned on him with a low blow. This led to Nash and Triple H feuding with one another. Nash teamed up with Michaels and Booker T against Triple H, Ric Flair and Chris Jericho in a six-man tag team match at Backlash on April 27 which ended with Triple H picking up the win for his team, pinning Nash after hitting him with a sledgehammer. Following Backlash, Nash was granted a shot at Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, and the two squared off at Judgment Day on May 18 with Michaels and Flair in their respective corners. Triple H would get himself disqualified and kept the title as a result, but this did not stop Nash from attacking Triple H following the match, putting him through the announcer&#x27;s table with a Jackknife Powerbomb. The next month, they fought again in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood on June 15 with Mick Foley as the special guest referee, but Nash lost the match.

In August, Nash feuded with Chris Jericho and was forced to cut his hair after losing a hair vs. hair match against Jericho on the August 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. This was made to cover Nash having to cut his hair for his role as The Russian for the 2004 &quot;Punisher&quot; film. His last match in WWE was at SummerSlam on August 24 in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Goldberg, Chris Jericho, and Randy Orton. He was the first to be eliminated after Jericho pinned him following Sweet Chin Music from Michaels. Before leaving, however, he executed a Jackknife Powerbomb on Jericho and Orton. Nash then stepped away from in-ring action and underwent neck surgery.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2011) ===

==== Kings of Wrestling (2004–2005) ====

Nash debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) alongside the returning Scott Hall on November 7, 2004, at the inaugural monthly TNA pay-per-view, Victory Road, with the duo helping NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett retain his title in a ladder match with Jeff Hardy. In subsequent weeks, the trio identified themselves as the Kings of Wrestling and began feuding with Hardy and A.J. Styles. At Turning Point on December 5, the Kings of Wrestling were defeated by Hardy, Styles, and Randy Savage.

Hall left TNA in early 2005, and Nash and Jarrett separated after Nash made clear his desire to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash received a title shot against Jarrett on February 13, 2005, at Against All Odds, but lost following interference from the debuting Outlaw. Following the defeat, Nash joined forces with Sean Waltman and began feuding with the newly formed Planet Jarrett. At Destination X on March 13, Nash lost to The Outlaw in a First Blood match following interference from Jarrett, who struck Nash with his title belt. The rivalry between Planet Jarrett and Nash and his allies culminated in a scheduled Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown on April 24 pitting Nash, Waltman, and Diamond Dallas Page against Jarrett, The Outlaw, and &quot;The Alpha Male&quot; Monty Brown. Nash, however, was removed from the card and replaced with B.G. James after contracting a staph infection, which left him sidelined for much of 2005.

Nash returned to TNA on October 1 for the first episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; on Spike TV, attacking and powerbombing Jarrett. Nash went on to challenge Jarrett to a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory on October 23. In the weeks preceding the event, Nash and Jarrett had several heated confrontations, on one occasion brawling with one another and with guest referee Tito Ortiz. On October 22, one day before Bound for Glory, Nash was hospitalized with chest pains. At Bound for Glory, a battle royal was held to determine the number one contender; Rhino won and then defeated Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash was later discharged from the hospital, having suffered a mild cardiac episode. He made a partial return to the ring in December 2005, wrestling several matches on a tour of South Africa.

==== Paparazzi Productions (2006–2007) ====
Nash returned to TNA once more on the April 27, 2006 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, announcing in a pre-taped segment that he would give a private interview to Alex Shelley one week later. The interview saw Nash claim to be the most profitable WWF World Heavyweight Champion of all time and describe the X Division as &quot;basically filler&quot;. Nash went on to announce that he intended to destroy the X Division in order to reassert his position within TNA. He began his campaign at Sacrifice on May 14, powerbombing Puma and continued his campaign on the May 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; by attacking Chris Sabin shortly after he had defeated Petey Williams to win the TNA 2006 World X Cup Tournament for Team USA. Nash continued to attack X Division wrestlers over subsequent weeks, leading to Sabin challenging him to a match at Slammiversary. Nash&#x27;s attacks were also coupled with pre-taped segments with Shelley (some appearing only on the internet website YouTube) and his &quot;X Division debut&quot; on the June 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where Nash wrestled a comedy match against a midget Shelley dubbed a &quot;Sabin-type wrestler&quot;. Nash defeated Sabin at Slammiversary in his second televised match in almost a year, albeit with the assistance of Shelley.

Around this time, Nash and Shelley formed a stable known as Paparazzi Productions, with Johnny Devine as a cameraman. Nash then decided to go for the X Division championship. He got penciled into a Number One Contendership match for the title against Sabin at Hard Justice. He claimed that he had developed an 840° somersault splash that he would unveil in the match. However, over the weekend, he suffered a mysterious neck injury, supposedly while practicing it with Tito Ortiz, and named Alex Shelley as his replacement in the match. From a wheelchair, Nash was helpless as he watched Shelley lose the match to Sabin. Nash remained out of action due to the injury, but returned prior to Bound for Glory, and announced &quot;The Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle Royal&quot;. Austin Starr won the match. Nash took an interest in Starr, which seemed to be at the behest of Shelley. Nash then worked with the X Division stars in a weekly segment known as the Paparazzi Championship Series (a play on the &quot;Bowl Championship Series&quot;). He also began continuing these skits along with Sonjay Dutt and Jay Lethal, in a segment called &quot;Paparazzi Idol&quot;. Nash became a manager of sorts for Lethal, helping him adopt a gimmick where he impersonated &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. At Sacrifice, Lethal and Dutt had an altercation. Nash broke it up, but Sonjay kicked him. Sonjay apologized, and Nash forgave him. Dutt then became the Guru with Nash humming mantras backstage.
He then began managing The Motor City Machine Guns, but this was short-lived before he next appeared in the role of Dr. Nash, psychiatrist and adviser to Kurt and Karen Angle. Nash then engaged in a brief program with TNA Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle, which eventually culminated in Nash aiding Angle. Nash warned the Angles about how dangerous Sting can be based on Nash&#x27;s experience feuding with Sting in WCW. At Bound for Glory, Nash interfered on Angle&#x27;s behalf during his World Title defense against Sting. However, it was for naught, as Sting captured the title from Angle via Scorpion Death Drop after fending off Nash and Angle&#x27;s wife, Karen. The following Thursday on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Nash and Angle had an altercation because Angle blamed Nash for him losing the World Title. Angle eventually attacked Nash, who retaliated by Jackknife Powerbombing Angle in the middle of the ring. The following week, Sting defended the TNA World Title against Angle in a rematch from Bound for Glory, and Nash had a ringside seat. After the match went on a bit, Angle and Sting were out of the ring and when Angle pushed Sting onto Nash, Sting turned around and hit Nash in the face with a right hand shot, leading to Nash interfering on Angle&#x27;s behalf, even though earlier he said he was not going to help Angle. Following the match, which Angle won, Nash offered a hand shake to Angle only to be &quot;flipped off&quot; by the new champ. An enraged Nash demanded a match with Angle, but TNA Management&#x27;s public face, Jim Cornette, instead booked Nash into a tag team match as Angle&#x27;s partner against Sting and a partner of his choosing, with the stipulation being that the person gaining the pinfall or submission would be crowned the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. After a red herring that Scott Hall was the mystery partner, it was revealed to be Booker T.

==== The Main Event Mafia (2008–2009) ====
At Final Resolution on January 6, 2008, Nash and his partner Samoa Joe lost in a title match to TNA World Tag Team Champions A.J. Styles and Tomko after Nash abandoned and seemingly betrayed Joe. Yet on the following &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Joe stormed into Nash&#x27;s locker room looking for a fight, Nash was actually able to persuade Joe into accepting his Machiavellian mentorship. Nash lost to Kurt Angle in a one-on-one match on &quot;Impact!&quot; with the winner qualifying for the Three Ways to Glory match at No Surrender on September 14. On the September 11 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, prior to No Surrender, he seemingly parted ways with Joe on good terms. One month later, Nash returned at Bound for Glory IV on October 12 and in a swerve, struck Joe in the back with Sting&#x27;s bat, helping Sting win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel once again in the process. On the October 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he formally joined Sting, Booker T, Scott Steiner, and Kurt Angle to create a villainous stable called The Main Event Mafia. He explained that he never forgave Joe for his scathing comments directed at his best friend Scott Hall&#x27;s no-show almost a year prior, and befriending him was all part of a long-term plan to screw him out of the title. He then went on to defeat Joe at Turning Point on November 9. Nash, however, was removed from the card for Genesis on January 11, 2009 due to a staph infection, and was replaced by Cute Kip. Nash returned on the January 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; when the Main Event Mafia took over the show. On &quot;Impact!&quot; on April 23, he began an on-screen relationship with Jenna Morasca, who subsequently began acting as his valet. At Slammiversary on June 21, he was reunited with Joe and helped Angle win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.

At Victory Road on July 19, Nash defeated A.J. Styles for the Legends Championship, his first title in TNA. However, Nash lost the title on the July 30 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; to Mick Foley. Under a month later at Hard Justice on August 16, Nash defeated Foley to reclaim the Legends Championship. At Bound for Glory on October 18, Nash lost the Legends Championship to Eric Young in a 3-way match, which also included Hernandez.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after Angle announced the death of The Main Event Mafia and turned face, Nash also became a face as he began feuding with Eric Young and the World Elite. However, the following month at Turning Point on November 15, Nash helped World Elite members Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus retain their TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Nash congratulated Young on outsmarting him at Bound for Glory and aligned himself with the World Elite, while also hinting at the return of the nWo once Hulk Hogan arrived in TNA, as when a paranoid Mick Foley came to him for information on who Hogan would be coming with, he facetiously suggested names such as Syxx-Pac, Scott Steiner, Buff Bagwell, and Scott Hall. Further suspicion was aroused to Hall&#x27;s return when Nash said that he was getting &quot;the band&quot; back together, hinting at an nWo return. At Final Resolution on December 20, Nash took part in the &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; match and won the briefcase containing a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

==== The Band (2010–2011) ====

On the January 4, 2010, special live, three-hour Monday night edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hogan made his debut in TNA, and Scott Hall and Sean Waltman made their return to the company to greet him. Nash, Hall and Waltman quickly reformed their alliance, but Hogan kept himself out of the group, claiming that times have changed. At Genesis on January 17, in their first match back together Nash and Syxx-Pac, who replaced Scott Hall in the match, were defeated by Beer Money, Inc. On the February 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hall and Syxx-Pac turned on Nash. At Destination X on March 21, Nash and Young faced Hall and Syxx-Pac in a tag team match, where The Band&#x27;s TNA futures were on the line. Nash turned on Young and helped the Band pick up the victory, which finally gave them contracts with the company. On the March 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Nash offered Young a spot in the Band, claiming that what happened in Destination X was just business and nothing personal. Young refused the offer and in the main event of the evening, teamed up with Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy to defeat the Band in a six-man tag team steel cage match. Nash gained a measure of revenge on Young by defeating him in a steel cage match at Lockdown on April 18. Later in the night, Nash replaced Syxx-Pac, who no-showed the event, and teamed up with Hall in a St. Louis Street Fight, where they were defeated by Team 3D. On the May 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Eric Young turned on Team 3D and joined The Band. On May 4, at the tapings of the May 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan had been attacked by Samoa Joe, Nash cashed in his &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; contract, teaming with Hall, and pinned him to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Nash later named Young one third of the champions under the Freebird Rule. At the June 14 tapings of the June 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, The Band was stripped of the Tag Team Championship, due to Scott Hall&#x27;s legal problems. The following day it was reported that Hall had been released from his contract with TNA. On the June 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Nash and Young decided to part ways, as Nash intended to go after Hogan, whom he blamed for what had happened to Hall and Waltman, and did not want Young to get into trouble for it.

After Nash was unable to convince Hogan to re–hire Hall and Waltman and failed to secure a meeting with Eric Bischoff, he set his sights on renewing his feud with Jeff Jarrett, who claimed that Nash had tried to hurt TNA by bringing Hall and Waltman in. On the August 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Sting, who had feuded with Jarrett prior to his 30-day suspension, returned to TNA and, together with Nash, beat down Jarrett, Bischoff and Hogan. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Nash defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Sting. The following week Nash helped Sting defeat Jarrett. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Nash and Sting away. At No Surrender on September 5, Jarrett and Joe defeated Nash and Sting in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with a baseball bat. On the September 16 episode of &quot;Reaction&quot;, Nash and Sting were joined by D&#x27;Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff&#x27;s secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Nash and Sting were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory on October 10, Nash, Sting and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Nash and Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they aligned themselves with Jarrett, Abyss and Jeff Hardy. On October 13, 2010, Nash&#x27;s contract with TNA expired and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling. His last TNA appearance was a taped broadcast on October 14, 2010, when Nash and Sting both announced they were walking away from TNA rather than being a part of Hogan and Bischoff&#x27;s regime. In January 2011 Nash signed a new contract with TNA, but was granted a release before reappearing on television, after being contacted by WWE.

=== Independent circuit (2011–2018) ===

Nash along with Hall and Waltman made an appearance at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos. Nash teamed with Waltman for a win against Road Dogg and Billy Gunn.

On September 23, 2012, Nash made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling, teaming with Keiji Mutoh in a tag team match, where they defeated Seiya Sanada and Taiyō Kea with Nash pinning Sanada with the Jackknife Powerbomb for the win. Nash briefly signed with Global Force Wrestling as a &quot;Legend&quot; to help promote events and tours, making appearances at two GFW events on August 28 and 29, 2015. On August 10, 2018, Nash defeated Flex Armstrong for the Big Time Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. This would become his last match, confirming his retirement on January 5, 2020, to heal his body.

=== Second return to WWE (2011–present) ===

==== Feuds with CM Punk and Triple H (2011–2012) ====
On January 30, 2011, at the Royal Rumble, Nash, billed as Diesel for the first time since 1996, returned to the promotion, taking part in the Royal Rumble Match. He entered the match at number 32, but was eliminated by Wade Barrett. It was announced that he had signed a five-year WWE Legends contract. On April 2, Nash, along with Sean Waltman, was on hand to celebrate the induction of Shawn Michaels into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2011. Triple H inducted Michaels, and after Michaels gave his speech, Nash and Waltman joined the two on stage to celebrate.
Nash, no longer billed as Diesel, returned at SummerSlam in August, attacking CM Punk after he became WWE Champion, which allowed Alberto Del Rio to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the title, thus turning heel. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Nash claimed Triple H, on-screen chief operating officer of WWE, had instructed him by text to attack the winner. Punk verbally berated Nash on the microphone, so Nash attacked him the next week. He also distracted Punk in a match, making him miss out on a championship match. Nash was signed to an on-screen contract the next week by John Laurinaitis and demanded a match against Punk. After Triple H booked himself in the match against Punk instead, Nash attacked them both at a contract signing and was fired on screen. At Night of Champions, Nash interfered in their match, alongside The Miz and R-Truth. Triple H then attacked Nash with a sledgehammer before winning the match. Nash returned at the following pay-per-view, Vengeance to help The Miz and R-Truth defeat Punk and Triple H. After the match, he attacked Triple H with a Jackknife Powerbomb and attacked him again the following night with his sledgehammer, preventing him from receiving medical attention and taking him off television. The following Monday, on October 31, Laurinaitis again signed Nash to a new contract. He continued to appear on &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, attacking Santino Marella with a Jackknife Powerbomb and cutting promos about how Triple H was more of a boss than a friend. On the December 5 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Nash competed in his first televised WWE match in eight years, defeating Santino Marella. Nash went on to face Triple H at in a ladder match with a sledgehammer hanging above the ring which he lost by pinfall after a sledgehammer shot to the face, ending the feud in the process.

==== Sporadic appearances and WWE Hall of Famer (2012–present) ====
In late 2012 and early 2013, Nash began appearing on WWE&#x27;s developmental training show, &quot;NXT&quot;. Nash initially appeared as the guest Match Commissioner for the night, a title given to him at the request of Dusty Rhodes. After announcing this to the crowd, Nash was interrupted by Heath Slater to whom he promptly delivered his finisher, effectively turning face. Nash later again appear on the January 20 tapings of &quot;NXT&quot; to reunite with members of The Kliq, allowing him to effectively settle all issues with Triple H, embracing him once again. The reunion also turned into a reunion of D-Generation-X and Nash was awarded the title of being an honorary member of the stable. Nash then helped DX take down Damien Sandow.

Nash competed in the 2014 Royal Rumble match as the 14th entrant, eliminating Jack Swagger before being eliminated by Roman Reigns. He inducted his real-life close friend and former tag team partner, Scott Hall, into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2014. Nash appeared on the August 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to reunite the nWo with Hulk Hogan and Scott Hall as part of Hogan&#x27;s birthday celebration. Nash was suspended by WWE on December 24, 2014, following his arrest, but was quickly reinstated when the charges were dropped.
On the January 19, 2015 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nash appeared with X-Pac and Scott Hall to reunite the nWo, and along with The Acolytes Protection Agency and The New Age Outlaws, they beat down The Ascension, who had been insulting legends from past weeks. On March 23, 2015, it was announced that Nash would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015. On March 28, he was inducted by long-time friend and Kliq member, Shawn Michaels. On March 29, Nash appeared at WrestleMania 31 alongside Hulk Hogan and Scott Hall, in their attempt to even the odds in favor of Sting in his match against Triple H, who had D-Generation X (Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, Shawn Michaels, and X-Pac) in his corner. However, Sting lost the match after Triple H hit him with a sledgehammer as he was attempting a Stinger splash.

Nash made a return to WWE for the &quot;Raw Reunion&quot; show on July 22, 2019. On December 9, 2019, it was announced that Nash would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame (2020 Class) for a second time as a member of nWo, together with Hogan, Hall, and Sean Waltman.

==Personal life==
Nash and his wife Tamara married in 1988, separated in 2000, and later reconciled. Their son, Tristen, born on June 12, 1996, was a solo musician and poet. On October 20, 2022, Tristen died from cardiac arrest that had been triggered by a seizure as a result of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. He was 26 years old.

On March 2, 2016, Nash announced he will donate his brain to the CTE Center at Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation after his death.

Nash is a supporter of the Democratic Party and considers himself to be a centrist Democrat. Nash publicly supported the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign. He has been outspoken about supporting gay wrestlers.

===Legal issues===
In May 2011, Nash was arrested for battery by assaulting a drunk man in a parking lot of a restaurant in Florida, while he and his wife Tamara were leaving. In June 2011, it was announced by prosecutors that Nash was clear of all charges against him, stating that he was only acting in self-defense, as the drunk man was trying to flirt with Nash&#x27;s wife.

On December 24, 2014, just after midnight, Nash was arrested for battery against his 18-year-old son, Tristen. Two hours later, police were called back and Tristen was arrested for battery against Nash&#x27;s wife, Tamara. On January 15, 2015, prosecutors announced that Nash would not face charges. Nash&#x27;s lawyer maintains that Nash was only defending his wife the night he was arrested.

==Legacy==
During his time as WWF Champion, Nash drew poorly and is often labeled as one of the lowest drawing champions of WWF. He has reasoned that in the mid-1990s nobody drew because professional wrestling was in a major recession due to the steroid scandal following the &quot;United States v. McMahon&quot; legal case.

Nash jumping ship to WCW in 1996 along with Scott Hall has often been cited as the main reason behind Vince McMahon&#x27;s decision to start offering downside guaranteed contracts to all of his talent in order to avoid a mass exodus of his talent roster and compete with WCW. The decision proved to be a boon since it changed the salary structure for the WWF wrestlers and helped increase the pay scale for the industry. McMahon also acknowledged in 1998 that letting them defect to WCW made him start offering guaranteed contracts.

In his autobiography &quot;Controversy Creates Ca$h&quot;, former WCW President Eric Bischoff praised Kevin Nash and Scott Hall for contributing to the key elements of the nWo&#x27;s feel and attitude, while others have said that many of the booking ideas that propelled WCW&#x27;s rise came from Nash and Hall. Veteran wrestler &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage credited Nash for spearheading the nWo Wolfpac faction in 1998 which grew in popularity with the fans and became the company&#x27;s hottest selling merchandise.

==Other media==
In 1991, Nash made his acting debut in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; as the genetically enhanced version of the villain, Shredder, called the Super Shredder. He also had a very minor role as a jackhammer worker in the 1998 movie &quot;Family Plan&quot;.

In 1999, Nash created and co-wrote a comic book titled &quot;Nash&quot;, set in a dystopian future and featuring himself as the primary character. Image Comics published an ashcan preview edition and two regular issues.

He was the first choice for the role of Sabretooth in &quot;X-Men&quot;, but the role ultimately went to his former tag team partner Tyler Mane. Nash appeared in a fight scene as The Russian in the 2004 film &quot;The Punisher&quot;. While filming the scene, Nash was accidentally stabbed with a real knife by actor Thomas Jane.

He made guest appearances in three different TV shows. He appeared on one episode each of &quot;The Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot; (episode &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;) and &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; (episode &quot;The Crucible&quot;) and in two episodes of &quot;Nikki&quot; as The Big Easy (episodes &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;Stealing Nikki&quot;). In 2009, he appeared on Fox&#x27;s show &quot;Brothers&quot;, in which he came to get his stolen championship belt back. In 2012, he played a male stripper in &quot;Magic Mike&quot; and reprised the role in the 2015 sequel &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot;. In 2017, he appeared as Big Hank Cramblin on &quot;Detroiters&quot;.

In the spring of 2022, Nash launched a weekly podcast called Kliq This.

<doc id="439261" wikidata="Q180681" url="?curid=439261" title="Air mattress">
<text>An air mattress is an inflatable mattress or sleeping pad.

Due to its buoyancy, it is also often used as a water toy or flotation device, and in some countries, including the UK and South Africa, is called a lilo (&quot;Li-lo&quot; being a specific trademark — derived from the phrase &quot;lie low&quot;) or a Readybed.

==For sleeping==

An air mattress, also known as an airbed or a blow-up bed, is an inflatable mattress made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or textile-reinforced urethane plastic or rubber. The deflated mattress can be compacted and carried or stored in a small form. They are inflated by blowing into a valve, either with a manual or an electric pump. Some are automatically inflated when a valve is opened, up to a certain pressure with additional inflation manually or by pump.

Air mattresses are used for camping, temporary or full-time home use, and may be optimized to combine several uses (e.g., camping and guest use) while others are single purpose. Air mattresses may have customized shapes, such as wheel cutouts for use in the cargo area of a pickup truck or SUV.

Sleeping pads are lightweight, reduced-size and reduced-thickness air mattresses intended for camping and backpacking, and may feature a layer of foam insulation under the air chambers. Higher quality air chambers use vulcanized rubber, covered in canvas or of polyurethane with a cloth shell or tick(ing). Permanent air beds will look almost like conventional beds with the exception of having a hose (one air chamber) or hoses (two air chambers) coming out of the head of the bed. These hoses will be connected to an air inflation device, with two outlet valves, that will have a remote control(s) so that each person can adjust the firmness of his or her side to his/her own exact needs. The firmness can be adjusted up or down, with the simple push of a button, on the remote(s).

A USA government safety agency has warned against letting infants sleep on air mattresses, because they can be too soft and suffocate smaller children (especially those below the age of 8 months) within folds or while entrapped between the mattress and the bed base. Additionally, there have been several recent governmental studies and regulations enacted due to the poisonous nature of the phthalate plasticizers contained within most PVC vinyl air beds and other soft vinyl products. The European Union has made similar efforts to prevent the use of vinyl materials in toys and bedding.

===Air beds===

Larger, more elaborate air mattresses (known as &quot;air beds&quot; in British English speaking locations) have come on the market in recent years that are intended for guest use or as permanent beds in the bedroom. Bed sizes for temporary air beds range from twin to king size, but few guest bed manufacturers offer king size as most guest air beds are sold outside the United States where king-size mattresses are not standard. Most permanent air beds use easy-to-find conventional sheets and bedding. California King (or Western King) sheets and bedding may be more difficult to find as this size was originally conceived for the waterbed industry.

Raised guest or temporary beds are typically raised off the ground to keep users away from the floor and offer a more traditional mattress experience. Though &#x27;raised&#x27; air beds are off the ground, they are not designed for full-time use, as the base of the bed is an air chamber and not a solid foundation.

===Health benefits===
Air mattresses can also improve the quality of life (and potentially provide some measure of relief) for people who suffer with back pain. Having the ability to adjust the firmness of a mattress to accommodate different body shapes, sizes, and weights, can be a factor in the healing process. Air mattresses are sometimes used to protect bedridden people from pressure sores, which can create life-threatening ulcers. Hygiene issues regarding sweat, oils, or other bodily fluids are easily removed by washing the air mattress with warm water along with mild detergents such as liquid soap or heavily diluted bleach and letting it air dry in the shade. New air mattresses can be washed in the same manner as with hygiene related issues but using hot (70 deg Celsius) instead of warm water. that may release VOCs or other toxic compounds from the manufacturing process (which can exacerbate allergies in children or other sensitive individuals) are available.

==For recreation==

=== As a water toy ===

The term air mattress may also refer to a certain inflatable swimming pool or beach toy, which has an air-sac &quot;pillow&quot; and several (usually four or five) tubes running its length. Also called a &quot;lilo&quot; (UK, AUS, NZ, SA), &quot;pool air mat&quot;, &quot;air mat&quot;, &quot;pool lounge&quot;, or &quot;float(ing) mat(tress)&quot;, it is used to recline on the water surface. The Li-Lo trademark for a rubberised material products was registered in UK on 19 Apr 1944 and in the USA on 25 Sep 1947 by P. B. Cow and Co Ltd. An inflatable air mattress for recreational use was advertised as one of the Li-Lo brand of products at the British Industries Fair in London 1949. Although it bears some resemblance to an air mattress, it is typically not built as strongly and may not reliably stay inflated all night long, making it impractical for use as a bed.

== Industry ==
Permanent use adjustable-firmness &quot;airbeds&quot; became popular particularly after market leader Select Comfort began a major marketing campaign around 2001. The original airbed was manufactured by Comfortaire in 1981, which was later purchased by Select Comfort, in January 2013 for $15.5m. Select Comfort announced on March 30, 2017, that they were ceasing all third-party retail sales, of the Comfortaire Line of products, essentially shutting down the Comfortaire Brand. Other manufacturers include Boyd Specialty, InnoMax, and American National.

Less expensive airbeds used for camping or guests include the Aerobed, sold by Jarden subsidiary The Coleman Company.

<doc id="439282" wikidata="Q1361400" url="?curid=439282" title="Gully">
<text>A gully is a landform created by running water, mass movement, or commonly a combination of both eroding sharply into soil or other relatively erodible material, typically on a hillside or in river floodplains or terraces. 

Gullies resemble large ditches or small valleys, but are metres to tens of metres in depth and width, are characterized by a distinct &#x27;headscarp&#x27; or &#x27;headwall&#x27; and progress by headward (i.e., upstream) erosion. Gullies are commonly related to intermittent or ephemeral water flow, usually associated with localised intense or protracted rainfall events or snowmelt. 

Gullies can be formed and accelerated by cultivation practices on hillslopes (often gentle gradients) in farmland, and they can develop rapidly in rangelands from existing natural erosion forms subject to vegetative cover removal and livestock activity.

==Etymology==
The earliest known usage of the term is from 1657. It originates from the French word &quot;goulet&quot;, a diminutive form of &quot;goule&quot; which means &quot;throat&quot;. The term may be connected to the name of a type of knife used at the time, a &quot;gully-knife.&quot;

Water erosion is more likely to occur on steep terrain because of erosive pressures, splashes, scour, and transport. Slope characteristics, such as slope length and amounts proportionate to slope length, affect soil erosion. Relief and soil erosion are positively correlated in southeast Nigeria. There are three types of topography: mountains, cuesta landscapes, and plains and lowlands. While highlands with stable lithology avoid gullying yet allow for vigorous runoff, uplands with friable sandstones are more prone to erosion.

== Formation and consequences ==
Gully erosion can progress through a variety and combination of processes. The erosion processes include incision and bank erosion by water flow, mass movement of saturated or unsaturated bank or wall material, groundwater seepage - sapping the overlying material, collapse of soil pipes or tunnels in dispersive soils, or a combination of these to a greater or lesser degree. Hillsides are more prone to gully erosion when they are cleared of vegetation cover through deforestation, over-grazing, or other means. Gullies in rangelands can be initiated by concentrated water flow down tracks worn by livestock or vehicle tracks. The flowing water easily carries the eroded soil after being dislodged from the ground, typically when rainfall falls during short, intense storms such as thunderstorms.

A gully may grow in length through headward (i.e., upstream) erosion at a knick point. This erosion can result from interflow and soil piping (internal erosion) as well as surface runoff. Gully erosion may also advance laterally through similar methods, including mass movement, acting on the gully walls (banks), and the development of &#x27;branches&#x27; (a type of tributary).

Gullies reduce the productivity of farmlands where they incise into the land and produce sediment that may choke downstream waterbodies and reduce water quality within the drainage system and lake or coastal system. Because of this, much effort is invested into the study of gullies within the scope of geomorphology and soil science, in the prevention of gully erosion, and the in remediation and rehabilitation of gullied landscapes. The total soil loss from gully formation and subsequent downstream river sedimentation can be substantial, especially from unstable soil materials prone to dispersion.

When water is directed over exposed ground, gully erosion removes soil near drainage lines. This may result in divided properties, loss of arable land, diminished amenities, and decreased property values. Additionally, it can lead to sedimentation, discoloration of the water supply, and creating a haven for rodents.

Water rushing over exposed, naked soil creates gullies and ridges that erode rock and soil. When water rushes across exposed terrain, it erodes or pushes dirt away, creating rills. Gravity causes rift erosion on a downward slope, with steeper slopes generating greater water flow. Sandier terrains are more commonly affected by rills most prevalent during the rainier months. Gullies develop when a rill is neglected for an extended time, thickening and expanding as soil erosion persists.

The factors influencing gully erosion were investigated in Zaria, Kaduna state, Nigeria, utilizing SRTM data, soil samples, rainfall data, and satellite imagery. The findings indicated that the factors that had the biggest effects on gully erosion were slope (56%) and rainfall (26%), land cover (12%), and soil (6%). The investigation concluded that each particular component significantly influenced soil loss.

=== Effects of gullies ===
The loss of fertile farmland due to gully erosion is a severe environmental problem that lowers crop quality and may cause famine and food shortages. It also causes the soil to lose organic content, which has an impact on plant viability. As items washed from fields end up in rivers, streams, or vacant land, erosion also contaminates the ecosystem. Because of increased population expansion and increasing land demand, erosion also threatens the natural ecosystem, encroaching on natural forests. Important assets including homes, power poles, and water pipelines may also be destroyed.

=== Prevention of gullies ===
Effective land management techniques can prevent gullies. These techniques include keeping vegetation along drainage lines, using more water, classifying drainage lines as distinct land classes, stabilizing erosion, preventing vermin, distributing runoff evenly, keeping soil organic matter levels high, and avoiding over-cultivation. These tactics guarantee uniform rates of penetration and robust plant coverage.

One serious environmental problem endangering sustainable development is gully erosion. Gullying prevention and control methods are dispersed and lacking, and they have low success and efficacy rates. This review attempts to make a valuable contribution to effective gully prevention and management techniques by combining information from previous research. It is possible to stop the creation of gullies by changing how land is used, conserving water and soil, or implementing specific actions in areas with concentrated flow. Plant leftovers and other vegetation barriers can prevent erosion, although their usefulness is limited. The biophysical environment, terrain, climate, and geomorphology are examples of external elements that affect gully prevention and control.

==== Stabilising gullies ====

Stabilizing gullies entails altering water flow to lessen scouring, sediment buildup, and revegetation. Water can be securely moved from the natural level to the gully floor using a variety of structures, including drop structures, pipe structures, grass chutes, and rock chutes. Structural modifications can be required along steep gully floors. Vegetation can reestablish itself thanks to sediments deposited over flatter gradients. Until the restoration is finished, damaged areas should be walled off.

==== Gully remediation in Eastern Nigeria ====
Eastern Nigeria&#x27;s people and ecology are seriously threatened by gully erosion. A research project focused on 370 families and nine risk regions evaluated the region&#x27;s gully erosion issues. The greatest perceived problem, according to the results, was biodiversity loss. In contrast, damage to properties, roads, and walkways was ranked as the least important issue. This implies a notable variation in the average evaluations across impacted individuals, underscoring the necessity for long-term repair approaches. Reducing soil loss, raising public knowledge of environmental issues, passing environmental legislation, and giving residents funds to strengthen their coping mechanisms are all advised by the study.

In Agulu-Nanka, Southeast Nigeria, a study examined the geoenvironmental causes driving gully erosion. It focuses on catchment management for gully erosion and geotechnical analysis. Through fieldwork, data was gathered utilizing GIS and GPS methods. According to the study, gully erosion occurs throughout, with Nanka/Oko having the highest concentration. The gully characteristic map shows variations in length and depth, emphasizing the necessity of considering gully vulnerability and giving erosion hazards immediate attention.

== Artificial gullies ==
Gullies can be formed or enlarged by several human activities.

Artificial gullies are formed during hydraulic mining when jets or streams of water are projected onto soft alluvial deposits to extract gold or tin ore. The remains of such mining methods are very visible landform features in old goldfields such as in California and northern Spain. The badlands at Las Medulas, for example, was created during the Roman period by hushing or hydraulic mining of the gold-rich alluvium with water supplied by numerous aqueducts tapping nearby rivers. Each aqueduct produced large gullies below by erosion of the soft deposits. The effluvium was carefully washed with smaller streams of water to extract the nuggets and gold dust.

== Termination of gullies ==
Gully initiation results from localized erosion by surface runoff, often focusing on areas where forest cover has been removed for agricultural purposes, uneven compaction of surface soils by foot and wheeled traffic, and poorly designed road culverts and gutters. Termination of gully processes requires water-resource management, soil conservation, and community migration. Gully erosion is localized in the Coastal Plain Sands, Nanka Sands, and Nsukka Sandstone of the Anambra-Imo basin region. The most affected deposits are unconsolidated or poorly consolidated and have short dispersion times. Public education is essential for a sustainable termination strategy, and collaboration between the government, donors, the private sector, and rural people is crucial.

==On Mars==
Gullies are widespread at mid-to-high latitudes on the surface of Mars and are some of the youngest features observed on that planet, probably forming within the last few 100,000 years. There, they are one of the best lines of evidence for the presence of liquid water on Mars in the recent geological past, probably resulting from the slight melting of snowpacks on the surface or ice in the shallow subsurface on the warmest days of the Martian year. Flow as springs from deeper seated liquid water aquifers in the deeper subsurface is also a possible explanation for the formation of some Martian gullies.

<text>In forensic science, questioned document examination (QDE) is the examination of documents potentially disputed in a court of law. Its primary purpose is to provide evidence about a suspicious or questionable document using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court.

==Overview==

Many QDE involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, to a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting wherein the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship.

A document examiner is often asked to determine if a questioned item originated from the same source as the known item(s), then present their opinion on the matter in court as an expert witness. Other common tasks include determining what has happened to a document, determining when a document was produced, or deciphering information on the document that has been obscured, obliterated, or erased.

The discipline is known by many names including forensic document examination, &#x27;document examination&#x27;, &#x27;diplomatics&#x27;, &#x27;handwriting examination&#x27;, or sometimes &#x27;handwriting analysis&#x27;, although the latter term is not often used as it may be confused with graphology. Likewise a forensic document examiner (FDE) is not to be confused with a graphologist, and vice versa.

Many FDEs receive extensive training in all of the aspects of the discipline. As a result, they are competent to address a wide variety of questions about document evidence. However, this &quot;broad specialization&quot; approach has not been universally adopted.

In some locales, a clear distinction is made between the terms &#x27;forensic document examiner&#x27; and a &#x27;forensic handwriting expert/examiner&#x27;. In such cases, the former term refers to examiners who focus on non-handwriting examination types while the latter refers to those trained exclusively to do handwriting examinations. Even in places where the more general meaning is common, such as North America or Australia, there are many individuals who have specialized training only in relatively limited areas. As the terminology varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is important to clarify the meaning of the title used by any individual professing to be a &quot;forensic document examiner&quot;.

==Scope of document examination==
A forensic document examiner is intimately linked to the legal system as a forensic scientist. Forensic science is the application of science to address issues under consideration in the legal system. FDEs examine items (documents) that form part of a case that may or may not come before a court of law.

Common criminal charges involved in a document examination case fall into the &quot;white-collar crime&quot; category. These include identity theft, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, or uttering a forged document. Questioned documents are often important in other contexts simply because documents are used in so many contexts and for so many purposes. For example, a person may commit murder and forge a suicide note. This is an example where a document is produced directly as a fundamental part of a crime. More often a questioned document is simply the by-product of normal day-to-day business or personal activities.

For several years, the American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM) published standards for many methods and procedures used by FDEs. E30.02 was the ASTM subcommittee for Questioned Documents. These guides were under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30.02 on Questioned Documents. When the ASTM Questioned Document subcommittee was disbanded in 2012 the relevant standards moved under the Executive Subcommittee E30.90; however, those standards have all been withdrawn over time. Those standards, as well as links to updated versions of the documents, are presently available on the SWGDOC (The Scientific Working Group for Document Examiners) website.

In 2015, the AAFS Standards Board (ASB) was formed to serve as a Standards Developing Organization (SDO). The ASB is an ANSI-accredited subsidiary of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the Forensic Document Examination Consensus Body within the ASB has published several relevant Standards.

One of those is the &quot;Scope of Expertise in Forensic Document Examination&quot; document which states an examiner needs &quot;discipline specific knowledge, skills, and abilities&quot; that qualifies them to conduct examinations of documents to answer questions about:
# the source(s) of writing;
# the source(s) of machine-produced documents;
# the source(s) of typewriting, impressions, and marks;
# the associations of materials and devices used to produce documents;
# the genuineness and authenticity of documents;
# the detection and decipherment of alterations, obliterations, and indentations, and;
# the preservation and restoration of legibility to damaged or illegible documents&quot;

Some FDEs limit their work to the examination and comparison of handwriting; most inspect and examine the whole document in accordance with this standard.

===Types of document examined===
Documents feature prominently in all manner of business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be a sheet of paper bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a &quot;document&quot;; FDEs define the word &quot;document&quot; very broadly, as any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This includes, for example, graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, and covert markings hidden in a written letter.

==Historical and Noteworthy cases==
===Pre-1900===
* The Howland will forgery trial (1868)
* Although the crimes were committed before the discipline of document examination was firmly established, the letters of the Jack the Ripper case have since been examined in great detail
* The Dreyfus Affair (1894), involving non-FDE Alphonse Bertillon, although professional comparisons exonerating Dreyfus were ignored
* The James Reavis (Baron of Arizona) land swindle trial about forged documents involved in a Spanish barony and land grant (1895)
* The Adolf Beck cases (1896 and 1904) where handwriting expert Thomas H. Gurrin repeated an erroneous identification

===1900-2000===
* The Lindbergh kidnapping (1934) where comparison of the ransom note and Bruno Hauptmann&#x27;s handwriting, by expert Albert S. Osborn, was crucial
* Operation Bernhard, a secret Nazi plan to destabilize the British economy through counterfeited banknotes (1939)
* Active measures, a Soviet-era political warfare program, led by the KGB, including the spreading of disinformation using falsified documents
* The Alger Hiss perjury appeal where the &quot;fake typewriter hypothesis&quot; saw expert Martin Tytell recreate a perfect replica typewriter (1952)

==Candidacy==
A person who desires to enter a career of forensic document examination must possess certain traits and abilities. Requirements for the &quot;Trainee Candidate&quot; (&quot;Standard Guide for Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners&quot;) are listed in ASTM (E2388-11) which has been moved to SWGDOC (G02-13).

First and foremost, &quot;an earned baccalaureate degree or equivalent from an accredited college or university&quot; is required as it gives the aspirant a scientific background with which to approach the work in an objective manner, as well as bestowing necessary biological, physical, and chemical knowledge sometimes called upon in the work.

Second, excellent eyesight is required to see fine details that are otherwise inconspicuous. To this end, the aspirant must successfully complete:
* a form discrimination test to ensure that the aspirant is able to tell apart two similar-appearing yet different items,
* a color perception test, and
* near and distant visual acuity tests &quot;with best corrected vision within six months prior to commencement of training.&quot;

Desirable skills also include knowledge of paper, ink, printing processes, and handwriting.

==Training==
There are three possible methods of instruction for an aspiring document examiner:
# Self-education is the way the pioneers of the field began, as there was no other method of instruction.
# Apprenticeship has become the widespread way many examiners are now taught. This is the method that is recommended by ASTM in Standard E2388-11 and SWGDOC G02-13. To conform with these standards such training &quot;shall be the equivalent of a minimum of 24 months full-time training under the supervision of a principal trainer&quot; and &quot;the training program shall be successfully completed in a period not to exceed four years&quot;. The training program must also include an extensive list of specific syllabus topics outlined in the relevant Standards.
# College and university programs are very limited, due in part to the relatively limited demand for forensic document examiners. It also relates to the need for extensive practical experience, particularly with respect to handwriting examination. It is difficult to include this degree of practical experience in a normal academic program.

There are some distance learning courses available as well. These are taught through a virtual reality classroom and may include an apprenticeship program, a correspondence course, or both.

A trainee must learn how to present evidence before the court in clear, forceful testimony. Fledgling examiners in the later stages of training can get a glimpse into the legal process as well as a better sense of this aspect of their work through participation in a mock trial or by attending court hearings to observe the testimony of qualified examiners. These are guidelines and not requirements.

==Examination==
===Examination types===
Examinations and comparisons conducted by document examiners can be diverse and may involve any of the following:
*Handwriting (cursive / printing) and signatures
*Typewriters, photocopiers, laser printers, ink-jet printers, fax machines
*Chequewriters, rubber stamps, price markers, label makers
*Printing processes
*Ink, pencil and paper
*Alterations, additions, erasures, obliterations
*Indentation detection and/or decipherment
*Sequence determination
*Physical matching

===Principle of identification===
The concept of &#x27;identification&#x27; as it is applied in the forensic sciences is open to discussion and debate. Nonetheless, the traditional approach in the discipline of forensic document examination is best expressed as follows:
&quot;When any two items possess a combination of independent discriminating elements (characteristics) that are similar and/or correspond in their relationships to one another, of such number and significance as to preclude the possibility of their occurrence by pure coincidence, and there are no inexplicable disparities, it may be concluded that they are the same in nature or are related to a common source (the principle of identification).&quot;

The evaluation of such characteristics is now predominantly subjective though efforts to meaningfully quantify this type of information are ongoing. Subjective evaluation does not mean that the results of properly conducted comparisons will be unreliable or inaccurate. To the contrary, scientific testing has shown that professional document examiners (as a group) out-perform lay-people when comparing handwriting or signatures to assess authorship.

However, this type of subjective analysis depends greatly upon the competence of an individual examiner.

It follows that
# an examiner should follow appropriate case examination protocols carefully and evaluate all possible propositions,
# an examiner should be properly trained and their training should include adequate testing of their abilities,
# the formal case examination procedure should incorporate some form of secondary review (ideally, independent in nature) and
# every examiner should make every effort to demonstrate and maintain their competency through professional certification and ongoing proficiency testing.

===Handwriting examinations===

The examination of handwriting to assess potential authorship proceeds from the above principle of identification by applying it to a comparison of samples of handwritten material. Generally known as ACE-V, there are three stages in the process of examination.

As Huber and Headrick explain in their text, these are as follows:
# Analysis or Discriminating Element Determination:The unknown item and the known items must, by analysis, examination, or study, be reduced to a matter of their discriminating elements. These are the habits of behaviour or of performance (i.e., features or characteristics and, in other disciplines, the properties) that serve to differentiate between products or people which may be directly observable, measurable, or otherwise perceptible aspects of the item.
# Comparison:The discriminating elements of the unknown, observed or determined through analysis, examination, or study, must be compared with those known, observed, or recorded of the standard item(s).
# Evaluation:Similarities or dissimilarities in discriminating elements will each have a certain value for discrimination purposes, determined by their cause, independence, or likelihood of occurrence. The weight or significance of the similarity or difference of each element must then be considered and the explanation(s) for them proposed.
# Optionally, the procedure may involve a fourth step consisting of verification/validation or peer review.

The authors note further that &quot;This process underlies the identification of any matter, person, or thing, by any witness, whether technical, forensic, or not.&quot; As such, it is not a formal method, but rather the elements that go into the method.

ASTM published a standard guide for the examination of handwriting titled &quot;E2290-07a: Examination of Handwritten Items&quot; which was withdrawn in 2016. At that time, it was published as the
&quot;SWGDOC Standard for Examination of Handwritten Items&quot;. This was superseded in 2022 by the Academy Standards Board document &quot;Standard for Examination of Handwritten Items&quot;. Some of the guides listed under &quot;Other Examinations&quot; below also apply to forensic handwriting comparisons (e.g., E444 or E1658).

An alternative guide for the examination of handwriting and signatures has been developed by the Forensic Expertise Profiling Laboratory (School of Human Biosciences, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia).

The European Network of Forensic Science Institutes has also published a &#x27;Best Practice Manual for the Forensic Handwriting Examination&#x27;.

<text>The system of auto trails was an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. Marked with colored bands on utility poles, the trails were intended to help travellers in the early days of the automobile.

Auto trails were usually marked and sometimes maintained by organizations of private individuals. Some, such as the Lincoln Highway, maintained by the Lincoln Highway Association, were well-known and well-organized, while others were the work of fly-by-night promoters, to the point that anyone with enough paint and the will to do so could set up a trail. Trails were not usually linked to road improvements, although counties and states often prioritized road improvements because they were on trails.

In the mid-to-late 1920s, the auto trails were essentially replaced with the United States Numbered Highway System. The Canadian provinces had also begun implementing similar numbering schemes.

<text>Operation Baytown was an Allied amphibious landing on the mainland of Italy that took place on 3 September 1943, part of the Allied invasion of Italy, itself part of the Italian Campaign, during the Second World War.

==Planning==
The attack was made by Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey&#x27;s British XIII Corps, which had under command the 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Guy Simonds) and the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard C. Bucknall). XIII Corps was part of the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. XIII Corps crossed the Straits of Messina from Sicily to Reggio di Calabria, covered by a heavy artillery barrage from Sicily and air cover from the Desert Air Force operating from Sicilian airfields. The intent was to tie down German forces in the area and gain an Allied foothold at the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy. Montgomery had objected to &quot;Baytown&quot; as ineffective, preferring to prioritise Operation Avalanche, but followed orders and prepared to carry it out anyway. However, when essential landing craft and naval resources were diverted to &quot;Avalanche&quot; he complained again.

The German commander, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, and his staff did not believe the Calabria landing was the main Allied attack, which they expected at Salerno, or possibly north of Naples, or even near Rome. He therefore ordered &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Traugott Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps, part of the German 10th Army under &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Heinrich von Vietinghoff to pull back from engagement with the Eighth Army and delay them by the demolition of bridges and other infrastructure. A single German regiment was left at the southernmost tip of Italy to support the Italian 211th Coastal Division.

==Execution==
Montgomery&#x27;s objections were proved correct: German troops refused battle and the Eighth Army tied down none of them. The main obstacle to the Allied advance was the terrain and German demolitions.

Opposition to the landings was very light, because the few German troops in the area rapidly withdrew northward. Italian troops on the coast, belonging to the coastal divisions, were poorly equipped, demoralized by the political situation and the massive Allied bombardment; they offered no resistance to the landing. An exception was the 185th Infantry Regiment &quot;Nembo&quot; which was attached to the 211th Coastal Division, had provided more determined resistance on the Aspromonte massif, but was eventually overcome on 8 September 1943. During the fighting, the Canadians killed six and took 57 prisoners, suffering two officers killed.

==Aftermath==
Operation Baytown was followed by Operation Slapstick, with the British 1st Airborne Division (Major-General George Hopkinson), and Operation Avalanche, the main landings at Salerno by elements of Lieutenant General Mark Clark&#x27;s U.S. Fifth Army. Both operations took place on 9 September, following the Italian surrender the day before. The surrender had been agreed on 3 September, but was not publicly announced until 8 September, and had no direct effect on &quot;Baytown&quot;.

<text>Kickstart Kids is a martial arts character development program non-profit organization, formed by Chuck Norris on August 16, 1990 as the Kick Drugs Out of America Foundation.

==History==
On August 16, 1990, the Kick Drugs out of America Foundation (dba Kickstart Kids) was formed by martial artist, actor and philanthropist, Chuck Norris. He wanted to provide a martial arts program that came at no cost to the students, a program that would teach kids all the valiant traits the martial arts has to offer.

In 1992, with the help of former President George H. W. Bush, the program was officially implemented in four schools in the Houston area: Burbank, Central, Hamilton, and Hogg.
Today, the program operates in over 59 schools throughout Texas. The program is taught in mostly middle/junior high schools and some high schools. They currently serve more than 9,500 of today&#x27;s youth, making a positive impact in their lives by teaching character through karate.

In 2003, the foundation was renamed to Kickstart Kids (it still maintains its official name as Kick Drugs Out of America Foundation, but now it has added a &quot;dba&quot; – doing business as – Kickstart Kids).

The stated mission of Kickstart Kids is to teach character through karate to empower youth with core values, such as discipline and respect, to achieve their greatest potential. Kickstart is a center for kids to defend themselves at any moment in need.

<text>Deepak Obhrai (July 5, 1950 – August 2, 2019) was a Tanzania-born Canadian politician, representing the riding of Calgary East (until 2015) and Forest Lawn (from 2015) for the Reform Party of Canada and then the Conservative Party of Canada from 1997 until he died in 2019. He previously served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was the first and only Hindu to become an MP in Canada, and at the time of his death was the longest continuously serving Conservative MP. He ran in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, but was defeated in the first round of voting.

== Early life and career ==
Obhrai was born on July 5, 1950, in Oldeani, Tanganyika, now Tanzania, to a Hindu family. His father died when Obhrai was six, so he was raised by his mother, who worked at a bank. Obhrai went to primary school in Moshi, a town near Mount Kilimanjaro, and went to high school in Arusha before transferring to the prestigious Daly College in Indore, India. He moved to the United Kingdom and trained as an air traffic controller. Disillusioned by the discrimination he faced in Britain, he returned to Tanzania to work. In 1976, Obhrai was on duty at a nearby Tanzanian airport when the Entebbe raid took place in neighbouring Uganda.

Obhrai immigrated to Canada in 1977 with his wife Neena, whom he had married in 1971, and his daughter Priti. He originally wanted to immigrate to Montreal, but decided to avoid Quebec and go to Calgary instead because of the recent election of René Lévesque&#x27;s secessionist Parti Québécois. Obhrai retrained as an accountant in Calgary and got a job with the municipal government. With his wife, he established a dry cleaning business that expanded to three stores.

In the 1990s Obhrai became more involved in Calgary community life, serving as the president of the India-Canada Association of Calgary, the Monterey Park Community Association, and the Hindu Society of Calgary. He also was the vice-president responsible for Alberta in the National Indo-Canadian Council.

=== Municipal and provincial politics ===
In 1993, Obhrai lost a race for an alderman position on Calgary City Council. He launched failed bids for the Progressive Conservative nomination for a provincial by-election in Calgary-McCall in 1995 and for Calgary-Montrose in 1996.

== Federal politics ==
Obhrai&#x27;s successful bid for the Reform Party of Canada nomination in the 1997 federal election was initially obstructed by the local riding association, prompting officials from the office of the party leader, Preston Manning, to intervene. He won the nomination and the riding and was re-elected when the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance in 2000. In 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2015 he was elected as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was also one of four Alliance MPs who agreed to sit with the Progressive Conservative caucus after the December 9, 2003, creation of the merged Conservative Party. The Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance parliamentary caucuses were not officially merged until a few weeks later.

As an opposition member, he served as the Opposition critic for International Cooperation, Multiculturalism, International Trade, and CIDA.

In February 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Obhrai as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In March 2008, he was given the additional responsibility of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Cooperation, a role he held until November 2008; he would hold the role again from November 2010 to January 2011.
During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Obhrai chose not to appear in an all-candidates debate in his riding, citing that his time was better spent talking with constituents. He also said that he &quot;does not wish to debate a Liberal from Toronto,&quot; a reference to Calgary East Liberal candidate Josipa Petrunic, who despite her employment by the University of Toronto, was born and raised in Calgary, which was also where she conducted her research.

As a result of Gurbax Singh Malhi&#x27;s defeat in the 2011 election, Obhrai became the longest serving member of parliament who was of South Asian and/or African ancestry. Obhrai penned a letter to the editor to the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; and to his supporters saying that: &quot;In my birth country, Tanzania, I would henceforth be referred to by the respectful title of &quot;Mzee&quot;. In South Asia, I would receive the title of &quot;Pradhaan&quot;. This means I have now reached the ranks of respected elders.&quot;

On September 19, 2013, Obhrai&#x27;s role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs was augmented when his role was expanded to include responsibility for international human rights. He was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada by Governor General of Canada David Johnston on the advice of Stephen Harper.

In September 2014, Obhrai received the Pride of India Award from the Indo-American Friends Group of Washington, D.C., and the Indo-American Business Chamber in a dinner ceremony held on Capitol Hill for his contributions towards strengthening Canada&#x27;s political, social, and cultural relations with India and for his role in increasing Indian diaspora participation in pluralistic political activity.

Obhrai was the longest-serving Conservative MP in Canada&#x27;s 42nd Parliament. Obhrai served as the International Development Critic in the Shadow Cabinet of Rona Ambrose, before resigning from the Shadow Cabinet to seek the Conservative Party leadership.

===Conservative leadership campaign===
Obhrai ran in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. The focus of his campaign was promoting Conservative outreach to immigrant communities and opposing proposals by fellow leadership candidate Kellie Leitch to screen immigrants for Canadian values. Having received 0.41% of the vote on the first ballot, Obhrai was eliminated after the first round.

===Post-leadership run===
Obhrai did not return to the Shadow Cabinet under new Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.

In December 2017, it was reported that Obhrai was being challenged for the Conservative nomination in Calgary Forest Lawn for the 2019 election by former Calgary-East MLA Moe Amery.

==Death==
Obhrai died of liver cancer on August 2, 2019, in Calgary. He had been diagnosed with the disease just a few weeks earlier. He was the longest-serving Conservative member of Parliament. A memorial service was held in Calgary several weeks after Obhrai&#x27;s death. Stephen Harper and Andrew Scheer were among those who spoke at the service.

<doc id="439315" wikidata="Q4353793" url="?curid=439315" title="HMS Albion (R07)">
<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; (R07) was a 22,000-ton light fleet carrier of the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down in 1944 and launched in 1947 but did not enter service until 1954. She served in the Royal Navy into the early 1970s.

==Construction and modifications==

She was built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Ltd. Her keel was laid down on 23 March 1944 and she was launched on 6 May 1947 by Violet Attlee, wife of the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. On 18 October 1949, she was under tow by tugs , &quot;Hendon&quot; and &quot;George V&quot; from Jarrow to Rosyth when &quot;Albion&quot; collided with from the Longstone Lighthouse. &quot;Maystone&quot; sank, &quot;Albion&quot; received a hole in her stern and started to sink. The three tugs attempted to beach her near St Abbs Head but were hampered when &quot;Hector&quot; became disabled when a tow rope wrapped around her propeller. The tug was sent from Rosyth to assist and the destroyer arrived and took &quot;Hector&quot; on tow until her crew managed to clear the propeller. &quot;Albion&quot; was successfully berthed at Rosyth with of water in her engine room. She was scheduled for completion in 1951 but not fully completed until May 1954. During the night of 19–20 June 1954, helicopters from &quot;Albion&quot; assisted in the search for survivors of a Swissair aircraft that had ditched in the English Channel off Folkestone, Kent. After an initial work up with her air group, in September she joined the Mediterranean Fleet and in October became the flagship of Flag Officer Aircraft Carriers.

==Operational history==
In 1956, after refitting at Portsmouth, &quot;Albion&quot; returned once again to the Mediterranean Sea for operations relating to the Suez Crisis, where her air group struck key Egyptian airfields, and covered the paratroopers&#x27; landings. In July 1958, &quot;Albion&quot; embarked 42 Commando Royal Marines, with all its vehicles and additional equipment, and transported the unit to the Middle East.

Final fixed-wing complement as embarked in 1959–60:
*806 sqn. 8 Sea Hawk FGA6 Fighter-Attack
*894 sqn. 12 Sea Venom FAW21 Night/All Weather Fighter
*849 sqn. D flt. 4 Skyraider AEW1 Airborne Early Warning
*815 sqn. 8 Whirlwind HAS7 Helicopter Anti-Submarine Warfare
*Ships Flight 1 Dragonfly HR5 Helicopter Search and Rescue

The next two years saw her visit the Far East, Australia, New Zealand and the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans, before she returned to Portsmouth to pay off. She was considered as a replacement for the Australian carrier but was rejected, and in January 1961 conversion begun for her to become a commando carrier. She recommissioned in 1962, training with 845 and 846 helicopter squadrons as well as 40 Commando Royal Marines before she joined the Far East Fleet. During this period she gained the nickname &quot;The Old Grey Ghost of the Borneo Coast&quot;.

On 26 November 1962 she collided with a tug in Aden harbour, killing two of the tug&#x27;s crew. She was a vital asset in supporting operations ashore in Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. In 1967 she was part of the RN task force that covered the withdrawal from Aden, and in 1971 was part of another withdrawal of British forces, this time in Singapore and the disbandment of the Far East Fleet.

She sailed from Portsmouth in March 1971 for the Far East, under the command of Captain James Jungius, RN. She paid a brief visit to Ascension Island before visiting Durban in April 1971. She was in Bombay from 3 to 6 May 1971 and, after a passage of nearly seven weeks the ship embarked 40 Commando Royal Marines off Changi for an exercise (set as a counter-terrorist operation in Brunei). A ceremonial entry into Singapore followed with 848 Naval Air Squadron providing a flypast as the air squadron disembarked to . A month alongside in Singapore followed, for an assisted maintenance period (AMP). Having embarked the Australian Army Band, the ship sailed Singapore at the end of June for Japan, carrying out a full-power trial and encountering typhoons on passage. &quot;Albion&quot; was in Kobe from 1 to 8 July 1971 and then returned to Singapore. A night assault exercise followed in the Marang area, in company with a number of other warships and auxiliaries.

After a rough passage the ship arrived in Fremantle on 9 August 1971 for an eight-day visit, with personnel changing from tropical uniform (&quot;whites&quot;) to blue uniform (&quot;blues&quot;) for the Australian winter. She returned to Singapore on 23 August and had another month alongside. Sailing Singapore on 20 September, she spent two days at the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and arrived at Hong Kong on 30 September, where she was alongside the British naval base, , until 11 October.

Back in Singapore on 15 October, her last two weeks at the Singapore Naval Base were spent storing, embarking 40 Commando Royal Marines and 848 Naval Air Squadron as part of the British withdrawal from the Far East. A farewell parade of all British armed forces represented in Singapore was held at 17:30 on 29 October 1971 at the base in Sembawang, the salute being taken by Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burnett. The ship sailed the next day and, on 31 October 1971, the ship was one of twenty in a steampast—and flypast—that marked the handover of the naval base to the ANZUK forces. &quot;Albion&quot; then headed west.

First call was Gan and then on to Mombasa from 14 to 22 November, where the ship underwent a week&#x27;s self-maintenance period (SMP) in Kilindini harbour. She then sailed to Masirah Island and, as part of the &quot;Gulf Covering Force&quot;, assisted with the withdrawal of British forces form the Persian Gulf. On 10 December she was detached, at full speed, to the Bay of Bengal to aid United Kingdom citizens remaining in East Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistan War but was diverted to Gan, where she arrived on 15 December. From Gan, 40 Commando Royal Marines were flown home to the United Kingdom. For the ship, it was Christmas in the Indian Ocean and New Year in Cape Town, from where she sailed on 5 January 1972. Back in home waters, she disembarked 848 Naval Air Squadron on 20 January and entered Portsmouth on 24 January 1972.

After maintenance and leave, the ship sailed from Portsmouth on 11 April 1972, embarking 848 Naval Air Squadron, for the Mediterranean. After a visit to Gibraltar, the ship was lying off Cyprus from 20 to 29 April, supporting Royal Marines in an exercise. Then followed a large NATO exercise, &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;, which included visits to Kavala, Greece, and Souda Bay, Crete. Returning west for home, with a brief stop at Gibraltar, the ship paid an official visit to Brest from 23 to 30 May 1972, flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet, Admiral Sir Edward Ashmore. The ship returned to Portsmouth on the last day of May and, in the first week of June, Captain William Staveley RN assumed command.

June 1972 saw the ship carrying out demonstrations at sea for officers from the Royal College of Defence Studies and, on 14 June, she headed north for Rosyth, where the ship received a visit from the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Having embarked 45 Commando Royal Marines and 848 Naval Air Squadron in the Firth of Forth, she sailed north for exercises in waters around the Orkney Islands. She was in Rotterdam from 28 June to 4 July 1972 and, on 8 July 848 Naval Air Squadron disembarked &quot;Albion&quot; for the last time, before the ship spent Clyde Week in Greenock. Her last United Kingdom port visit was to Dover, marking the ship&#x27;s adoption by the Confederation of Cinque Ports. On 18 July, she held a Families&#x27; Day in Portsmouth before going alongside in the naval base for leave and maintenance.

In September 1972 &quot;Albion&quot; took part in Exercise &quot;Strong Express&quot;, then the largest NATO exercise ever staged, in Norwegian waters around Harstad. Her final deployment was to Canada, and she sailed from Portsmouth on 10 October 1972, embarking 42 Commando Royal Marines and 845 Naval Air Squadron the next day. She arrived in Saint John, New Brunswick, on 19 October and landed 42 Commando for exercises ashore with Canadian forces and, two days later, Halifax, Nova Scotia, for a nine-day visit hosted by HMCS &quot;Stadacona&quot;. She began her passage along the Saint Lawrence Seaway on 31 October, arriving in Montreal two days later. With 150 sea cadets embarked, she sailed from Montreal at 08:30 on 7 November and arrived in Quebec at 20:30 the same day. Sailing 10 November, she called at Saint John on 13 November in order to recover 42 Commando, finally departing Canadian waters on 15 November and heading East across the North Atlantic. At 08:00 on 22 November, &quot;Albion&quot; anchored in Plymouth Sound and disembarked 42 Commando, 845 Naval Air Squadron and Kangaw Flight RM. Sailing from Plymouth the next day, she entered Portsmouth Harbour at 14:30 on 24 November 1972, flying her paying-off pennant, with a fly-past by 845 Naval Air Squadron. The usual activities then began before disposal of the ship: de-ammunitioning, returning equipment, the last ship&#x27;s company dance (ashore), the wardroom paying-off ball and, daily, an exodus of members of the ship&#x27;s company.

==Fate==
In 1973, &quot;Albion&quot; was sold for conversion to a heavy lift vessel for North Sea oil exploration. The plan collapsed and she was instead broken up for scrap at Faslane Naval Base.

<text>Arthur Hanger (born February 19, 1943) is a Canadian politician.

Hanger is a former member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, having represented the riding of Calgary Northeast from 1993 until his retirement in 2008. He was elected as a member of the Reform Party of Canada (1993–2000) and the Canadian Alliance (2000–2003) before the present-day Conservatives were re-formed. Born in Three Hills, Alberta, Hanger is a former officer of the Calgary Police Service.

==Early political career==
Hanger came to the House of Commons when he won the largest plurality of votes in Calgary Northeast in the 1993 Canadian federal election. He was seen as one of the more radical members of the Reform Party, with these views culminating in March 1996 when he announced that he supported corporal punishment and had booked a trip to Singapore to investigate its use of caning in deterring crime. After public outcry and criticism from within the party, the trip was cancelled.

Hanger was the Official Opposition critic for Citizenship and Immigration (2001–2004), with special responsibility for Foreign Credentials (2004). He was a former Chief Official Opposition critic for National Defence (1997–2001) and Opposition critic for the Solicitor General (1995–1997).

He was vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in the 38th Parliament, and vice chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs in the 36th Parliament. He served as a member of various other Parliamentary committees during his career as an MP.

In the summer of 2001, Hanger was the first Alliance MP to be suspended from caucus for criticizing the leadership of Stockwell Day. However, he did not become a member of the Democratic Representative Caucus, as he accepted the September 10, 2001, reinstatement offer that was made to all the dissident MPs.

On March 31, 2004, he was the only Conservative MP in the House of Commons to join with 18 Bloc Québécois MPs to vote against the referral of the Older Adult Justice Act to the Standing Committee on Justice. The move was in contrast to the support the bill garnered from virtually all members of his own party, as well as the governing Liberals and the New Democratic Party. Hanger provided no comment about why he voted against this law.

==Chair of Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights==
During the first two sessions of the 39th Parliament he served as chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and also chaired the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.

Hanger announced on October 10, 2007, that he would retire at the next election, which was held in 2008.

<text>William Thomas Cahill (June 25, 1912July 1, 1996) was an American politician, lawyer, and academic who served as the 46th governor of New Jersey from 1970 to 1974. A Republican, Cahill previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly and U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Cahill was born in Philadelphia to Irish immigrants William P. Cahill and Rose Cahill. The family moved to South Jersey in 1919. He attended Camden Catholic High School in Camden, New Jersey, and graduated in 1929. Afterwards, Cahill graduated St. Joseph&#x27;s College (now Saint Joseph&#x27;s University) at Philadelphia in 1933. He returned to Camden to study at the Rutgers School of Law - Camden, receiving his law degree in 1937.

== Political career ==

In 1937 and 1938, Cahill was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1939 he was admitted to the bar and began his political career. Living in Collingswood, New Jersey, Cahill was the city prosecutor of Camden, New Jersey, in 1944 and 1945, was the first assistant prosecutor of Camden County from 1948 to 1951 and was a special deputy attorney general of the State of New Jersey in 1951.

Cahill was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1951 to 1953. Cahill was elected to the Eighty-sixth and to the five succeeding Congresses. During his tenure in the US House, Cahill voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He served in the House until resigning to assume his seat as governor, serving from January 3, 1970, to January 19, 1974. Throughout his tenure in Congress and as governor, Cahill was widely viewed as a moderate Republican.

===Governor of New Jersey===

In 1969, Cahill ran for Governor of New Jersey, facing off against Democrat Robert B. Meyner, who had previously held the office from 1954 to 1962. Cahill defeated Meyner and became New Jersey&#x27;s first Republican governor in 16 years.

Cahill served as governor from January 20, 1970, to January 15, 1974, and assumed office with a Republican-controlled legislature to support him. Among his accomplishments as governor were new automobile emission standards, an increase in the sales tax from 3 to 5 percent, the introduction of the state lottery, and the passage of no-fault auto insurance. He also played a role in bringing the New York Giants from Yankee Stadium to a new field in the Hackensack Meadowlands.

On Thanksgiving Day 1971, two months after the Attica State prison riots in upstate New York, a similar rebellion rose at Rahway State Prison. The revolt was quieted without violence, and Cahill&#x27;s role in ending the conflict was widely commended. Cahill also appointed a commission that recommended the creation of a state income tax, which proved to be controversial with voters. The proposal was defeated in July 1972, but a state income tax was finally instituted four years later, after Cahill left office.

In spite of his many successes and accomplishments as governor, Cahill&#x27;s term was derailed by scandal. In 1972, Secretary of State Paul J. Sherwin was convicted for fixing a $600,000 state highway contract with a contractor who returned the favor with $10,000 to Cahill&#x27;s associates. Then, in April 1973, former New Jersey Republican State Committee chairman Nelson G. Gross and State Treasurer Joseph McCrane, who had been finance chairman for Cahill&#x27;s 1969 campaign, were both charged with illegally making campaign donations to the governor as tax deductions. Both men were convicted the following year. Although investigators were unable to implicate Cahill in either affair, his reputation suffered as a result of these setbacks.

Cahill ran for re-election in 1973. Damaged by the scandals in his administration, he was defeated in the Republican primary election by the more conservative Congressman Charles Sandman, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat Brendan Byrne. During his final months as governor, Cahill named his predecessor, Democrat Richard J. Hughes, as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.

==Death==
After his term as governor, Cahill was a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University from 1974 to 1978. Cahill died at his daughter&#x27;s house in Haddonfield, New Jersey, on July 1, 1996, of peripheral artery disease. A funeral service was held at Christ the King R.C. Church. Then-governor Christine Todd Whitman, and former governors Brendan Byrne, Thomas Kean, and James Florio were in attendance. Cahill was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Cherry Hill Township, New Jersey. The William T. Cahill Center for Experiential Learning and Career Services at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, was dedicated in his honor on September 10, 1997.

<text>HMS &quot;Albion&quot; is a landing platform dock of the Royal Navy, the first of the two-ship . Built by BAE Systems Marine in Barrow-in-Furness, &quot;Albion&quot; was launched in March 2001 by the Princess Royal. Her sister ship, , was launched in November 2001, also from Barrow. Affiliated to the city of Chester and based in Plymouth, she is the ninth ship to carry the name (after Albion, an ancient name of Great Britain), stretching back to the 74-gun 1763 warship, and last carried by an aircraft carrier decommissioned in 1973 after 19 years service. Designed as an amphibious warfare ship, &quot;Albion&quot; carries troops, normally Royal Marines, and vehicles up to the size of the Challenger 2 main battle tank. She can deploy these forces using four Landing Craft Utility (LCUs) and four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs). A flight deck supports helicopter operations.

&quot;Albion&quot;″s future came under review as part of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. She was the fleet flagship from December 2010 until October 2011, and then again from March 2018 until January 2021. On 20 November 2024 Defence Secretary John Healey announced that both Albion and her sister Bulwark would be withdrawn from service by March 2025.

==Operational history==
Ordered for the Royal Navy on 18 July 1996, &quot;Albion&quot; was constructed by BAE Systems Marine at its shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The first steel was cut on 17 November 1997, and the ship″s keel was laid down on 23 May 1998. The vessel was launched on 9 March 2001. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 19 June 2003 by her sponsor Anne, Princess Royal. &quot;Albion&quot; is the nameship of the , which also includes . The ship also carries a permanently embarked Royal Marines landing craft unit, 6 Assault Squadron, Royal Marines.

Along with sister ship &quot;Bulwark&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot; forms a key part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s amphibious warfare capability. The ship can carry up to 256 soldiers in normal conditions, ordinarily Royal Marines. &quot;Albion&quot; can also carry their various associated armoured vehicles, up to the size of the Challenger 2 main battle tank. Vehicles can be deployed through an internal dock, using the ship&#x27;s complement of four Landing Craft Utility (LCUs), while troops can be deployed from davits using four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs). Also equipped with a flight deck, the ship can operate two helicopters, with a third parked. CH-47s can sling-load RM BvS 10 Viking light tracked, amphibious armoured vehicles and deliver them ashore if the sea states are too severe for them to swim ashore.

===2003–2011===
In 2003, &quot;Albion&quot; was granted the Freedom of the City of Chester and also had a prominent role in the Queen&#x27;s Colour Parade for the Royal Navy in Plymouth Sound; the third time a Fleet Colour has been given in the Royal Navy&#x27;s history. In early 2004 the ship deployed on a multinational exercise for the first time, taking part in Exercise Joint Winter 04 off Norway, during which she completed her cold weather sea trials and was declared fully operational. Her next deployment was the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States. On 11 November 2004, the ship was sent to Ivory Coast to support Operation Phillis. &quot;Albion&quot; underwent a refit in early 2006, which included the installation of a new command, control, and communications suite.

&quot;Albion&quot; attended the HMNB Devonport Navy Days, 26–28 August 2006. Also in attendance was her sister ship, &quot;Bulwark&quot;, recently returned from the Lebanon evacuation. &quot;Ocean&quot; was unable to attend due to three sailors contracting tuberculosis; she was moved to HMNB Portsmouth.

During the Vela Deployment to West Africa, &quot;Albion&quot; acted as the Amphibious Task Group flagship. The deployment lasted from 11 September to 22 November 2006. Approximately 3,000 British personnel and 11 ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary were involved. This deployment saw, for the first time, an &quot;Albion&quot;-class vessel taking part in amphibious operations with a auxiliary landing ship dock, .

In late July and early August 2007, &quot;Albion&quot; was anchored off Sunderland during the city&#x27;s air show.

In late 2008, &quot;Albion&quot; undertook her first refit, to upgrade various electronic and defence systems. During this docking period the Commanding Officer, Captain Wayne Keble, assumed command of &quot;Albion&quot;″s sister ship, &quot;Bulwark&quot;.

In April 2010, during the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, &quot;Albion&quot; was sent to Santander, Spain as part of Operation Cunningham to bring back soldiers from the third battalion The Rifles battlegroup, Royal Air Force personnel and stranded British citizens. In May 2010, &quot;Albion&quot; together with and other Royal Navy, French and US vessels, joined the multi-national AURIGA Task Group for amphibious exercises at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

In late 2010, despite having been in commission for only seven years, the ship&#x27;s future was uncertain, with either &quot;Albion&quot; or her sister ship &quot;Bulwark&quot; due to be put into extended readiness as a result of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review.

In December 2010, &quot;Albion&quot; was announced as the next Royal Navy flagship and flagship of the UK Responsive Force Task Group, following the early decommissioning of the aircraft carrier , which occurred in March 2011, also as a result of the 2010 review.

In March 2011, &quot;Albion&quot; took part in Exercise Green Alligator with HQ of 3 Commando Brigade, the Joint Helicopter Command, the Royal Netherlands Marines Corps and 539 Assault Squadron RM. She was the main ship of the deployed Royal Navy Response Force Task Group. In May 2011, the Task Group took part in Exercise Cypriot Lion.

In June 2011, the ship had been redeployed along with the Response Force Task Group to the Gulf of Sidra off Libya to provide assistance to the ongoing NATO-led operation there. She subsequently continued on to the Indian Ocean, passing through the Suez Canal on 15 June, to assist with anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa.

On 20 September 2011, &quot;Albion&quot; docked at Liverpool Pier Head to celebrate her 10th anniversary with a six-day stay. She was open to the public on the following Saturday and Sunday (24 &amp; 25 September 2011). This was her second visit to Liverpool, having previously visited in March 2010.

===Extended readiness 2011–2017===
In late 2011 &quot;Albion&quot; entered a state of &quot;extended readiness&quot; (joining the UK&#x27;s equivalent to a Reserve Fleet), after &quot;Bulwark&quot; completed a major refit.

In order to cut the running costs of the Royal Navy, the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review concluded that one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s two landing platform docks, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot;, should be placed into extended readiness while the other is held at high readiness for operations. Both vessels will alternate between extended readiness and high readiness throughout their service lives.

It was confirmed that &quot;Albion&quot; would be the first of the two vessels placed at extended readiness, for a cost of £2.5 million as &quot;Bulwark&quot; had recently finished a major refit. Running costs while in extended readiness were estimated to be £300,000 per annum in order to keep the vessel available for reactivation at short notice if needed.

In December 2014, &quot;Albion&quot; was moved into dry dock at Plymouth to allow her hull to be inspected and cleaned prior to the major work being undertaken to reactivate the ship. The major refit, plus the associated work up period, will take approximately 2.5 years, with &quot;Albion&quot; initially slated to assume the role of Fleet Flagship in April 2017.

The running costs of one of the &quot;Albion&quot;-class vessels at high readiness ranged from £17.7 million – £38.6 million per annum from 2007 to 2011.

&quot;Albion&quot;″s refit included the fitting of Phalanx CIWS in place of the Goalkeeper CIWS, a Type 997 radar and a new command system.

===2017–present===
Ship&#x27;s staff moved back onboard &quot;Albion&quot; at the end of January 2017, formally taking responsibility for the ship from Babcock with the aim of taking &quot;Albion&quot; to sea for the first time in six years in summer 2017.

On 6 February 2018, &quot;Albion&quot; deployed for the first time since her refit to relieve &quot;Duncan&quot; as flagship of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the planned out-of-service date for &quot;Bulwark&quot; is 2033. However, in October 2017, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; reported that the Ministry of Defence was considering decommissioning &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot;, as part of a package of cost-cutting measures intended to mitigate the expense of the Royal Navy&#x27;s two new aircraft carriers. This action was reversed by then Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in September 2018.

In April 2018, &quot;Albion&quot; was dispatched to the Asia-Pacific to assist in enforcing sanctions against North Korea.

On 4–6 February 2020, &quot;Albion&quot; hosted the crew of &quot;Uma&quot;, a 36-foot sailing yacht that is featured on the YouTube channel &quot;Sailing Uma&quot;. The Uma crew produced two episodes about their experiences on &quot;Albion&quot;.

In September 2020, &quot;Albion&quot; embarked on a unique deployment named Littoral Response Group eXperimental (LRG(X)). This would see the ship enter the Mediterranean with embarked Royal Marine Commando forces and Royal Naval personnel testing and developing pilot projects such as experimental unmanned aerial drones and autonomous vehicles for logistical and intelligence gathering purposes, in the operational environment. The deployment was the first that Albion had carried out with the full ships company remaining on board without leave, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

On 27 January 2021, &quot;Albion&quot; transferred Fleet Flagship duty to HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; (R08).

In July 2023, &quot;Albion&quot; returned to Devonport from her final deployment prior to going into a state of &quot;reduced readiness&quot; (skeleton crew on board for ship maintenance). It had been anticipated that HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; would assume &quot;Albion&#x27;s&quot; former frontline role in 2024 after completing a prolonged refit, though it was then reported that she would also be retained in reserve. &quot;Albion&quot; herself had been expected to remain in &quot;extended readiness&quot; (uncrewed reserve) until at least 2029 with her return to active operations at that point dependent on her receiving a further refit to allow her to continue in service into the early 2030s.

However, in November 2024, the government announced that &quot;Albion&quot; would, be taken out of service by March 2025.

<text>Ruth Sawyer (August 5, 1880 – June 3, 1970) was an American storyteller and a writer of fiction and non-fiction for children and adults. She is best known as the author of &quot;Roller Skates&quot;, which won the 1937 Newbery Medal. She received the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award in 1965 for her lifetime achievement in children&#x27;s literature.

==Life==
Sawyer was born on August 5, 1880, in Boston, Massachusetts. She was the youngest of five children, was the only daughter of Francis Milton and Ethalinda Smith Sawyer. While she was still a baby they moved to New York City, where she attended private school. The product of a wealthy family, Sawyer had an Irish nanny named Joanna, who inspired her love and appreciation of storytelling. Upon the death of her father, a New York City importer, the family moved to their summer cottage in Maine. There they lived off the land, an experience that Sawyer later described in her novel, &quot;The Year of Jubilo&quot;. Eventually the family returned to New York and Sawyer attended the Garland Kindergarten Training School for two years.

In 1900, Sawyer left Garland and traveled to Cuba. There she taught storytelling to teachers who were opening kindergartens for children orphaned during the Spanish–American War. After returning to the United States, her work in Cuba helped her obtain a scholarship to Columbia University where she studied storytelling and folk lore. She received her BS in education from Columbia in 1904. She then went to work for the New York school system, telling stories to people born overseas. In 1910 she started the first storytelling program for children for the New York Public Library.

Sawyer also wrote articles for &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, which twice sent her to Ireland to study. While overseas on those and other trips she collected folk tales and continued learning the art of storytelling, eventually becoming well known for her folk tale collections and storytelling prowess. Her life experiences frequently gave Sawyer ideas for her books, and she spent her life collecting and telling folk tales and stories. At least one biographer pointed out the parallel between Sawyer and the Brothers Grimm.

In 1911 Sawyer married ophthalmologist Albert C. Durand. They lived in Ithaca, New York, and had two children, Margaret (Peggy) and David. Peggy, a children&#x27;s librarian, married Robert McCloskey, who later became a famous children&#x27;s author and illustrator, best known for writing &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;.
Sawyer worked for the Cornell University Extension Services from 1923 to 1933, traveling through rural New York telling stories and lecturing about books. In 1931, though Spain was already torn by factions of the upcoming Civil War, Sawyer spent the year traveling around the country collecting folk tales. While there she met a young boy who would become the model for her book &quot;Tono Antonio&quot;.

From 1935 to 1945 Sawyer visited the West Virginia Federal Reformatory for Women every month, telling stories. There she met a Hungarian woman who told her about Christmas in her country. This became the basis for Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Anna Angel&quot;.

After Sawyer&#x27;s husband retired in 1946, they moved to Maine, where they lived until resettling in Boston in 1956. In 1965 she received the seventh annual Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association for &quot;continued, distinguished contribution to children&#x27;s literature without regard to the nature of the contribution.&quot; That year she also became the third recipient of the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award from the Association for Library Service to Children, which recognizes an author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made &quot;a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children&quot;. At the time, it was awarded every five years.

Sawyer never stopped writing, traveling or telling stories. At age 81 she went to Austria to research the legend of the Dwarf King named Laurin.

Ruth Sawyer, &quot;the great lady of American storytelling&quot;, died June 3, 1970, in Lexington, Massachusetts. Her papers are held at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.

==Writing career==

Sawyer&#x27;s first book was an adult novel, &quot;The Primrose Ring&quot;. It appeared in 1915 and was made into a silent film in 1917, starring Mae Murray and an uncredited Loretta Young in her film debut as a fairy.

The next year Sawyer published her first book for children, &quot;This Way to Christmas&quot;. The story is about a young boy—based on her son, David—whose parents go on a trip and leave him in the care of an Irish couple, Joanna and Barney. In each chapter David listens to a new Christmas story or folk tale.

Sawyer published one book every year or two for the next twenty years. Her best known book, &quot;Roller Skates&quot;, was published by Viking Press in 1936. A fictional autobiography, &quot;Roller Skates&quot; tells of one year in the life of ten-year-old Lucinda Wyman, who was named for one of Sawyer&#x27;s grandmothers. Lucinda&#x27;s parents are traveling to Europe and leave her with the Misses Peters in New York City. Permitted almost unlimited freedom, Lucinda roller skates through the city, meeting people of all ages and nationalities. &quot;Roller Skates&quot; is considered ahead of its time because of Lucinda&#x27;s freedom and the difficult issues that she must navigate throughout the book, such as the death of two of her friends. She won the 1937 Newbery Medal from the professional librarians, recognizing it as the previous year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American children&#x27;s literature&quot;.

&quot;The Year of Jubilo&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Roller Skates&quot;. Published in 1940, it takes Lucinda and her family to Maine after the death of her father. Again Sawyer fictionalized her own life. The next year saw two books published by Sawyer. &quot;The Least One&quot;, a children&#x27;s story illustrated by Leo Politi, and &quot;The Long Christmas&quot;. The latter is a collection of thirteen Christmas legends, rhymes and carols from around the world.

Sawyer&#x27;s next books appeared in 1944. &quot;The Way of the Storyteller&quot; is divided into two parts. The first contains directions for those who want to learn storytelling techniques, with practical suggestions for performance, memorization, and improving skills. The second section has eleven stories especially suitable for telling aloud. &quot;The Way of the Storyteller&quot; was used as a textbook for teachers, librarians and storytellers for many years, appearing in a revised version in 1962.

The second Sawyer book published in 1944 was &quot;The Christmas Anna Angel&quot;. Based on the stories she heard from a woman in the West Virginia Federal Reformatory, it tells about a young girl growing up in Hungary during World War II. The deprivation of war means there&#x27;s very little for the family to celebrate with, but the heroine of the story is convinced an angel will provide a miracle in time for Christmas. Illustrated by Hungarian-born Kate Seredy, the book was a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal.

By this time Sawyer&#x27;s fiction writing was exclusively for children. She published several more children&#x27;s books in the late 1940s and 1950s, including &quot;Maggie Rose, Her Birthday Christmas&quot;. Set in Maine, this story of a young girl&#x27;s dream for a real Christmas birthday party is illustrated by Maurice Sendak.

For &quot;Journey Cake, Ho!&quot; Sawyer collaborated with her son-in-law Robert McCloskey. Sawyer wrote the story, a fresh take on the theme of run-away food. McCloskey provided the illustrations and he was a runner-up for the 1954 Caldecott.

Sawyer&#x27;s final children&#x27;s novel was &quot;Daddles, The Story of a Plain Hound-Dog&quot;. In &quot;Daddles&quot;, the narrator remembers three summers she and her brother spent in their cottage in Maine. The first two summers they share their adventures with a hunting dog named Daddles. The third summer they come back to find their companion has died.

==Storytelling==

Sawyer has been called &quot;a story teller with consummate gifts – whose tales both oral and written should be characterized as living folk-art&quot;. Children&#x27;s literature expert May Hill Arbuthnot called her &quot; a fine storyteller with an unerring sense of words, mood, and the music of narration&quot;. She went on to say &quot;There is no one else who can relate Irish stories as she does&quot;. Librarians Brandi Florence &amp; Erica Jarvis write &quot;She had an ability to take old narratives and infuse them with new life so as to make them accessible to a new generation&quot;.

<text>Jason Thomas Kenney (born May 30, 1968) is a former Canadian politician who served as the 18th premier of Alberta from 2019 until 2022, and the leader of the United Conservative Party (UCP) from 2017 until 2022. He also served as the member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Calgary-Lougheed from 2017 until 2022. Kenney was the last leader of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) before the party merged with the Wildrose Party to form the UCP. Prior to entering Alberta provincial politics, he served in various cabinet posts under Prime Minister Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2015.

Kenney studied philosophy at the University of San Francisco, but returned to Canada without completing his degree. In 1989, he was hired as the first executive director of the Alberta Taxpayers Association before becoming the president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Kenney was elected to the House of Commons in the 1997 federal election for the Reform Party. In 2000, he was re-elected as a Canadian Alliance candidate and then was re-elected five times as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada.

Following the Conservative victory in the 2006 federal election, Kenney was appointed parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Harper. In January 2007, he was sworn into the Privy Council as the secretary of state for multiculturalism and Canadian identity. Kenney held the post of minister for citizenship, immigration and multiculturalism from October 2008 to July 2013, when he became minister of employment and social development and minister for multiculturalism. In February 2015, he was named minister of national defence. Kenney was considered a potential party leader following the defeat of the Conservative government in October 2015 and resignation of Harper as leader.

In July 2016, Kenney announced his intention to run for the leadership of the Alberta PCs in that party&#x27;s 2017 leadership election. Kenney resigned his seat in Parliament on September 23, after sitting in the House of Commons for over 19 years. He was elected party leader on March 18, 2017, on a platform of merging with the Wildrose Party. He was leader until the merger was effected on July 24. Kenney was then elected United Conservative Party leader on October 28.

On April 16, 2019, Kenney led the United Conservative Party to a majority government in the 2019 Alberta general election, defeating incumbent Premier Rachel Notley of the New Democratic Party. Kenney came under criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic from members within the UCP and the general public, triggering a leadership review in May 2022. On May 18, 2022, Kenney narrowly won the leadership review 51.4% to 48.6%, but announced that this support was insufficient and that he would step down as UCP leader. Kenney remained premier until October 11, 2022. Danielle Smith was chosen to succeed him by the United Conservative Party on October 6, 2022.

==Early life and career==
Jason Thomas Kenney was born on May 30, 1968, in Oakville, Ontario, the son of Lynne (Tunbridge) and Robert Martin Kenney. His father was a teacher at Appleby College and was of Irish heritage. Kenney&#x27;s grandfather was jazz musician and big band leader Mart Kenney.

Kenney attended the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, a private Catholic high school of which his father was president. Kenney may have been inspired to enter politics following a brief discussion with former prime minister John Diefenbaker.

Kenney studied philosophy at the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit university in San Francisco, California, but failed to complete his coursework. It was there that he discovered conservatism. During his time in California, Kenney was interviewed by CNN for a segment exploring religious values. In the segment, where he was credited as &quot;Jason Kenny – Anti-abortion Activist,&quot; he argued against Jesuit professors who declared free speech as essential to a university. Allowing pro-choice activists on campus, Kenney argued, was &quot;destroying the mission and the purpose of this university.&quot; In the student newspaper, the &quot;San Francisco Foghorn&quot;, he suggested that giving a platform to pro-choice groups would mean the school had no basis to refuse a similar platform to pedophiles or to the Church of Satan.

The Archbishop rejected Kenney&#x27;s petition that summer, and he never returned to complete his undergraduate degree. Instead, Kenney returned to Canada to begin work for the Saskatchewan Liberal Party. He was &quot;very involved in the young Liberals&quot; as a young man, and in 1988 was executive assistant to Ralph Goodale, the leader of the provincial party at the time. Not long after, in 1989, Kenney was hired as the first executive director of the Alberta Taxpayers Association, which advocated for fiscal responsibility. In 1990, Kenney was named president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a self-described taxpayer&#x27;s advocacy group that scrutinizes governmental expenditure from a conservative perspective.

==In opposition (1997–2006)==

Kenney was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1997, at the age of 29. He was elected as a member of the Reform Party of Canada, which later became the Canadian Alliance. While a member of the House of Commons, Kenney was co-chair of the United Alternative Task Force, national co-chairman of Stockwell Day&#x27;s campaign for leadership of the Alliance, and national co-chair of the Canadian Alliance&#x27;s 2000 election campaign. While on the Opposition benches between 1997 and 2006, Kenney served in several prominent shadow cabinet roles, including deputy House leader for the Official Opposition, critic for Canada–United States relations, critic for national revenue, and critic for finance.

He was a member of a group of Reform Party MPs that were known as the Snack Pack due to their habit of eating greasy food and ridiculing the ruling Liberals.

Kenney supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and suggested that the Chrétien government&#x27;s refusal to support the war would damage Canada&#x27;s relationship with the United States.

Kenney was a member of the Canada Tibet Committee and hosted the Dalai Lama in 2010.

==Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (2006–2007)==

On February 6, 2006, Kenney and Sylvie Boucher were appointed as parliamentary secretaries to the prime minister, Stephen Harper. That August, when two opposition MPs suggested removing Hezbollah from Canada&#x27;s list of terrorist organizations, Kenney came under fire for comparing the organization to the Nazi Party. Later, he rebuked Prime Minister of Lebanon Fuad Saniora for his criticisms of Canada, invoking the $25 million CAD that the country received from Canada in reconstructive assistance during the 2006 Lebanon War.

==Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity (2007–2008)==
On January 4, 2007, Kenney was sworn in as the secretary of state for multiculturalism and Canadian identity and as a Privy Councillor. In this capacity, Kenney was the Harper government&#x27;s representative to ethnic communities in Canada, and made frequent appearances at ethnic community events across the country.

In early 2008, Kenney posted an announcement on his website, declaring that the Canadian government recognized the flag of the Republic of Vietnam as the symbol of the Vietnamese-Canadian community. Further, he declared that &quot;attempts to disparage [the flag] are a deeply troubling attack on one of Canada&#x27;s ethnic communities and on the principles of multiculturalism.&quot; In May 2008, he made a speech at an Army of the Republic of Vietnam rally, lending support to the program.

That same month, Kenney launched the Community Historical Recognition Program (CHRP), which established $13.5 million CAD in funding over five years for commemorative projects by ethno-cultural communities that had been subject to discriminatory Canadian immigration and wartime policies. By the project&#x27;s conclusion in 2013, all of the funds had been utilized, save for $500,000 that was earmarked for education about the Chinese head tax, and was left unspent when one Chinese community group failed to file the required paperwork. Because more than thirty other projects involving the Chinese-Canadian community had been funded through the CHRP, Kenney considered the project a success and declined to release the funding, citing the conclusion of the program. In 2013, Kenney said in his remarks on the end of the CHRP program that the government was &quot;committed to recognizing and educating Canadians about the experiences of those pioneers who overcame such heavy burdens. Their experiences mark an unfortunate period in our nation&#x27;s history. We must ensure that they are never forgotten.&quot;

==Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism (2008–2013)==

In 2008, Kenney became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s cabinet shuffle of October 30, while retaining responsibility for multiculturalism, which he had been given in 2007.

In April 2009, Kenney officially launched Asian Heritage Month to &quot;better understand the rich diversity the Asian Canadian community brings to Canada&quot;.

While speaking in Jerusalem in December 2009 about Canadian government funding of human rights organizations, Kenney said, &quot;We have de-funded organizations, most recently, like KAIROS who are taking a leadership role in the boycott [of Israel]. We&#x27;re receiving a lot of criticism for these decisions ... but we believe we have done these things for the right reasons, and we stand by these decisions.&quot; He later added in a letter to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that, &quot;While I disagree with the nature of KAIROS&#x27;s militant stance toward the Jewish homeland, that is not the reason their request for taxpayer funding was denied.&quot;

On June 26, 2010, Kenney announced changes to the Skilled Worker Immigration Program. For their applications to be processed, skilled worker applicants were thereafter required to either have an offer of arranged employment or be qualified in one of 29 eligible occupations out of the 520 described in the National Occupational Classification (NOC). A cap of 20,000 applications per year for the skilled workers class was also introduced. As of July 1, 2011, a maximum of 10,000 Federal Skilled Worker applications will be considered for processing in the subsequent 12 months. Within the 10,000 cap, a maximum of 500 federal skilled worker applications per eligible occupation will be considered for processing each year.

Kenney said that his reform of the immigration point system fixed problems with the previous immigration system. He also said the new system was more efficient in accepting migrants who could make the best contributions to the Canadian economy. The Canadian Experience Class Program was created to attract more international students who qualify as a graduate in the program, with an increased focus on youth, job skills, and a fluency in English or French. And at the same time, the immigration department imposed a new language requirement for the Federal Skilled Workers (FSW) program. Many of these changes were made to reduce the processing times for immigration applications. Vancouver immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said that these changes would guarantee &quot;no more backlogs.&quot; Kenney, however, decided to delete the backlog of 280,000 skilled worker applications, and a lawsuit by the deleted applicants failed to preserve the applications.

There was significant criticism of the institution of a Designated Country of Origin (DCO) list, which attributes countries as being unlikely to persecute. Therefore, refugee claimants coming from these countries—including Hungary, Mexico, and Israel—will undergo a different refugee claimant process than those from non-DCO countries. Furthermore, refugee claimants from countries on the DCO no longer receive emergency healthcare coverage.

In 2011, Kenney imposed a ban on niqab face veils for those taking the oath of citizenship. In his appeal on behalf of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration in &quot;Citizenship and Immigration v Ishaq&quot;, 2015 FCA 194, the three justices ruled in favour of Zunera Ishaq and her right to wear the niqab, confirming that the federal requirement was unlawful.

===Investigations into citizenship fraud===
On July 19, 2011, Kenney announced that the government intended to revoke the citizenship of 1,800 people it believes obtained their status through fraudulent means. The decision to revoke Canadian citizenship was rare, and a large-scale proposed crackdown had no precedent. At the time of his announcement, fewer than 70 citizenships had been revoked since the &quot;Citizenship Act, 1946&quot;.

An investigation into residence fraud continued to grow, and almost 11,000 cases were being reviewed in September 2012. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) revoked up to 3,100 citizens&#x27; citizenship, citing cheating or lies. Kenney said of the matter, &quot;Canadian citizenship is not for sale and we are taking action to strip citizenship and permanent residence status from people who do not play by rules.&quot; CIC worked in tandem with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and various overseas Canadian offices to prevent citizenship fraud. Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Vic Toews said that &quot;These efforts reinforce our government&#x27;s commitment to protecting the integrity of our immigration system.&quot; The CIC estimates that about 5,000 people with Canadian permanent resident status are outside of Canada, and implicated in residence fraud.

In January 2009, Kenney made public statements critical of U.S. soldiers seeking asylum in Canada who were facing punishment for their refusal to participate in the Iraq War. Unlike in the Vietnam era, Kenney said, the current asylum seekers were neither &quot;draft dodgers&quot; nor &quot;resisters&quot;, but rather &quot;people who volunteer to serve in the armed forces of a democratic country and simply change their mind to desert. And that&#x27;s fine, that&#x27;s the decision they have made, but they are not refugees.&quot; He also referred to the asylum seekers as &quot;bogus refugee claimants&quot;. These remarks were seen by some supporters of the asylum seekers as a form of interference in the asylum process. Kenney believed that Kimberly Rivera, an American soldier seeking refuge, was not a legitimate refugee. &quot;Military deserters from the United States are not genuine refugees under the internationally accepted meaning of the term,&quot; said Alexis Pavlich, the minister&#x27;s press secretary.

In 2012, Kenney took steps in 2012 to find and combat marriage fraud. His efforts were primarily focused on marriages in which one party was a Canadian citizen and the other, an immigrant, was using marriage to facilitate their entry into Canada, at which point they would leave their sponsor&#x27;s home and declare the marriage to be a lie. In response, Kenney instituted a five-year prohibition on spousal sponsorship for those who had already been sponsored by a spouse into Canada. He also implemented a &quot;conditional&quot; permanent residency status, to ensure that a spouse or partner had to live as husband and wife for a minimum of two years with their Canadian sponsor, or else they would have their status revoked.

===Admissibility decisions===
As part of Kenney&#x27;s &quot;Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act&quot;, introduced in June 2012, the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism would have the ability to deny entry to Canada based on &quot;public policy considerations.&quot; Kenney was quoted in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as saying that present immigration laws do not allow someone to be kept out if they are seeking to promote violence. The previous year, both the official opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) and Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly had asked Kenney to exercise negative discretion, but no such ability existed under Canadian law. During debate in the House of Commons, the NDP criticized this component of the bill, arguing it gives too much power to the minister.

Earlier, in March 2009, the CBSA prevented British politician George Galloway from entering Canada, where he had planned to give a series of speeches against the War in Afghanistan. The Office of the Immigration Minister stated that the Canada Border Services Agency deemed Galloway as inadmissible to Canada due to national security concerns. Galloway had openly given what he called &quot;financial support&quot; to Hamas, classified as a terrorist group in Canada.

Galloway pursued the matter in the Canadian court system, where it was revealed that Kenney&#x27;s office had emailed the CBSA on the matter. The Federal Court found that Kenney&#x27;s office had used &quot;a flawed and overreaching interpretation of the standards under Canadian law for labeling someone as engaging in terrorism or being a member of a terrorist organization.&quot; The presiding judge also determined that the CBSA had produced its assessment of Galloway on scant evidence after receiving instructions from Kenney&#x27;s staff, who attempted to bar Galloway because &quot;they disagreed with his political views&quot;.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; later pointed out that, while Kenney was quick to refuse Galloway entry into Canada, his department gave entry to controversial politician Geert Wilders, who compared Islam to fascism and campaigned to ban the Quran from the Netherlands. Wilders spoke in Toronto and Ottawa, generating further controversy.

===Citizenship policy changes===

A new law amending the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; came into effect on April 17, 2009. One of the changes instituted by the Government of Canada is the &quot;first generation limitation&quot;, considered a punitive measure by some against naturalized citizens who reside abroad for lengthy periods of time. Minister Kenney said the following in the House of Commons of Canada on June 10, 2010: &quot;That&#x27;s why we must protect the values of Canadian citizenship and must take steps against those who would cheapen it … We will strengthen the new limitation on the ability to acquire citizenship for the second generation born abroad.&quot;
The new rules would not confer a Canadian citizenship on children born outside of Canada to parents who were also born outside of Canada. Thus, for children to obtain Canadian citizenship if born abroad, they would have to have one parent who was born in Canada. Another effect of this law was to abolish automatic citizenship by birth for the children of parents in Canada in the service of a foreign government. Children born to foreign diplomats in Canada would only become Canadian if at least one parent was either a Canadian citizen or a Permanent Resident.

In 2010, Kenney introduced &quot;Discover Canada&quot;, a new citizenship guide for prospective citizens. &quot;The Canadian Press&quot; reported that Kenney blocked information about same-sex marriage from the Citizenship and Immigration study guide for immigrants applying for citizenship, although a sentence was included in a 2011 revision. The revised edition also added information about arts and culture, the War of 1812, and an admonition against importing &quot;violent, extreme or hateful prejudices&quot; to Canada.

Kenney took steps to restore full citizenship status to the &quot;Lost Canadians&quot;, Canadian nationals who had &quot;fallen through the cracks&quot;. Bill C-37 corrected the citizenship issues for 95% of &quot;Lost Canadians,&quot; and special grants were to be made to resolve the remaining 5%. Kenney says the Lost Canadians group should not be politicizing their plight, but they should be making a &quot;solid application and a strong case&quot;. Kenney&#x27;s predecessor, Diane Finley, had authorized a special grant of citizenship to Guy Valliere, although he died prior to receiving citizenship.

===Refugee reform===

On March 29, 2010, Kenney announced an overhaul of the Canadian refugee system. The reform package committed to allowing the resettlement of 2,500 more refugees living in United Nations refugee camps and urban slums. The plan also included expansion of the Government-Assisted Refugees Program to 500 places, while a further 2,000 resettlement places were added to the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program. In total, the new plan would lead to the resettlement of 14,500 UN-selected refugees from refugee camps and urban slums to Canada.

The &quot;Protecting Canada&#x27;s Immigration System Act&quot; was introduced on February 16, 2012, and received Royal Assent on June 28, 2012. It was broadly criticized as it &quot;gives Ministers broad, unfettered and unprecedented powers&quot; among other new powers. It was sponsored by Kenney.

There was controversy around changes to Interim Federal Health, the social assistance program for refugee claimants. Physicians and allied health professionals opposed these cuts through national protests in all major cities in Canada. Physicians opposing the cuts to refugee health care include Vincent Lam, who stated that Canada is a country known for its tolerance and diversity, but healthcare professionals are &quot;dismayed and ashamed at the cuts for healthcare for refugees.&quot;

Afghan interpreters who served alongside Canadian troops in southern Afghanistan, and who applied for Canadian visas on the basis of facing threats from insurgents, were denied visas. Kenney backed this decision.

Kenney promised that Canada would resettle more refugees from 2011 to 2012 than in previous years. Instead, there was a 26% drop in refugee resettlement in Canada during that period, hitting a 30-year low. Loly Rico, president of the Canadian Council for Refugees, criticized Kenney for not following through on his promise.

===Office of Religious Freedom===

Following through on a Conservative campaign promise from the 2011 Canadian federal election, Kenney initiated the creation of the Office of Religious Freedom, an agency of Foreign Affairs Canada, to monitor religious oppression domestically and promote religious freedom internationally. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed the office in a visit to Canada in 2013, saying, &quot;I think it shows leadership from Canada. And Canada, by the way, in many ways is a perfect place from which to promote this ideal because of the complexion of the country.&quot; The Liberal government which formed after the 2015 Canadian federal election closed the office in 2016.

==Minister of Employment and Social Development (2013–2015)==
As part of the July 2013 cabinet reorganization, Kenney was named Minister of Employment and Social Development. While in this position, he focused on expanding the review process for the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security disability appeals, which had become backlogged under the previous tribunal process.

In January 2014, Kenney reached an agreement with all provincial and territorial counterparts, except Quebec, to implement the Canada Job Grant, which aimed to train unemployed workers who did not qualify for unemployment insurance over a period of four years. The final agreement provided more flexibility for the provinces and territories than the initial 2013 proposal, which had been rejected by Kenney&#x27;s counterparts for its &quot;take it or leave it&quot; nature, which potentially forced the provinces and territories to forgo $300 million of the $500 million in federal funding provided to them by Labour Market Agreements if they did not accept the plan. $2.5 million were spent on advertising for the program during Stanley Cup playoffs spots in 2013 and 2014, even before the details of the federal-provincial agreements were finalized or approved, which prompted Advertising Standards Canada to label them as &quot;misleading.&quot;

==Minister of Defence (2015)==

After a February 2015 cabinet shuffle in which Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird left federal politics, with former Defence minister Rob Nicholson taking his place, Kenney was promoted to Minister of Defence. While serving in this position, Kenney took a hard-line approach to national security, saying that it was necessary for Canada to fight against Islamic State militants to prevent them from becoming a threat to the country.

In March 2015, Kenney claimed that Russian warships had confronted Royal Canadian Navy craft, and that Russian fighters had buzzed at low altitude while it participated in a NATO maritime task force off the coast of Ukraine as part of a mission against Russian intervention in the country. NATO officials later stated that Russian ships could be seen on the horizon, but never approached the fleet, and that all flyovers had been at high altitudes.

Later that month, Kenney defended the Canadian airstrike campaign against ISIS being extended into Syria, claiming that, among the coalition air forces, only Canada and the United States had aircraft capable of using precision guided munitions. In fact, Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had won praise from general Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, for their use of precision guided munitions. General Tom Lawson, then the Chief of Canada&#x27;s Defence Staff, issued a statement defending Kenney, but later retracted his statement and apologized, saying that its contents were incorrect. Sources within the Department of Defence say that Lawson had been pressured into releasing the inaccurate statement by Kenney&#x27;s office.

Also in March, Kenney faced criticism for tweeting photos purporting to be of ISIS enslaving young girls. One of the images was taken years before ISIS came into existence and appeared to be from an Ashura procession, while another turned out to be a picture staged by actors in London, England.

In April 2015, Kenney announced that troops from the Canadian Armed Forces would be sent to Ukraine as trainers for Ukrainian forces as part of Operation UNIFIER. The soldiers, who arrived in September 2015, were from 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (2 CMBG) and were stationed in at the Ukrainian Armed Forces International Peacekeeping and Security Centre near the Polish–Ukrainian border at Yavoriv.

In May 2015, after a report was published on sexual misconduct in the Canadian Forces, Kenney promised that an independent centre at arm&#x27;s length from the military would be formed to hear complaints of sexual misconduct in the military and provide support and resources for victims.

==Return to opposition and entry into provincial politics==
Although the Conservatives were defeated at the 2015 federal election, Kenney was reelected in Calgary Midnapore, essentially a reconfigured version of his old riding, where he was named to the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Kenney was long considered a likely candidate to succeed Stephen Harper as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, and had been mentioned as a prospective candidate and presumed frontrunner in the next leadership election to be held in 2017. His name was also mentioned as a prospective leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta (PC) who could potentially unite the rival Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties. On July 6, 2016, Kenney announced that he would be seeking the leadership of the Alberta PC Party, citing his desire to unite Alberta&#x27;s two major centre-right parties. The following day, he announced that he would resign his seat in the House of Commons within three months once the leadership campaign period officially opened, a decision that was severely criticized by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, which Kenney had previously lead, for misusing taxpayer dollars. He officially resigned September 23.

Kenney was elected leader of the PCs on March 18, 2017, with more than 75% of the delegate votes on the first ballot. He re-affirmed his pledge to unite the party with the rival Wildrose Party. Two months later, on May 18, the PC and Wildrose party announced a merger agreement that would be voted by on their respective memberships. The results, announced June 22, had 95% of Wildrose and PC members vote in favour of a merger. The new United Conservative Party was recognized as the Official Opposition by the Legislative Assembly of Alberta on July 25, 2017, and shortly thereafter registered with Elections Alberta. Nathan Cooper named interim leader while the party organized a leadership election. However, as Alberta law forbade political parties from transferring assets, the PC and Wildrose parties continued to exist on paper, and the UCP was formally a newly created party.

On October 28, 2017, the party&#x27;s inaugural leadership election was held. Kenney was elected as the first full-time leader of the party, defeating former Wildrose leader Brian Jean and lawyer Doug Schweitzer. The following day, MLA Dave Rodney announced his resignation of his seat of Calgary-Lougheed in order to create a vacancy for Kenney. Kenney was elected as MLA on December 14, and sworn in as Leader of the Opposition on January 29, 2018.

=== &quot;Kamikaze campaign&quot; scandal ===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Alberta Election Commissioner are investigating allegations that Jason Kenney and his team were involved in orchestrating Jeff Callaway&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the United Conservative Party in an attempt to harm Kenney&#x27;s biggest rival, Brian Jean. Documents obtained by &quot;The Star&quot; confirm that Kenney&#x27;s campaign controlled major aspects of Callaway&#x27;s campaign, including the providing of strategic plans, attack ads, speeches, and talking points intended to discredit Jean. These documents were handed over the election commissioner, according to Callaway&#x27;s former campaign manager Cameron Davies. Davies also said that Kenney had attended a meeting at Callaway&#x27;s house in July 2017, where the &quot;kamikaze campaign&quot; was discussed, and that Kenney had firsthand knowledge of this strategy.

A leaked document alleged that Jason Kenney&#x27;s team first approached Derek Fildebrandt in July 2017 about running a &quot;dark-horse&quot; campaign, but ultimately decided against working with him. Fildebrandt confirmed this account but stated that it was he who rejected the idea.

An emergency injunction was sought to halt the probe into the financing of Callaway&#x27;s UCP leadership campaign for the duration of the 2019 Alberta general election, but was denied by Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench Justice Anne Kirker, who ruled it was in the public interest for the investigation to continue.

CBC News and CTV News received documents indicating that fraudulent e-mail addresses attached to party memberships were used to cast ballots in the party&#x27;s leadership race in 2017, which Jason Kenney won. CBC News picked a sample of e-mail addresses based on suspicious domains, and determined that 60% of those were used to cast ballots in the leadership election.

Former UCP MLA Prab Gill sent a letter to the RCMP outlining allegations that the Kenney leadership campaign used fraudulent e-mail addresses to intercept PINs needed to vote in the leadership race, and that they were subsequently used by the Kenney campaign to vote for Kenney.

Many of the suspicious domains were traced to a network with ever-changing domains, and it is unclear who registered these domains. The majority of the fraudulent e-mail addresses were registered in the weeks preceding the leadership vote. CBC noted that it is not clear how widespread the voting fraud is outside of their selected sample of suspicious domains, and it is also possible that common e-mail providers such as Gmail or Hotmail were used with fraudulent addresses. A dozen individuals were contacted by CBC News to confirm whether or not they voted in the race, all of whom confirmed that they did not vote in the race and the e-mails on the voter&#x27;s list were not their true e-mails.

The RCMP went to question at least one family to speak with them regarding the allegations of voter fraud.

==Premier of Alberta (2019–2022)==
Under Kenney&#x27;s leadership, the United Conservative Party won a majority government in the 2019 Alberta general election, winning 63 seats and 54.88% of the popular vote in 2019 election. On April 30, 2019, Kenney was sworn in by Lieutenant Governor Lois Mitchell, becoming the 18th Premier of Alberta.

During the first session of the 30th Alberta Legislature, the Kenney government passed several notable of pieces of legislation, including the &quot;Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax,&quot; the &quot;Alberta Corporate Tax Amendment,&quot; and the &quot;Public Sector Wage Arbitration Deferral Act&quot;. The government also passed legislation allowing parties to merge, clearing the way for PC and Wildrose to legally and formally merge into the UCP, and hence dissolve. Premier Kenney established a one-year, $2.5 million Public Inquiry into Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns and a Calgary-based $30 million &#x27;war room&#x27; to &quot;fight misinformation related to oil and gas&quot;. They announced their first provincial budget on October 24, 2019, which fulfilled their &quot;promise of slight austerity&quot; with &quot;cuts to spending programs and the elimination of hundreds of bureaucracy jobs&quot;, according to &quot;The National Post&quot;. &quot;The Post&quot; said that these and the corporate tax cuts &quot;were the key planks of a four-year plan to bring the budget into balance.&quot; The goal is to reduce government spending by $4-billion over four years.

===Oil Sands lawsuit===
On February 2, 2022, five environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in Edmonton against Kenney for defamation. The lawsuit alleged that, in public statements and in social media posts, Kenney deliberately distorted the results of a public inquiry led by Calgary forensic accountant Steve Allan investigating the possibility that the groups accepted American money to spread misinformation about the environmental impacts of oil sands development in Alberta. They were represented in the filing by Paul Champ of Ottawa-based Champ &amp; Associates.

=== Leadership tensions and resignation ===
On March 8, 2021, CBC News reported that following discontent about the travel controversy and government policies around pandemic measures and coal mining, several UCP constituency associations had discussed holding a leadership review at an upcoming convention, putting Kenney&#x27;s leadership of the party to a vote. On March 13, the UCP announced a leadership review will be held at the party&#x27;s annual general meeting in 2022, expected to be held in October, six months ahead of the fixed election date for the next Alberta general election.

On April 7, 2021, 15 UCP MLAs, including former Minister of Municipal Affairs Tracy Allard and Speaker Nathan Cooper, signed a letter criticizing the Government&#x27;s public health orders. Two other MLAs added their names to the letter after it had been released publicly. UCP MLA Dan Williams also released a video criticizing the closure of GraceLife Church by Alberta Health Services. Kenney stated that Government MLAs were permitted to dissent over COVID-19 health restrictions but breaking health rules or encouraging others to do so would result in their expulsion from the Government Caucus. This was described as a &quot;revolt&quot; and an unprecedented level of opposition from within a government caucus. During a three-hour caucus meeting following the release of the letter, Kenney reportedly threatened to ask the lieutenant governor to dissolve the legislature and call a snap election if dissidents did not support the government.

On April 22, 2021, a letter calling for the resignation of Premier Kenney, started circulating within the UCP party&#x27;s leadership boards. The letter gained 90 signatures composed of board presidents and board members of UCP riding associations. The letter states that the boards believed that they did not believe Kenney had the moral authority or trustworthiness to lead this party into the next election or to continue to deliver on important conservative priorities and that for the sake of a strong and free Alberta and for the well-being of the conservative movement in this province, the boards ask that Kenney do the proper thing and resign. The petitioners will bring up the letter during an upcoming board meeting.

On May 13, 2021, MLA Todd Loewen stepped down from his role as UCP caucus chair and called on Jason Kenney to resign, citing &quot;persistent issues of dysfunction within the government&quot; and claiming that &quot;the Premier chooses not listen to caucus&quot;.

On September 22, 2021, MLA RJ Sigurdson presented a motion of no-confidence at a UCP caucus meeting, after the government introduced new public health restrictions, including a vaccine passport, following a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta. The motion was withdrawn after it was agreed that the UCP would hold a leadership review in Spring 2022, rather than October 2022 as previously scheduled.

On May 18, 2022, Jason Kenney narrowly won a confidence vote held by the UCP with 51.4% support from members of his party. He then announced on the same evening his intention to resign as premier of Alberta and leader of the UCP, citing the clearly divisive nature of his leadership and a need for party unity. He subsequently confirmed that he would not be candidate in the leadership election to succeed himself.

== Post-premiership ==
On November 29, 2022, Jason Kenney resigned as MLA for Calgary-Lougheed, with immediate effect. On February 1, 2023, Kenney announced that he had started a new job as senior advisor for the law firm, Bennett Jones.

His seat was retained by Eric Bouchard of the UCP in the May 2023 Alberta general election.

Jason Kenney was nominated to the board of ATCO on March 31, 2023.

== Political positions ==

Kenney has been a social conservative in his political career, voting in favor of abortion restrictions and against same-sex marriage.

=== Abortion ===
Kenney voted in favour of abortion restrictions and received an endorsement from the socially conservative lobbyist group Campaign Life Coalition. In 2012, Kenney was one of ten Cabinet ministers who voted in favour of a motion to study when life begins. In 2018, a bill to create &quot;no-protest zones&quot; around abortion clinics was introduced to the Alberta legislature, following similar legislation in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. As leader of the UCP, Kenney refused to debate the bill and led his caucus to walk out of the house 14 times over the course of two months when the bill was at issue.

=== LGBTQ issues ===
Kenney voted against same-sex marriage as an MP, saying, &quot;A majority of Canadians support the provision of benefits on grounds such as domestic partnership relationships, which are grounded on unions of economic dependency rather than relationships of a mere conjugal nature, and yet still two-thirds of Canadians, from every culture that exists in this country, from every corner of the globe who have come to this country to build a future for themselves and their families, recognize that marriage is, as the Supreme Court said the last time it spoke to this issue in the Egan case in 1995, &#x27;by nature a heterosexual institution&#x27;.&quot;

In 2016, Kenney supported the removal of &quot;traditional definition of marriage&quot; from the conservative party policy book.

Kenney was criticized by the provincial NDP, some LGBTQ activists, and some journalists for saying in a &quot;Postmedia&quot; interview that parents generally have a right to know if their child has joined a Gay-Straight Alliance, unless it would be contrary to the best interests of the child in the circumstances.

In November 2018, Kenney faced pressure to expel an outspoken member of the United Conservative Party who compared the gay pride flag to the flag of Nazi Germany. Although Kenney had previously directed the party to cancel the membership of another member, he said that the decision to expel members rested with the party&#x27;s board.

A two-decade-old audio recording surfaced in December 2018 of Kenney boasting about overturning a gay marriage law in 1989 in San Francisco. Kenney was referring to his role in organizing a petition to repeal the city ordinance that extended recognition rights of heterosexual couples to same-sex couples. This ordinance, originating during the 1980s AIDS epidemic, extended rights that were previously exclusive to heterosexual couples, such as hospital visitation, to same-sex couples. Kenney addressed the audio clip by stating that he regrets the comments he made and that, since then, his record shows he supports domestic partner arrangements and benefits for couples regardless of sexual orientation. The comments led to backlash from outside and within the United Conservative Party. One board member and campaign manager for the party resigned his positions and membership with the party, citing the audio recording of Kenney as his reason for departure.

=== Minority outreach ===
Kenney was widely recognized for his central role in reaching out to ethnic minority voters in 2011, leading to the Conservative Party&#x27;s successful election campaign, and the Conservative parliamentary majority that resulted. He publicly acknowledged that his ongoing strategy of promoting conservative values and policies in government so as to capture the support of ethnic communities was in the works beginning years prior to Stephen Harper first winning government in 2006. Kenney also suggested that Harper was one of the first people he consulted with on the ethnic outreach strategy, when the latter was still an opposition Canadian Alliance MP.

Kenney&#x27;s ethnic outreach strategy was also evident when, in early 2011, a letter using government stationery was sent to Conservative riding associations seeking assistance in raising $200,000 funding for an ad campaign aimed at bolstering support among ethnic communities in ridings that the Conservatives were targeting in the next election. News of this broke when a copy was believed to have been mistakenly sent to the office of opposition MP Linda Duncan instead of that of fellow Conservative MP John Duncan (no relation). This led to criticism over the letter&#x27;s labelling of certain groups and ridings as &quot;ethnic&quot; or &quot;very ethnic&quot;. Kenney publicly apologized for the mailing error, citing a staffer&#x27;s inexperience for the mistake.

As immigration minister, Kenney was largely credited with building bridges attracting ethnic communities to the Conservative Party, which was long dominated by the Liberal Party. In addition, he also handled the apology and financial compensation for the Chinese head tax and the official recognition of the Armenian and Ukrainian genocides. According to an observer, &quot;He acts as a conductor to correct historical wrongs, It might not seem important to the majority of the population, but for the concerned communities, it&#x27;s huge.&quot; According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the Chinese–Canadian community nicknamed Kenney the &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot; in reference to his efforts to garner ethnic votes on the basis of what some perceive as commonly held conservative values. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; characterized him as having a &quot;Bieber-like&quot; following in many communities. Kenney justified his efforts to gain ethnic support by stating, &quot;You observe how these new Canadians live their lives. They are the personification of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s aspirational class. They&#x27;re all about a massive work ethic.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kenney is bilingual, speaking French and English. He has never been married and has no children.

== Awards and recognition ==
Kenney received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012, and the Albertan version of the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal in 2022.

In 2004, Kenney was named one of Canada&#x27;s &quot;100 Leaders of the Future&quot; by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, &quot;one of Canada&#x27;s leading conservative activists&quot; by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and one of &quot;21 Canadians to watch in the 21st century&quot; by the &quot;Financial Post&quot;.

On May 13, 2009, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, in association with the Dominion Institute, &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot;, and presenting sponsor Enbridge, presented Kenney with the award for &quot;Best Overall MP&quot;.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; named Kenney the &quot;hardest working&quot; MP of 2011, citing overwhelming support from all political parties who recognized Kenney&#x27;s constant &quot;20-hour work days&quot; and &quot;permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow&quot;.

On November 4, 2012, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa.

In 2014, Kenney received the UN Watch Moral Courage Award for speaking out on behalf of those who had been victimized by international tyranny. At the ceremony in Geneva, representatives of the 14th Dalai Lama presented Kenney with a traditional Tibetan scarf. Also in 2014, Kenney was awarded the inaugural Benjamin Disraeli Prize by Policy Exchange, a centre-right UK think tank, in recognition of the successful outreach to Canada&#x27;s ethnic and cultural communities. The award was presented by British Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove.

In August 2016, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine awarded Jason Kenney with an Order of Merit, Third Class.

<text>The Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award (formerly the &quot;Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal&quot; or &quot;Wilder Award&quot;) is a prize awarded by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), to writers or illustrators of children&#x27;s books published in the United States who have, over a period of years, made substantial and lasting contributions to children&#x27;s literature. The bronze medal prize was originally named after its first winner, twentieth-century American author Laura Ingalls Wilder, before being renamed in 2018.

Originally, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal was awarded every five years, awarding six prizes between 1955 and 1980. From 1980 to 2001 it was awarded every three years, awarding seven prizes. From 2001 to 2015 it was awarded every two years. It is now awarded annually. The most recent author to receive the award was Pam Muñoz Ryan in 2024. 

==Criteria==
* The medal may be awarded to an author or illustrator including co-authors or co-illustrators, and persons who both write and illustrate. The person may be nominated posthumously.
* Some portion of the nominee&#x27;s active career in books for children must have occurred in the twenty-five years prior to nomination.
* Citizenship or residence of the potential nominee is not to be considered.
* The nominee&#x27;s work must be published in the United States but this does not mean that the first publication had to be in the United States. Books by the nominee that have been published in the United States are to be considered in the nomination process.
* Some of the books by the potential nominee must have been available to children for at least ten years.
* The books, by their nature or number, occupy an important place in literature for American children, and children have read the books, and the books continue to be requested and read by children.
* The committee is to direct its attention only to the part of the nominee&#x27;s total work that is books for children (up to and including age fourteen).

==Renaming==
In February 2018, the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), the division of ALA that administers the award, announced a taskforce which re-examined the naming of the award and included representation from the American Indian Library Association (AILA). The task force was convened because of criticism of Wilder&#x27;s depictions of Native and African Americans. A recommendation to rename the award was made on June 23, 2018. The ALSC board found Wilder&#x27;s body of work &quot;includes expressions of stereotypical attitudes inconsistent with ALSC&#x27;s core values of inclusiveness, integrity and respect, and responsiveness.&quot; The award&#x27;s name was officially changed to the &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award.&quot;

<text>Right whale dolphins are cetaceans belonging to the genus Lissodelphis. It contains the northern right whale dolphin (&quot;Lissodelphis borealis&quot;) and the southern right whale dolphin (&quot;Lissodelphis peronii&quot;). These cetaceans are predominantly black, white beneath, and some of the few without a dorsal fin or ridge. They are smaller members of the delphinid family, oceanic dolphins, and very slender. Despite scientists being long acquainted with the species (the Northern species was identified by Titian Peale in 1848 and the Southern by Bernard Germain de la Cépède in 1804), little is known about them in terms of life history and behaviour.

==Physical description==

Both species have slender bodies, small, pointed flippers and a small fluke. Conspicuously, neither species has a dorsal fin; nor do right whales and this may explain the dolphins&#x27; name. The northern right whale dolphin is the only dolphin in the Pacific with this property. Similarly, the Southern is the only finless dolphin in the southern hemisphere. The two species can be readily distinguished (apart from the geographical separation in their ranges) by the extent of the whiteness on the body. Both have white bellies; however, the area of white coloration on the Southern species covers much more of the body — including the flanks, flippers, beak and forehead.

Northern males are about long at sexual maturity. Females are . Both sexes become mature at about 10 years. New-born right whale dolphins are about half the length of their parents. The southern species is typically larger (up to ) and heavier (up to compared with the Northern&#x27;s maximum of ). The dolphins live for about 40 years.

==Intelligence==
Northern right whale dolphins have an encephalization quotient (a measure of intelligence) of 5.55, which is the highest for any living species except humans.

==Distribution==
The northern right whale dolphin is widely distributed in the temperate North Pacific in a band running from Kamchatka and mainland Japan in the west to British Columbia down to the Baja California Peninsula in the east. It is not known with certainty if they follow a migratory pattern. However, individuals have been observed close to the Californian shore following their main food source, squid, in winter and spring. Such sightings have not been recorded in summer. Otherwise these dolphins are pelagic. No global population estimates exist. There are an estimated 14,000 individuals close to the North American shoreline.

The southern right whale dolphin has a circumpolar distribution running from about 40° to 55°. They are sighted in the Tasman Sea in particular.

==Behaviour==

Both species are highly gregarious. They move in pods of several hundred individuals and sometimes congregate in groups of 3000. The groups may also contain dusky dolphins and pilot whales (in the south) and Pacific white-sided dolphins (in the north). These dolphins are some of the fastest swimmers (in excess of 40 km/h). They can by turns become very boisterous and breach and tail-slap or become very quiet and almost undetectable at sea. At high speed they can leap up to 7 metres across the ocean&#x27;s surface in a graceful bouncing motion.

The species will generally avoid boats, but bow-riding has been recorded on occasion.

A single and rare stranding has been recorded for the northern species. On 9 June 2018, a 5.5-foot female was found deceased on Manzanita Beach on the coast of Oregon. There has been one recorded instance of 77 southern right whale dolphins stranding on Chatham Island.

==Conservation==
The southern species is under pressure from Peruvian whaling operations. The northern species has never been commercially targeted. However, tens of thousands of the northern species were killed in the 1980s due to their becoming caught in oceanic drift gillnets introduced at that time. Gillnets were banned by the United Nations in 1993. Conservation campaigners work vigorously to try to ensure these bans are retained.

Attempts to keep right whale dolphins in aquaria have all ended in failure and death. In all cases but one, they have died within three weeks.

<text>The northern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) is a small, slender species of cetacean found in the cold and temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Lacking a dorsal fin, and appearing superficially porpoise-like, it is one of the two species of right whale dolphin.

==Description==
The northern right whale dolphin has a streamlined body with a sloping forehead, and a slimmer build than other delphinids. It lacks any fin or ridge on the smoothly curving back. Its body is nearly all-black with a white ventral marking, extending forward as a narrow band from the caudal peduncle to the throat region, where the patch widens. In females, this white band is wider in the genital area than in males. In southern right whale dolphins (&quot;Lissodelphis peronii&quot;), the white patch extends higher on the posterior flanks and head. Calves, which are born initially creamy-dark grey or brown, attain adult colouring by the age of one year.

The beak of northern right whale dolphins is short and well-defined, characterised by a straight mouthline. The flippers are small, curved, narrow and pointed. The tail flukes are triangular and, like the flippers, rather pointed.

Adults are long and weigh between . Females (2.3–2.6 m) are generally smaller than males (around 3 m). Otherwise the sexes appear similar.

Northern right whale dolphins have between 80 and 95 thin, sharp teeth, which are not externally visible, used for catching small fish and squid.

Northern right whale dolphins have been observed traveling in pods of up to 110 (eastern North Pacific) to 200 (western North Pacific) individuals; however, larger pods, containing as many as 3,000 dolphins, have been reported. A gregarious species, they often associate with Pacific white-sided dolphins (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obliquidens&quot;), but have also been observed with Baird&#x27;s beaked whales (&quot;Berardius bairdii&quot;), Dall’s porpoises (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli&quot;), humpback whales (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;), pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala macrorhynchus&quot;), Risso’s dolphins (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;) and sperm whales (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;), among others.

Data on growth and reproduction of right whale dolphins is limited. Examination of northern right whale dolphins caught in driftnets allowed for an estimation of the average age of sexual maturity; in males, it was estimated to be 9.9 and 10.1 years and, in females, 9.7 and 10.4 years. Average length at sexual maturity was estimated at 215.1 cm and 214.7 cm in males and 201.1 cm and 199.8 cm in females. The mass of a mature testis was between 117.4 g to 1300 g. Gestation period was 12.1 to 12.3 months and calving seemed to peak during summer (July and August). The minimum calving interval was two years. An asymptotic length of 265 cm and 210 cm was reached in males and females, respectively.

==Intelligence==
Northern right whale dolphins have an encephalization quotient (a measure of intelligence) of 5.55, which is the highest for any living species except humans.

==Geographic range and distribution==
Northern right whale dolphins are found in cold to temperate waters, , of the North Pacific Ocean. They typically inhabit offshore, oceanic regions between 34°N to 55°N and 145°W to 118°E. However, &quot;L. borealis&quot; has been reported as far south as 29° N, off Baja California (Mexico), during times of anomalously cold water temperatures. Off the US west coast, northern right whale dolphins have been seen primarily in shelf and slope waters.

Migration patterns of northern right whale dolphins are not well understood, but aerial surveys off the US coast suggest seasonal changes in density that may reflect seasonal movements. Overall, distributions appear to shift northward in summer and southward in winter. However, contradicting patterns have also been observed.

Northern right whale dolphins are encountered fairly often by responsible whale watching companies operating off Monterey.

==Behavior==

Northern right whale dolphins are fast swimmers. Their average swimming speed is around but they can reach speeds of up to . When travelling fast, a group looks as though they are bouncing along on the water, as they make low, graceful leaps together, sometimes travelling as far as 7 m in one leap. They can dive up to deep in search of squid and fish, especially lanternfish. Additionally, &quot;L. borealis&quot; also feeds on other prey items, such as Pacific hake, saury and mesopelagic fish.

Although northern right whale dolphins rarely approach boats, they sometimes engage in bow-riding behaviour. Furthermore, they are occasionally spotted doing acrobatics, such as breaching, belly-flopping, side slapping, and lobtailing.

Unlike most delphinidae, &quot;L. borealis&quot; vocalise without the use of whistles. Visual and audio surveys have confirmed that vocalisation primarily consists of clicks and burst–pulses. &quot;L. borealis&quot; have repetitive burst-pattern pulses that can be categorised and associated to different subgroups of &quot;L. borealis&quot;. These vocalisations may be used in the communication between individuals, in a similar way to signature whistles in other delphinid species. The evolutionary loss of whistling in &quot;L. borealis&quot; may have resulted from a number of factors, such as predator avoidance, school size or school species composition.

==Taxonomy==
The species &quot;Lissodelphis borealis&quot; was first described by Titian Peale in 1848. The genus &quot;Lissodelphis&quot; is placed within the Delphinidae, the oceanic dolphin family of cetaceans. The epithet of the genus was derived from Greek &quot;lisso&quot;, smooth, and &quot;delphis&quot;; the specific epithet, &quot;borealis&quot;, indicates the northern distribution. Together with the second species of &quot;Lissodelphis&quot;, &quot;Lissodelphis peronii&quot;, they are called right whale dolphins because similarly to the right whales (&quot;Eubalaena&quot;) these dolphins also lack a dorsal fin.

Based on the analysis of complete cytochrome b sequences, LeDuc et al. (1999) suggested placing the northern right whale dolphins (together with &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; spp. and &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; spp.) into the subfamily Lissodelphinae. However, the evolutionary relationships of Delphinidae, especially within and among the Lissodelphinae, have not been resolved unambiguously, yet. This is because the family Delphinidae contains a high number of different species, which radiated fairly rapidly.

Genetically, no statistically significant differences have been found between northern right whale dolphins from the US coast and other regions within the North Pacific.

==Population status==
It is estimated that a total of around 68,000 northern right whale dolphins inhabit the Pacific Ocean. Of those, around 26,000 (the geometric mean of their abundance estimates in US waters during 2008–2014) are placed into the California/ Oregon/ Washington stock for management purposes. Their minimum population estimate is around 18,600. Their abundances and distributions along the US coast do not only vary seasonally but also interanually, making the identification of population trends difficult.

==Threats==

In the 19th century, whalers occasionally took northern right whale dolphins. In the mid-20th century, the largest threat for &quot;L. borealis&quot; were drift nets used for large-scale squid fishing. The bycatches of &quot;L. borealis&quot; during these activities, which were mainly led by Japan, Taiwan and Korea, amounted to up to 24,000 per year in the 1980s. This is thought to have reduced the stock in this area by one- to three-quarters.

It is thought that in contrast to coastal areas, the offshore habitat of the northern right whale dolphin is generally less susceptible to human pollution. However, only very few studies have actually investigated the effect of pollution on &quot;L. borealis&quot;. A study estimating polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in cetaceans of the North Pacific, measured PCBs in one individual of northern right whale dolphins and found high levels of PCBs in its system.

Natural predators of &quot;Lissodelphis borealis&quot; are unknown, but may include the killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and large sharks. Stranding events are uncommon in this species.

Since northern right whale dolphins rely on sound for communication, feeding and orientation, anthropogenic underwater noise pollution, such as vessel or military noise production, disturbs them.

==Conservation status==

Although the current population trend is unknown, the conservation status according to the IUCN Redlist is Least Concern.

International trade in the species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as the dolphin is listed in CITES Appendix II. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has not yet regulated the taking of these odontocetes.

In Canada, the 1982 Cetacean Protection Regulations of the Fisheries Act of Canada prohibit hunting of &quot;L. borealis&quot; and other related species. The exception to this rule are aboriginal peoples, who are allowed to take whales for subsistence purposes. In the United States, all cetaceans are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as well as through the Packwood – Magnuson Amendment of the Fisheries and Conservation Act, and the Pelly Amendment of the Fisherman’s Protective Act.

One of the most effective conservation measures for &quot;L. borealis&quot; was the U.N. ban on the high-seas driftnet fisheries. The California/Oregon driftnet fishery has been required by law to use pingers (devices that deliver an acoustic warning into the water column) to help reduce the bycatch of other cetaceans, but bycatch reduction for &quot;L. borealis&quot; was not found to be statistically significant, perhaps due to low sample sizes.

<text>The southern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii) is a small and slender species of cetacean, found in cool waters of the Southern Hemisphere. It is one of two species of right whale dolphin (genus &quot;Lissodelphis&quot;). This genus is characterized by the lack of a dorsal fin. The other species, the northern right whale dolphin (&quot;Lissodelphis borealis&quot;), is found in deep oceans of the Northern Hemisphere and has a different pigmentation pattern than the southern right whale dolphin.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first published by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1804. The southern right whale dolphins together with the northern right whale dolphins are the only members of the genus &quot;Lissodelphis&quot;, which name is derived from the Greek, with &quot;lisso&quot; meaning smooth, and &quot;delphis&quot; meaning dolphin. Recent classifications have placed &quot;Lissodelphis&quot; within the Delphinidae, the oceanic dolphin family of cetaceans. The specific epithet &quot;peronii&quot; commemorates François Péron, a French naturalist who saw the species near Tasmania during an expedition in 1802. Although some doubts remain on the validity of these two species, most authors currently retain them as separate species.

Both species in the genus are referred to by the name &quot;right whale dolphin&quot;, a name derived from the right whales (&quot;Eubalaena&quot;) which also lack a dorsal fin. Other common names for the southern right whale dolphin include: whitebellied right whale dolphin, southern right whale porpoise, mealy-mouthed porpoise, (Spanish), (Spanish), (Japanese), (French), (Russian), (German), and (Dutch).

==Description==
Southern right whale dolphins can be easily distinguished from other cetacean species within their range as they are the only dolphins without dorsal fins in the Southern Hemisphere. They have streamlined and graceful bodies, a single blowhole and a short and defined beak, possessing between 39 and 50 teeth per row.

A sharp dividing line separates the black dorsal part from the white ventral part of the body, running from the tail stock forward, dipping down to the flipper insertion and sweeping back up, below the eyes, to cross the melon between the blowhole and snout crease. Younger individuals can be grey/brownish dorsally but develop adult coloration within the first year. The flippers of the southern right whale dolphins are small, recurved, predominantly white and located about one-quarter of the way back from the snout tip. Their flukes are small, have a white underside and dark grey upper side, with a notch in the middle and concave trailing edges.

Variability in the size of these black and white areas exists. More extensive anomalous pigmentation has been observed, with records of pure all-white individuals, as well as melanistic (all-black) individuals. In 1998, a potential hybrid of a southern right whale dolphin and a dusky dolphin (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obscurus&quot;) was observed and subsequently described in 2002. This animal showed intermediate morphological features between the two species.

Newborn calves measure around in length and weigh around , while adults range between and weight between on average. The maximum weight for southern right whale dolphins is 116 kg, with maximum lengths reaching in males and in females but few specimens have been examined and it is expected they grow larger. On average, males tend to grow slightly larger than females. Little is known of this species’ reproductive biology. Research suggests that males reach sexual maturity at lengths between and females between .

==Population status==
There are no current global abundance and mortality estimates of the species although it is considered a fairly common and abundant species along its range, particularly in Chile. The very low sighting rate is most likely caused by a lack of sampling effort and due to the difficulties of sighting the animals in their offshore habitat.

==Distribution==
Southern right whale dolphins have a circumpolar distribution across the Southern Hemisphere, generally occurring in cool temperate to Sub-Antarctic waters between 30°S and 65°S. The precise boundary of their range has not been estimated or closely studied but the southern limit of the species appears to be bounded by the Antarctic Convergence while the northern limit seems bounded by the Tropical Convergence although rare sightings beyond these limits have been recorded. Most sightings of the southern right whale dolphins occur in offshore and deep waters, with temperatures ranging between 1 and 20 °C. In regions where deep waters approach the coast and in upwelling areas, they have occasionally been observed near shore.

===South America===
The species is known to be abundant along the western coasts of South America, ranging from Cape Horn (55°58’S) to Arica (18°28’S), with the northernmost record at 12°30’S near Pucusana (Peru). Although the southern right whale dolphin is considered abundant, only few confirmed records of the species in the Eastern South Pacific exist.

Preliminary boat surveys and stranding and fishery records suggest that southern right whale dolphins may be one of the most common species of cetacean in northern Chile. The range extends until offshore north of 40°S and off the southern coast of Chile and it has been suggested that at least a part of this Chilean population migrates northbound in the austral winter and spring, when the coastal component of the cold Humboldt Current and cool coastal upwelling are strongest. An extension of the range to the North, associated to cold-water currents and food availability, has also been observed in Brazil, where a stranded individual was found in 1995 in an area where the warm Brazil Current meets the cold Malvinas Current.

In 2018, two groups were sighted in the western area of the Strait of Magellan in Chile. It was unclear through which route and why they entered the Magellan Strait but these were the first sightings of live southern right whales dolphins in this shallow area. A few reports of solitary stranded specimens in exterior channels south of 40°S and the Beagle Channel have also shown their occurrence inside shallow channel systems. It has been hypothesized they may enter these channels accidentally or because of poor health. In the past, a high number of stranded southern right whale dolphins were reported on beaches of north-central chile, most of which were discarded animals by-caught In fishing nets. An increase in strandings is possibly due to the developing swordfish gillnet fishery off northern Chile.

The waters of the Patagonian continental shelf of Argentina harbor a high diversity of cetaceans, including southern right whale dolphins. They are known to occur in cold waters off Santa Cruz Province, the Falkland Islands, as well as off Tierra del Fuego. Sightings in coastal areas are rare but exist in Mar del Plata and in Golfo Nuevo, where three southern right whale dolphins were observed once during the summer of 1992.

In Southern Africa, the range is associated with cold currents up the western and southern coasts, ranging northwards as far as about 23°S due to the cold counter clockwise Benguela Current. The species has been found to occur year-round in a localized area on the southwestern coast of Namibia, in Lüderitz, linked to the strong Lüderitz upwelling cell area and high productivity waters. These animals may occasionally extend their range into South African waters although more sampling effort is needed to support this. Just one confirmed sighting of the species exists from the South African coast, just south of the Orange River. Southern right whale dolphins have also been observed in waters around Marion Island.

===Australia===
The species has been observed in Australian waters since 1802, although only few actual records exist since then. They are found off southern continental Australia including sightings south and southwestward of Tasmania, in the Great Australian Bight and off south-western Australia. One pair was sighted on the 20th of October 1910 at 42°51S, 153°56E, approximately 460 km to the east of Australia, in the Tasman Sea. No localised areas where the species occurs year-round are known from the coast of Australia, although more survey effort could result in the identification of these areas, similar to the one off the west coast of Namibia.

Few stranded individuals have been documented in Australian waters. In December 2019, a dolphin washed up on a beach at Port Fairy, Victoria, with the deceased animal being assessed by state authorities, researchers and local Australian aboriginal elders. Another dolphin washed up in January 2020 and was photographed, but the dead animal washed back off the beach. The dual strandings were described as ‘very unusual’ by authorities.

===New Zealand===
One of the earliest records of this species in New Zealand waters was during the Terra Nova Expedition, when a pair was sighted approximately 145 km west-south-west of Nugget Point Lighthouse, South Island at 47°04&#x27;S, 171°33&#x27;E. Southern right whale dolphins have been observed at sea to the southeast of New Zealand and are largely found between the Subtropical Convergence and the subantarctic waters to the south of it, between surface temperatures of 9°-17 °C.

The first recorded photographs of the species globally, were from a stranding of three individuals in New Zealand in 1952, which were apparently rescued. Since then there have been a number of strandings around the country, including seven events between 1970 and 1981 and a mass stranding of 75 individuals occurred at the Chatham In 1988. More recently a stranding of a single animal occurred at Mahia Beach, North Island in April 2020 which was euthanised by the Department of Conservation. The northernmost record of a stranding in New Zealand was of a ~200 cm long male at Whananaki (35° 31’S, 174° 28’), Northland, in November 1979.

Southern right whale dolphins are occasionally observed off the coast of Kaikōura, on the eastern coast of South Island, typically in groups of 50-200, although larger groups of &gt;500 are also encountered. In 1967, research showed that the species could also be found off-shore from the Chatham, Bounty and Antipodes Islands (approximately 43-57°S, 168-158°E) between January and March.

==Behavior==
===Social===
Southern right whale dolphins are generally gregarious and have been documented in aggregations of more than 1000 individuals although small groups of one to 10 have also been reported. Mean group size estimates differ and range between 52 and 368 off northern Chile, however, they typically live in groups of 100-200 individuals. Pods of just a few animals have also been observed, often associated with other cetacean species. Mixed groups with Dusky dolphins (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obscurus&quot;) appear common in the southern Atlantic and have occasionally been reported in New-Zealand, off Southwest Africa and along the coast of southern Chile. They have been observed to intermix freely with pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala spp.&quot;) and in Chile, associations with common dolphins (&quot;Delphinus delphis&quot;) have been reported. Along their range they have also occasionally been sighted with hourglass dolphins (&quot;Lagenorhynchus cruciger&quot;), common bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) and fin whales (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;).

Four basic herd configuration types have been reported and conform to the types described for the northern right whale dolphin: (1) Densely packed schools, without identifiable subgroups; (2) herds of scattered subgroups of various sizes; (3) V-shaped herds; and (4) herds in ‘’chorus line’’ formation. Their movement is very graceful and they often move by leaping out of the water continuously. When they swim slowly, they expose only a small area of the head and back while surfacing to breath. When travelling at higher speeds they have been observed to either (1) swim just below the surface, surfacing briefly to breath and then submerge or (2) swim rapidly at the surface, performing low-angle leaps covering much surface distance. Breaching, belly-flopping, side-slapping, and lob-tailing (slapping the flukes on the water surface) have been witnessed. Some groups will avoid boats, whereas others approach and possibly bow-ride. Few direct speed measurements at sea exist but swimming speed has been reported to be .

===Foraging===
Southern right whale dolphins prey on an undetermined range of fish, but it has been suggested they prey primarily on mesopelagic fish and squid, and may dive to depths in excess of in search of food. However, little is known of their particular habits, and it is unknown whether they generally search for their food at these greater depths or near the surface. Based on stomach contents, epipelagic coastal food habits, mesopelagic or a combination of both were suggested for southern right whale dolphins. Geographical variability in prey species has been observed by comparing stomach contents of animals from central Chile and New Zealand.

The species itself is presumably occasionally predated upon by larger sharks and killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) however, other predators might exist. In 1983, an intact dolphin measuring was found in the stomach of a Patagonian toothfish (&quot;Dissostichus eleginoides&quot;) taken off central Chile, and in 1990, a foetus was discovered inside a sleeper shark (&quot;Somniosus&quot; cf. &quot;pacificus&quot;).

==Threats==
Overall, clear evidence of the impact of potential threats on the species are sparse. Southern right whale dolphins were taken by whaling operations of the 19th century, primarily for their meat. In the past they have been infrequently caught off the coasts of Peru and Chile, where their meat and blubber were used as food and crab bait. High levels of bycaught animals have been recorded in the swordfish (&quot;Xiphias gladius&quot;) driftnet fishery in northern Chile, which started in the early 1980s, and to a lesser extent, the species has also been incidentally caught in driftnets along the coast of Peru. 

Large numbers of southern right whale dolphins are sometimes taken by gillnetting and longline fishing in oceans off the southern coast of Australia. Off the west coast of southern Africa, no evidence exists of bycatch in gillnet fisheries, but there may be competition for forage resources with pelagic trawl fisheries due to the pelagic distribution of the species and their squid based diet. The direct and indirect impacts of global climate change on the southern right whale dolphin are largely unknown, but could have a cascading effect on the movement and feeding ecology. Seismic activity, for oil and gas, might also be a minor threat. No reported attempts to capture live southern right whale dolphins exist.

==Conservation status==
As of 2018, the Global IUCN Red List classifies the southern right whale dolphin as Least Concern (LC), due to their apparent wide distribution in pelagic waters of the sub-Antarctic and the lack of evidence of severe threats to the populations. However, the species remains extremely data-poor throughout its range so the assessment should be considered provisional until more knowledge is obtained.

The 2016 Regional Red List of Mammals of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland also classified the species as Least Concern while in Australia and Chile, based on the limited current knowledge on the species, southern right whale dolphins are classified as Data Deficient by the Action Plan for Australian Mammals and the Chilean Species National List respectively. Under the New Zealand Threat Classification System this species is listed locally as Data Deficient.

Southern right whale dolphins are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the species is subject to International Whaling Commission (IWC) regulations. In South-Africa, the species is protected by the Marine Living Resources Act (No. 18 of 1998). They are included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). Within the Australian Whale Sanctuary, all cetaceans, including the southern right whale dolphins are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). The Sanctuary includes all Commonwealth waters from the three nautical mile state waters limit out to the boundary of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles and further in some places). The species is also protected within the Indian Ocean Sanctuary and Southern Ocean Sanctuary.
Although the species is included in legislation, no specific conservation measures have been identified for this species as throughout its range, there is still a clear deficiency of data to build these measures upon.

<doc id="439355" wikidata="Q1423114" url="?curid=439355" title="Windows Management Instrumentation">
<text>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of extensions to the Windows Driver Model that provides an operating system interface through which instrumented components provide information and notification. WMI is Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM) standards from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).

WMI allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers, both locally and remotely. WMI comes preinstalled in Windows 2000 and later. It is available as a download for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, and Windows 98.

Also included with Windows was Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC), a CLI utility to interface with WMI. However, starting with Windows 10, version 21H1 and Windows Server 2022, WMIC is deprecated in favor of PowerShell.

==Purpose of WMI==
The purpose of WMI is to define a proprietary set of environment-independent specifications that enable sharing management information between management apps. WMI prescribes enterprise management standards and related technologies for Windows that work with existing management standards, such as Desktop Management Interface (DMI) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). WMI complements these other standards by providing a uniform model for accessing management data from any source.

==Development process==
Because WMI abstracts the manageable entities with Common Information Model (CIM) and a collection of providers, the development of a provider implies several steps. The major steps can be summarized as follows:
# Create the manageable entity model
## Define a model
## Implement the model
# Create the WMI provider
## Determine the provider type to implement
## Determine the hosting model of the provider
## Create the provider template with the ATL wizard
## Implement the code logic in the provider
## Register the provider with WMI and the system
# Test the provider
# Create consumer sample code.

==Providers==

Since the release of the first WMI implementation during the Windows NT 4.0 SP4 era (as an out-of-band download), Microsoft has consistently added WMI providers to Windows:
* On Windows NT 4.0, the WMI package shipped with 15 providers.
* Windows 2000 shipped with 29 WMI providers.
* Windows Server 2003 came with approximately 80 WMI providers.
* Windows Vista includes 13 new WMI providers, hence ships with approximately 100 providers.
* Windows Server 2008 includes more providers for IIS 7, PowerShell and virtualization.
* Windows 10 adds 47 providers for the Mobile Device Management (MDM) service.

Many customers have interpreted the growth in numbers of providers as a sign that Microsoft envisions WMI as the ubiquitous management layer of Windows.

Beyond the scripting needs, most leading management solutions, such as Microsoft Operations Mamager (MOM), System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), Active Directory Services (ADS), HP OpenView (HPOV), and the various offerings of BMC Software and CA, Inc. are WMI-enabled, i.e., capable of consuming and providing WMI information. This enables administrators who lack WMI coding skills to benefit from WMI.

==Features==
WMI offers many features out of the box. Here are the most important advantages:

* Automation interfaces: WMI comes with a set of automation interfaces ready to use. Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate or test a scripting model as it is already available from WMI.
* .NET management interfaces: The codice_1 namespace makes WMI classes available to all .NET apps and scripts written in C# or PowerShell. Beyond the WMI class design and the provider development, the Microsoft development and test teams are not required to create, validate and test new assemblies to support a new namespace in .NET as this support is already available from WMI.
* COM interfaces: Unmanged code in Microsoft Windows (e.g., apps written in C or C++ languages) can interact with the standard set of WMI interfaces for the Component Object Model (COM) to access WMI providers and their supported WMI classes. Developers of WMI providers can leverage the same COM interfaces in their projects to furnish said classes.
* Remoting capabilities over DCOM and SOAP: In addition to local management via COM, WMI supports remoting via Distributed COM (DCOM) and SOAP. The latter is available in Windows Server 2003 R2 and later, through the WS-Management initiative led by Microsoft, Intel, Sun Microsystems, and Dell. This initiative allows running any scripts remotely or to consume WMI data through interfaces that handle SOAP requests and responses. WS-Management can consume everything that a WMI provider generates, although embedded objects in WMI instances were not supported until Windows Vista. WS-Management later became an integral part of PowerShell. Unlike SOAP-based remoting, DCOM-based remoting requires a proxy DLL deployed on each client machine.
* Support for queries: WMI offers support for WQL queries. This means WMI can still filter the results of a provider that doesn&#x27;t implement filtering or queries.
* Event-handling capabilities: WMI can notify a subscriber of events of interest. WMI uses the WQL to submit event queries and define the type of events to be returned. Anyone writing a WMI provider can have the benefit of this functionality at no cost for their customers. It will be up to consumers to decide how they desire to consume the management information exposed by the WMI provider.
To speed up the process of writing a WMI provider, the WMI team developed the &quot;WMI ATL Wizard&quot; to generate the code template implementing a provider. The code generated is based on the WMI class model initially designed by the developer. The WMI provider developer will be able to interface the pre-defined COM or DCOM interfaces for the WMI provider with its set of native APIs retrieving the management information to expose.

WMI is based on an industry standard called Common Information Model (CIM) defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). The CIM class-based schema is defined by a consortium of manufacturers and software developers for the requirements of the industry. Any developer can write code that fits into this model. For instance, Intel develops WMI providers for its network adapters. HP leveraged existing WMI providers and developed custom WMI providers for its OpenView enterprise management solutions. IBM&#x27;s Tivoli management suite consumes WMI. Starting with Windows XP SP2, Microsoft leverages WMI to get status information from antivirus software and firewalls.

== Service ==
On the Windows NT family of operating systems, WMI runs as a Windows service called codice_2. On the Windows 9x family, WMI runs in the context of the codice_3 executable file. On both Windows 9x and Windows NT families, codice_3 is available as a command-line utility for servicing the WMI repository.

==WMI tools==
Microsoft provides the following WMI tools for developers and IT pros:
* MOF compiler (codice_5): The Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler parses a file containing MOF statements and adds the classes and objects defined in the file to the CIM repository. The MOF format is a specific syntax to define CIM class representation in an ASCII file. MOF&#x27;s role for CIM is comparable to MIB&#x27;s role for SNMP. codice_5 is included in every WMI installation. Every definition existing in the CIM repository is initially defined in an MOF file. MOF files are located in codice_7. During the WMI setup, they are loaded in the CIM repository.
* WMI Administrative Tools: This suite of tool consists of WMI CIM Studio, WMI Object Browser, WMI Event Registration, and WMI Event Viewer. The most important tool for a WMI provider developer is WMI CIM Studio as it helps in the initial WMI class creation in the CIM repository. It uses a web interface to display information and relies on a collection of ActiveX components installed on the system when it runs for the first time. WMI CIM Studio can:
** Connect to a chosen system and browse the CIM repository in any namespace available.
** Search for classes by their name, by their descriptions or by property names.
** Review the properties, methods, and associations related to a given class.
** See the instances available for a given class of the examined system.
** Perform Queries in the WQL language.
** Generate an MOF file based on selected classes.
** Compile an MOF file to load it in the CIM repository.
* codice_8 is a WMI tester tool delivered with WMI. This tool allows an administrator or a developer to perform most of the tasks from a graphical interface that WMI provides at the API level. Although available under all Windows NT-based operating systems, this tool is not officially supported by Microsoft. WBEMTest provides the ability to:
** Enumerate, open, create, and delete classes.
** Enumerate, open, create, and delete instances of classes.
** Select a namespace.
** Perform data and event queries.
** Execute methods associated to classes or instances.
** Execute every WMI operation asynchronously, synchronously or semi-asynchronously.

* WMI command line tool (WMIC) is a scripting and automation utility that allows information retrivial and system administration via WMI, using some simple keywords (aliases). WMIC.exe is available on all Windows versions since Windows XP. Starting with Windows 10, version 21H1 and Windows Server 2022, WMIC is deprecated in favor of PowerShell. In Windows 11, version 24H2, WMIC is not installed by default. A Linux port of WMIC, codice_9, is written in Python and is based on Samba4.
* WBEMDump.exe: This command-lie tool is a component of the Platform SDK and comes a corresponding Visual C++ project. The tool can show the CIM repository classes, instances, or both. It is possible to retrieve the same information WMIC retrieves. codice_10 requires more specific knowledge about WMI, as it doesn&#x27;t abstract WMI as WMIC. It is also possible to execute methods exposed by classes or instances. Even if it is not a standard WMI tool delivered with the system installation, this tool can be quite useful for exploring the CIM repository and WMI features.
* WMIDiag.vbs (discontinued): The WMI Diagnosis Tool is a VBScript for testing and validating WMI on Windows 2000 and later. This script was downloadable from Microsoft until August 2020. The download includes pretty thorough documentation and the tool supports numerous switches. When run, it will generate up to four text files which: list the steps taken (the LOG file), an overview of the results (REPORT file), a statistics file (in comma separated values format), and optionally a file listing of the providers registered on the machine (PROVIDERS, also in comma separated values format). The report file that is generated includes a list of the issues identified and potential ways to fix them.

==Wireless networking example==
In the .NET Framework, the ManagementClass class represents a Common Information Model (CIM) management class. A WMI class can be a codice_11 in the case of a disk drive, or a codice_12, such as a running program like codice_13.

This example shows how codice_14 WMI class is used to find the SSID of the Wi-Fi network that the system is currently connected to in the language C#:

ManagementClass mc = new ManagementClass(&quot;root\\WMI&quot;, &quot;MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier&quot;, null);
ManagementObjectCollection moc = mc.GetInstances();

foreach (ManagementObject mo in moc)
 string wlanCard = (string)mo[&quot;InstanceName&quot;];
 bool active;
 if (!bool.TryParse((string)mo[&quot;Active&quot;], out active))
 active = false;
 byte[] ssid = (byte[])mo[&quot;Ndis80211SsId&quot;];


The codice_14 WMI class is only supported on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

==WMI driver extensions==
The WMI extensions to WDM provide kernel-level instrumentation such as publishing information, configuring device settings, supplying event notification from device drivers, and allowing administrators to set data security through a WMI provider known as the &quot;WDM provider&quot;. The extensions are part of the WDM architecture; however, they have broad utility and can be used with other types of drivers as well (such as SCSI and NDIS).

The WMI Driver Extensions service monitors all drivers and event trace providers that are configured to publish WMI or event trace information. Instrumented hardware data is provided by way of drivers instrumented for WMI extensions for WDM. WMI extensions for WDM offer a set of Windows device driver interfaces for instrumenting data within the driver models native to Windows, so OEMs and IHVs can easily extend the instrumented data set and add value to a hardware/software solution. The WMI Driver Extensions, however, are not supported by Windows Vista and later operating systems.

<text>HMS &quot;Athene&quot; was a Royal Navy aircraft transport. She was a merchant conversion, requisitioned by the Navy during the Second World War and returned after its end. She is the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named after the Greek goddess Athene. She was broken up in 1963.

==Career==
She was originally built as the &quot;Clan Brodie&quot;, for the Clan Line at the yards of the Greenock &amp; Grangemouth Dockyard Company Greenock, Scotland. The Navy requisitioned her and she was launched on 1 October 1940 as the aircraft transport HMS &quot;Athene&quot;.

&quot;Athene&quot; received a single catapult, and operated as a seaplane carrier in the South Atlantic over 1942/43.

In June 1943 &quot;Athene&quot; departed from San Diego bound for Pearl Harbor under escort by the Barnegat Class seaplane tender USS Chincoteague (AVP-24)

In 1946 the Navy returned her to Clan Line. She was reconverted for merchant service and served until 1963, when she was sold for scrap. She arrived in Hong Kong for breaking up on 19 July 1963.

<text>HMS &quot;Australia&quot; was one of seven armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1880s. She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1889 and remained there until 1893 when she returned home. The ship was assigned to the Coast Guard Squadron for the next decade before she was placed in reserve in 1903. &quot;Australia&quot; was sold for scrap in 1905.

==Design and description==
&quot;Australia&quot; had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . Designed to displace , all of the &quot;Orlando&quot;-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately .

The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by four boilers with forced draught. During her sea trials, &quot;Australia&quot; reached . The ship carried a maximum of of coal which was designed to give her a range of at a speed of . The ship&#x27;s complement was 484 officers and ratings.

&quot;Australia&quot;″s main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk V guns, one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on pivot mounts. Her secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, most of which were mounted on the main deck in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457 mm) torpedo tubes: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.

The ship was protected by a waterline compound armour belt thick. It covered the middle of the ship and was high. Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was below the waterline when she was fully loaded. The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse bulkheads . The lower deck was thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Australia&quot;, named for the Australian continent, was laid down on 21 April 1885 by Robert Napier and Sons at their shipyard in Govan, Glasgow.

The ship was launched on 25 November 1886, and completed on 11 December 1888. Shortly after commissioning, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and remained there until 1893 when she participated in the Columbian Review held in New York City that year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus&#x27; discovery of the New World.

Upon her return home, &quot;Australia&quot; became the coast guard ship for Southampton Water for the next decade. Captain Charles Henry Adair was briefly in command from November 1899 to January 1900, when Captain George Neville was appointed in command on 20 January 1900. She escorted the royal yacht when Queen Victoria visited Ireland in April 1900, and in September the following year she visited Germany and Denmark when she escorted the royal yacht carrying King Edward VII from Hamburg to Elsinore.

She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Captain Charles Home Cochran was appointed in command on 24 November 1902, but the ship was placed in reserve at Chatham Dockyard in early 1903, before being sold for scrap on 4 April 1905.

<doc id="439365" wikidata="Q44205" url="?curid=439365" title="Helmuth von Moltke the Elder">
<text>Helmuth Karl Bernhard Graf von Moltke (; 26 October 180024 April 1891) was a Prussian field marshal. The chief of staff of the Prussian Army for thirty years, he is regarded as the creator of a new, more modern method of directing armies in the field and one of the finest military minds of his generation. He commanded troops in Europe and the Middle East, in the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War, and Franco-Prussian War. He is described as embodying &quot;Prussian military organization and tactical genius&quot;. He was fascinated with railways and pioneered their military use. He is often referred to as Moltke the Elder to distinguish him from his nephew Helmuth von Moltke the Younger (Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke), who commanded the German army at the outbreak of the First World War. He is notably the earliest-born human whose recorded voice is preserved, being born in the last year of the 18th century (1800). He made four recordings; two that were recorded in October 1889 are preserved to this day.

==Early life==
Moltke was born in Parchim, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, son of &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Friedrich Philipp Victor von Moltke (1768–1845), a German in Danish service. In 1805, his father settled in Holstein (then a possession of the King of Denmark). But the next year he was left impoverished when during the War of the Fourth Coalition of 1806–1807 French troops burned his country house and plundered his townhouse in Lübeck, where his wife and children were. At nine the younger Moltke was sent as a boarder to Hohenfelde in Holstein, and at age twelve went to the Royal Danish Military Academy at Copenhagen, being destined for the Danish army and court. In 1818 he became a page to King Frederick VI of Denmark and a second lieutenant in the Oldenburg Infantry Regiment. At twenty-one, Moltke decided to leave Denmark and enter the Prussian army, despite the loss of seniority. In 1822 he became a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Regiment stationed at Frankfurt an der Oder. At twenty-three he was allowed to enter the general war school (later called the Prussian Military Academy), where he studied the full three years, graduating in 1826.

== Military career ==
=== Early career ===
====As a young officer====
For a year Moltke had charge of a cadet school at Frankfurt an der Oder, then he was for three years employed on the military survey in Silesia and Posen. In 1832 he was seconded for service on the general staff at Berlin, to which he was transferred in 1833 on promotion to first lieutenant. He was at this time regarded as a brilliant officer by his superiors, including Prince William, then a lieutenant-general.

Moltke was well received at court and in the best society of Berlin. His tastes inclined him to literature, to historical study, and to travel. In 1827 he published a short romance, &quot;The Two Friends&quot;. In 1831 he wrote an essay entitled &quot;Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, from their Separation under Philip II to their Reunion under William I&quot;. A year later he wrote &quot;An Account of the Internal Circumstances and Social Conditions of Poland&quot;, a study based both on reading and on personal observation of Polish life and character.

He was fluent in English and a talented writer in German; in 1832 he was contracted to translate Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; into German, for which he was to receive 75 marks, his object being to earn the money to buy a horse. In eighteen months he had finished nine volumes out of twelve but the publisher failed to produce the book and Moltke never received more than 25 marks.

====Service with the Ottoman Empire====

In 1835, on his promotion to captain, Moltke obtained six months&#x27; leave to travel in southeast Europe. After a short stay in Constantinople, he was asked by the Sultan Mahmud II to help modernize the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s army and with permission from Berlin he accepted the offer. He remained for two years at Constantinople, learned Turkish, and surveyed the city of Constantinople, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. He travelled through Wallachia, Bulgaria and Rumelia, making many other journeys on both sides of the Straits.
In 1838, Moltke was sent as an adviser to the Ottoman general commanding the troops in Anatolia, who was to carry on the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1839–1841) against Muhammad Ali of Egypt. During the summer Moltke made extensive reconnaissances and surveys, riding several thousand miles in the course of his journey. He navigated the rapids of the Euphrates and visited and mapped many parts of the Ottoman Empire. In 1839 the army moved south to fight the Egyptians but upon their approach, the general refused to listen to Moltke&#x27;s advice. Moltke resigned his post of staff officer and took charge of the artillery. In the Battle of Nezib on 24 June 1839, the Ottoman Army was beaten, but Moltke&#x27;s actions were well-regarded.

Thus on 7 November 1839, he received the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; from Prussia. With great difficulty, Moltke made his way back to the Black Sea, and thence to Constantinople. His patron, Sultan Mahmud II, was dead, so he returned to Berlin, broken in health, in December 1839.

Once home Moltke published some of the letters he had written as &quot;Letters on Conditions and Events in Turkey in the Years 1835 to 1839&quot;. This book was well received at the time. Early the next year he married a young English woman, Maria Bertha Helena Burt, whose father John Heyliger Burt had married Moltke&#x27;s sister Augusta. It was a happy union, though there were no children.
In 1840, Moltke had been appointed to the staff of the IV Corps, which was under the command of Prince Charles of Prussia, stationed at Berlin. He published his maps of Constantinople, and, jointly with other German travellers, a new map of Asia Minor and a memoir on the geography of that region.

He became interested in railroads and he was one of the first directors of the Hamburg–Berlin railway. Moltke also paid close attention to the tactical and operational implications of rifled weapons. In 1843 he published the article &quot;What Considerations should determine the Choice of the Course of Railways?&quot; Even before Germany began constructing its first railroad he had noticed their military potential and he urged the general staff to support railway construction for mobilisation and supply. He spent all of his savings on investments into Prussian railroad ventures which made him a considerable amount of wealth. During his later years in the great general staff he would add a Railways Department, which did not have the task of planning military campaigns like many of the other departments, but managed the military use of railways.

In 1845, Moltke published &quot;The Russo-Turkish Campaign in Europe, 1828–1829&quot;, which was well received in military circles. In the same year, he served in Rome as personal adjutant to Prince Henry of Prussia, which allowed him to create another map of the &quot;Eternal City&quot; (published in 1852). In 1848, after a brief return to the General Staff in Berlin, he became Chief of the Staff of the 4th Corps, of which the headquarters was then at Magdeburg. There he remained for seven years, during which he rose to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel. In 1855, Moltke served as a personal aide and mentor to Prince Frederick William (later Emperor Frederick III) as &quot;Generalmajor&quot;. He accompanied the prince to England for the prince&#x27;s marriage, as well as to Paris and Saint Petersburg for the coronation of Alexander II of Russia.

=== In Prussia ===
====Chief of the Prussian General Staff and Great General staff====

On the suggestion of Edwin von Manteuffel, the new king appointed Moltke as Chief of the Prussian General Staff on 29 October 1857. He would hold the position for the next 30 years (though after the establishment of the German Empire, the Prussian General Staff&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Great General Staff&quot;, as it would have direction of the various German armies during war.) As soon as he gained the position he went to work making changes to the strategic and tactical methods of the Prussian army: changes in armament and means of communication; changes in the training of staff officers (such as instituting staff rides); and changes in the method for the mobilization of the army. He also instituted a formal study of European politics in connection with the plans for campaigns which might become necessary. In short, he rapidly put into place the features of a modern general staff. By 1860, his reforms were completed.

In 1859, the Austro-Sardinian War in Italy caused the mobilization of the Prussian army, though it did not fight. After the mobilization, the army was reorganized and its strength was nearly doubled. The reorganization was the work not of Moltke but of the Prince Regent, William, and the Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. Moltke watched the Italian campaign closely and wrote a history of it in 1862. In an act that was yet another first in military affairs, this history was attributed on the title page to the historical division of the Prussian staff.

In 1860, &quot;[Moltke] added a Railway Section to the military council. A contemporary would write that von Moltke never made an important decision without consulting the German railway timetables.&quot; Moltke had been following developments relating to the railroad ever since his return from Egypt, at which time he wrote that: “Every new railway development is a military benefit, and for national defence, it is far more profitable to spend a few million on completing our railways than on new fortresses.”

In December 1862, Moltke was asked for an opinion on the military aspect of the quarrel with Denmark. He thought the difficulty would be to bring the war to an end, as the Danish army would, if possible, retire to the islands, where, as the Danes had the command of the sea, it could not be attacked. He sketched a plan for turning the flank of the Danish army before the attack upon its position in front of Schleswig. He suggested that by this means its retreat might be cut off.

====War with Denmark====

When the Second Schleswig War began in February 1864, Moltke was not sent with the Prussian forces but kept at Berlin. His war plan was mismanaged, and the Danish army escaped to the fortresses of Dybbøl and Fredericia, each of which commanded a retreat across a strait to an island. Dybbøl and Fredericia were besieged, Dybbøl taken by storm, and Fredericia abandoned by the Danes without assault – but the war showed no signs of ending. The Danish army was safe on the islands of Als and Funen.

On 30 April 1864, Moltke was sent to be chief of the staff for the allied (German) forces. He and Friedrich Graf von Wrangel planned landing on Als or Funen. On June 29, battalions (part of Herwarth von Bittenfeld&#x27;s army corps) crossed to Als in boats, landed while under fire from the Danish batteries, and quickly seized the whole island as far as the Kekenis peninsula. Days later, Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein&#x27;s corps crossed the Limfjord and occupied the remaining parts of Jutland while the Austrians seized the various islands. The Danish government, dejected by the course of the war, ended the war in defeat by signing the Treaty of Vienna.

=====Moltke&#x27;s theory of war=====
In contrast to Antoine-Henri Jomini, who expounded a system of rules, Moltke was a disciple of Carl von Clausewitz and regarded strategy as a practical art of adapting means to ends. He had developed the methods of Napoleon in accordance with altered conditions of his age, was the first to realize the great defensive power of modern firearms, and realized that an enveloping attack had become more formidable than an attempt to pierce an enemy&#x27;s front.

He developed the idea of Clausewitz and said &quot;The purpose of war is to carry out the policy of the government with arms&quot;. He emphasized the autonomy of war. This brought conflicts with Otto von Bismarck. One of Moltke&#x27;s characteristic strategies, seen in all his plans for war with Russia and France, was what has been called the offensive–defensive strategy, manoeuvring his army to cut the lines of communication of the enemy force and then dig in and defeat the enemy force trying to re-establish its lines of communication in a defensive action. Moltke had pondered the tactics of Napoleon at the Battle of Bautzen, when the emperor brought up Ney&#x27;s corps, coming from a great distance, against the flank of the allies, rather than to unite it with his own force before the battle; he had also drawn this conclusion from the combined action of the allies at the Battle of Waterloo. Moltke realized that the increase in firepower reduced the risk a defender ran in splitting his forces, while the increase in the size of armies made outflanking manoeuvres more practical.

Moltke had worked out the conditions of the march and supply of an army. Only one army corps could be moved along one road in one day; to put two or three corps on the same road meant that the rear corps could not be made use of in a battle at the front. Several corps stationed close together in a small area could not be fed for more than a day or two. He believed that the essence of strategy lay in arrangements for the separation of the corps for marching and their concentration in time for battle. To make a large army manageable, it must be broken up into separate armies or groups of corps, each group under a commander authorized to regulate its movements and actions subject to the instructions of the commander-in-chief regarding the direction and purpose of its operations.

Moltke also realized that the expansion in the size of armies since the 1820s made it impossible to exercise detailed control over the entire force (as Napoleon or Wellington had done in battle). Subordinates would have to use initiative and independent judgment for the forces to be effective in battle. Campaign and battle plans should encourage and take advantage of the decentralization that would be necessary in any case. In this new concept, commanders of distant detachments were required to exercise initiative in their decision-making and Moltke emphasized the benefits of developing officers who could do this within the limits of the senior commander&#x27;s intent. He accomplished this by means of Mission-type tactics (directives stating his intentions) rather than detailed orders and he was willing to accept deviations from a directive provided that it was within the general framework of the mission. Moltke held this view firmly and it later became a fundamental of all German military theory, especially for the field manual .

Moltke&#x27;s thesis was that military strategy had to be understood as a system of options since it was possible to plan only the beginning of a military operation. As a result, he considered the main task of military leaders to consist in the extensive preparation of all possible outcomes. His thesis can be summed up by two statements, one famous and one less so, translated into English as &quot;No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy&#x27;s main strength&quot; (or &quot;no plan survives contact with the enemy&quot;) and &quot;Strategy is a system of expedients&quot;. Right before the Austro-Prussian War, Moltke was promoted to General of the Infantry.

====Austro-Prussian War====

Moltke planned and led the military operations during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In the strategy for the war, the main points are as follows. First Moltke demonstrated a concentration of effort. There were two enemy groups opposing the Prussians, the Austro-Saxon armies, 270,000 and their allied North and South German armies, some 120,000 strong. The Prussian forces were smaller by some 60,000 but Moltke was determined to be superior at the decisive point. Moltke divided the Prussian Army into three field armies: the First Army, the Second Army, and the Army of the Elbe. The First Army consisted of three army corps, a cavalry corps of six brigades and 300 guns, gathering near Görlitz (Prince Friedrich Karl). The Second Army consisted of four army corps, a cavalry division and 336 guns, near Neisse (Crown Prince Frederick William). The Army of the Elbe consisted of three divisions, two cavalry brigades and 144 guns in the cantonments around Torgau (General Karl von Bittenfeld). Besides the three field armies, three more divisions were stationed at Altona (General Edwin von Manteuffel), one at Minden (General Eduard von Falckenstein) and one at Wetzlar (General Gustav von Beyer). The three field armies, placed to attack Austria, consisted of some 278,000 men, leaving just 48,000 men remaining to defend against Austria&#x27;s German allies. Those 48,000, led by Falckenstein, managed to capture the Hanoverian Army in less than two weeks and then to attack and drive away the south German forces.

In dealing with the Austrian and Saxon armies, the difficulty was to have the Prussian army ready first. This was not easy, as the king would not mobilize until after the Austrians. Moltke&#x27;s railway knowledge helped him to save time. Five railway lines led from the various Prussian provinces to a series of points on the southern frontier. By employing all these railways at once, Moltke had all his army corps moved simultaneously from their peacetime garrisons to the frontier.

After marching into Saxony, the Saxon army retreated into Bohemia. Moltke had two Prussian armies about apart. The problem was how to bring them together to catch the Austrian army between them like the French at Waterloo between Wellington and Blücher. He determined to bring his two armies together by directing each of them to advance towards Gitschin. On June 22, 1866, Moltke told the two princes that Gitschin was the desirable point for the juncture of the two armies. He foresaw that the march of the Crown Prince would probably bring him into collision with a portion of the Austrian army. Prince Friedrich Karl sent the 3rd Division to Gitschin; but the Crown Prince had 100,000 men, and it was not likely that the Austrians could have a stronger force. When Friedrich Karl commanded further attacks, straining his own supply lines, Moltke inferred that the prince was trying to take Prague by himself.
The Austrians, under Ludwig von Benedek, marched faster than Moltke expected, and might have opposed Prince Frederick Charles (the Red Prince) with four or five corps; but Benedek&#x27;s attention was centred on Crown Prince Frederick William, and his four corps, not under a common command, were beaten in detail. On 1 July Benedek collected his shaken forces into a defensive position in front of Königgrätz. Moltke&#x27;s two armies were now within a short march of one another and of the enemy. On 3 July they were brought into action, the first army against the Austrian forces and the second against the Austrian right flank. The Austrian army was completely defeated and the campaign and war were won.

Moltke was not quite satisfied with the Battle of Königgrätz. He tried to have the Prussian Army of the Elbe brought up above Königgrätz, so as to prevent the Austrian retreat, but its commanding officer failed to get there in time. He also tried to prevent the Prussian First Army from pushing its attack too hard, hoping in that way to keep the Austrians in their position until their retreat should be cut off by the Crown Prince&#x27;s army, but this also did not happen. During the negotiations, Otto von Bismarck opposed the king&#x27;s wish to annex the Kingdom of Saxony and other territory beyond what was actually taken; he feared the active intervention of France. Moltke, however, was confident of beating both the French and Austrians if the French should intervene, and he submitted to Bismarck his plans in case a war against both France and Austria proved necessary. After the peace, the Prussian government voted Moltke the sum of 30,000 marks (equivalent to approximately 225,000 US$ in 2016), with which he bought the estate of Creisau (present-day Krzyżowa), near Schweidnitz (present-day Świdnica) in the Province of Silesia.

In 1867, &quot;The Campaign of 1866 in Germany&quot; was published. This history was produced under Moltke&#x27;s supervision and was regarded as quite accurate at the time. In the same year Moltke became a member of Reichstag as a member of the Conservative Party. He frequently spoke on military issues. On 24 December 1868 Moltke&#x27;s wife died at Berlin. Her remains were buried in a small chapel erected by Moltke as a mausoleum in the park at Creisau.

After the war, Bismarck assessed him that he was a reliable soldier.

====Franco-Prussian War====


Moltke again planned and led the Prussian armies in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), which paved the way for the creation of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871. The aspects of such a war had occupied Moltke&#x27;s attention almost continuously since 1857; documents published after his death show the many times he considered such a war and the best arrangement of the Prussian or German forces for such a campaign. The arrangements for the transport of the army by railway were revised annually to suit the changes in his plans brought about by political conditions and by the growth of the army, as well as by the improvement of the Prussian system of railways.

The successes of 1866 had strengthened Moltke&#x27;s position, so that when, on 5 July 1870, the order for the mobilization of the Prussian and South German forces was issued, his plans were adopted without dispute. Five days later he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army for the duration of the war. This gave Moltke the right to issue orders which were equivalent to royal commands.

Moltke&#x27;s plan was to assemble the whole army south of Mainz, this being one district in which a single army could secure the defence of the whole frontier. If the French disregarded the neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, and advanced towards Cologne (or any other point on the Lower Rhine), the German army would be able to strike at their flank. At the same time the Rhine itself, with the fortresses of Koblenz, Cologne and Wesel, would be a serious obstacle in their path. If the French should attempt to invade south Germany, an advance by the Germans up the Rhine river would threaten their communications. Moltke expected that the French would be compelled by the direction of their railways to collect the greater part of their army near Metz, and a smaller portion near Strasbourg.

The German forces were grouped into three armies: the First of 60,000 men under Von Steinmetz, on the Moselle below Trier; the Second of 130,000 men, under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, around Homburg (with a reserve of 60,000 men behind them); and the Third of 130,000 men under the Crown Prince Frederick William, at Landau. Three army corps were held back in north-Eastern Germany, in case Austria-Hungary should make common cause with France. He reported this to the King on 17 April 1870.

Moltke&#x27;s plan was that the three armies, while advancing, should make a right wheel, so that the First Army on the right would reach the bank of the Moselle opposite Metz, while the Second and Third Armies should push forward, the Third Army to defeat the French force near Strasbourg, and the Second to strike the Moselle near Pont-à-Mousson. If the French army should be found in front of the Second Army, it would be attacked in front by the Second Army and in flank by the First or the Third (or both). If it should be found on or north of the line from Saarburg to Lunéville, it could still be attacked from two sides by the Second and Third Armies in co-operation. The intention of the great right wheel was to attack the principal French army in such a direction as to drive it north and cut its communications with Paris. The fortress of Metz was to be only monitored, and the main German forces, after defeating the chief French army, would then march against Paris.

This plan was carried out in its broad outlines. The Battle of Wörth was brought on prematurely, and therefore led, not to the capture of MacMahon&#x27;s army, which was intended, but only to its defeat and hasty retreat as far as Châlons. The Battle of Spicheren was not intended by Moltke, who wished to keep Bazaine&#x27;s army on the Saar until he could attack it with the Second Army in front and the First Army on its left flank. But these unexpected victories did not disconcert Moltke, who carried out his intended advance to Pont-Mousson, crossed the Moselle with the First and Second Armies, then faced north and wheeled round, so that the effect of the battle of Gravelotte was to drive Bazaine into the fortress of Metz and cut him off from Paris.

Nothing shows Moltke&#x27;s insight and strength of purpose in a clearer light than his determination to attack on 18 August, at the Battle of Gravelotte, when other strategists would have thought that, the strategic victory having been gained, a tactical victory was unnecessary. He has been blamed for the last attack at Gravelotte, which incurred heavy loss for no gain. But it is now known that this attack was ordered by the king and that Moltke blamed himself for not having used his influence to prevent it.

During the night following the battle Moltke left one army to invest Bazaine at Metz and set out with the two others to march towards Paris, the more southerly one leading, so that when MacMahon&#x27;s army should be found the main blow might be delivered from the south and MacMahon driven to the north. On 25 August it was found that MacMahon was moving north-east for the relief of Bazaine. The moment Moltke was satisfied of the accuracy of his information, he ordered the German columns to turn their faces north instead of west. MacMahon&#x27;s right wing was attacked at Beaumont while attempting to cross the Meuse, his advance necessarily abandoned, and his army with difficulty collected at Sedan.

At the Battle of Sedan, the two German armies surrounded the French army, which on 1 September was attacked from multiple sides and compelled to surrender. Moltke then resumed the advance on Paris, which was also surrounded.

From this time Moltke&#x27;s strategy is remarkable for its judicious economy of force, for he was wise enough never to attempt more than was practicable with the means at his disposal. The surrender of Metz and of Paris was just a question of time, and the problem was, while maintaining the sieges, to be able to ward off the attacks of the new French armies levied for the purpose of raising the Siege of Paris. The Siege of Metz ended with its surrender on 27 October.

On 28 January 1871, an armistice was concluded at Versailles by which the garrison became virtual prisoners and the war was ended.

====Final years and death====


In October 1870, Moltke was made a &quot;Graf&quot; (count) as a reward for his services during the Franco-Prussian War and victory at the Battle of Sedan. In June 1871, he was further rewarded by a promotion to the rank of field marshal and a large monetary grant. He served in the Diet of the North German Confederation from 1867 to 1871, and from 1871 to 1891 he was a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; (federal parliament).

Under his supervision, the German General Staff wrote studies about the Second Italian War of Independence, the Second Schleswig War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War. William I recognized the cultural achievements of Moltke by awarding him the civil class of the Pour le Mérite on 24 May 1874.

Moltke superintended the preparation of the official history of the Franco-Prussian War, which was published between 1874 and 1881 by the German General Staff. After the war, he became a national hero and celebrity. More than 50 monuments to Moltke were erected throughout Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; some were destroyed during or after World War II, but many remain.
When Moltke retired in 1888 as Chief of the General Staff, he was succeeded by Alfred von Waldersee. (His nephew, Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke, was chief from 1906 to 1914.) Moltke officially retired from active service on 9 August 1888. His 90th birthday on 26 October 1890 was declared a national holiday. Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke died at his home in Berlin on 24 April 1891 after a short illness. He received a state funeral where his body lay in state surrounded by military honours and thousands paid their respects, including Kaiser Wilhelm II; Bismarck did not attend. Thousands of troops, led by the Kaiser, escorted his casket to Berlin&#x27;s Lehrter Railroad Station, from which it was transported to Silesia.

Moltke&#x27;s remains were interred in the family mausoleum on the Kreisau estate, which however was plundered after World War II, when Silesia was annexed by Poland. No trace of his remains is known to exist.

==Personal life==
In April 1842, aged 41, Moltke married his 16-year-old step-niece Bertha Maria Wilhelmine Burt, known as Marie. She was the daughter of John Heyliger Burt, of St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, a member of a wealthy slave-owning planter family. Burt had married Moltke&#x27;s sister Auguste after the death of his first wife, who was also a German. It was a loving union and they remained married until Marie&#x27;s death on 24 December 1868, although they had no children. He was devoted to his wife, and long after her death still daily visited the chapel where she and her sister were buried to meditate.

==History of sound recording==
On 21 October 1889, von Moltke, then aged 88, made two audio recordings with Adelbert Theodor Wangemann, a German native who worked with Thomas Edison and had been sent to Europe with Edison&#x27;s newly invented cylinder phonograph. Moltke recorded a line from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (Act 1, Scene 3, – &quot;Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice&quot;), as well as a passage from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, both of which were engraved onto two wax cylinders. These recordings were then lost until their rediscovery in 1957, though they remained unidentified for decades after. On 30 January 2012, they were among a number of recordings revealed by the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. The two record cylinders made by Moltke are the only known surviving voice recordings of a person born in the 18th century.

<doc id="439367" wikidata="Q2397126" url="?curid=439367" title="HMS Cairo (D87)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cairo&quot; (D87) was a C-class light cruiser of the Royal Navy, named after the Egyptian capital, Cairo. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name. She was part of the &quot;Carlisle&quot; group of the C-class of cruisers.

== History ==

She was laid down by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead on 28 November 1917, launched on 19 November 1918 and commissioned on 24 September 1919. &quot;Cairo&quot; was not ready for service in World War I and her first posting was to the China Station in 1920, followed by the East Indies Station from 1921 to 1925. On 23 April 1926 &quot;Cairo&quot; visited Kismayu, Italian Somaliland, during the Jubaland Boundary Commission. After a further temporary attachment to the China Station until 1927, she joined the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island, Bermuda. From 1928 to 1930, &quot;Cairo&quot; was in the Mediterranean as flagship for the Rear-Admiral (D). After a refit from 1931–1932, she was with the Home Fleet as Commodore (D). She was converted to an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1939.

In World War II she took part in the Norwegian Campaign, where she was damaged by German aircraft off Narvik on 28 May 1940. 10 sailors were killed and the ship was out of action for two months. In the Mediterranean she led the escort of a six cargo-ship convoy from Gibraltar to Malta, code named Operation Harpoon, which endured intense air strikes. The British squadron also faced the attack of an Italian light cruiser division in the Sicilia channel. Four merchantmen and two destroyers were sunk, while &quot;Cairo&quot; was hit by two 6-inch rounds from the Italian cruiser &quot;Eugenio di Savoia&quot;, killing two members of her crew.

In August 1942, &quot;Cairo&quot; took part in Operation Pedestal, the escort of a convoy to Malta. During the operation she was torpedoed and sunk by the Italian submarine &quot;Axum&quot; north of Bizerta, Tunisia, on 12 August 1942. One torpedo blew off part of the stern, the port propeller was gone, the engine room flooded and gun mount Y fell off in the sea. As during the battle it was impossible to tow her to safety, it was decided to scuttle her. The destroyer fired four torpedoes but only one hit. A series of depth charges did not finish her off, so finally the escort destroyer received orders to sink her with gunfire. Twenty-four seamen went down with the ship.

<doc id="439369" wikidata="Q57130" url="?curid=439369" title="Helmuth von Moltke the Younger">
<text>Helmuth Johannes Ludwig Graf von Moltke (; 25 May 1848 – 18 June 1916), also known as Moltke the Younger, was a German general and Chief of the Great German General Staff, a member of the House of Moltke. He was also the nephew of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; &quot;Graf&quot; Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke, who is commonly called &quot;Moltke the Elder&quot; to differentiate the two.

Upon becoming the head of the General Staff, Moltke led the German Army from 1 January 1906 to 14 September 1914 during the opening months of World War I. His legacy remains a matter of controversy, due to his involvement in Germany&#x27;s decision to go to war and in the execution of the invasion of France and Belgium that culminated in the First Battle of the Marne.

==Early career==
Helmuth von Moltke was born in Biendorf, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and was named after his uncle, Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke, future &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) and hero of the Unification of Germany. During the Franco-Prussian War, Moltke served with the 7th Grenadier Regiment and was cited for bravery. He attended the War Academy between 1875 and 1878 and joined the General Staff in 1880. In 1882 he became personal adjutant to his uncle, who was then Chief of the General Staff. In 1891, on the death of his uncle, Moltke became aide-de-camp to Emperor Wilhelm II, thus becoming part of the Emperor&#x27;s inner circle. In 1898 he became commander of the 1st Guards Infantry Brigade and in 1902, being promoted to Lieutenant General, received command of the 1st Guards Infantry Division.

==Rise to the Great General Staff==
In 1904 Moltke was made Quartermaster-General; in effect, Deputy Chief of the General Staff. In 1906, he became chief on the retirement of Alfred von Schlieffen. His appointment was controversial then and remains so today. The other likely candidates for the position were Hans Hartwig von Beseler, Karl von Bülow and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz. Critics charge that Moltke gained the position on the strength of his name and his friendship with the Emperor (who liked to call him &quot;Julius&quot;), with whom he was certainly far closer than were the other candidates. Historians argue that Beseler was too close to Schlieffen to have succeeded him, while Bülow and Goltz were too independent for William II to have accepted them. Moltke&#x27;s friendship with the Emperor permitted him a latitude that others could not have enjoyed. Goltz, at least, saw nothing wrong with Moltke&#x27;s performance as Chief. 

==Chief of the Great General Staff==

===Preparing for war===

After becoming Chief of the German General Staff, Moltke devoted much of his time reviewing and fine-tuning the war plans set in place by his predecessor, Count Schlieffen. What came to be known as the &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot; was based on the likelihood that Germany would be forced to fight both France and Russia in a two-front war. As the succeeding Chief of the Great General Staff, Moltke adhered to Schlieffen&#x27;s plans yet made some modifications such as excluding Holland from the plan.

Therefore, in the event of conflict with Russia, it simultaneously called for a decisive offensive against France. In order to outflank French defenses, the offensive would entail an invasion of the Low Countries, thereby theoretically enabling German forces to swing behind Paris and decisively defeat the whole of France&#x27;s armies in a battle of encirclement 

In December 1911, Moltke lectured the General Staff: &quot;All are preparing themselves for the great war, which all sooner or later expect.&quot;

In 1913, Moltke discarded the Germany&#x27;s sole alternative to the Schlieffen Plan, the Eastern Deployment Plan, which confined hostilities to Russia alone in the event of a Russo-German conflict. Thus, by the time of the July Crisis, there was no way for Germany to go to war with Russia without simultaneously opening hostilities against France.

===Outbreak of World War I===
Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, Moltke was called to the Kaiser who had been told by Karl Max, prince Lichnowsky, that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had offered French neutrality under guarantee of Great Britain. According to the historian John Keegan, however, the Kaiser believed that Britain would remain neutral if Germany did not attack France. Whichever is true, the Kaiser, seeing that a two-front war could be avoided, told Moltke to divert forces from the western to the eastern front against Russia. Moltke refused, arguing that such a drastic alteration of a long-planned major mobilization could not be done without throwing the forces into organizational chaos, and the original plan now in motion had to be followed through. Years later, General Hermann von Staabs, head of the German railway division, disagreed, in a book detailing a contingency plan that the German army had for such a situation. Grey&#x27;s offer turned out to be a wishful misinterpretation by Lichnowsky and the Kaiser told Moltke to proceed as originally planned. 

Over the course of his term during the war, Motlke was confident about the victory of his forces. On 16 August 1914, in the train heading towards Koblenz, Moltke expressed his opinions regarding Battle of Liège and the Austro-Hungarian Army. He said, &quot;Today the last forts of Liège will be shot to pieces,&quot; expressing his confidence in the German victory of the Battle. Further, he assessed the Austro-Hungarian Army to be strong enough to fend the Russians. Even Josef von Stürgkh, the military attache onboard with Moltke regarded this as a wishful thought. 

Moltke&#x27;s health, already stressed from this argument with his ruler, would break down as a consequence of Germany&#x27;s subsequent defeat at the first battle of the Marne, and on 14 September 1914 he was succeeded by Erich von Falkenhayn.

===Marne Campaign===
It is a matter of debate whether the &quot;failure&quot; of the Marne Campaign can be placed at Moltke&#x27;s feet. The German actions had been based on the Schlieffen Plan and von Schlieffen himself had spotted a flaw in his plan, but had not suggested a solution: if the German right wing had made for the west side of Paris they would have been out of touch with the rest of the German army weak and unsupplied, and if they had made for the east of the city they would have been attacked by the French. On 27 August 1914 Moltke instructed General von Kluck (in command of the right wing) to go west of Paris. The next day Kluck decided to move south eastward instead, Moltke acquiesced and not only were Kluck&#x27;s forces attacked on the flank by the French but also by the British at their rear. Everywhere the Germans rolled back. Some critics contend that Moltke&#x27;s weakening of the Schlieffen Plan by sending troops to the Eastern Front led to German defeat on the Marne. The records show that Moltke, who was concerned about Russia, moved 180,000 men east before the war. Many thousands more men were transported from the crucial right wing to the left wing facing France in Alsace and Lorraine. Most controversially, on 28 August, Moltke sent two corps and a cavalry division to reinforce Ludendorff and Hindenburg, just before the victory at the Battle of Tannenberg. The series of moves has been viewed by some historians as responsible for much of the strategic failure of the Schlieffen Plan as enacted in 1914. A number of historians, notably Zuber and S. L. A. Marshall, contend that the failure of Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s 1st Army to keep position with Karl von Bülow&#x27;s 2nd Army, thus creating a gap near Paris that was exploited by the French, is a more direct cause than any planning foibles on Moltke&#x27;s part. The Schlieffen School disagrees and argues that Moltke lost control of the invading armies during the month of August and thus was unable to react when the First Battle of the Marne developed in September. While Moltke had lost touch with his field commanders, German operational doctrine had always stressed (personal initiative) on the part of subordinate officers, more so than in other armies. Other historians argue that the multitude of strategic options Moltke faced and the danger of the Russian invasion of East Prussia clouded Moltke&#x27;s judgement.

Although earlier in the campaign, German generals and the press had been proclaiming the campaign as good as won, on 4 September, Moltke was found despondent that the lack of prisoners and captured guns meant that the Germans had not yet really won a decisive victory. Moltke may well have been overly preoccupied with the unsuccessful German offensive in Lorraine, and he issued no orders to the First, Second and Third Armies between 2 and 5 September whilst the Battle of the Marne was in progress.

Following the German retreat from the Marne, Moltke allegedly reported to the Kaiser, &quot;Your Majesty, we have lost the war.&quot;

==Later life==

After Moltke handed over authority to Falkenhayn in September 1914, he was entrusted in Berlin with the office of Chief of the Home Substitute for the General Staff, which had the task of organising and forwarding the reserves together with controlling the territorial army corps while corresponding to those at the front. Moltke&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, and he died in Berlin on 18 June 1916 (aged 68) during the state memorial ceremony for &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Colmar &quot;Freiherr&quot; von der Goltz. He left a pamphlet entitled &quot;Die &#x27;Schuld&#x27; am Kriege&quot; (&quot;The Blame for the War&quot;), which his widow Eliza intended to publish in 1919. She was dissuaded from doing so because of the problems it might cause. The pamphlet was designed to show the &quot;chaotic&quot; nature of events leading up to the war, to counter Allied accusations of warmongering by Germany. Army chiefs and the German Foreign Ministry were disturbed by its contents. General Wilhelm von Dommes was sent to advise &quot;Gräfin&quot; Eliza von Moltke against its publication. Having read the pamphlet, he confided to his diary that it &quot;contains nasty stuff&quot;. Instead, Eliza published the more bland &quot;Erinnerungen, Briefe, Dokumente&quot;, a collection of her husband&#x27;s letters and documents. Other material was archived. Some was later destroyed during the Second World War and the original pamphlet has been lost since that time.

==Personal life==
At sixty-six, &quot;Graf&quot; von Moltke was one of the older commanders of 1914 and in poor health, having suffered a stroke shortly before the outbreak of the war. These factors negatively affected his determination when he was under stress. His personal interests included music, painting and literature. While often assertive in manner, his character was assessed by the historian Barbara W. Tuchman as being essentially that of a self-doubting introvert.

Moltke was a follower of theosophy, which taught that humanity was an endless, unchanging cycle of civilizations rising and falling. Historian Margaret MacMillan connected his personal beliefs with his resigned approach to the possibility of a general war in the lead-up to the First World War. Like many of his colleagues on the German General Staff, he was heavily influenced by Social Darwinism. His view of international relations as merely a struggle for survival led him to believe that the longer the start of the war was delayed the worse things would be for Germany.

<doc id="439380" wikidata="Q3443277" url="?curid=439380" title="Flushing (physiology)">
<text>Flushing is to become markedly red in the face and often other areas of the skin, from various physiological conditions. Flushing is generally distinguished from blushing, since blushing is psychosomatic, milder, generally restricted to the face, cheeks or ears, and generally assumed to reflect emotional stress, such as embarrassment, anger, or romantic stimulation. Flushing is also a cardinal symptom of carcinoid syndrome—the syndrome that results from hormones (often serotonin or histamine) being secreted into systemic circulation.

==Causes==

* abrupt cessation of physical exertion (resulting in heart output in excess of current muscular need for blood flow)
* abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES), usually in patients who have had abdominal surgery 
* alcohol flush reaction
* antiestrogens such as tamoxifen
* atropine poisoning
* body contact with warm or hot water (hot tub, bath, shower)
* butorphanol reaction with some narcotic analgesics (since butorphanol is also an antagonist)
* caffeine consumption
* carbon monoxide poisoning
* carcinoid tumor
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially emphysema (also known as &quot;pink puffer&quot;)
* cluster headache attack or headache
* compression of the nerve by the sixth thoracic vertebrae
* coughing, particularly severe coughing fits
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome
* dehydration
* dysautonomia
* emotions: anger, embarrassment (for this reason it is also called &quot;erythema pudoris&quot;, from the Latinized Greek word for &quot;redness&quot; and the Latin &quot;of embarrassment&quot;)
* fever
* fibromyalgia
* histamines
* homocystinuria (flushing across the cheeks)
* Horner&#x27;s syndrome
* hot flush
* hyperglycaemia
* hyperstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, especially the vagus nerve
* hyperthyroidism
* inflammation (for example, caused by allergic reaction or infection)
* iron poisoning
* Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (caused by antibiotics)
* keratosis pilaris rubra faceii
* Kratom
* mastocytosis
* medullary thyroid cancer
* mixing an antibiotic with alcohol
* neuroendocrine tumors
* niacin (vitamin B3)
* pheochromocytoma 
* polycythemia vera
* powerful vasodilators, such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
* severe pain
* sexual arousal, especially orgasm 
* sexual intercourse 
* sneezing (red nose)
* some recreational drugs, such as alcohol, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines
* spicy foods
* sunburn (erythema)
* tachycardia
* vinpocetine
===Sex flush===
Commonly referred to as the sex flush, vasocongestion (increased blood flow) of the skin can occur during all four phases of the human sexual response cycle. Studies show that the sex flush occurs in approximately 50–75% of females and 25% of males, yet not consistently. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under lower temperatures.

During the female sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then spread to the breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and possibly over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and the walls of the vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms.

The sex flush typically disappears soon after reaching orgasm, but in other cases, may take up to two hours or more, and sometimes intense sweating occurs simultaneously.

<doc id="439381" wikidata="Q61613" url="?curid=439381" title="Helmuth James von Moltke">
<text>Helmuth James Graf von Moltke (11 March 1907 – 23 January 1945) was a German jurist who, as a draftee in the German Abwehr, acted to subvert German human-rights abuses of people in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. He was a founding member of the Kreisau Circle opposition group, whose members opposed the government of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, and discussed prospects for a Germany based on moral and democratic principles after Hitler. The Nazis executed him for treason for his participation in these discussions.

Moltke was the grandnephew of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and the great-grandnephew of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the victorious commander in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars, from whom he inherited the Kreisau estate in Prussian Silesia, now Krzyżowa in Poland.

==Early life==
Moltke was born in Kreisau (now Krzyżowa, Świdnica County, Poland) in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His mother, Dorothy (&quot;née&quot; Rose Innes), was a South African of British descent, the daughter of Sir James Rose Innes, Chief Justice of the Union of South Africa from 1914 to 1927, and his wife Jessie Rose-Innes.

Moltke&#x27;s parents were Christian Scientists, his mother adopting his father&#x27;s religion after marriage. His father became a Christian Science practitioner and teacher, and both parents were in the group that translated the first German edition of the Christian Science textbook, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot; by Mary Baker Eddy. For reasons of family tradition, Moltke decided to become confirmed in the Evangelical Church of Prussia when he was 14.

==Education==
From 1927 to 1929, Moltke studied law and political sciences in Breslau, Vienna, Heidelberg, and Berlin. In 1928, Moltke became involved with college teachers and youth movement leaders in the organization of the &quot;Löwenberger Arbeitsgemeinschaften&quot; (Löwenberg working groups) in which unemployed young workers and young farmers were brought together with students so that they could learn from one another. They also discussed civics, obligations, and rights. In Kreisau, Moltke set aside an unused part of the estate for farming startups, which earned him harsh criticism from neighbouring landowners.

In 1931, he married Freya Deichmann, whom he met in Austria. In 1934, Moltke took his junior law examination. In 1935, he declined the chance to become a judge to avoid having to join the Nazi Party. Instead, he opened a law practice in Berlin. As a lawyer dealing in international law, he helped victims of Hitler&#x27;s régime emigrate, and he traveled abroad to maintain contacts. Between 1935 and 1938, Moltke regularly visited Great Britain, where he completed English legal training in London and Oxford.

==International law division of the Abwehr==
In 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. Moltke was immediately drafted at the beginning of the Polish campaign by the Abwehr, the High Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Counter-Intelligence Service, Foreign Division, under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, as an expert in martial law and international public law.
Moltke&#x27;s work for the Abwehr mainly involved gathering insights from abroad, from military attachés and foreign newspapers, and news of military-political importance, and relaying this information to the Wehrmacht. He maintained the connection between the OKW and the Foreign Office, but above all to provide appraisals of questions of the international laws of war. Unusually, he chose not to wear a uniform.

In his travels through German-occupied Europe, he observed many human rights abuses, which he attempted to thwart by citing legal principles. Moltke was one of the few officials who argued for treating captured Soviet prisoners of war according to the 1929 Geneva Convention, a treaty that Germany had signed and was legally obliged to follow. In October 1941, Moltke wrote: &quot;Certainly more than a thousand people are murdered in this way every day, and another thousand German men are habituated to murder... What shall I say when I am asked: And what did you do during that time?&quot; In the same letter he said, &quot;Since Saturday the Berlin Jews are being rounded up. Then they are sent off with what they can carry... How can anyone know these things and walk around free?&quot;

Moltke hoped that his appraisals could have a humanitarian effect on military actions; he was supported by anti-Hitler officers such as Canaris and Major General Hans Oster, Chief of the Central Division. During Nazi Germany&#x27;s war with the Soviet Union, Moltke wrote a memorandum urging the Wehrmacht to follow both the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention, in order to comply with international law and to promote reciprocal good treatment for German prisoners of war, but the recommendation was rejected by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, who scribbled on the margin that &quot;The objections arise from the military concept of chivalrous warfare&quot;.

Moltke invoked international law and political reasoning to stop the shooting of hostages in Holland, and was involved in warning the Danish resistance movement of the impending planned deportation of Danish Jews, which led to their mass evacuation by boat from Copenhagen to Malmö, Sweden. Having access to information about deportations and the shootings of hostages reinforced Moltke&#x27;s opposition to the war and the entire program of the Nazi Party.

Moltke&#x27;s meeting with Aimée Sotto Maior (aka de Heeren), a Brazilian spy who had come to Paris in 1938 under the cover of being a wealthy heiress and fashion shopper, allowed her to discourage Brazilian president, Getúlio Vargas, from entering an alliance with Germany.

Dorothy Thompson, one of the most famous and celebrated journalists of the period, performed a radio show during the war called &quot;Listen, Hans!&quot; These broadcasts were addressed, in German, to a fictional Prussian Junker identified only as “Hans.” Thompson later explained that the figure of &#x27;Hans&#x27; whom she addressed her broadcasts to was really Helmuth James von Moltke III. 

In 1943, Moltke traveled to Istanbul on two occasions. The official reason was to retrieve German merchant ships impounded by Turkey. The real reason was participation in an effort to end the war by a coalition of anti-Hitler elements of the German Army, German refugees living in Turkey, members of the OSS, the Abwehr (German military intelligence) and the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen. This group passed a report to the Allies, which reached President Franklin Roosevelt. However, Roosevelt&#x27;s advisers, including Henry Morgenthau Jr., counseled against the credibility of the report.

==Nonviolent opposition to Nazi rule==
Moltke also surreptitiously spread the information to which he was privy, on the war and the Nazi concentration camps, to friends outside the Nazi party, including members of the Resistance in occupied Europe. Declassified British documents reveal that he twice attempted to contact British officials, including friends from Oxford, offering to &quot;go to any length&quot; to assist them, but the British refused the first time, confusing him with his uncle, the German ambassador to Spain, and replied to the second offer by asking for &quot;deeds&quot; rather than &quot;talk&quot;.

Moltke possessed strong religious convictions. In a 1942 letter smuggled to a British friend Lionel Curtis, Moltke wrote: &quot;Today, not a numerous, but an active part of the German people are beginning to realize, not that they have been led astray, not that bad times await them, not that the war may end in defeat, but that what is happening is sin and that they are personally responsible for each terrible deed that has been committed – naturally, not in the earthly sense, but as Christians&quot;.
In the same letter, Moltke wrote that before World War II, he had believed that it was possible to be totally opposed to National Socialism without believing in God, but he now declared his former ideas to be &quot;wrong, completely wrong&quot;. In Moltke&#x27;s opinion, only by believing in God could one be a total opponent of the Nazis.

===Kreisau Circle===

In Berlin Moltke had a circle of acquaintances who opposed Nazism and who met frequently there, but on three occasions met at Kreisau. These three incidental gatherings were the basis for the term &quot;Kreisau Circle&quot;. The meetings at Kreisau had an agenda of well-organized discussion topics, beginning with relatively innocuous ones as cover. The topics of the first meeting of May 1942 included the failure of German educational and religious institutions to fend off the rise of Nazism. The theme of the second meeting in the autumn of 1942 was on post-war reconstruction, assuming the likely defeat of Germany. This included both economic planning and self-government, developing a pan-European concept that pre-dated the European Union, summarized in documented resolutions. The third meeting, in June 1943, addressed how to handle the legacy of Nazi war crimes after the fall of the dictatorship. These and other meetings resulted in &quot;Principles for the New [Post-Nazi] Order&quot; and &quot;Directions to Regional Commissioners&quot;, works, which Moltke asked his wife, Freya, to hide in a place that not even he knew.

Moltke opposed the assassination of Hitler. He believed that if one succeeded, Hitler would become a martyr, and if it failed, that would expose those few individuals among the German leadership who could be counted on to build a democratic state after the collapse of the Third Reich. On 20 July 1944, there was an attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life, which the Gestapo used as a pretext to eliminate perceived opponents to the Nazi regime. In the aftermath of the plot, some 5,000 of Hitler&#x27;s opponents were executed.

==Arrest, trial and execution==
Moltke&#x27;s mindset and his objections to orders that were at odds with international law both put him at risk of arrest. Indeed, the Gestapo arrested him in January 1944. A year later, in January 1945, he stood, along with several of his fellow régime opponents, before the &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; (&quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;), presided over by Roland Freisler. Because no evidence could be found that Moltke had participated in any conspiracy to bring about a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, Freisler had to invent a charge &quot;&quot;.

Since Moltke and his friends had discussed a Germany based on moral and democratic principles that could develop after Hitler, Freisler deemed this discussion as treason, a crime worthy of death. Hanns Lilje writes in his autobiography that as Moltke stood before the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;, he had &quot;possessed, in the face of clear recognition of the fact that the death penalty had already been decided, the moral courage for an attack on Freisler and the whole institution&quot;. In two letters written to his wife in January 1945 while imprisoned at Tegel Prison, Moltke noted with considerable pride that he was to be executed for his ideas, not his actions, a point that had been underlined a number of times by Freisler. In one letter, Moltke noted &quot;Thus it is documented, that not plans, not preparations, but the spirit as such shall be persecuted. &quot;Vivat&quot; Freisler!&quot; In the second letter, Moltke claimed that he stood before the court &quot;not as a Protestant, not as a great landowner, not as an aristocrat, not as a Prussian, not as a German...but as a Christian and nothing else&quot;. He wrote: &quot;But what the Third Reich is so terrified of ... is ultimately the following: a private individual, your husband, of whom it is established that he discussed with 2 clergymen of both denominations [Protestant and Catholic] ... questions of the practical, ethical demands of Christianity. Nothing else; for that alone we are condemned... I just wept a little, not because I was sad or melancholy ... but because I am thankful and moved by this proof of God&#x27;s presence.&quot;

Moltke was sentenced to death on 11 January 1945 and hanged twelve days later at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. In a letter written while in custody, he revealed his motivation for resistance to his two sons: &quot;Since National Socialism came to power, I have striven to mitigate the consequences for its victims and to prepare the way for change. My conscience drove me to it – it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s duty, after all.&quot;

==Recognition==

In 1989, Moltke was posthumously awarded the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis for his work, &quot;Briefe an Freya 1939–1945&quot;.

In 2001, the German Section of the International Society for Military Law and the Law of War established the Helmuth-James-von-Moltke-Preis for outstanding judicial works in the field of security policy.

As Germany continues to shed light on the internal dynamics of the Nazi era, Moltke has become a prominent symbol of moral opposition to the Nazi regime. On 11 March 2007, Moltke&#x27;s centenary was commemorated in the Französischer Dom in Berlin, where he was described by German chancellor Angela Merkel as a symbol of &quot;European courage&quot;.

His life was the subject of a 1992 documentary film nominated for an Oscar, &quot;The Restless Conscience: Resistance to Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945&quot;. A biography by Günter Brakelmann compiles Moltke&#x27;s letters, diary, and other papers shared by his wife.

<text>A writ of summons is a formal document issued by the monarch that enables someone to sit in a Parliament under the United Kingdom&#x27;s Westminster system. At the beginning of each new Parliament, each person who has established their right to attend Parliament is issued a writ of summons. Without the writ, they are unable to sit or vote in Parliament.

In most countries, the constitutional logic of a Parliament as a &quot;creature of the Head of State&quot; does not exist; instead, the Parliament is considered to have an independent existence in its own right springing directly from the Constitution. Accordingly, there are no writs of summons, although members of Parliament have their memberships certified by an Election commission, returning officer or other similar body.

==History==
Writs of summons generally follow the same form, whose nature has changed but little over the centuries. The words &quot;writ&quot; and &quot;summons&quot; appear nowhere in the writ.

Additional text may appear in the writ. For example, in the year 1264–5. At that time, Henry III of England was concerned for his first-born, the Lord Edward, because he had been ransomed for the more equitable distribution of power, which in the event was obtained by the Parliament holden at London on 20 January 1265.

By 1295 now under Edward I of England the form had changed. In fact, the writs of summons to that Parliament &quot;are evidence about the nature and function of the developing body.&quot; The forms of address are particularly curious as they number three in type: whether it was to a prelate, a baron or a representative of a shire or town. And the latter are informed that &quot;Since we intend to have a consultation and meeting with the barons&quot; now therefore &quot;we strictly require you to cause... to be elected without delay&quot; various delegates of the lieux.
It is established precedent that the sovereign may not deny writs of summons to qualified peers. In 1626, King Charles I ordered that the writ of summons of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol not be issued. Lord Bristol had been charged with treason but was never tried. He complained to the House of Lords, which resolved that the denial of a writ to an eligible peer was without precedent and that the sovereign should immediately issue a writ of summons, which did occur.

==Modern forms==
===To Peers===
Modern summonses are without reference to royal hostages but in essence they flow in the same way. Firstly, they set out the titles of the Sovereign, and then those of the recipient. Next, they note the date for Parliament&#x27;s calling and the reason for its calling. This portion of the writ differs based on whether Parliament is at the time sitting, or prorogued, or dissolved. Then, after commanding the recipient to attend, the writ indicates that the sovereign him or herself witnesses it. The form of writs issued to Peers while Parliament is dissolved is as follows:

In the case of writs issued to Peers when Parliament is prorogued, the form of the first sentence of the second paragraph changes:

In the case of writs issued during a session of Parliament, the form of the first sentence of the second paragraph changes:

<doc id="439385" wikidata="Q5095464" url="?curid=439385" title="Chicago (poker card game)">
<text>The game was allegedly invented in an underground poker club at Hammarbykajen, Stockholm in Sweden owned by the Russian mafia. The game is a variation of the Swedish card game, Fem-kort.
The poker-related card game called Chicago is one of the most popular card games in Finland today. Relying on the keeping of score instead of the placing of bets, it is suitable even for environments such as schools, where gambling is often prohibited. The game exists in countless versions, so here a (somewhat arbitrarily chosen) basic game will be followed by a number of possible variations.

== Hand scores ==

The backbone of the game is that each hand has its own point value, as given in this table:
* One pair - 1 point.
* Two pair - 2 points.
* Three of a kind - 3 points.
* Straight - 4 points.
* Flush - 5 points.
* Full house - 6 points.
* Four of a kind - 7 points (but see Variations below).
* Straight flush - 8 points (but see Variations below).
*Royal Flush - 20 points (but see Variations below).

== Basic rules ==

Chicago is played with a standard 52-card deck. Each player is dealt five cards. The objective is to reach, or exceed, 52 points.

=== Exchanges and hand scoring ===
The players are allowed to exchange any number of their cards. If a player chooses to exchange one card only, he may choose &quot;one up&quot;, meaning that he is dealt one card faced up, which he can either accept, or instead take the next card unseen. After the exchanges, the player with the best hand (and only one player) gets points for his hand. Then follows another round of exchanges, but no hand scoring.

=== The game ===
Now, the first player begins by playing one card. Ordinary whist rules apply, but the players keep their cards collected by themselves. The player who wins the last trick gets 5 points. Also, the player with the best hand (whether it is the same player or not) gets points for his hand. After achieving 42 points a player is no longer permitted to trade cards as they normally would. Instead, they are dealt 6 cards at the beginning of the game and must discard one before the first scoring round. No further exchanges are permitted.

=== Chicago ===
Any player can choose to play &quot;Chicago&quot; at any time. In this case, he pledges himself to win &quot;all&quot; the tricks of the game. If he does, he is awarded 15 points, but if he fails, the penalty is just as harsh: -15 points.

=== Blind Chicago ===
In addition to the conventional &quot;Chicago&quot; mentioned above, a player may also elect to pull a &quot;Blind Chicago&quot;. As with the standard &quot;Chicago&quot;, during a &quot;Blind Chicago&quot; a player also pledges to win all the tricks - however he announces his intention to do so before having ever seen his cards. In other words, a &quot;Blind Chicago&quot; can only be announced immediately after the last card leaves the dealer&#x27;s hand. If he succeeds, a player is rewarded 30 points, with 20 deducted in the event of failure. If a &quot;Blind Chicago&quot; is announced, no players are awarded points for their poker hands in any of the phases. The player attempting the &quot;Blind Chicago&quot; may trade as he normally would. Also note that if a player succeeds in completing the &quot;Blind Chicago&quot; on a deuce, he is awarded 60 points - an automatic game win.

== Variations ==
* Sometimes, a player given five cards below ten (either inclusive or exclusive - must be decided before game starts) is allowed to replace them before the exchanges begin.
* Some play with 3 exchanges instead of 2. Then of course, scoring for hands will be made after both the first and the second exchange.
* Some do not use the &quot;one up&quot; rule.
* Often, a game will require that a player declare &quot;Chicago&quot; before they can win the game. The declaration is accepted regardless of whether one wins or loses the 5 tricks.
*Often, one awards 8 for Four of a kind instead of 7, 11 for Straight flush instead of 7 and a win for a Royal flush instead of 20.
* Often, one wants to give higher rewards than 7 or 8 points for four of a kind and straight flush respectively. There are several ways to achieve this, most notably by elevating the player immediately to 52 points, or lowering either all players or one player of the holder&#x27;s choice to 0 points, or a combination of these. Some also separate the royal flush from the straight flush, awarding 9 points for a royal flush. Holding a royal flush usually means immediate victory.
* The confusion is great as to what scores are appointed in the case of &quot;Chicago&quot;. Some will argue that no player will get any points at all besides the +15 or -15, whilst others will allow other points to be awarded. The +5 for the game, however, can never be stacked with the +15 for Chicago. Yet another variation is to award +13/-13 points for Chicago and the declaring player gets to go first. In that variation it is forbidden to declare Chicago unless the player has reached 13 points, ruling out the possibility of a negative score.
* Some prescribe that any player with 45 points or more is not allowed to replace any cards.
* Some require that after (and not in the same hand as) a player reaches 52 points, he must win the game once more before he actually wins. This handles the possibility that more than one player reach 52 points in the same hand.
* Some award 10 points instead of 5 if the last trick is taken with a deuce. If this variant is employed, 30 points must also be awarded for a &quot;Chicago&quot; hand successfully ended with a deuce.

<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected in the 1987 general election, held on 11 June. The Parliament lasted until 1992, although the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was replaced on 28 November 1990 by Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major.

Diane Abbott was one of the first three Black British MPs in the House of Commons; Bernie Grant and Paul Boateng were elected alongside her at the same election.

During the 1987–92 Parliament, Bernard Weatherill was the Speaker, Margaret Thatcher and John Major served as Prime Minister, and Neil Kinnock served as Leader of the Opposition. This Parliament was dissolved on 16 March 1992.

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the 1987 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group, while Sinn Féin has not taken its seats. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.

<text>Commander Charles Herbert Little RCN, CD, FRCGS (December 11, 1907 – January 10, 2004) was Canadian Director of Naval Intelligence during the Second World War and an author.

== Biography ==
Charles Herbert (Herbie) Little was born and raised in Mount Forest, Ontario. He won scholarships to Upper Canada College (graduating in 1926) and Trinity College, Toronto (class of 1930) where he majored in German and played ice hockey, football, and cricket. He was a member of the Beta Psi fraternity.

He was offered a contract with the Montreal Maroons ice hockey team but decided to continue his studies instead.

He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and continued Germanic studies at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating in 1932. While there he was captain of the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club that won the Spengler Cup two consecutive seasons.

On his return to Canada, he married Ruth B. Harrison of Rothesay, New Brunswick. He taught at Upper Canada College until he joined the Royal Canadian Navy at the outbreak of the war in 1939. Little presented himself at HMCS York in Toronto, but after he mentioned that he was a teacher of German and that he had just returned from a trip to Germany, he was immediately sent to Ottawa. Upon his arrival he was asked to go through some captured German documents, some of which seemed to describe a weapon. Those papers were sent to London and were found to be partial plans for the new magnetic mines being used by the German Navy.

During the war he served as Director of Naval Intelligence on the Naval Staff. Because of his position he was one of the few Canadians to handle Ultra decrypts. After the defeat of Nazi Germany he was allowed to enter combat and was sent to join the British Pacific Fleet.

He remained in the navy until 1959, helping to develop the University Naval Training Division and the Regular Officer Training Plan.

After leaving the navy he became a federal civil servant. From 1964 to 1971 he was chief editor of the Royal Commission on Pilotage.

He wrote ten historical books, a book of poetry and numerous articles. He was a lifelong contributor to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society Journal. He was made a fellow of the society in 1969 (FRCGS). He was given an award by the Spanish government for his history of Spanish exploration of the west coast of Canada. He was National President of the Canadian Authors&#x27; Association from 1972 to 1975 and was made Honorary President in 2001. He was president of the Canadian Writers&#x27; Foundation from 1978 to 2001 and was Honorary President thereafter.

In 1977 he was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal. In 1991 he was awarded the Admirals&#x27; Medal. In 2000 at the age of 92, he dropped the puck at the start of the 100th annual Oxford vs Cambridge Ice Hockey game.

He died in Ottawa at the age of 96. He was buried at Frenhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.

<text>Somporn Saekhow (1940 – August 20, 2002, Thai สมพร แซ่โค้ว) was a farmer from Kanchanadit, Surat Thani Province, Thailand, who became famous as a monkey teacher.

As his parents were coconut farmers, Somporn experienced the traditional use of monkeys for the harvest of coconuts. The monkeys were often beaten by their owners when they didn&#x27;t perform as expected (e.g. when they left ripe coconuts on the tree). This gave him the idea to teach monkeys in a better way. His Buddhist teacher, the famous monk Phra Buddhadasa from the nearby temple Wat Suan Mokkha in Chaiya, encouraged him to teach monkeys in a positive way, without the use of force. In 1957 he started to teach monkeys and developed his unique teaching style.

As it is illegal to catch wild monkeys in Thailand, the students of the monkey school – pig-tailed macaques (&quot;Macaca nemestrina&quot;) – were brought in by their owners for the education only. In the first step the monkey has to get used to humans, then it will be shown how to turn a coconut. Next the coconut is fixed on a pole, later even higher on a tree. After six months of training they are ready for picking the ripe coconuts from the trees.

In time his school became locally famous, and the largest monkey school of all southern Thailand. In 1993 Somporn together with his favourite monkey Khai Nui carried the provincial flag in the opening ceremony of the National Games held in Surat Thani. At the same time his school became a tourist attraction as well, showing the teaching methods as well as the special performance of his best student.

Somporn died in 2002 after a heart attack. His school is continued by relatives.

<doc id="439430" wikidata="Q4650285" url="?curid=439430" title="ABC trial">
<text>R v Aubrey, Berry and Campbell, better known as the ABC Trial, was a trial conducted in the United Kingdom in the 1970s, of three men for offences under the Official Secrets Act 1911. The men were two libertarian journalists of a similar political viewpoint as much of the Labour government, and a resigned GCHQ source seeking to heighten scrutiny of government-authorised wire-tapping and limit the work of the American espionage agency, the CIA, in Britain. These aims were furthered in the following two decades achieved through detailed parliamentary scrutiny into and regular reports as to the work of security services, a Freedom of Information Committee and regulation of wire-tapping. Aside from very limited reportage from the Central Criminal Court, its early analysis comes in the account of one of its investigative-journalist defendants, Duncan Campbell, in the annual journal &quot;Socialist Register&quot;.

==Background==
London magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; in 1976, through the writings of the first and third defendants, published a two-page account of GCHQ called &quot;The Eavesdroppers&quot;, this was among other evidence collected and imparted by the defendants as to how GCHQ operates from year-to-year including gathered evidence, such as photographs of radio masts, of its physical apparatus.

By statute, the Attorney General needed to condone the prosecution for it to proceed; he did so.

The case took place from September to November 1978 – still in an era of surveillance to counter ongoing threats due to the Cold War and from Irish and Northern Irish dissident republicans. Conviction of some form was assured as all parties could not deny a small amount of classified information had been communicated and no tenable argument of the law as to freedom of information such as on the basis of freedom of expression was raised.

The Watergate scandal in the US, exposed by investigative journalists, showed the effectiveness of press reporting of the activities of secret government agencies. President Nixon had repeatedly claimed that the requirements of national security overrode the public&#x27;s right to know, and this had been exposed by the press, Senate and Congress, to have been driven by his desire to cover up criminal activity.

==Summary==
All three of the men were charged with wrongful communication of information under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act. Campbell was also charged with an offence under section 1 of the Act: imparting information which might be useful to an enemy for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state. This second charge was dropped before the close of the trial, the judge stating they were &quot;oppressive in the circumstances&quot;.

The trial was held in Court 1 of the Central Criminal Court. It was against three defendants: 
* Crispin Aubrey, who was a journalist for &quot;Time Out&quot;;
* John Berry, a former Corporal in signals intelligence (SIGINT);
* Duncan Campbell, who was an investigative journalist.

One of the prosecution witnesses was an anonymous SIGINT (that is, electronic communications) officer, referred to as &quot;Colonel B&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s 1979 account identified him as Colonel Johnstone.

The trial found that the information came almost entirely from open publications, some from the United States, as well as simple information gathering such as noting the units resident at a site from signage posted at the main gate and visible from public roads.

The jury confirmed guilt (convicted) as to the remaining (non-dropped) Section 2 offence as to disclosure of those classified matters in no way in the public domain. The only penalty imposed was against Berry and was non-custodial; but criminal records of all three would hamper certain sensitive employment. In 1979 Campbell wrote an article, including the words &quot;It ended in convictions under Section 2 for each of us, but with negligible penalty – in the case of myself and fellow journalist Aubrey, no penalty at all.&quot; This added &quot;&#x27;Colonel B&#x27; rapidly achieved the position of a national figure of ridicule.&quot; In Campbell&#x27;s view many editorials mentioning the unnecessarily secretive governance of and occasionally counter-productive application of protected status to essentially all information at and concerning GCHQ largely fuelled the decision by the Liberal Party, successful in the random selection of private member&#x27;s Bills via Clement Freud, to select a Freedom of Information Bill. The bill, a forerunner of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, lapsed with the end of the Callaghan ministry but achieved a wholly unopposed second Commons reading, reflecting a sea change among members.

The Section 1 charge &quot;lacked the legitimation which could be provided by the existence of a subversive or hostile threat, the presentation of their evidence rapidly became ridiculous. The information [Campbell] had gathered, dealt with piecemeal, was of course readily available in public. As witness after witness conceded this point, the prosecution rapidly lost any sense of purpose.&quot; The prosecution dropped this charge.

The contemporary drive of most of the security services with making themselves and their nature top secret, already widely suspected, was criticised in the centrist, libertarian 1979 article by Campbell, citing in support Tony Bunyan&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;The Political Police in Britain&quot;, which opined that Official Secrets Acts, as then applied and interpreted in the courts, &quot;represent the last resort in suppressing public knowledge of the workings of the state&quot;.

The quickly rubbished first jury, its foreman and others having been in service with the Government, leading to an unchallenged second jury who heard and decided the case, was directly responsible for exposing extreme jury vetting, and eliciting official disclosures on the nature and previous extent of the practice - generally in the case of political or terrorist trials, or cases of organized crime. Increasing attention by libertarians to the nature of the jury system, and its preservation and strengthening, proved to be a lasting bonus of the case.

==Impact on UK Law==
Aubrey and Campbell had predominantly worked by cross-referencing public sources of information such as open army journals. The case challenged the presumption by UK security services that arbitrary material related to military or security operations could be inherently considered secret, or that synthesising such material could be considered espionage. One exchange in court resulted in a witness claiming that the sign outside their base was a secret, despite being visible from a public road. Key witness Col. Johnston admitted under cross-examination that &quot;“To be frank, I am not certain what is a secret and what isn’t.”&quot;

The Official Secrets Act 1911 was largely replaced by the Official Secrets Act 1989, including the &quot;catch-all&quot; Section 2 that Aubrey, Berry and Campbell had been convicted under. Inclusion of a specific public interest defence was considered for the 1989 Act, but rejected as it was deemed that protections under Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) of the European Convention of Human Rights and other legal safeguards provided sufficient protection. Future Governments have generally refrained from authorising prosecutions against journalists under the OSA, treating leaks as an internal problem and not one which should impinge upon freedom of the press.

==Timeline==
*18 February 1977: Aubrey and Campbell (the two journalists) interviewed Berry
*20 February 1977: All three men were arrested and charged under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 (Berry was charged with &quot;communicating classified information to unauthorised persons&quot;, and Campbell and Aubrey with &quot;unauthorised receipt of classified information&quot;)
*24 May 1977: Further charges were added under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act
*9 August 1977: Additional charge under Section 1 against Duncan Campbell, for collecting information
*November 1977: Committal hearing at Tottenham Magistrates Court. First appearance of Colonel B as a prosecution witness.
*5 September 1978: Trial opened at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Willis
*18 September 1978: Trial stopped after jury foreman was exposed as a former SAS officer
*3 October 1978: Second trial opened before Mr Justice Mars-Jones
*24 October 1978: All Section 1 charges were dropped
*14 November 1978: Aubrey and Berry were convicted by the jury
*16 November 1978: Campbell was convicted by the jury
*17 November 1978: The only penalty imposed was non-custodial, against Berry.

==Defendant&#x27;s opinion of Attorney General==
In 1979, Campbell wrote that the Attorney General &quot;had allowed himself to be used as a patsy for the security services to try to rearrange the law of official secrecy to their choosing. Several initiatives from that quarter had become apparent during the case.&quot;

<text>Selwyn is a township in central-eastern Ontario, Canada, located in Peterborough County. The township comprises a mix of rural areas and built up urban areas (former independent towns and villages).

The township was created in 2001, as Smith-Ennismore-Lakefield, changing its name to Selwyn effective January 15, 2013. It is not to be confused with the hamlet of Selwyn, one of many unincorporated areas within the township.

==History==

On January 1, 1998, Ennismore and Smith Townships were amalgamated to form the Township of Smith-Ennismore. On January 1, 2001, a Minister&#x27;s Order created the currentlargertownship by amalgamating the formerly independent Village of Lakefield with the Township of Smith-Ennismore and part of Douro–Dummer Township.

In December 2012, the township council voted to select a new name after Canada Post notified many residents that addresses would have to be changed to reflect the municipality due to a phasing out of its rural route system. The council chose to focus on a simpler name, reducing what it felt was confusion regarding the collective purposerather than a persistent notion of disparate partsintended by the history of amalgamations. By a vote of 3 to 2, choosing from a slate of new names, the township council voted to adopt the new name of Selwyn, effective January 2013.

==Geography==

The township comprises the communities of:

<text>Alasdair Smith DL is a former professor of economics and vice-chancellor at the University of Sussex and is a former chair of the 1994 Group. He is a noted international economist whose studies (often developed in concert with fellow economist Tony Venables) have been used by the European Union. He became a deputy chair of the Competition Commission in 2012 and was then an inquiry chair at the Competition and Markets Authority from 2014 to 2017. In April 2017, he became a member of the Scottish Fiscal Commission.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Smith was born on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1949. He is a graduate of the University of Glasgow, the London School of Economics and Oxford University.

===Career===
He taught for 9 years at the London School of Economics before becoming a professor of economics at the University of Sussex in 1981, and becoming vice-chancellor in 1998.

While vice-chancellor, he restructured the university, and helped create the Brighton and Sussex Medical School.

His pro-top-up fees stance resulted in the student union at the University of Sussex calling for a vote of no-confidence in his leadership in a student election in February 2003. There was also controversy over his proposal in 2006 to restructure the chemistry department at Sussex.

He announced in November 2006 that he was to stand down at the end of August 2007. His successor, Professor Michael Farthing, took over as vice-chancellor on 1 September 2007, while Smith remained at Sussex as a research professor of economics.

He was a member of the Prison Service Pay Review Body from 2001 to 2004; and of the Doctors&#x27; and Dentists&#x27; Review Body from 2007 to 2010. In March 2010, he became chair of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body and a member of the Senior Salaries Review Body. In 2013, there was controversy when his appointment as chair of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body was not renewed for a second term. He has been a member of the Determinations Panel of The Pensions Regulator since 2011.

At the Competition Commission, his cases included the proposed Barr-Britvic merger, the takeover by Eurotunnel of SeaFrance ferries, and a market investigation into Private Motor Insurance. At the CMA, he chaired a market investigation into Retail Banking.

===Personal life===
He is married to Sherry Ferdman and has two daughters.
