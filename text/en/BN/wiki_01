<text>Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan (; ; 2 September 1926 – 22 November 2008), , commonly known as Ibrahim Nasir, was a Maldivian politician who served as the Prime Minister of the Maldives from 1957 to 1968 under the monarchy, and later the first President of the Second Republic of Maldives from 1968 to 1978. Nasir served two terms (one term consisting of 5 years), then he decided to retire, even though the People&#x27;s Majlis voted him in for a third term. Nasir adhered to the non-aligned ideology and was a staunch anti-imperialist. Nasir is remembered as an independence hero for guiding the Maldives to independence from the British Empire, he is also credited for establishing the tourism industry in the Maldives, as well as rapidly modernizing and developing the country and economy.

== Early life ==

Ibrahim Nasir was born on 2 September 1926 in Fuvahmulah, Maldives, to Ahmad Didi of &quot;Velaanaage&quot; from Male&#x27; and &quot;Nayaage&quot; Aishath Didi from Fuvahmulah. Nasir is descended from the royal houses Huraa from his paternal side and Dhiyamigili from his maternal side. Nasir&#x27;s mother, Aishath Didi, was the daughter of Moosa Didi, son of Dhadimagu Ganduvaru Maryam Didi, daughter of Hussain Didi, son of Al-Nabeel Karayye Hassan Didi, son of Prince Ibrahim Faamuladheyri Kilegefan, son of Sultan Muhammed Ghiya&#x27;as ud-din, son of Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar II, son of Sultan Muhammad Imaduddin II of the Dhiyamigili dynasty.

Nasir would spend his childhood in Fuvahmulah, after which Nasir&#x27;s family moved to Malé, where he began studying and attended Madharusathul Salahiyya, which later became Majeediyya School in 1969. After finishing his studies in Malé, he would spend more time studying in Sri Lanka, before he returned to Malé and began his political career and rapidly climbed the political ladder.

Nasir was married three times and had five children. His first wife was Aisha Zubair (Tuttudon Goma), whom he married in 1950. They had a son named Ahmed Nasir. In 1953, he married Mariyam Saeeda Didi, with whom he had two sons, Ali Nasir and Mohamed Nasir. In 1969, Nasir married Naseema Mohamed Kaleyfan, with whom he had a son and a daughter, Ismail Nasir and Aishath Nasir, respectively.

==Premiership==

Ibrahim Nasir served as the prime minister under the reign of Muhammad Fareed Didi from 12 December 1957, until the former was sworn in as the first President of the Second Republic of Maldives. He was also the Minister of Finance from December 1957 to November 1968. Nasir favoured neutrality during his premiership and later presidency. Nasir was keen on expelling the British from RAF Gan and seeking independence from them. Nasir also did not want to give this base to the Soviets who contacted him about it later during his presidency.

Upon achieving independence in 1965, the Maldives was invited to join the Commonwealth of Nations. Nasir declined this invitation due to Nasir seeing the Commonwealth as being an organization under the British Empire. The Maldives would however go on to join the Commonwealth of Nations during Maumoon&#x27;s tenure in 1982.

The events in Thinadhoo under President Ibrahim Nasir’s administration in the 1960s are among the darkest chapters in Maldivian history. Following the end of the short-lived United Suvadive Republic (1959-1963), Nasir’s government undertook a brutal campaign to suppress dissent in Thinadhoo, one of the key islands involved in the secessionist movement. Reports suggest that government forces launched an attack on the island in 1962, resulting in widespread violence. Homes were burned, and many residents were forcibly evacuated or killed, marking what some historians and locals refer to as a massacre. This crackdown effectively erased Thinadhoo as a functioning community for years and instilled fear across the Maldives, reinforcing central control under Nasir’s rule. The events remain a painful memory for many and continue to provoke debates about justice and accountability in Maldivian history.

Although Nasir preferred to keep a cordial relationship with the nations of the world, both Nasir&#x27;s premiership and presidency was marked with by a strained relationship with the Maldives&#x27; former colonial overlord.

Less than two months after securing independence, Nasir secured membership in the United Nations on 21 September 1965, against the opposition of countries that did not feel that the UN was the place for small states. The Maldives was the first state of its size (a population less than 80,000 in 1965) to be admitted to the UN. Small states that had long been independent such as San Marino and Monaco and they were not admitted to become members of the UN. Western Samoa which became independent only a few years prior to the Maldivian independence also was not admitted to the UN. The flag of the Maldives was raised at the UN headquarters on October 12, 1965.

==Tourism industry==

The tourism industry began to develop during Nasir&#x27;s tenure when the government at the time made efforts to diversify the economy beyond fishing and agriculture, Nasir believed the revenue would help boost the economy and modernize the country. Although the United Nations mission at the time advised against it. However, in 1972, the first resort, Kurumba Island Resort was opened, the second resort Bandos Island Resort was personally developed and opened by Nasir, and he also personally set-up the first tourist agency known as &quot;Crescent Tourist Agency&quot;. Ever since tourism has flourished and become the most important industry in the Maldives. During the 50 Golden Year of Tourism anniversary event in 2022, Nasir was awarded a special award (accepted by the Nasir family) and recognition for his part in founding the tourism industry in the Maldives.

==Presidency==

Ibrahim Nasir was sworn in as the second President of the independent Republic of Maldives on 11 November 1968. Nasir pursued a non-aligned policy as president. His foreign policy involved establishing and maintaining positive relations with nations around the globe, Nasir believed that investing into tourism would both help the development of the country as well as further his foreign policy. In 1976, the Maldives officially joined the Non-Aligned Movement.

He was credited with many other improvements such as introducing an English-based modern curriculum to government-run schools. He brought television and radio to the country with formation of &quot;Television Maldives&quot; and &quot;Radio Maldives&quot; for broadcasting radio signals nationwide. He abolished &quot;Vaaru&quot;, a tax on the people living on islands outside Malé, as well as many other taxes on various imports to the country, some of which have been since reinstated. When Nasir relinquished power, Maldives was debt-free to the international community, and corruption was effectively under control. Under his watch, the national shipping line with more than 40 ships that were plying the oceans of the world remained a source of national pride for Maldivians. It was a remarkable success story among the maritime nations of South Asia.
His tenure was characterized by significant progress in the country&#x27;s industrial and economic sector, while also heavily modernizing and industrialising the country. Among the notable achievements during his administration was starting the tourism industry which brought about an economic boom and placed the Maldives on the map as well as the construction of Hulhulé airport (now Velana International Airport), which is commonly regarded as the first airport in the Maldives, despite the existence of a previous airport in Addu called RAF Gan (Royal Air Force Station Gan) built by the British Empire during their protectorate of Maldives.

Some notable achievements during Nasir&#x27;s rule:
* Attaining political independence for the country on 26 July 1965.
* Securing membership at the United Nations on 21 September 1965, thus gaining worldwide recognition.
* Starting an English language intermediate education program (March 1961)
* Starting A-level education (1976)
* Initiating the Atoll Education Center project and opening the first center (Eydhafushi, 1977)
* Women permitted to vote in Maldives (1964)
* Starting nursing training (1963)
* Opening health centers in all atolls (starting with Naifaru, 1965)
* Opening the second modern hospital (October 1967), the first was built in RAF Gan (1957) in Addu of Southern Maldives by British Empire, which is now a dive center.
* Building the second airport (April 1966), the first one being RAF Gan in Addu of Southern Maldives built by British Empire which is now Gan International Airport.

* Starting the tourism industry (March 1972)
* First motorised fishing boat built (In Hulhule&#x27; boatyard, July 1964)
* Modernising the fisheries industry with mechanised vessels (engines became available for private fishing vessels; 1974)
* Felivaru fish canning factory opened (February 1978)
* Incorporating Maldives Shipping Limited (MSL; 1967)

On the 26th of July 2015, to mark 50 years of independence, Nasir was awarded the 50th Independence Day Shield of Honour (accepted by the Nasir family), in recognition of his contribution to achieving independence as well as development of the Maldives post independence.

Nasir&#x27;s hasty introduction of the Latin alphabet (Malé Latin) in 1976 instead of local Thaana script – reportedly to allow for the use of telex machines in the local administration – was widely criticised. Clarence Maloney, a Maldives-based U.S. anthropologist, lamented the inconsistencies of the &quot;Dhivehi Latin&quot; which ignored all previous linguistic research on the Maldivian language and did not follow the modern Standard Indic transliteration. At the time of the romanization every island&#x27;s officials were required to use only one script. The Thaana script was reinstated by President Gayoom shortly after he took power in 1978. However, Malé Latin continues to be widely used as the default romanization of Dhivehi.

== Havaru Thinadhoo rebellions and depopulation ==

During his tenure as Prime Minister of the Sultanate of Maldives, Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on Gan, because Nasir intended to cancel the Gan military agreement with the British. This group of islands consisting of Huvadu Atoll, Addu Atoll and Nasir&#x27;s home island Fuvahmulah, cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the United Suvadive Republic with Abdullah Afeef as president and Hithadhoo as its capital. The United Suvadive Republic had the backing of the British, however they changed their stance after Nasir sent gunboats from Malé, and Abdullah Afeef went into exile, which culminated in the controversial event of depopulation of Havaru Thinadhoo. This resulted in the forced evacuation of the island&#x27;s entire population and the subsequent destruction of their homes and property. The incident has been criticized as a violation of human rights and a crime against humanity. While others have praised Nasir for his leadership and decisive action in ending the separatist movement for good and restoring national unity. Nevertheless, his involvement in the Thinadhoo incident remains a source of controversy and criticism for Nasir. In 1960, Nasir renegotiated the agreement with the United Kingdom, which allowed them to continue the operation and use both the Gan and the Hithadhoo facilities for thirty years, but now the British were required to pay from 1960 to 1965 for the Maldives&#x27; economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces &#x27;East of Suez&#x27;.

==Post presidency==

Nasir was succeeded by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom who was then Minister of Transport and former permanent representative of the Maldives to the United States. The former president went into self-exile in Singapore on 7 December 1978 after resigning from his post. In 1981, Gayoom sentenced him to jail &quot;in absentia&quot; for alleged corruption charges and plotting a coup d&#x27;état; none of the allegations were proven and Nasir was pardoned.

Nasir was widely criticized during the Gayoom administration, especially during the early days of Gayoom&#x27;s presidency. There were massive rallies in almost all the big islands of Maldives with indecent cartoons of Nasir organized by Gayoom&#x27;s government, as well as cartoons of Nasir on the roads and in newspapers. Insulting anti-Nasir songs were recorded and distributed by the government, which were even played on national radio.

It is said that until Nasir left Malé, Gayoom praised and talked in favour of him (as in his first speech after being sworn in as president). However, after Nasir left Malé everything changed. Mass demonstrations were held against him, labeling him a traitor, and calling for his death. He was tried in &quot;absentia&quot; and sentenced. Gayoom led a massive demonstration against Nasir on 16 May 1980 and the &#x27;crowd&#x27; to which Gayoom spoke (between 15,000 and 20,000 people attended, with the population of Malé then being about 35,000) in which he discussed his views about how Nasir came to power, how he had been one of the leaders in the overthrow of first president Mohamed Amin in 1953 and how he had allegedly mishandled government money. However, the allegations against Nasir were never proven. Gayoom later pardoned him in July 1990, but never granted permission for him to return to Maldives. This point turned out to be proven according to an interview given by Kuvaa Mohamed Maniku, a close associate of Nasir to TVM on 23 November 2008, one day after Nasir&#x27;s death. Maniku said he met President Nasir at Bangkok Airport in 1990 after Nasir had been pardoned by the government, and Nasir had told Maniku he had sent a letter to President Gayoom requesting permission to return to Maldives and to live anywhere in the country approved by him. According to Maniku, Nasir had told him that he had not received a reply from Gayoom.

==Death==

On 22 November 2008, at the age of 82, Nasir died at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Though the cause of death is unknown, he had kidney problems which plagued him in the time before his death. Nasir&#x27;s body was flown to the Maldives, where his body was displayed in Theemuge, the presidential palace in Malé, on 23 November. The day was declared a national holiday in the Maldives, and tens of thousands of Maldivians flocked to see Nasir&#x27;s body. At the presidential palace, former President Mohamed Nasheed were among those who paid their respects to Nasir. His funeral prayer was led by Dr. Abdul Majeed Abdul Bari after the Fajr (dawn) prayers on Monday, 24 November 2008. After the funeral prayers, Nasir was laid to rest at dawn at the cemetery attached to the Friday Mosque (&quot;Hukuru Miskiy&quot;). Nasir was survived by three children, Ahmed Nasir, Ismail Nasir and Aishath Nasir, as well as his grandchildren Ibrahim Ahmed Nasir, Mohamed Nasir, Sameeh Ahmed Nasir and Samah Ahmed Nasir. His other two sons, Ali Nasir and Muhammad Nasir, had predeceased their father by several years.

<text>Joe 90 is a British science fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company, Century 21, for ITC Entertainment. It follows the exploits of nine-year-old schoolboy Joe McClaine, who becomes a spy after his adoptive father invents a device capable of recording expert knowledge and experience and transferring it to another human brain. Armed with the skills of the world&#x27;s top academic and military minds, Joe is recruited by the World Intelligence Network (WIN) as its &quot;Most Special Agent&quot;.

First broadcast on the ITV regional franchises between 1968 and 1969, the 30-episode series was the final Anderson production to be made primarily using Supermarionation, a form of electronic marionette puppetry. The following series, &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, included extensive footage of live actors. As in the preceding series, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, the puppets of &quot;Joe 90&quot; are of natural body proportions rather than the caricatured design used in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and its precursors.

Though not as successful as Century 21&#x27;s earlier productions, &quot;Joe 90&quot; has been praised for the characterisation of its main puppet cast and the quality of its scale model sets and special effects. Commentators have interpreted the spy-fi theme and use of a boy protagonist as both a &quot;kids-play-Bond&quot; concept and an enshrinement of children&#x27;s imagination. The series has drawn some criticism for its lack of female characters, especially compared to the Andersons&#x27; earlier series.

Century 21 produced tie-ins from comic strips to toy cars. The series was syndicated in the United States in 1969, repeated in the UK in the 1990s and released on DVD in the 2000s. A live-action film adaptation has been proposed more than once but remains undeveloped.

==Premise==
&quot;Joe 90&quot; is widely believed to be set in 2012 and 2013. The scriptwriters&#x27; guide stated that the year is 1998, while other sources place the series at an unspecified point in the early 21st century. The episode &quot;The Unorthodox Shepherd&quot; is implied to be set in 2013.

The series revolves around the eponymous Joe, a nine-year-old schoolboy and the adopted son of widowed computer expert Professor Ian &quot;Mac&quot; McClaine. Ostensibly an ordinary father-and-son pair, the McClaines live in an Elizabethan-style cottage on the Dorset coast. In the basement of the cottage is a secret laboratory containing Mac&#x27;s latest invention, the Brain Impulse Record And Transfer (referred to by the acronym &quot;BIG RAT&quot;): a machine capable of recording a person&#x27;s knowledge and experience and transferring it to the mind of another. The BIG RAT is centred around the &quot;Rat Trap&quot;: a spinning, spherical cage in which the pre-recorded &quot;brain patterns&quot; are uploaded to the recipient.

Sam Loover, a friend of Mac and an agent of the World Intelligence Network (WIN), recognises the potential of Joe and the BIG RAT and persuades the McClaines to pledge their services to the organisation. With the aid of the BIG RAT, Joe becomes a spy unlike any other: by taking on the brain patterns of expert adults, he gains the skills needed to undertake dangerous missions, while his youth helps him to avoid arousing enemy suspicion. As long as he wears a pair of special glasses, which contain electrodes that store the transferred brain patterns, he is able to carry out all manner of assignments – from piloting fighter aircraft to performing neurosurgery to playing the piano. Known as WIN&#x27;s &quot;Most Special Agent&quot;, Joe 90 reports to Shane Weston, the network&#x27;s commander-in-chief in London, and carries a specially-adapted school case featuring a secret compartment that contains a radio transceiver and high-capacity handgun. The series ends with a clip show episode set on Joe&#x27;s 10th birthday, in which a number of his missions are recalled as flashbacks during a surprise party.

Like earlier Supermarionation series, &quot;Joe 90&quot; features secret organisations, rescue missions, global security threats and advanced technology: the last exemplified by the &quot;Jet Air Car&quot;, a land-sea-air vehicle invented by Mac as the primary means of transport for him and Joe. Like the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP) in &quot;Stingray&quot;, the World Intelligence Network (WIN) is a global organisation referred to by an acronym. In the fictional world of &quot;Joe 90&quot;, the Cold War – significant when the series was first broadcast, due to the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia – has ended and a world government has been formed. WIN is the successor to MI6, the Central Intelligence Agency and the KGB, which all merged to form the new global spy network. Although the first episode sees Joe hi-jack a prototype Russian fighter and bring it to England, this is revealed to be a fiction imagined by Weston to explain the types of espionage that the boy will perform as a WIN agent. This plot twist, which also reveals that Russia and the West are now allies, has been praised by media historian Nicholas J. Cull for its &quot;progressiveness of spirit&quot; and for demonstrating Gerry Anderson&#x27;s wish to &quot;[take] an end to the Cold War as a given in his work&quot;. Cull states that Anderson was motivated by what he viewed as a &quot;duty to the rising generation to avoid perpetuating Cold War stereotypes&quot;.

However, despite the existence of a world government, the nations of Earth are still divided into Western and Eastern blocs. Here, Cull argues, &quot;Joe 90&quot; is similar to earlier Anderson series in that it &quot;unashamedly capitalised on the Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown&quot;. Hostile entities include the Eastern Alliance, which dominates Asia and appears in the episodes &quot;Attack of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Mission X-41&quot;. &quot;Arctic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Tiger&quot; combine the threat from the East with dangerous nuclear technology: in the former, Joe attempts to recover a lost atomic warhead from the ocean floor while avoiding enemy submarines; in the latter, he must destroy a nuclear device before it is launched into orbit to hold the world to ransom. In contrast, &quot;Big Fish&quot; portrays nuclear technology as a force for good: in this episode, Joe pilots a damaged nuclear submarine out of the territorial waters of a Latin American police state.

==Voice cast==
Compared to &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, &quot;Joe 90&quot; features a smaller cast of just five regular characters. Like the preceding series, it has been described as more &quot;English-sounding&quot; than &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the Andersons having dispensed with the idea that the main character should be a &quot;square-jawed, fair-skinned male with a Mid-Atlantic accent&quot;. Instead, &quot;Joe 90&quot; focuses on the strong American supporting characters of Sam Loover and Shane Weston.

* Len Jones as Joe McClaine. While child characters in earlier Supermarionation series had been voiced by grown actresses, Joe was voiced by a child actor to give the new series greater realism. Gerry Anderson commented that having a woman voice a boy &quot;always sounded rather odd to me. It never sounded like a real little boy ... With &quot;Joe 90&quot;, I suggested finding a British kid and making him repeat the lines parrot fashion.&quot; He described Jones&#x27; performance as &quot;only adequate, but at least it sounded authentic.&quot;
* Rupert Davies as Professor Ian &quot;Mac&quot; McClaine. At the time of production, Davies was well known for playing Maigret in the TV series of the same name, a role that had left him typecast. He was the most distinguished actor yet to contribute to an Anderson series. In Gerry Anderson&#x27;s biography &quot;What Made Thunderbirds Go!&quot;, Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn describe Mac&#x27;s &quot;warm yet distinguished&quot; English tones as a &quot;perfect counterpoint&quot; to Sam Loover and Shane Weston.
* Keith Alexander as Sam Loover. Alexander had previously voiced characters in &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; as a replacement for Ray Barrett. During the 1960s, he also provided the voice of another puppet character, Topo Gigio, on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the US.
* David Healy as Shane Weston. Healy, an American expatriate actor, had voiced guest characters in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and often played transatlantic characters in British television.
* Sylvia Anderson as Mrs Harris, the McClaines&#x27; housekeeper, who is unaware of their involvement with WIN. Anderson was best known for voicing Lady Penelope in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and its film sequels.

Supporting characters were voiced by Alexander, Healy and Anderson as well as returning voice actors Gary Files, Martin King, Jeremy Wilkin, Shane Rimmer and (for one episode, &quot;Viva Cordova&quot;) Liz Morgan. Rimmer and Morgan were not credited for their contributions. Files said that he was &quot;tickled pink&quot; to be working with Davies, commenting: &quot;I hated the way that so many so-called producers wouldn&#x27;t meet his eye. He was Maigret forever, you see, in their eyes.&quot; On her one role in &quot;Joe 90&quot;, Morgan said: &quot;They needed a voice, they called around and everyone else was out shopping. So they called me in.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Joe 90&quot; was intended to be a different kind of Supermarionation series, with the emphasis less on action, gadgetry and special effects and more on characterisation and plots that were more spy thriller than science fiction. According to Gerry Anderson, &quot;The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware.&quot;

When it came to devising the series, Anderson was inspired by his early work as an assistant editor on films such as &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945), for which he handled recording tape on a daily basis. While reflecting on the uses of the tape, Anderson made an association with the workings of the human brain: &quot;I read somewhere that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape.&quot; As to naming the main character, Anderson remembered that Steve Zodiac, the protagonist of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, was originally to have had the surname &quot;Ninety&quot;.

===Writing and filming===
The series was commissioned by Lew Grade in the autumn of 1967. Pre-production was completed in October while the last episodes of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; were being filmed. Principal photography ran from 13 November 1967 to mid-August 1968 on the two puppet stages at Century 21&#x27;s studios on the Slough Trading Estate. Each episode took an average of two weeks to film.

As with their earlier series, the Andersons wrote the first episode (&quot;The Most Special Agent&quot;). Before they devised WIN, Joe was to have become the &quot;Most Special Agent&quot; of the CIA. Most of the episodes were written by Tony Barwick, with Shane Rimmer contributing six scripts. Rimmer was hired while co-authoring a book with Barwick, who initially offered him a two-script contract. Those scripts were &quot;Splashdown&quot; and &quot;Big Fish&quot;.

Occupied by &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; and his live-action film &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, Gerry Anderson was unable to serve as producer as he had on &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. The role was assumed by Reg Hill and David Lane. Lane remembered that as producer he was responsible for &quot;looking at the scripts, the effects, the puppets, the whole thing really&quot;. He found support in Anderson&#x27;s long-serving collaborator Desmond Saunders, who directed the first episode and stayed on as production manager for the rest of the series. &quot;Joe 90&quot;″s other directors included Leo Eaton, Alan Perry and Ken Turner, all of whom had directed episodes of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, and Peter Anderson, who was promoted from assistant director to replace Brian Burgess and Robert Lynn.

A Christmas-themed episode, &quot;The Unorthodox Shepherd&quot;, featured location shooting to an extent that Century 21 had never attempted before. The following series, &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, advanced this hybrid format by combining puppet sequences with extensive footage of live actors.

===Production design===
The Supermarionation puppets of &quot;Joe 90&quot; were the naturally-proportioned kind that had been introduced for &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. The drive for increased realism in all design aspects that had begun with the preceding series continued in &quot;Joe 90&quot;. Except for Captains Scarlet and Blue, all of the main character puppets from &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; were re-used. Few new puppets were made, the only notable exceptions being Mac (who was sculpted on &quot;bouncing bomb&quot; designer Barnes Wallis), Joe and Mrs Harris.

Joe was the first child marionette to be made as part of the new generation of Supermarionation puppets. The puppets of Sam Loover and Shane Weston had each made several guest appearances in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. For their regular roles in &quot;Joe 90&quot; they were given a range of alternative &quot;mood&quot; heads, including &quot;smilers&quot;, &quot;frowners&quot; and &quot;blinkers&quot;. The Weston puppet was also re-wigged. Many of Century 21&#x27;s &quot;revamp puppets&quot;, which had played supporting characters in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, were copied in darker skin colours to portray a range of ethnicities. As two stages were being used for filming, the &quot;expressionless&quot; main character puppets were also duplicated. Like &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, &quot;Joe 90&quot; also featured &quot;under-control&quot; puppets that were manipulated by levers from under the set instead of wires from an overhead gantry.

In other production design areas, Keith Wilson and Grenville Nott succeeded Bob Bell as heads of the art department and built the inside of Culver Bay Cottage from a design by Mike Trim. Anderson remembered being pleased with the cottage set: &quot;The interior, with its beams and lovely soft furnishings, was really beautiful.&quot; The BIG RAT model was built by the newly-formed Century 21 Props (or Century 21 Electronics), which was based in Bourne End and was responsible for making the gadget props that appear in the series.

Though busy with &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; and &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, Derek Meddings briefly reprised his role as special effects director to construct Mac&#x27;s Jet Air Car. The vehicle was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented that it &quot;looked like no other piece of hardware we had had previously, but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped.&quot; Stephen La Rivière, author of &quot;Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future&quot;, considers the Jet Air Car an update of Supercar from the series of the same name. However, he agrees that while the car is &quot;Joe 90&quot;″s &quot;star vehicle&quot;, it is unimpressive compared to the &quot;beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor&quot;.

===Music===
The theme and incidental music were composed by Barry Gray. Episodes begin with either a cold open (a first for an Anderson series) or the title sequence, which sees Joe receiving a brain pattern from the BIG RAT. The opening theme is dominated by the notes of guitarist Vic Flick, known for performing lead guitar in the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; from the film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). In Gerry Anderson&#x27;s biography, &quot;What Made Thunderbirds Go!&quot;, the &quot;Joe 90&quot; theme is described as a &quot;dizzying piece of psychedelic pop art that could have been produced only in the late Sixties&quot;. The closing credits are superimposed over images of objects such as Joe&#x27;s spectacles and WIN badge. While the concepts for these images were photographic, the final versions were augmented with airbrush artwork.

Besides the music for the first episode, &quot;The Most Special Agent&quot;, Gray composed incidental music for a further 20 episodes. This music was recorded between 18 January and 27 September 1968, beginning with the titles and the first episode tracks in a session at the Olympic Sound Studios in London and ending with the music for &quot;See You Down There&quot; at CTS Studios. Recording was sometimes conducted at Gray&#x27;s house in Esher. Gray&#x27;s compositions occasionally required guest talent. The piano music in the episode &quot;International Concerto&quot; was performed by Robert Docker, while the child&#x27;s hands seen in the close-up shots of Joe playing belonged to Gray&#x27;s son, Simon. &quot;Lone-Handed 90&quot; features a recurring harmonica played by Tommy Reilly.

Silva Screen Records released a &quot;Joe 90&quot; soundtrack CD in 2006. Rating the CD three-and-a-half stars out of five, AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann comments that while the music is &quot;not great writing&quot; it remains &quot;perfectly adequate, if not inspired.&quot; Earlier releases include a 45 rpm gramophone record, &quot;Title Theme from the ATV Series Joe 90&quot;, which also featured various incidental music.


==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Joe 90&quot; debuted on ATV Midlands and Tyne Tees Television in late September 1968. Broadcasts on LWT, Southern Television and Anglia Television began shortly after. The series reached Harlech and Channel Television in November and Granada Television on Christmas Day. Granada, which started its run with the Christmas-themed &quot;The Unorthodox Shepherd&quot; rather than &quot;The Most Special Agent&quot;, was one of several broadcasters to transmit the series under the alternative title &quot;The Adventures of Joe 90&quot;. In the US, &quot;Joe 90&quot; aired in first-run syndication in 1969.

The series had several UK re-runs during the 1970s but was not shown on Yorkshire Television until 1981. Some broadcasters used an alternative version of the title sequence beginning with a zoom-in shot of Joe&#x27;s special glasses accompanied by a voice-over from Tim Turner stating: &quot;These are Joe 90&#x27;s special glasses. Without them, he&#x27;s a boy. Wearing them, he&#x27;s an expert.&quot; These words, intended to warn young viewers not to endanger themselves by copying Joe&#x27;s exploits, have sometimes been wrongly attributed to Keith Alexander.

In 1994, &quot;Joe 90&quot; was shown on BBC1 as part of the Children&#x27;s BBC strand. Rights holder PolyGram cleared the series for broadcast on the condition that the title sequence&#x27;s &quot;zooming&quot; &quot;Joe 90&quot; logo be replaced with a static version to distinguish it from the logo for G.I. Joe toys. The video tapes used for broadcast were 16 mm transfers of the original 35 mm film and were edited for timing reasons: cold opens were moved so that all episodes began with the title sequence, while the end titles were shrunk to allow a CBBC presenter to read out viewer birthday cards. A simultaneous run on Nickelodeon presented the episodes in their original forms. The series was shown several more times on the BBC until 1997. In 2009, the series aired on the UK Sci Fi Channel alongside &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;.

===Home media===
In the 1980s, Channel 5 (later PolyGram Video) released the series on home video in the UK. The eight-volume set featured the episodes &quot;The Most Special Agent&quot;, &quot;Splashdown&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Arctic Adventure&quot; in their re-edited forms from the 1981 compilation film &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Joe 90&quot;, which itself received three video releases in the 1980s. Re-released in 1992, the set used 16 mm prints of poorer quality than the original film.

In 2002, Carlton released a five-disc Region 2 DVD box set and a VHS box set of 5 tapes sourced from a digital remaster of the original 35 mm prints. This was followed by DVD Region 1 and Region 4 releases in 2003. A French-language release – &quot;Joe 90: Agent Très Spécial&quot; – hit the Canadian market in 2004. Through these releases, the episodes that make up the compilation film were made commercially available in their unedited forms for the first time.

==Reception==
Author John Peel questions Mac&#x27;s ethics in &quot;experimenting on&quot; Joe to further the development of the BIG RAT. On Joe as a secret agent he jokingly remarks &quot;presumably there are no child labour laws in the future!&quot; La Rivière&#x27;s attention is drawn to Mac&#x27;s line at the end of the first episode: the admonition &quot;Don&#x27;t come crying to me if you get hurt!&quot; demonstrates the professor&#x27;s willingness to &quot;abnegate all parental responsibility&quot;. Noting &quot;Joe 90&quot;″s subscription to &quot;wider themes in Cold War culture&quot;, Cull likens the BIG RAT&#x27;s capabilities to brainwashing but concludes that fundamentally it is &quot;benign&quot; technology. The stronger violence introduced in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; is sometimes evident in &quot;Joe 90&quot;: in &quot;Hi-jacked&quot;, Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in &quot;Project 90&quot;, Mac narrowly avoids having his head pulverised by a drill. Desmond Saunders comments: &quot;There was an unpleasant side to [the series] which I never really understood. There was something about it that was very strange and sinister.&quot;

Producer David Lane praises the series for its humour, contrasting this with the darker tone of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. He believes &quot;Joe 90&quot; to be considerably more family-friendly, summing it up as &quot;a great little programme&quot;. Anthony Clark of the British Film Institute commends &quot;Joe 90&quot; for including more effective characterisation than &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, also praising the writing and Barry Gray&#x27;s musical score. La Rivière highlights the connection between the boy protagonist and the theme of espionage, writing that the series&#x27; premise &quot;taps into the fantasy indulged by most boys that they, even at nine years old, can be James Bond.&quot; Writer John R. Cook agrees with La Rivière&#x27;s points on viewer self-identification, describing the series as &quot;wish-fulfilment fantasy&quot; and Joe as a reflection of the young target audience. Comparisons have been made to other media featuring child spies, such as the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; films and the &quot;Alex Rider&quot; novels.

La Rivière notes the intimacy of the premise and the predominantly male characters, suggesting that &quot;Joe 90&quot; is &quot;very much a &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own&quot; adventure.&quot; Of the 30 episodes, only ten feature female characters, a fact that La Rivière attributes to Century 21&#x27;s preoccupation with &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; and &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;. Peel suggests that the absence of female characters makes &quot;Joe 90&quot; inferior to &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Grouping &quot;Joe 90&quot; with &quot;Supercar&quot; and &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, Peel concludes that it is &quot;hardly coincidental that these tend to be the least loved of [Anderson&#x27;s] series; he had, after all, ignored half of his potential audience.&quot; He questions the comparisons to the &quot;James Bond&quot; films, arguing that &quot;being a somewhat nerdy kid with glasses and brain implants was not really thrilling.&quot;

Both Gerry Anderson and Cull suggest that the series, with its bespectacled protagonist, boosted the self-confidence of young viewers who wore glasses. The name &quot;Joe 90&quot; has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults who wear glasses similar to Joe&#x27;s, such as snooker player Dennis Taylor. During the 1990s, comparisons were made between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for his large glasses. Jeff Evans, author of &quot;The Penguin TV Companion&quot;, criticises the glasses as a plot device, writing that they make Joe &quot;look more like the class swot than a secret agent.&quot;

Cook reads further into the series&#x27; theme of child empowerment, writing that &quot;Joe 90&quot; creates a &quot;technological utopia&quot; around youth. He comments: &quot;Through the character of Joe, his brain hardwired at the start of each episode into the BIG RAT supercomputer, the young are shown to be literally at one with technology.&quot; Cook suggests that BIG RAT&#x27;s ability to provide Joe with instant access to brain patterns could be interpreted as a prediction of the development of the Internet. With his added knowledge and experience, Joe becomes the manifestation of &quot;homo superior&quot;, and yet his youth and imagination grant him the power to change the world in ways that no adult could. In this respect, Cook regards &quot;Joe 90&quot; as a forerunner of &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, another series featuring themes of transcendence in children. This concept, Cook suggests, is evident in the title &quot;Joe 90&quot; itself: &quot;No longer is [Joe] a nine-year-old boy but instead his status and capacities have been multiplied tenfold to transform him into agent &#x27;Joe 90&#x27;, his name an appealing futuristic echo of the then distant year of 1990.&quot;

Ultimately, &quot;Joe 90&quot; has proven to be less successful than earlier Anderson productions. The authors of &quot;Supermarionation Classics&quot; praise the writing and model work but add that the series &quot;failed to arouse more than a passing interest&quot; with some fans. Stephen Hulse refers to &quot;Joe 90&quot; as &quot;technically accomplished&quot; and &quot;clearly the most child-oriented&quot; of the Andersons&#x27; later puppet productions, but also calls it one of their &quot;lesser series&quot;.

The series&#x27; spy-fi theme was further developed in the following Supermarionation production, &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, which like &quot;Joe 90&quot; features an unconventional secret agent (a vicar – Father Stanley Unwin) and an intelligence agency with an acronym for a name (BISHOP – short for &quot;British Intelligence Service Headquarters, Operation Priest&quot;).

==Other media==
Series tie-ins included a Century 21 Toys range comprising friction-drive and battery-operated versions of the Jet Air Car and Sam Loover&#x27;s car. Also available were Joe&#x27;s WIN briefcase (complete with replica gadgets and pistol) and his WIN badge (reading &quot;Most Special Agent&quot;). The series was also given its own weekly comic, &quot;Joe 90 Top Secret&quot;, published by City Magazines, which ran for 34 issues and presented the TV episodes in strip form, while also including strips based on the TV shows &quot;The Champions&quot; and &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;. In September 1969, &quot;Joe 90 Top Secret&quot; merged with &quot;TV21&quot; (formerly &quot;TV Century 21&quot;) to form &quot;TV21 and Joe 90&quot;. After a further 36 issues, the &quot;Joe 90&quot; strips were dropped and the title reverted to &quot;TV21&quot;. Other print media included 1968 and 1969 &quot;Joe 90&quot; annuals by Century 21 Publishing/City Magazines as well as two short novels by May Fair Books: &quot;Joe 90 and the Raiders&quot; and &quot;Joe 90 in Revenge&quot;.

In 1981, the New York branch of ITC released a &quot;Joe 90&quot; compilation film, &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Joe 90&quot;, comprising the episodes &quot;The Most Special Agent&quot;, &quot;Splashdown&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Arctic Adventure&quot;. Intended to boost US syndication sales, the film was one of several Anderson anthologies to be released in the 1980s under the promotional banner &quot;Super Space Theater&quot;. &quot;The Most Special Agent&quot; was re-edited to remove its framing sequences, thus giving the impression that Joe&#x27;s theft of the MiG-242 is a real mission rather than a fiction. The British Board of Film Classification rated the film PG, though the episodes are individually rated U.

During the 1990s, &quot;Joe 90&quot; appeared as a comic strip in the &quot;Funday Times&quot;. Strips from the discontinued &quot;Joe 90 Top Secret&quot; were reprinted in a new publication, &quot;Joe 90&quot;, which was launched to tie in with the 1994 BBC repeats. After seven issues, this merged into Fleetway&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; comic.

In 2001, three &quot;Joe 90&quot;-themed &quot;trailers&quot; were filmed to accompany the BBC nostalgia series &quot;I Love The &#x27;90s&quot;. Each of these depicts Joe entering the BIG RAT and receiving the brain pattern of a 1990s household name, from Liam Gallagher to Vic Reeves to Garth (played by Dana Carvey) from the film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. The trailers are included as a special feature on the &quot;Joe 90&quot; Region 2 DVD box set.

===Unmade film===
By the 1980s, the rights to the ITC productions belonged to PolyGram Television. They were later sold to Carlton International and then Granada International, which merged with Carlton in 2004 to form ITV Global Entertainment, a division of ITV plc. In the 1990s, PolyGram proposed a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Joe 90&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that a film version was in the planning stages with Disney producing.

The film remains undeveloped. In 2005, while discussing obtaining remake rights from Granada, Anderson said: &quot;We have regular meetings and although they are very polite and very nice, nothing ever happens.&quot; He died in 2012.

<text>The E Queens Boulevard Express/Eighth Avenue Local is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is blue since it uses the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The E operates 24 hours a day between Jamaica Center–Parsons Boulevard–Archer Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, and the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan; limited rush hour service originates and terminates at 179th Street instead of Jamaica Center. Daytime service makes express stops in Queens and all stops in Manhattan; late night service makes all stops along the full route.

E service, which is one of the most heavily used services in the subway system, started in 1933 with the opening of the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In its early years, the E train ran along the Rutgers Street Tunnel and South Brooklyn Line to Brooklyn, though this service pattern stopped by 1940. Until 1976, the E train ran to Brooklyn and Queens via the IND Fulton Street Line and IND Rockaway Line during rush hours and to the World Trade Center at other times. The E&#x27;s northern terminal was switched from 179th Street to Jamaica Center with the opening of the IND Archer Avenue Line in 1988.

== History ==

=== Creation and extensions ===
E service began with the opening of the IND Queens Boulevard Line from 50th Street to Roosevelt Avenue on August 19, 1933, running between Roosevelt Avenue and Hudson Terminal (current World Trade Center station) on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. Because the IND Crosstown Line did not yet fully open, and as the IND Queens Boulevard Line had not yet opened to Jamaica, service ran via the Queens Boulevard Line&#x27;s local tracks. The E also ran local in Manhattan. Initially, weekday service ran every four minutes during rush hours, every five minutes middays, every six or eight minutes evenings, and every twelve minutes overnights. Service ran every four or five minutes during the Saturday morning rush hour, every five minutes during the morning and afternoon, and every six or eight minutes in the evening. On Sunday, E trains ran every six or seven minutes in the morning, every five minutes in the afternoon, and every six or eight minutes in the evening. Service was provided by three-car trains during rush hours and two-car trains at other times. By January 16, 1934, rush hour service was operating with three- or four-car trains.

E trains were extended to East Broadway following the opening of the IND Sixth Avenue Line from West Fourth Street on January 1, 1936. E trains no longer served stations on the Eighth Avenue Line south of West Fourth Street. On April 9 of the same year, the Sixth Avenue Line was extended through the Rutgers Street Tunnel to Jay Street–Borough Hall, and E trains were extended via this line and the IND South Brooklyn Line to Church Avenue, replacing the train, which was rerouted via the new IND Fulton Street Line to Rockaway Avenue. The E service was again extended with the opening of the Queens Boulevard Line extension to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike on December 31, 1936.

Express service along Queens Boulevard began on April 24, 1937, coinciding with the extension of the line and E service to 169th Street. Express service was inaugurated during rush hours, with E trains making express stops from 71st–Continental Avenues to Queens Plaza. The express service operated between approximately 6:30 and 10:30 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Express service was also provided on Saturdays between 6:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. During rush hours, GG trains were extended to Continental Avenue from Queens Plaza, taking over the local service. During non-rush hours, when GG service terminated at Queens Plaza, local service was provided by EE trains, which operated between 169th Street and Church Avenue in Brooklyn. The initial headway for express service was between three and five minutes. With the completion of the Crosstown Line on July 1, 1937, non-rush hour GG service was extended to 71st Avenue, allowing E trains to run express along Queens Boulevard west of 71st Avenue at all times. EE service was discontinued at this time. In addition, three southbound E trains began service at 71st Avenue between 8:07 and 8:28 a.m. during the morning rush hour. The headway between trains during the peak of rush hour was reduced to three minutes at this time.

On September 12, 1938, nine weekday rush hour trains began terminating at Jay Street between 7:45 and 8:30 a.m. Five of these trips originated at 169th Street, while the other four began service at Parsons Boulevard. Four northbound E trains entered service at Smith–Ninth Streets between 4:52 and 5:25 p.m. on weekdays. The additional service allowed for a peak two-minute headway for twelve minutes in the morning rush hour southbound. The 23rd Street–Ely Avenue station opened as an in-fill station on August 28, 1939, and was served by the E service during rush hours, and by the EE service during other times. Between April 1939 and October 1940, select evening E trains ran to and from the Horace Harding Boulevard terminal at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, terminating at Hudson Terminal in Manhattan. These trains operated to and from Chambers Street and ran between 8:24 p.m. and 1:29 a.m., when the fair closed for the night. Service ended following the fair.
On December 15, 1940, service on the entire Sixth Avenue Line began, and service patterns across the IND were modified. E service was cut back to Broadway–Lafayette Street, and service south of that station to Church Avenue was replaced by the new train along Sixth Avenue. The new F service supplemented E express along Queens Boulevard, and allowed for the introduction of express service along Queens Boulevard between 71st Avenue and Parsons Boulevard. F trains terminated at Parsons Boulevard instead of 169th Street to reduce congestion at the two stations. Starting January 10, 1944, some E trains began terminating at 71st Avenue after the weekday and Saturday morning rush hour, and some originated there during the evening rush hour. In addition, the headway of late night service was increased from twelve minutes to fifteen minutes.

In 1949, Saturday afternoon trains were cut back from eight cars to five cars. On October 24, 1949, the E was extended during weekday rush hours to Broadway–East New York, running local via the Fulton Street Line to allow A trains to run express. Several trains continued to terminate at 71st Avenue after the morning rush hour. At the same time, the headway between rush hour trains in the peak-direction was reduced from four minutes to three minutes. The Queens Boulevard Line&#x27;s extension to 179th Street opened on December 11, 1950, and E trains were extended from 169th Street to terminate there. In 1952, trains were lengthened from five-car trains to six-car trains on Saturday mornings, afternoons, and evenings.

On June 30, 1952, two morning rush hour trips on the E train were added, running between 71st Avenue and Jay Street. Midday service began operating on eight-minute headways instead of six-minute headways, evening service began operating on ten-minute headways instead of eight-minute headways, and late night service began operating on twenty-minute headways, instead of fifteen-minute headways. With the July 5, 1952 timetable, E trains began running every eight minutes during the morning and afternoon on Saturday, instead of every six minutes during the morning rush hour, and every seven minutes during the morning and afternoon. During late evenings, trains began running every twelve minutes instead of every eight minutes.

In 1953, the platforms were lengthened at 75th Avenue, Sutphin Boulevard, Spring Street, Canal Street, Ralph Avenue, and Broadway–East New York to to allow E and F trains to run eleven-car trains. The E and F began running eleven-car trains during rush hours on September 8, 1953. The extra train car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.

On October 30, 1954, the E service was modified as part of a series of service changes made following the completion of the Culver Ramp, which made it possible for IND service on the Culver Line to run to Coney Island. Non-rush hour E service was rerouted from Broadway–Lafayette Street to Hudson Terminal, and E trains began running express in Manhattan during rush hours, when they headed to Brooklyn. In 1955, late night trains were cut back from five-car trains to three-car trains, and midday and evening trains were lengthened from six-car trains to eight-car trains. A year later, late night trains were lengthened to operate with four-car trains instead of three-car trains.

=== Changes in Brooklyn service ===
On June 28, 1956, the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch reopened as the IND Rockaway Line after being converted for subway service, and E service was extended from East New York to Rockaway Park or Wavecrest (now Beach 25th Street) during weekday rush hours. During non-rush hours, service was provided by four-car shuttles between Euclid and Rockaway Park or Wavecrest. Three weekday E trains leaving 179th Street between 6:54 and 7:27 a.m. were cut at Euclid Avenue, with one half of the train running to Far Rockaway, and the other half going to Rockaway Park. After the end of the morning rush hour, several trains terminated at East New York, before going back into Manhattan-bound service before the afternoon rush hour.

On September 17, 1956, rush hour E service was cut back to Euclid Avenue when Rockaway service was replaced by the A train. The A and E later switched southern terminals again, and on September 8, 1958, the E began running to Far Rockaway and Rockaway Park during rush hours, with some trips terminating at Euclid Avenue. During weekday off-peak hours, separate shuttles operated from Euclid Avenue to Far Rockaway and Rockaway Park. At the same time, round-robin service began during weekend and late night service, because of the low ridership at these times. These trains would run from Euclid Avenue to Rockaway Park, and then reverse and run to Far Rockaway, before returning to Euclid Avenue.

The operation of eleven-car trains ended on August 18, 1958, because of operational difficulties. The signal blocks, especially in Manhattan, were too short to accommodate the longer trains, and the train operators had a very small margin of error to properly platform the train. It was found that operating ten-car trains allowed for two additional trains per hour to be scheduled. To make up for the loss of eleven-car trains, two short-run trains from 71st Avenue were added on the E and F during rush hours.

On October 11, 1958, round-robin service ceased operating on weekends, being by replaced by shuttles running from Euclid Avenue to either terminal in the Rockaways. Round-robin service continued to operate late evenings, late nights, and early mornings. From October to June, round-robin service started at 6:40 p.m. leaving Euclid Avenue, and from June to October the service began at 9:44 p.m. from Euclid Avenue.

Since many Rockaway riders were dissatisfied with having rush hour service provided by local trains, starting on November 3, 1958, four morning rush hour E trains ran express via the Fulton Street Line from Euclid Avenue: two from Rockaway Park, and two from Far Rockaway. To make up for the loss of local service along the Fulton Street Line, four A trains leaving Euclid Avenue between 7:56 a.m. and 8:24 a.m. began making local stops. All E trains began running express and all A trains began running local to Euclid Avenue on September 8, 1959. On June 6, 1960, three E trains started originating at Lefferts Boulevard in the morning rush hour and three E trains began terminating there in the evening rush hour, after complaints from riders. Shuttles between Euclid Avenue and the Rockaways, which had not been assigned a route designation, but often were signed as E trains, were labeled HH trains on February 1, 1962.

In 1964, E trains were cut back from five-car trains to four-car trains on Saturday late nights and to three-car trains on Sunday late nights. In addition, trains were lengthened from five cars to six cars on Sunday mornings, afternoons, and evenings. Two additional E trains began running from 169th Street during the morning rush hour on April 6, 1964; these trips began entering service at 179th Street on December 21, 1964. On July 11, 1966, midday service began running every ten minutes, instead of every eight, and evening service began running every twelve minutes, instead of every ten. At the same time, midday and evening trains began running with ten-car trains instead of eight-car trains, and late night trains were extended from four-car trains to five-car trains. Midday and evening shuttles between the Rockaways and Euclid Avenue were replaced by the A service on July 10, 1967.

In October 1969, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) performed a test over the course of a month to evaluate the impact that increasing the scheduled frequency of the E and F services along the Queens Boulevard Line in the southbound direction in the morning would have on running times and the number of trains that actually ran in service. As part of the test, 35 trains were scheduled to leave 179th Street during the morning peak hour, 17 E trains and 18 F trains. However, only 32 trains actually left the terminal, 15 E trains and 17 F trains. The study found that the average number of trains actually in service was 28 at Queens Plaza, 14 Es and 14 Fs, and 31 at 71st Avenue, 15 Es and 16 Fs, and that running such a high frequency of service was not possible without increasing running times and causing congestion.
Southbound E trains began stopping at the lower level of the 42nd Street station during rush hours on March 23, 1970, to reduce delays by relieving congestion on the station&#x27;s platforms. The frequency of weekend service was decreased on July 3, when trains started running every ten minutes on Saturdays and every twelve minutes on Sundays.

As part of systemwide changes in bus and subway service on January 2, 1973, the E became the local in Brooklyn again, running alternatively to Euclid Avenue and Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street on weekdays from 6:15 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3:35 p.m. to 6:15 p.m.. The span of express service in Manhattan and through service to Brooklyn and the Rockaways during rush hours was doubled. The E would no longer also serve Far Rockaway during rush hours, with this service provided by the A. During other times, except when Round-Robin service operated, E shuttle service would run from Broad Channel to Rockaway Park. A trains would run express instead in Brooklyn during rush hours, though for a longer period of time, and would take over service to Far Rockaway. These changes were initially supposed to take effect on September 11, 1972.

On January 19, 1976, rush hour service on the E was decreased. Northbound rush hour service began running every four or five minutes, instead of every four, and southbound evening rush hour service began running every four or six minutes, instead of every four. Finally, on August 30, 1976, E service in Brooklyn was eliminated with all trains terminating at World Trade Center. Brooklyn service was replaced by the CC local. On January 24, 1977, as part of a series of NYCTA service cuts to save $13 million, many subway lines began running shorter trains during middays. As part of the change, E trains began running with six cars between 9:50 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. On August 30, 1976, some E trains began terminating at 71st Avenue after the morning rush hour. Until 1986, two E trains and two F trains started at 71st Avenue in the morning rush hour with the intention to relieve congestion. These trains were eliminated because they resulted in a loading imbalance, as these lightly-loaded trains would be followed by extremely crowded trains from 179th Street, which followed an eight-minute gap of E and F service from 179th Street.

In 1986, the NYCTA studied which two services should serve the Queens Boulevard Line during late nights as ridership at this time did not justify three services. A public hearing was held in December 1986, and it was determined that having the E and R, which would replace the N, run during late nights provided the best service. On May 24, 1987, ten-minute frequencies on E during evenings were extended by an additional hour to 9 p.m.

=== Archer Avenue changes ===
On December 11, 1988, the Archer Avenue Lines opened, and E trains were rerouted via this branch, running to Jamaica Center via the Queens Boulevard Line&#x27;s express tracks. E trains began running express east of 71st Avenue, skipping 75th Avenue and Van Wyck Boulevard at all times, with local service to 179th Street replaced by the R, which was extended to 179th Street from 71st Avenue. The R extension allowed F trains to continue running express to 179th Street. It was decided to serve Archer Avenue with the E as opposed to the F to minimize disruption to passengers who continued to use Hillside Avenue, to maximize Jamaica Avenue ridership and the length of the peak ridership period, which is longer on the F. It was found that most riders using buses diverted to Archer Avenue used the E, while passengers on buses to 179th Street used the F. Having E trains run local between 71st Avenue and Van Wyck Boulevard was dismissed in order to provide 24 hour express service to the Archer Avenue Line.

Two service plans were identified prior to a public hearing on February 25, 1988, concerning the service plan for the new extension. The first would have split rush-hour E service between the two branches, with late night service to 179th Street provided by the R, while the second would have had all E trains run via Archer Avenue, and would have extended R locals to 179th Street. A modified version of the second plan was decided upon. The change in the plan was the operation of alternate E trains from 179th Street as expresses during the morning rush hour between 7:07 and 8:19 a.m. to provide an appropriate level of E service to Archer during the morning rush, to maintain the same level of service to 179th Street while providing express service, and to provide greater choice for riders at the Parsons Boulevard and 179th Street stations on Hillside Avenue. It was decided not to divert some E trains to 179th Street during the afternoon rush hour so that Queens-bound riders would not be confused about where their E train was headed.

The 1988 changes angered some riders because they resulted in the loss of direct Queens Boulevard Express service at local stations east of 71st Avenue (169th Street, Sutphin Boulevard, Van Wyck Boulevard and 75th Avenue stations). Local elected officials pressured the MTA to eliminate all-local service at these stations. As part of service cuts on September 30, 1990, the R was cut back to 71st Avenue outside of rush hours. Local service to 179th Street was replaced by F trains, which provided Queens Boulevard Express service during middays, evenings, and weekends, and local G service during late nights.

In May 1989, Sunday headways were reduced from twelve minutes to ten minutes. As part of the changes, on October 1, 1990, morning rush hour service from 179th Street was discontinued, and all E trains began running to Jamaica Center. In addition, the frequency of E service was reduced from 15 trains per hour to 12 trains per hour to allow the frequency of F service to be increased from 15 trains per hour to 20 trains per hour. The frequency of F service was subsequently reduced to running every minutes on April 15, 1991, before being increased back to minutes, or about 18 trains per hour, on October 26, 1992. On April 1, 1991, E trains were shortened to run with six-car trains between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. in order to increase passenger security during overnight hours.

In 1992, the MTA considered three options to improve service at the local stops east of 71st Avenue, including leaving service as is, having E trains run local east of 71st Avenue along with R service, and having F trains run local east of 71st Avenue replacing R service, which would be cut back to 71st Avenue at all times. The third option was chosen to be tested for six months starting in October or November 1992. The test started on October 26, 1992, and was implemented on a permanent basis six months later, eliminating express service along Hillside Avenue.

=== 63rd Street changes ===
On March 23, 1997, the E service began stopping at 75th Avenue and Briarwood during evenings, nights and weekends. On August 30, 1997, E service began running local in Queens during late nights in order to ease connections, reduce the need for late night transfers, and provide even service intervals. On the same date, late night G service was permanently cut back from 179th Street to Court Square, replaced by F service running local east of Queens Plaza, doubling late night service frequency at Queens Boulevard local stations. On September 8, 1998, E trains began running at a frequency of eight trains per hour middays, an increase from six trains per hour.

During the early part of 2000, because of the replacement of track switches at the World Trade Center station, the E was extended to Euclid Avenue at all times except late nights, when it operated to Canal Street. Service on the E was again affected by the September 11 attacks in 2001, as its terminal station, World Trade Center, was located at the northeastern corner of the World Trade Center site, so for a time, the E again operated to Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn as the local on the IND Fulton Street Line at all times except late nights, replacing the temporarily suspended service. On September 24, 2001, service was restored, and E service was cut back to Canal Street, since World Trade Center would be closed until January 28, 2002.

On December 16, 2001, the connection from the IND 63rd Street Line to the Queens Boulevard Line opened, and trains were rerouted via this connector to travel between Manhattan and Queens. E rush hour service was increased from 12 trains per hour to 15 trains per hour, and F service decreased from 18 trains per hour to 15 trains per hour to accommodate these trains. The additional E trains ran to 179th Street, running express along Hillside Avenue, due to a lack of capacity to handle additional trains at Jamaica Center. Four trains began at 179th Street in the morning rush hour, and three began there in the beginning of the evening rush hour, four rush hour E trains ran to 179th Street in the evening rush hour, and three morning rush hour reverse-peak trips terminated at Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike. In addition, the frequency of weekday evening service was increased, with trains running every ten minutes instead of every 12 minutes.

In 2002, the frequency of weekend E service was increased. Trains began running every eight minutes on Saturday mornings, instead of every ten minutes, and every ten or twelve minutes on Saturday evenings, instead of every twelve minutes. Sunday service was increased to run every ten or twelve minutes during the morning and evening, instead of every twelve or fifteen minutes, and trains began running every 8 or 10 minutes during afternoons, instead of every twelve minutes. On April 27, 2003, evening service was increased, with trains running at six-, eight-, and ten-minute headways, instead of twelve-minute headways. Midday, afternoon, and early evening service was increased to run every eight minutes on February 22, 2004. On September 16, 2019, the three trips that terminated at Kew Gardens were extended to 179th Street, making express stops along Hillside Avenue.

Between September 19 and November 2, 2020, E service was cut back to Jamaica–Van Wyck due to track replacement on the upper levels of the Jamaica Center and Sutphin Boulevard stations. During this time, a shuttle bus connected to Sutphin Boulevard and Jamaica Center. During the second phase, which started on November 2, 2020, a limited number of E trains ran to Jamaica Center, running express east of 71st Avenue during the day on weekdays and making local stops at other times. Service to 179th Street was expanded from weekday limited rush hour service to weekday daytime service; these trains made local stops east of 71st Avenue. This phase was completed in December 2020.

On March 17, 2023, New York City Transit made adjustments to evening and late night E, and service to accommodate long-term CBTC installation on the Queens Boulevard Line between Union Turnpike and 179th Street. E service originating from the World Trade Center began operating local in Queens two hours earlier on weekdays and Saturdays, after 9:30 pm instead of 11:30 pm, and one hour earlier on Sundays, after 9:30 pm instead of 10:30 pm. Starting on August 28, 2023, E service to 179th Street was temporarily suspended; this service change continued through the end of March 2024.

===EE service===

The EE originally ran as an Eighth Avenue local between 71st Avenue and Chambers Street during off peak hours when the did not run. This service was discontinued on July 1, 1937. However, the EE reappeared on November 27, 1967, when it ran between 71st–Continental Avenues and Whitehall Street via the local tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, replacing the . This service was discontinued on August 30, 1976, and replaced by the .
== Issues ==

=== Overcrowding ===
The E and F, the two Queens Boulevard express services, have historically been some of the most overcrowded routes in the entire subway system, and have more ridership than can be accommodated by existing capacity. Multiple efforts have been made to deal with the problem. In 1968, as part of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (MCTA)&#x27;s Program for Action plan to drastically expand the region&#x27;s transportation network, the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line was proposed to increase capacity between Queens and Manhattan and reduce overcrowding on Queens Boulevard express trains. This line would have served as a &quot;super-express&quot; bypass of the Queens Boulevard Line, paralleling the line by running along the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line, and making stops at Northern Boulevard, where a transfer would be available to Queens Plaza, and Woodside, before merging with the Queens Boulevard Line at 71st Avenue. The line would have provided additional express service to stations east of 71st Avenue, and was intended to divert passengers from the overcrowded E and F to the new line, which would have connected to the BMT Broadway Line and IND Sixth Avenue Lines in Manhattan via the new 63rd Street Lines. Since funding for the entire line dried up because of the 1975–1976 New York City fiscal crisis, the plan was scaled back to the construction of the 63rd Street Lines to a dead-end station at 21st Street–Queensbridge in Queens.

In 1990, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) elected to connect the 63rd Street Lines to the Queens Boulevard Line at 36th Street, with connections to both the local and express Queens Boulevard tracks. In 2001, the 63rd Street Connection was completed, allowing for an increase of nine trains per hour on the line between Queens and Manhattan through the introduction of V service. Express F trains, which had run via 53rd Street, were rerouted via the new connection, and were replaced by new local V trains. To further increase capacity, as part of the MTA&#x27;s 2010–2014 Capital Program the MTA is equipping the tracks from 50th Street/8th Avenue and 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike with communications-based train control, which would allow for three more trains during peak hours on the Queens Boulevard express tracks (it currently runs 29 tph). This would also increase capacity on the local tracks of the IND Queens Boulevard Line. With the installation of CBTC on the Eighth Avenue Line as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, and on the Archer Avenue Line as part of the 2020–2024 Capital Program, the E will become fully automated.

In October 2017, twenty five-car train sets assigned to the E service had seats at the end of the cars removed to provide extra capacity. The MTA expected that the removal of seats would allow each E train to carry up to 100 additional riders. Subsequent surveys found that the removal of seats improved passenger flow on trains, helping reduce dwell times in stations.

=== Homelessness ===
For several decades, the E has hosted a large population of homeless people and has been nicknamed the &quot;Homeless Express&quot;, according to a conductor interviewed by WNBC. It is the subway route that most homeless people sleep on since the route runs fully underground, sheltering people from the cold, and since the route has some of the system&#x27;s newer rolling stock. In addition, the route passes through major transit hubs that shelter the homeless, like Pennsylvania Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

== Route ==

=== Service pattern ===
E trains run between Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer on the Archer Avenue Line and World Trade Center on the Eighth Avenue Line at all times, running via the Queens Boulevard Line in Queens. E trains run local along the Eighth Avenue Line at all times. All trains run express in Queens between 71st Avenue and Queens Plaza at all times except late nights, when they make local stops. On weekends, weekday evenings, and late nights, E trains stop at 75th Avenue and Briarwood; limited AM-rush trains also make these stops in both directions. During rush hours, limited service runs to and from 179th Street, typically making express stops east of 71st Avenue, although select PM-rush trains to this terminal make local stops. Four E trips originate from 179th Street during the a.m. rush hour, three E trips originate from 179th Street during the p.m. rush hour, three E trips terminate at 179th Street during the a.m. rush hour, and four trips terminate at 179th Street during the p.m. rush hour.

E trains share tracks with F trains between the 75th Avenue and 36th Street interlockings during weekday rush hours and middays, and between the Van Wyck Boulevard and 36th Street interlockings on evenings, late nights and weekends. The shared segment with the F, during rush hours, receives the most scheduled service of any track segment in the system with 30 trains per hour, 15 on the E, and 15 on the F. The route shares tracks with M trains between Queens Plaza and Fifth Avenue–53rd Street, and with C or late-night A service from 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal to Canal Street.

The following table shows the lines used by the E service, with shaded boxes indicating the route at the specified times:
=== Stations ===

For a more detailed station listing, see the articles on the lines listed above.

=== Route bullet ===
The E is signed on trains, in stations, and on maps with a blue emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot; since it runs via the Eighth Avenue Line. The route was first color-coded in a light blue on November 26, 1967, when the NYCTA introduced its first set of colored service labels to coincide with the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. In June 1979, the route was given a darker blue bullet as part of the introduction of a new color-coding scheme based on subway trunk lines in Manhattan, done in connection with a redesign of the subway map.

<doc id="426996" wikidata="Q709002" url="?curid=426996" title="Theodore Parker">
<text>Theodore Parker (August 24, 1810 – May 10, 1860) was an American transcendentalist and reforming minister of the Unitarian church. A reformer and abolitionist, his words and popular quotations would later inspire speeches by Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr.

==Early life and education==
Parker was born in Lexington, Massachusetts, the youngest child in a large farming family. His paternal grandfather was John Parker, the leader of the Lexington militia at the Battle of Lexington. Among his colonial Yankee ancestors were Thomas Hastings, who came from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634, and Deacon Thomas Parker, who came from England in 1635 and was one of the founders of Reading.

Most of Theodore&#x27;s family had died by the time he was 27, probably due to tuberculosis. Out of eleven siblings, only five remained: three brothers, including Theodore, and two sisters. His mother, to whom he was emotionally close, died when he was eleven. He responded to these tragedies by refusing to lapse into what he called &quot;the valley of tears&quot;, focusing instead on other events and demands, and by affirming &quot;the immortality of the soul&quot;, later a benchmark of his theology.

Descriptions of Parker as a teenager recall him as &quot;raw&quot; and rough, emotional and poetic, sincere, &quot;arch&quot;, &quot;roguish&quot;, volatile, witty, and quick. He excelled at academics and gained an early education through country schools and personal study. He studied long and late when farm chores allowed, teaching himself math, Latin, and other subjects. At seventeen he began teaching in local schools. He continued teaching himself and private students in advanced and specialized subjects. He learned Hebrew from Joshua Seixas (son of Gershom Mendes Seixas and Hannah Manuel), whom he may have baptized in a covert conversion to Christianity. He also studied for a time under Convers Francis, who later preached at Parker&#x27;s ordination.
In 1830, at age 19, Parker walked the ten miles from Lexington to Cambridge to apply to Harvard College. He was accepted but could not pay the tuition, so he lived and studied at home, continued to work on his father&#x27;s farm, and joined his classmates only for exams. Under that program, he was able to complete three years of study in one. He then took various posts as a teacher, conducting an academy from 1831 to 1834 at Watertown, Massachusetts, where his late mother&#x27;s family lived. At Watertown, he met his future wife, Lydia Dodge Cabot. He announced their engagement to his father in October, 1833. Theodore and Lydia were married four years later on April 20, 1837.

While at Watertown, Parker produced his first significant manuscript, &quot;The History of the Jews&quot;, which outlined his skepticism of biblical miracles and an otherwise liberal approach to the Bible. These were to be themes throughout his career.

Parker considered a career in law, but his strong faith led him to theology. He entered the Harvard Divinity School in 1834. He specialized in the study of German theology and was drawn to the ideas of Coleridge, Carlyle, and Emerson. He wrote and spoke (with varying degrees of fluency) Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and German. His journal and letters show that he was acquainted with many other languages, including Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Coptic and Ethiopic. He completed the divinity school program quickly, in 1836, in order to marry and begin preaching without delay.

==Career==
Parker called the late 1830s a &quot;period of…disappointment&quot;. Citing &quot;home; children; &amp; a good professional sphere,&quot; he wrote in his journal that &quot;All fail me, &amp; all equally.&quot; Increasing controversies in his career culminated in a break with orthodoxy in the early 1840s. The fallout from these events affected him deeply, and it took him a few years to land on his feet and move forward.

===First pastorate===
Parker had spent 1836 visiting pulpits in the Boston area, but for family reasons accepted a pastorate at West Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1837. At first, he found the location less than stimulating and work constraining. He adapted to pastoral life, however, and preached in many pulpits around Boston as a visitor. He gained a wide reputation as an earnest, effective speaker. In 1840 Harvard awarded him an honorary master&#x27;s degree on the basis of his extensive learning.

Parker delivered one especially popular sermon twenty-five times between 1838 and 1841. In it, he argued against the popular notion that religion could be reduced to morality. &quot;The principle of morality is obedience to the Law of con[science],&quot; he wrote, while religion required more: that we &quot;feel naturally, allegiance to a superior Being: dependence on him &amp; accountability to him.&quot; The theme of dependence echoes Schleiermacher, an indication of the German influence on his theology. Morality involves right acting, while religion requires love of God and regular prayer, which Parker considered essential to human life. &quot;No feeling is more deeply planted in human nature than the tendency to adore a superior being,&quot; he preached, &quot;to reverence him, to bow before him, to feel his presence, to pray to him for aid in times of need&quot; and &quot;to bless him when the heart is full of joy.&quot;

===Transcendentalism===
In 1837, Parker had begun attending meetings of the group later known as the Transcendental Club. Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s Divinity School Address that year had been deeply arresting to him, and he welcomed the opportunity to associate with Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, and several others. Transcendentalists such as Henry David Thoreau and Parker wrote of the world as divine, and of themselves as part of this divinity. Unlike Emerson and other Transcendentalists, however, Parker believed the movement was rooted in deeply religious ideas and did not believe it should retreat from religion. All shared a conviction that slavery should be abolished and social reforms should take root.

Parker gradually introduced Transcendentalist ideas into his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. &quot;I preach abundant heresies,&quot; he wrote to a friend, &quot;and they all go down—for the listeners do not know how heretical they are.&quot; For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing &quot;some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.&#x27;&quot; He was hardly alone. &quot;&#x27;What shall we do with the Old Testament?&#x27; asked fellow Unitarian James Walker in 1838. &#x27;That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome.&quot; Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1838 Parker published his first major article, a critical review of an orthodox work written by his former professor John Gorham Palfrey. In it Parker broke for the first time with supernatural realism, as he also increasingly did in his sermons. To him, Christianity was natural rather than miraculous. More and more, he praised social reform movements such as those for temperance, peace, and the abolition of slavery. In 1840 he described such movements as divinely inspired, though he added that they did not fully address the spiritual and intellectual ills of society. Controversy mounted regarding these and other Transcendentalist elements in his work. So did criticism, which often saddened and distressed him.

===Break with Orthodoxy===
In 1841, Parker laid bare his radical theological position in a sermon titled &quot;A Discourse on the Transient and Permanent in Christianity&quot;, in which he espoused his belief that the traditions of historic Christianity did not reflect the truth. In so doing, he made an open break with orthodox theology. He instead argued for a type of Christian belief and worship in which the essence of Jesus&#x27;s teachings remained permanent but the words, traditions, and other forms of their conveyance did not. He stressed the immediacy of God and saw the Church as a communion, looking upon Christ as the supreme expression of God. Ultimately, he rejected all miracles and revelation and saw the Bible as full of contradictions and mistakes. He retained his faith in God but suggested that people experience God intuitively and personally, and that they should center their religious beliefs on individual experience.

Parker&#x27;s West Roxbury church remained loyal. Sermons and media attacked him, however, when he denied Biblical miracles and the literal authority of the Bible and Jesus. Many questioned his Christianity. Nearly all the pulpits in the Boston area were closed to him, and he lost friends. Parker reacted with grief and defiance. He remained unwilling to concede that his views placed him beyond the outer bounds of Unitarian liberalism. After this unwilling break with the Unitarian establishment, he spent two years (1841–1843) adjusting to the reality of his newly controversial and independent career and increasing his social activism on religious grounds. He began to see himself as a prophetic religious reformer.

==Personal life==
Parker and Lydia Cabot married in 1837, but the union was rocky from the start. In 1840 he befriended a neighbor, Anna Blake Shaw. Although their relationship was by all accounts not sexual, it caused problems with his wife.

== Mature home life and career, 1843–1859 ==
Parker&#x27;s family life, temperament, and work steadied during the 1840s. The second half of his career revolved around antislavery, democracy, and religious social activism.

===Travel to Europe===
In 1843 and 1844, Theodore and Lydia traveled in Europe. While there his theology, career, and personal life matured and steadied. He was no longer as sensitive to criticism and bore difficulties more easily. Away from extended family problems in West Roxbury, his marriage seems to have improved and become more steadily affectionate. Despite complex issues that occasionally resurfaced, he and Lydia were happier. &quot;My wife is kind as an angel,&quot; he would write in his journal during denominational trials in 1845. His travels also seemed to stimulate a growing interest in political and social issues.

===Independent Boston pastorate===
Returning to the United States, Parker found Unitarianism on the cusp of a division over his right to fellowship as a minister. His controversial 1841 sermon had created a stir that ballooned into an all-out storm in 1844 at the Church of the Disciples. The debate over the nature and degree of Parker&#x27;s &quot;infidelity&quot; caused Unitarians to adopt a liberal creed, which they had formerly declined to do based on an inclusive principle. Their position proved too orthodox to include Parker.

In January, 1845, a sizeable group of supporters gathered at Marlboro Chapel in Boston and resolved to provide Parker &quot;a chance to be heard in Boston.&quot; Calling themselves &quot;Friends of Theodore Parker,&quot; they hired a hall and invited him to preach there on Sunday mornings. Despite misgivings, Parker accepted and preached his first sermon at the Melodeon (Boston, Massachusetts) Theater in February. Although the arrangement was temporary at first, he resigned his West Roxbury pastorate in early 1846 (to the dismay of his faithful parishioners there). He elected to call his new congregation the 28th Congregational Society of Boston; after the Melodeon, Parker&#x27;s congregation met in the Boston Music Hall on Winter Street, Boston.

Parker&#x27;s congregation grew to 2,000 and included influential figures such as Louisa May Alcott, William Lloyd Garrison, Julia Ward Howe (a personal friend), and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Stanton called his sermons &quot;soul-satisfying&quot; when beginning her career, and she credited him with introducing her to the idea of a Heavenly Mother in the Trinity. Parker was increasingly known for preaching what he and his followers identified as a type of prophetic Christian social activism.

The 28th Congregational Society, now renamed Theodore Parker Unitarian Church, located on 1851 Centre Street in West Roxbury was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1985.

===Reform movements and social theology===
After 1846, Parker shifted from a focus on Transcendentalism and challenging the bounds of Unitarian theology to a focus on the gathering national divisions over slavery and the challenges of democracy. In Boston, he led the movement to combat the stricter Fugitive Slave Act, a controversial part of the Compromise of 1850. This act required law enforcement and citizens of all states—free states as well as slave states—to assist in recovering fugitive slaves. Parker called the law &quot;a hateful statute of kidnappers&quot; and helped organize open resistance to it. He and his followers formed the Boston Vigilance Committee, which refused to assist with the recovery of fugitive slaves and helped hide them. For example, they smuggled away Ellen and William Craft when Georgian slave catchers came to Boston to arrest them. Due to such efforts, from 1850 to the onset of the American Civil War in 1861, only twice were slaves captured in Boston and transported back to the South. On both occasions, Bostonians combatted the actions with mass protests.

As Parker&#x27;s early biographer John White Chadwick wrote, Parker was involved with almost all of the reform movements of the time: &quot;peace, temperance, education, the condition of women, penal legislation, prison discipline, the moral and mental destitution of the rich, the physical destitution of the poor&quot; though none became &quot;a dominant factor in his experience&quot; with the exception of his antislavery views. He &quot;denounced the Mexican War and called on his fellow Bostonians in 1847 &#x27;to protest against this most infamous war,&#x27;&quot; while at the same time promoting economic expansionism and exposing a racist view of Mexicans&#x27; inherent inferiority, calling them &quot;a wretched people; wretched in their origin,
history, and character&quot;.

Yet his abolitionism became his most controversial stance. He wrote the scathing &quot;To a Southern Slaveholder&quot; in 1848, as the abolition crisis was heating up, and took a strong stance against slavery and advocated violating the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, a controversial part of the Compromise of 1850 which required the return of escaped slaves to their owners. Parker worked with many fugitive slaves, some of whom were among his congregation. As in the case of William and Ellen Craft, he hid them in his home. Although he was indicted for his actions, he was never convicted.

As a member of the Secret Six, he supported financially the abolitionist John Brown, whom many consider a terrorist. After Brown&#x27;s arrest, Parker wrote a public letter, &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Expedition Reviewed&quot;, arguing for the right of slaves to kill their masters and defending Brown&#x27;s actions.

==Death==
Following a lifetime of overwork, Parker&#x27;s ill health forced his retirement in 1859. He developed tuberculosis, then without effective treatment, and departed for Florence, Italy, where he died on May 10, 1860. He sought refuge in Florence because of his friendship with Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, Isa Blagden and Frances Power Cobbe, but died scarcely a month following his arrival. It was less than a year before the outbreak of the American Civil War.

Parker was a patient of William Wesselhoeft, who practiced homeopathy. Wesselhoeft gave the oration at Parker&#x27;s funeral. He is buried in the English Cemetery in Florence. When Frederick Douglass visited Florence, he went first from the railroad station to Parker&#x27;s tomb.

Parker&#x27;s headstone by Joel Tanner Hart was later replaced by one by William Wetmore Story. The British writer Fanny Trollope, also buried here, wrote the first anti-slavery novel and Richard Hildreth wrote the second. Both books were used by Harriet Beecher Stowe for her antislavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852).

<doc id="426998" wikidata="Q1345631" url="?curid=426998" title="Tim Horton">
<text>Miles Gilbert &quot;Tim&quot; Horton (January 12, 1930 – February 21, 1974) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played 24 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent the majority of his career playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs, later playing with the New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Buffalo Sabres. In 2017, Horton was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. He died at age 44 following a single-vehicle crash in which drugs and alcohol were involved.

A successful businessman, Horton co-founded the Tim Hortons restaurant chain.

==Early life==
Horton was born in Cochrane, Ontario, at Lady Minto Hospital, to Aaron Oakley Horton, a Canadian National Railway mechanic, and Ethel May (née Irish). His father christened him Miles Gilbert after his two grandfathers, but he came to be known exclusively as Tim, the name his mother had wanted to give him. He had one brother, Jerry Horton.

The family moved in 1935 to Duparquet, Quebec, returning to Ontario in 1938 to Cochrane; the family moved to Sudbury in 1945.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Horton grew up playing ice hockey in Cochrane, and later in a mining community near Timmins. The Toronto Maple Leafs organization signed him in 1948; he moved to Toronto to play junior hockey and attended St. Michael&#x27;s College School.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Two years later, he turned pro with the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; farm team, the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League. He spent most of the first three seasons with Pittsburgh, playing in his first NHL game on March 26, 1950. Horton appeared in the NHL again in the fall of 1952. He remained a Leaf until 1970, winning four Stanley Cups. Horton later played for the New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres. He was known for his extreme strength and calmness under pressure. As a hard-working and durable defenceman, he gained relatively few penalty minutes for an enforcer-type defenceman. He was also an effective puck carrier – in 1964–65 he played right wing for the Leafs. Horton appeared in seven National Hockey League All-Star Games. He was named an NHL first team All-Star three times: (1964, 1968, and 1969). He was selected to the NHL Second Team three times: (1954, 1963, 1967).

Between February 11, 1961, and February 4, 1968, Horton appeared in 486 consecutive regular season games; this remains the Leafs club record for consecutive games and was the NHL record for consecutive games by a defenceman until broken by Kārlis Skrastiņš on February 8, 2007.

Horton had a reputation for enveloping players fighting him in a crushing bear hug.

While playing, Horton was generally acknowledged as the strongest man in the game; injuries and age were little more than minor inconveniences. Chicago Black Hawks left wing Bobby Hull declared, &quot;There were defencemen you had to fear because they were vicious and would slam you into the boards from behind, for one, Eddie Shore. But you respected Tim Horton because he didn&#x27;t need &quot;that&quot; type of intimidation. He used his tremendous strength and talent to keep you in check.&quot;

In 1962, he scored three goals and 13 assists in 12 playoff games, setting a Leafs team record for playoff points by a defenceman. This record was tied in 1978 by Ian Turnbull (who played 13 games), but was not broken until 1994, when David Ellett registered 18 points (albeit in 18 games).

===Post-Toronto years===

In March 1970, the Maple Leafs traded Horton to the New York Rangers for future considerations; he spent the last fifteen games of the season in New York and all of the following as well. At the beginning of the 1971–72 season, he was claimed by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the intra-league draft and, at age 41, signed a one-year contract for an estimated $100,000, the largest contract at the time for the five-year-old franchise. With a broken ankle and a shoulder separation, Horton only played 44 games for the Penguins and managed just 11 points.

In spite of Horton&#x27;s age, 42, and considerable nearsightedness, Punch Imlach of the Buffalo Sabres, who was also the former Leafs&#x27; general manager, acquired Horton in the intra-league draft and signed him in 1972. In 1973, his performance assisted the Sabres in their first playoff appearance. Horton later signed a contract extension in the off-season.

While playing for the Leafs, Horton wore the number 7, the same number worn by King Clancy from 1930 to 1937. The team declared both Horton and Clancy honoured players at a ceremony on November 21, 1995, but did not retire the number 7 from team use; despite this, it became an honoured jersey number, abiding by Leafs honours policy. In 2016, the Leafs changed their retirement policy and, on October 15, retired the number 7 in honour of both Horton and Clancy.

Horton wore number 2 in Buffalo (as Rick Martin already had the number 7). Both numbers have since been retired.

==Career statistics==
===Regular season and playoffs===
==Donut industries==

In 1964, Horton opened his first Tim Horton Donut Shop in Hamilton, Ontario on Ottawa Street. He added a few of his culinary creations to the initial menu. By 1968, Tim Horton had become a multi-million dollar franchise system. Horton&#x27;s previous business ventures included both a hamburger restaurant and Studebaker auto dealership in Toronto.

Upon Horton&#x27;s death in 1974, his business partner Ron Joyce bought out the Horton family&#x27;s shares for $1 million and took over as sole owner of the existing chain, which had 40 stores at the time, and later expanded to nearly 4,600 stores in Canada alone by 2013. Today, Tim Hortons is a flagship of Restaurant Brands International, a conglomerate that includes Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Firehouse Subs.

Joyce&#x27;s son, Ron Joyce Jr., is married to Horton&#x27;s eldest daughter, Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce; until 2023, the couple owned a Tim Hortons franchises in Cobourg, Ontario.

==Death and aftermath==
Horton died after losing control of his De Tomaso Pantera sports car on the Queen Elizabeth Way in St. Catharines, Ontario, in the early morning of February 21, 1974. He had played a game in Toronto the previous evening against his former team, the Maple Leafs, and was driving alone back to Buffalo, south. The Sabres had lost the game, and despite sitting out the third period and playing with a jaw and ankle injury, Horton was selected one of the game&#x27;s three stars.

Horton&#x27;s Pantera had been given to him by Sabres&#x27; general manager Imlach as an enticement to return to the team for one more season.

On his drive to Buffalo, Horton stopped at his office in Oakville, and was met there by Ron Joyce. While there, Horton phoned his brother Gerry, who recognized that Tim had been drinking and tried to persuade him not to continue driving. Joyce also offered to have Horton stay with him. Horton chose to continue his drive to Buffalo.

After 4:00 a.m. EST (9:00 UTC), a woman reported to the Ontario Provincial Police in Burlington that she had observed a car travelling at high speed on the Queen Elizabeth Way. A warning was broadcast over police radio. Thirty minutes later, Officer Mike Gula observed a speeding vehicle travelling Niagara-bound on the Queen Elizabeth Way in Vineland. Gula activated his siren and attempted to pursue Horton&#x27;s vehicle, but lost sight of it.

Horton passed a curve in the road at Ontario Street and was approaching the Lake Street exit in St. Catharines when he lost control and drove into the centre grass median, where his tire caught a recessed sewer which caused the car to flip several times before it came to a stop on its roof in the Toronto-bound lanes. Not wearing a seatbelt, Horton was found from the car. He was pronounced dead at St. Catharines General Hospital.

Subsequent to Horton&#x27;s death, there was no official public inquiry, and his autopsy was not made public. Police would not state whether Horton was intoxicated. In 2005, Horton&#x27;s autopsy was made public (with witness statements redacted), and revealed that Horton&#x27;s blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, and that a half-filled vodka bottle was amongst the crash debris. Horton was also in possession of the drugs Dexedrine, a stimulant, and Dexamyl, a stimulant-sedative; traces of amobarbital, an ingredient in Dexamyl, were found in his blood. The autopsy report found no painkillers in Horton&#x27;s body, and also concluded that his car had been in good working order. There was nothing to suggest Horton was evading police, or that police were near enough to initiate a criminal pursuit. Horton was interred at York Cemetery, Toronto.

Following Horton&#x27;s death, Ron Joyce offered Horton&#x27;s widow Lori $1 million for her shares in the chain, which included 40 stores. She accepted his offer and Joyce became sole owner. Years later, Lori became dissatisfied with Joyce&#x27;s offer, and filed a lawsuit against him. In 1993, Lori lost the lawsuit; an appeal was declined in 1995. She died in 2000 at age 68.

== Personal life ==
Married in 1952, Horton was survived by his wife, the former Lori Michalek of Pittsburgh, and four daughters. Horton was a Freemason, belonging to Kroy Lodge No. 676 in Thornhill, Ontario.

<text>Chameli () is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Sudhir Mishra. The story revolves around a prostitute and an investment banker spending a night together. It stars Kareena Kapoor and Rahul Bose. This was Rinke Khanna&#x27;s final film before her retirement after marriage.

The film was remade as &quot;Jabilamma&quot; (2008) in Telugu with Navneet Kaur and Rajeev Kanakala.

== Plot ==
Aman Kapoor is a wealthy investment banker, whose pregnant wife, Neha was killed in a car accident more than a decade ago. The incident left him depressed and lonely. Forced to engage in social events, he reluctantly hosts a party. The stormy weather puts Aman in a pensive mood, and he decides to go home. While driving, his car breaks down on a flooded road and his phone battery dies. He takes refuge in an alleyway where he meets Chameli, a street-smart prostitute, with the story taking place all in the course of one dark rainy stormy night. 

Chameli offers Aman a match for his cigarette, and he is initially repulsed by her after she propositions him. Aman&#x27;s presence scares off a potential customer, and he offers to pay for her missed wages, which Chameli declines. Soon, two police officers arrive, looking for their bribe. They begin to manhandle Chameli, which aggravates Aman, who is then intimidated by the officers. Chameli defuses the situation, and Aman&#x27;s attitude towards her softens after the pair begin a conversation about their lives. The discussion is interrupted by Johnny, a young boy selling coffee and cigarettes. Chameli is familiar with him, paying his school fees and looking after his health. He promises to come back with a mechanic to fix Aman&#x27;s car. Chameli then attends to Raja, an unstable young man who has stolen Rs 50,000 from his father. Raja is in love with Haseena, and is convinced that she has run off to become a prostitute. Chameli consoles and advises him, and then takes him away. Haseena, a trans woman, arrives and playfully propositions Aman. Chameli returns and advises Haseena to run away with Raja to another city with the money. Raja&#x27;s homophobic father turns up to look for them, but he leaves when he realises they are not there. Each incident further develops the friendship between Chameli and Aman.

Chameli&#x27;s pimp, Usman, has rented her out to Naik, a brutish local politician who has a reputation for injuring prostitutes and is also carrying an STD (sexually transmitted disease), hence Chameli does not want to go to him, as she does not want to contract an STD like a fellow prostitute that she knows. Naik&#x27;s henchmen seek Chameli out, and the pair manages to escape and go to a local bar to talk to Usman. Chameli reveals that she cannot free herself from her pimp because she still owes him money which she borrowed. At the bar, Aman offers to pay off Chameli&#x27;s debt in exchange for her not having to entertain Naik. At the ATM Usman demands more money, threatening Aman with a knife, and the pimp is stabbed in the ensuing scuffle. Aman and Chameli are picked up by the police, and his temperament causes him to be placed in a holding cell. Chameli convinces the officers to allow Aman to make a call, and he speaks to a friend who has connections with the Assistant Commissioner of Police K.P. Singh. Singh listens to Aman&#x27;s story and decides to withdraw the police protection over Usman, who became an informant after being arrested. Chameli tells Aman that the withdrawal of protection means that Usman and his family are now vulnerable to being killed by other, more dangerous criminals. Singh reluctantly agrees to continue protecting Usman. At the hospital, Singh forces Usman to call Naik, and the ACP threatens him, eventually convincing Naik to leave Chameli alone.

As they leave the hospital, Chameli playfully teases Aman about how his wife will react to the situation. Aman breaks down and tells her about the accident, adding that it is his fault that she died since he chose to drive in heavy rains. As dawn breaks, Aman finally returns home, a changed man. The highly eventful night has altered his outlook on life and allowed him to come to terms with his loss. He reconnects with his father-in-law, whom he had avoided since his wife&#x27;s death. After some time, he returns to see and meet Chameli again.

== Production ==
&quot;Chameli&quot; was first offered to actress Amisha Patel, who then refused to do the film and said the role of a prostitute won&#x27;t match her character. The role then went to Kareena Kapoor, which marked a turning point in her career. The film began production in August 2003. The director of the film, Anant Balani, died on 28 August 2003. The film was almost shelved when Pritish Nandy called Sudhir Mishra to direct the film. Mishra completed the film with a different script.

== Soundtrack ==
The songs are composed by Sandesh Shandilya and lyrics are penned by Irshad Kamil and Prof. R. N. Dubey.

== Reception ==
Anupama Chopra wrote that &quot;, he [Sudhir Mishra] takes the late director Anant Balani&#x27;s idea of a one-night encounter between a prostitute and an investment banker and creates a poignant portrait of urban lives. Taran Adarsh wrote that &quot;On the whole, &quot;CHAMELI&quot; does not deliver. At the box-office, the film caters to a niche audience but in view of the fact that the film lacks a solid script to keep the viewer hooked, even that segment of viewers may not take to it whole-heartedly&quot;. Saumya Roy of &quot;Outlook&quot; wrote that &quot;There is a good vibe between Bose and Kareena that makes the movie watchable&quot;. Chinmayee Manjunath from &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; opined, &quot;But be warned — high expectations will be shattered&quot;.

<text>The Detroit Auto Show, formerly known as the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), is an annual auto show held in Detroit, Michigan. Hosted at Huntington Place (formerly Cobo Center) since 1965, it is among the largest auto shows in North America, and is widely regarded as one of the automotive industry&#x27;s most important events.

The show is organized by the Detroit Auto Dealers Association (DADA), and has been held annually in January for much of its recent history. It is usually open to the general public for 1–2 weeks, preceded by previews for industry employees and media, and a black-tie &quot;charity preview&quot; fundraiser for local children&#x27;s charities.

==History==
In 1899, William E. Metzger helped organize the Detroit Auto Show, only the second of its kind, after the 1898 Paris Auto Show. An auto show was held in Detroit in 1907 at Beller&#x27;s Beer Garden at Riverside Park and since then annually except 1941–1953. During the show&#x27;s first decades of existence it portrayed only a regional focus. In 1957 international carmakers exhibited for the first time.

In 1987, the DADA proposed that the show become international. The members of the DADA went to places such as Europe and Japan in the attempt to convince those unveiling their new brands or vehicles in those countries to bring those unveilings to the North American Auto Show. That attempt proved to be successful; the North American Auto Show was then renamed the North American International Auto Show in 1989. The NAIAS was the first (and, until 2006, only) auto show in the United States sanctioned by the OICA.

Since 1965, the show has been held at Huntington Place (formerly Cobo Center), where it occupies nearly of floor space. Prior to being held at Huntington Place, the show was held at other well-known places in the Metro Detroit area, including the Light Guard Armory, Wayne Gardens pavilion, and Michigan State Fairgrounds.

Record attendance was in 2003, with 838,066 attendees. In 2009, attendance was 650,517. In 2016, there were 815,575 in ticketed attendance, after reaching 803,451 in 2015. In 2004 and 2005, the charity preview attracted 17,500 people at $400 a ticket and raised $7 million in total. Over 800,000 attended during the days the show was open to the general public in 2018; it is estimated that the show generates a revenue of over $500 million to the local economy.

Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz were not present at the 2019 edition, following recent absences of other luxury manufacturers like Porsche, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo.

In 2018, plans were made to move the show from January to June beginning in 2020, in hopes of attracting more visitors and adding outdoor events, with plans for an &quot;auto plaza&quot; around Woodward and Jefferson avenues, in addition to the indoor exhibition at TCF Center. An outdoor festival known as &quot;Motor Bella&quot; was to precede the show, which would showcase European supercars. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which TCF Center was used as a field hospital by FEMA.

In 2020, plans were made to move the 2021 show from June to late September due to the continued pandemic. However, the 2021 edition was also canceled. The NAIAS organizers held Motor Bella at the M1 Concourse in Pontiac, Michigan as a partial replacement, which was an outdoor enthusiast event running from September 21–26. Executive director Rod Alberts stated that &quot;we cannot ignore the major disruptions caused by the pandemic and the impact it has had on budgets. As such, we will be providing an amazing experience to the media, the auto industry and the public in a cost-effective way.&quot;

For the 2022 and 2023 editions, the show returned to downtown Detroit and was held in September. With the 2025 edition, the show returned to January, and was rebranded again as the Detroit Auto Show.

==Editions==

=== 2025 ===
In 2025, the show was moved back to its previous January timeframe; as a result, no show was held in 2024. The 2025 public show ran from January 11–20, with the media and charity previews held on the 10th, the latter featuring a performance by Flo Rida.

Like in 2023, the 2025 show was held entirely indoors at Huntington Place. Ford, General Motors, Kia, Stellantis, Toyota, and Volkswagen returned as full exhibitors; and BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Ineos, Mazda, and Mercedes-Benz were represented by exhibits organized by local dealerships, with Ineos making their first Detroit Auto Show appearance. High-end and exotic vehicles were exhibited in The Gallery, a separate section also programmed by local dealers.

The 2025 show included four test tracks on the show floor: the returning Powering Michigan EV Experience, featuring electric vehicles from BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Rivian (in the latter&#x27;s Detroit Auto Show debut); the new Detroit Grand Prix Track, with electric and gasoline-powered electric vehicles from Buick, Ford, Honda, Mazda, and Volkswagen; and the returning Ford Bronco Built Wild Experience and Camp Jeep off-road courses in their manufacturers&#x27; respective exhibits.

===2023===
The 2023 public show ran from September 16–24, with the media preview on the 13th and charity preview (featuring a performance by Jennifer Hudson) on the 15th. Notably, its run coincided with the beginning of the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, which targeted Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, the show&#x27;s three largest exhibitors. The UAW held a rally outside Huntington Place on the evening of the charity preview, but did not picket the event or call for a consumer boycott of the show.

For 2023, the show returned to its previous all-indoor format. All three Detroit-based automakers exhibited, joined by Kia, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Subaru declined to return for the 2023 show, while Honda and Hyundai were represented in exhibits organized by their Detroit-area dealerships. Like in 2022, non-participating automakers were represented by smaller displays of their automobiles in a separate section of the show floor.

The 2023 show introduced the Powering Michigan EV Experience, a large indoor test track at the rear of the show floor, on which attendees rode in new electric vehicles from GM, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Tesla. The track included a 300-foot acceleration strip, and a serpentine course to demonstrate the vehicles&#x27; handling. The separate Ford and Jeep off-road demonstration courses, as well as the Ram truck course, returned from the 2022 show. Tesla&#x27;s participation in the EV Experience marked the company&#x27;s first NAIAS appearance since 2015.

===2022===
In 2022, the full NAIAS returned to Huntington Place, with the public show running from September 17–25, preceded by the media preview on the 14th and the charity preview on the 16th. The media preview was visited by then-U.S. President Joe Biden, and the charity preview featured a performance by Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic.

The 2022 edition featured a redesigned layout, with the main exhibits indoors on the show floor at Huntington Place, and other supporting events outdoors in nearby Hart Plaza. Stellantis, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Subaru were the only automakers with major exhibits on the convention floor, while Volkswagen had a smaller display in the lobby of Huntington Place. In recognition of Jeep ducking, Stellantis rented the World&#x27;s Largest Rubber Duck for the show, which stood in the plaza outside Huntington Place. Many non-participating automakers, such as Nissan, Hyundai, and Mercedes-Benz, were represented by new vehicles on display on the convention floor, but without a branded exhibit.

Returning from Motor Bella were interactive test tracks on the show floor, offering rides in Ford and Stellantis vehicles, included with show admission. Ford&#x27;s track featured an acceleration strip, used to demonstrate the F-150 Lightning, and a large hill, showcasing the Bronco&#x27;s off-road capabilities. Stellantis operated two tracks: Camp Jeep, an off-road course featuring the Jeep Wrangler, Gladiator, and Grand Cherokee; and a second demonstration course featuring Ram pickup trucks.

Plans for the full NAIAS to return in September 2021 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In lieu, the show&#x27;s organizers hosted an outdoor event, Motor Bella, at the M-1 Concourse in nearby Pontiac from September 21–26.

===2020 (cancelled)===

===2019===
The 2019 show ran from January 19–27 at Cobo Center and opened with the lowering of a 2020 Shelby GT500 from the Cobo Center ceiling. 30 cars launched in the previews, down from 69 in 2018. Among various cars, it displayed new versions of the Kia Soul. Other major attractions included the 2020 Shelby GT500. &quot;USA Today&quot; noted that Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, Jeep and Toyota were all re-introducing discontinued models at the show with the media previews, for example the Toyota Supra and midsize Ford Ranger.

<text>Kareena Kapoor Khan (; ; born 21 September 1980) is an Indian actress. A prolific leading lady of Hindi cinema since 2000, she is noted for her roles in a range of film genres—from romantic comedies to crime dramas. Kapoor is the recipient of several awards, including six Filmfare Awards, and as of 2024, is one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s highest-paid actresses.

Born into the Kapoor family, she is the daughter of actors Babita and Randhir Kapoor, and the younger sister of actress Karisma Kapoor. After making her acting debut in 2000 in &quot;Refugee&quot;, Kapoor established herself the following year with several roles, including in the top-grossing drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;. This was followed by a series of commercial failures and negative reviews for her repetitive roles. An against-type performance as a sex worker in the 2004 drama &quot;Chameli&quot; marked a turning point in her career. She earned critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama &quot;Dev&quot; and a character based on Desdemona in the 2006 crime film &quot;Omkara&quot;. Her performance as a loquacious woman in the romantic comedy &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007) earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

Further praise came for her dramatic performances in &quot;Kurbaan&quot; (2009), &quot;&quot;, &quot;Heroine&quot; (both 2012), &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016) and &quot;Laal Singh Chaddha&quot; (2022). Her highest-grossing releases include the comedy-dramas &quot;3 Idiots&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; (2015), the action films &quot;Bodyguard&quot; (2011) and &quot;Singham Returns&quot; (2014), and the comedies &quot;Golmaal 3&quot; (2010) and &quot;Good Newwz&quot; (2019). She has also starred in the female-led comedies &quot;Veere Di Wedding&quot; (2018) and &quot;Crew&quot; (2024).

Kapoor Khan is married to actor Saif Ali Khan, with whom she has two sons. Her off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She is known for being outspoken and assertive and is recognised for her fashion style. Beside film acting, Kapoor participates in stage shows, hosts a radio show and has contributed as a co-writer to two autobiographical memoirs and two books of nutrition guides. She has started her own line of clothing and cosmetics for women, and has worked with UNICEF since 2014 to advocate for the education of girls and an increase in quality based education in India.

== Early life ==
Born on 21 September 1980 in Bombay (now Mumbai), Kapoor (often informally referred to as &#x27;Bebo&#x27;) is the younger daughter of Randhir Kapoor and Babita (&quot;née&quot; Shivdasani); her elder sister Karisma is also an actress. Kapoor is the paternal granddaughter of actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor, maternal granddaughter of actor Hari Shivdasani, and great-granddaughter of filmmaker Prithviraj Kapoor. The actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor are her uncle and aunt respectively, and their son, Ranbir Kapoor, is also an actor. 

According to Kapoor, her name &quot;Kareena&quot; was derived from the book &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, which her mother read while she was pregnant with her. Kapoor is of Punjabi descent on her father&#x27;s side, and on her mother&#x27;s side she is of Sindhi and British descent.

Describing herself as a naughty, spoilt child, Kapoor&#x27;s exposure to films from a young age kindled her interest in acting; she was particularly inspired by the work of actresses Nargis and Meena Kumari. Despite her family background, her father disapproved of women entering films because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents and they lived separately before reconciling in October 2007. She was raised by her mother, who worked several jobs to support her daughters until Karisma debuted as an actress in 1991. Although her father was not present for most her childhood, Kapoor remarked that he played an important role in her life.

Kapoor attended Jamnabai Narsee School in Mumbai, followed by Welham Girls&#x27; School in Dehradun. She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, though later admitted to liking the experience. According to Kapoor, she was not inclined towards academics though received good grades in all her classes except mathematics. Upon graduating from Welham, she returned to Mumbai and studied commerce for two years at Mithibai College. Kapoor then registered for a three-month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard Summer School in the United States. She later developed an interest in law, and enrolled at the Government Law College, Mumbai; during this period, she developed a long-lasting passion for reading. However, after completing her first year, she decided to pursue her interest in acting, though she later regretted not having completed her education. She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore Namit Kapoor, a member of the Film and Television Institute of India.

== Career and personal life ==
=== Career beginnings, breakthrough and setback (2000–2003) ===
While training at the institute, Kapoor was cast as the lead in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), opposite Hrithik Roshan. Several days into the filming, however, she abandoned the production since more prominence was given to the director&#x27;s son than her. She debuted later that year alongside Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s &quot;Refugee&quot;. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kapoor was introduced as Naaz, a Bangladeshi girl with whom Bachchan&#x27;s character falls in love. Dutta cast her for the combination of youthfulness and innocence he found in her, and Kapoor considered their collaboration to be a learning experience that helped her personally and professionally. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; noted &quot;the ease with which she emotes the most difficult of scenes&quot;, and &quot;India Today&quot; reported that she belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes. &quot;Refugee&quot; was a moderate box-office success in India and Kapoor&#x27;s performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.

Kapoor was paired opposite Tusshar Kapoor in Satish Kaushik&#x27;s box-office hit &quot;Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai&quot; (2001). A review in &quot;The Hindu&quot; noted that based on her first two films, she was &quot;definitely the actress to watch out for&quot;. She next starred in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s flop &quot;Yaadein&quot;, followed by Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s moderately successful thriller &quot;Ajnabee&quot;. Later that year, she appeared in Santosh Sivan&#x27;s period epic &quot;Aśoka&quot;, a partly fictionalised account of the life of the Indian emperor Ashoka. Featured opposite Shah Rukh Khan, Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character Kaurwaki with whom Ashoka falls in love. &quot;Aśoka&quot; was screened at the Venice and 2001 Toronto International Film Festivals, and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India, which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed. Jeff Vice of &quot;The Deseret News&quot; commended her compelling screen presence. At the 47th Filmfare Awards, &quot;Aśoka&quot; was nominated for five awards including a Best Actress nomination for Kapoor.

A breakthrough in Kapoor&#x27;s career came when she was cast by Karan Johar as Pooja (&quot;Poo&quot;, a good-natured, superficial girl) in the 2001 melodrama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;. She found little resemblance between herself and her &quot;&quot; character, and modeled Poo&#x27;s personality on that of Johar. Filming the big-budget production, alongside an ensemble cast was a new experience for Kapoor, and she recalls it fondly as a dream come true. &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; was an immensely popular release, finishing as India&#x27;s second highest-grossing film of the year and Kapoor&#x27;s highest-grossing film to that point. It became one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market, earning over worldwide. Taran Adarsh described Kapoor as &quot;one of the main highlights of the film&quot;, and she received her second Filmfare nomination for the role—her first for Best Supporting Actress—as well as nominations at the International Indian Academy (IIFA) and Screen Awards.

Box Office India reported that the success of &quot;Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai&quot; and &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and Rediff.com published that with &quot;Aśoka&quot; she had become the highest-paid Indian actress to that point earning per film. During 2002 and 2003, Kapoor continued to work in a number of projects but experienced a setback. All six films in which she starred—&quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge!&quot;, &quot;Jeena Sirf Merre Liye&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Khushi&quot;, &quot;Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon&quot;, and the four-hour war epic &quot;LOC Kargil&quot;—were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Critics described her performances in these films as variations of the character she played in &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, and expressed concern that she was becoming typecast. She later spoke positively of this period, recalling it as a beneficial lesson which taught her to work harder.

=== Professional expansion (2004–2006) ===
By 2004, Kapoor, who had confessed to having entered the film industry strictly for financial reasons, was eager on broadening her range as an actor and thus decided to accept more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous lead. Under the direction of Sudhir Mishra, Kapoor starred in &quot;Chameli&quot; as a golden-hearted prostitute who meets with a widowed investment banker (Rahul Bose). When Kapoor was first offered the part, she passed on it, explaining that she would be uncomfortable in the role. She relented when Mishra approached her for the second time, and in preparation for the role, visited several of Mumbai&#x27;s red-light districts at night to study the mannerisms of sex workers and the way they dressed. With a production budget of , the independent film marked a departure from the high-profile productions Kapoor previously starred in. &quot;The Times of India&quot; praised her for having exceeded all expectations; Rediff.com, however, found her portrayal unconvincing and excessively stereotypical, comparing her mannerisms to a caricature. &quot;Chameli&quot; marked a significant turning point in Kapoor&#x27;s career and she received a special jury recognition at the 49th Filmfare Awards.

Kapoor next co-starred in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Yuva&quot;, a composite film about three youngsters from different strata of society whose lives intersect by a car accident; she featured as Vivek Oberoi&#x27;s romantic interest. Despite not having &quot;much of a role&quot;, she agreed to the project due to her desire to work with Ratnam. Film critic Subhash K. Jha concurred that her role was insubstantial, but further stated that Kapoor uses her &quot;character traits to her ... advantage to create a girl who is at once enigmatic and all-there&quot;. She then appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Fardeen Khan in Govind Nihalani&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Dev&quot;, which revolved around the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat. Kapoor starred as a Muslim victim and contributed in the soundtrack by providing the vocals. Nihalani was initially hesitant to cast a mainstream commercial actress but found that Kapoor displayed a level of intelligence and sensitivity beyond her years. She was eager to work with him, as his films &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tamas&quot; (1988) gave her a deeper appreciation for cinema, and identified with her character&#x27;s ability to be strong yet simple. It earned her critical acclaim and a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress.

Kapoor was cast for the first time as a villain in &quot;Fida&quot; (2004), a thriller about an online heist. Critics noted a distinct progression from her earlier roles. That same year, she starred in Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s thriller &quot;Aitraaz&quot; and Priyadarshan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Hulchul&quot;. &quot;Aitraaz&quot; follows the story of a man (Akshay Kumar) accused of sexual harassment by his female superior (Priyanka Chopra). Kapoor was offered Chopra&#x27;s part, but decided to play Kumar&#x27;s wife, knowing that Indian women would better identify with her character. Jitesh Pillai of &quot;The Times of India&quot; found Kapoor to have a small role, but noted that she &quot;shines through brightly earning her big moment in the courtroom sequence&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Hulchul&quot; became Kapoor&#x27;s first commercial success in three years. Her next film, &quot;Bewafaa&quot;, in 2005, was panned by critics. Nikhat Kazmi believed that to become a serious actress Kapoor was embodying a maturer, more-jaded character beyond her years in &quot;Bewafaa&quot;. Her final two releases of the year included the romantic dramas &quot;Kyon Ki&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both of which underperformed at the box office. In her next two releases—the thriller &quot;36 China Town&quot; and the comedy &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot; (both 2006)—she starred opposite Shahid Kapoor. &quot;36 China Town&quot; was a commercial success and &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot; performed moderately well.

The filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj saw Kapoor in &quot;Yuva&quot;, and was sufficiently impressed to cast her in his next project, &quot;Omkara&quot;, an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Othello&quot; set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. Kapoor featured as Desdemona and was challenged on portraying the character&#x27;s inner turmoil, which she believed was much more subtle and subdued. She subsequently attended several script-reading sessions with the entire cast, and described the project as a special one for her. &quot;Omkara&quot; premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. &quot;Filmfare&quot; praised her ability to convey the various emotions her character went through, and her portrayal earned her a fourth Filmfare and first Screen Award. Kapoor considers it to be a favourite among her roles and compared her portrayal of Dolly with her own evolving maturity as a woman.

=== Established actress (2007–2011) ===
Kapoor next teamed with Shahid Kapoor for a fourth time in the romantic comedy &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007), in which she portrayed Geet Dhillon, a vivacious Sikh girl with a zest for life. Director Imtiaz Ali was not a well-known figure before its production, but Kapoor agreed to the film after being fascinated with his script. She collaborated closely with Ali to build her character and was challenged on effectively portraying Dhillon&#x27;s exuberant personality without making it caricaturish. &quot;Jab We Met&quot; was received favourably by critics and became successful at the box office. The BBC commented that the role required a mixture of naivety and spontaneity, and was impressed with Kapoor&#x27;s effort; Rajeev Masand labelled her the film&#x27;s &quot;biggest strength&quot;. Kapoor was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Actress and her second Screen Award. While shooting for &quot;Jab We Met&quot;, Kapoor and Shahid ended their four-year relationship. She admitted to being heartbroken by the split and hoped that they would reconcile their friendship in the future.

The following year, Kapoor co-starred in Vijay Krishna Acharya&#x27;s &quot;Tashan&quot;, where she met her future husband in actor Saif Ali Khan. Although highly anticipated by the audience before release, the film underperformed at the box office. After providing her voice for the character of the love interest of a street dog in the Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures animated film &quot;Roadside Romeo&quot;, Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s comedy &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot;. A sequel to the 2006 film &quot;&quot;, the film had an ambivalent reception from critics. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; believed the screenplay was derivative, concluding that her character and performance lacked originality. &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot; was a financial success with global revenues of .

In 2009, Kapoor was cast as Simrita Rai, a surgeon who moonlights as a model, in Sabbir Khan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Kambakkht Ishq&quot;. Set in Los Angeles, it was the first Indian film shot at Universal Studios. The film was poorly received by critics but became an economic success. The box-office flop &quot;Main Aurr Mrs Khanna&quot; came next, following which she played the leading lady in the dramatic thriller &quot;Kurbaan&quot;. Starring Kapoor as a woman confined to house arrest after discovering that her husband is a terrorist, she found the film to be an emotionally draining experience due to how difficult it was to disconnect from her character. Kapoor received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Gaurav Malani of &quot;The Economic Times&quot; commented that after a long time the actress was given a substantial role with a potential to boost her career, while Subhash K. Jha described it as her &quot;most consistently pitched performance to date&quot; played with sensitivity.

Kapoor&#x27;s second Filmfare nomination that year came for Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Five Point Someone&quot; by Chetan Bhagat, co-starring Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi. Her role is that of Pia, a medical student and Khan&#x27;s love interest. The film emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time up until then, grossing in India. It also did well internationally, earning over , the second biggest Bollywood success ever in the overseas market. &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; opined that Kapoor &quot;brings a dollop of sunshine and feminine grace to an otherwise masculine tale&quot;, taking note of her spontaneity while playing her character. &quot;3 Idiots&quot; received several Best Film recognitions at major Indian award functions, and Kapoor was awarded the IIFA Award for Best Actress, among others.

Kapoor began the new decade with a leading role in the poorly received romantic comedy &quot;Milenge Milenge&quot; (2010). Critics found the film to be outdated with stereotypical characters. A supporting role in &quot;We Are Family&quot;, an official adaptation of the Hollywood tearjerker &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), proved more rewarding. In an attempt to bring her interpretation to the part originally played by Julia Roberts, Kapoor refrained from watching &quot;Stepmom&quot; again and was drawn to the complexity of her character. Priyanka Roy of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; criticised it for being melodramatic, but praised Kapoor for enhancing the whole film. Kapoor was awarded the Best Supporting Actress at the 56th Filmfare Awards. She reunited with director Rohit Shetty for &quot;Golmaal 3&quot;, which received mixed reviews but earned more than domestically. For her performance, Kapoor received Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies including Filmfare.

Further success came to Kapoor in 2011 when she starred as the love interest of Salman Khan&#x27;s character in &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film of the same name. The film was not well received by critics, though became a financial success, with a domestic total of —India&#x27;s highest-earning film of the year. A review in &quot;Mint&quot; dismissed Kapoor&#x27;s role as ornamental; &quot;Mid-Day&quot; argued she &quot;actually manages to bring her caricature of a role alive&quot;. She next appeared in the Anubhav Sinha-directed sci-fi film &quot;Ra.One&quot;, revolving on a villainous videogame character (Shah Rukh Khan) who escapes into the real world. Made on a budget of , the film became one of the biggest earners of the year with a worldwide total of over —despite negative media coverage of its box-office performance—and Kapoor&#x27;s fourth major commercial success in three consecutive years.

=== Marriage, continued success and motherhood (2012–2017) ===
Kapoor followed her success in &quot;Bodyguard&quot; and &quot;Ra.One&quot; with a role in Shakun Batra&#x27;s &quot;Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu&quot; (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows the story of two strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character. The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of in India and abroad. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found her &quot;endearingly natural&quot;; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com complimented her for playing a non-ornamental role since that in &quot;Jab We Met&quot;. She next appeared in &quot;Agent Vinod&quot;, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. Asked why she took the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.

For her next feature, Kapoor was cast as a fading movie star in Madhur Bhandarkar&#x27;s &quot;Heroine&quot;. Initially skeptical about taking on the part whose personality she felt to be far removed from her own, she agreed after Bhandarkar enforced his faith in her. Although not a method actor, Kapoor believed that the intense role had left her on edge in her personal life and refrained from taking on any other projects. Reviewers found the film monotonous, but noted that it was watchable primarily due to Kapoor&#x27;s performance. Rajeev Masand described it as &quot;a deliciously camp performance&quot; that was played &quot;with utmost sincerity&quot;. Bollywood Hungama opined that it was her best work to date and concluded that despite an inconsistent character, Kapoor embellished it &quot;with a rare vulnerability and an exceptional inner life&quot;. At the annual Stardust Awards, Kapoor garnered the Editor&#x27;s Choice for Best Actress, and received additional nominations at Filmfare, IIFA, Producers Guild, Screen and Stardust.

On 16 October 2012, Kapoor married actor Saif Ali Khan in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai, and she gave birth to their sons in 2016 and 2021 respectively. Kapoor stated that despite adding Khan to her name she would continue practising Hinduism after marriage. &quot;&quot;, in which she played the prostitute Rosie (as Kareena Kapoor Khan), was her final release of 2012. The film is set against the backdrop of Mumbai&#x27;s red-light districts and follows the travails of a police officer (Aamir Khan) who is assigned the duty of solving a mysterious car accident. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; found Kapoor Khan a standout among the other performers, adding that &quot;she brings an unseen mix of oomph and emotion&quot;. With global revenues of , the film emerged as a box office hit, and earned Kapoor Khan Best Actress nominations at the Screen, Stardust and Zee Cine award ceremonies.

In 2013, Kapoor Khan collaborated with Ajay Devgn for the fourth time in Prakash Jha&#x27;s &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, a socio-political drama loosely inspired by social activist Anna Hazare&#x27;s fight against corruption in 2011. The film received little praise from critics and underperformed at the box office earning domestically. Following an appearance in the poorly received romantic comedy &quot;Gori Tere Pyaar Mein&quot; (2013), Kapoor Khan decreased her workload for the next two years to focus on her marriage and family. She took on smaller parts where she played the love-interest of Ajay Devgn in the action film &quot;Singham Returns&quot; (2014) and Salman Khan in the drama &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; (2015). The former, in which Kapoor Khan had a role written specifically for her, met with mixed reviews and Kapoor received criticism for taking a role of minimal importance. Conversely, the film was a financial success with a revenue of over . Kabir Khan&#x27;s &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; emerged as India&#x27;s highest-earning film of the year grossing a total of , and earned the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

In 2016, Kapoor Khan took on a starring role in &quot;Ki &amp; Ka&quot;, about gender stereotypes, to which she was particularly drawn for its relevance. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but it emerged a financial success grossing over worldwide. Meena Iyer of &quot;The Times of India&quot; mentioned Kapoor as remarkable, and Sukanya Verma considered the actress to be the film&#x27;s prime asset. She next featured in &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; (2016), a crime drama that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state Punjab. Kapoor Khan was initially reluctant to do the film due to the length of her role, but agreed after reading the completed script and partially waived her fees to star in it. &quot;Udta Punjab&quot; generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification deemed that the film represented Punjab in a negative light. The Bombay High Court later cleared the film for exhibition with one scene cut. Rediff.com stated that the film relies on her character, and Mehul S. Thakkar of &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot; wrote that she was successful in delivering such a strong performance. For her performance, Kapoor Khan received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Filmfare and Zee Cine award ceremonies.

=== Comedies and professional expansion (2018–present) ===
Following the birth of her first child, Kapoor Khan was persuaded by her husband to return to acting. She was keen to work on a project that would accommodate her parental commitments and found it in Shashanka Ghosh&#x27;s female buddy film, &quot;Veere Di Wedding&quot; (2018). Initially approached for the project in 2016, the makers rewrote Kapoor Khan&#x27;s role to accommodate her pregnancy, but the lack of maternity insurance in India led filming to begin after she gave birth. She liked the idea of telling a story of friendship and love from a female perspective, which she believed was rare in Hindi film, and was pleased to work with three other leading ladies. Anna M. M. Vetticad praised the film for portraying women with &quot;agency, flaws, humanity and, above all, a sense of humour&quot;, and took note of Kapoor Khan&#x27;s restrained performance. With a worldwide gross of over , &quot;Veere Di Wedding&quot; emerged as one of the highest-grossing female-led Hindi films.

Kapoor Khan reteamed with Akshay Kumar in &quot;Good Newwz&quot; (2019), a comedy about two couples&#x27; tryst with in vitro fertilisation. &quot;Mint&quot; Udita Jhunjunwala wrote that it is &quot;hard to keep your eyes off Kapoor Khan&quot;. She received Best Actress nominations at Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Awards, and the film earned over to emerge as the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. She next took a supporting role in &quot;Angrezi Medium&quot; (2020), a spiritual sequel to &quot;Hindi Medium&quot;. According to her, it was a deliberate attempt to move away from her comfort zone; she filmed her role in 10 days while she was accompanying her husband on his film shoot in London. The feature released in India amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its commercial performance was affected due to the closing of the cinemas. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in commended her &quot;ability to glitter in a handful of moments&quot;, but Vinayak Chakravorty for &quot;Outlook&quot; thought the portions involving Kapoor Khan were inessential to the story.

In 2022, Kapoor Khan starred in an adaptation of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, titled &quot;Laal Singh Chaddha&quot;, starring Aamir Khan in the title role. She played Rupa, a troubled aspiring actress; Devesh Sharma of &quot;Filmfare&quot; opined that her performance &quot;filled with angst and grit&quot; was one of the best in her career. Amidst a significant campaign by Hindu nationalists to boycott the film due to Aamir Khan&#x27;s political affiliations, &quot;Laal Singh Chaddha&quot; failed to recoup its estimated production budget of . She received another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.

Eager to work in the thriller genre, Kapoor Khan signed on for two such films: &quot;Jaane Jaan&quot; and &quot;The Buckingham Murders&quot; (both 2023). She has said that these projects would mark the beginning of a new phase in her career, in which she would focus more on artistic merit than stardom. Her roles in them marked a departure from the glamorous roles she had a reputation for portraying. &quot;Jaane Jaan&quot;, a Netflix film adaptation of Higashino Keigo’s novel &quot;The Devotion of Suspect X&quot; from filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh, starred her as a single mother involved in a murder. &quot;The Hindu&quot; Shilajit Mitra commended her &quot;brisk, unfussy performance&quot; and appreciated her for playing &quot;as part of a team, complementing instead of trying to commandeer scenes&quot;. In terms of global viewing hours, the film emerged as the most-watched Indian film on Netflix in 2023. Hansal Mehta&#x27;s &quot;The Buckingham Murders&quot; starred her as a detective in a small town in Buckinghamshire, for which she modelled her character on Kate Winslet&#x27;s role in &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot;. The film, shot predominantly in English, marked her first production venture. It premiered at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival. WION&#x27;s Shomini Sen commended Kapoor Khan&#x27;s restrained portrayal of a deglamourised character. It had a theatrical release the following year, where it had poor box-office returns.

Kapoor Khan returned to commercial cinema with the female-led heist comedy &quot;Crew&quot; (2024), co-starring Tabu and Kriti Sanon. For their roles as flight attendants, the trio received training from former cabin crew members. &quot;Outlook&quot; Garima Das praised her look and comic timing. The film emerged as another female-led commercial success for Kapoor Khan after &quot;Veere Di Wedding&quot;, and its success led Box Office India to credit her amongst the most successful Hindi film actresses of all time. She next reprised her role amongst an ensemble in the Cop Universe sequel &quot;Singham Again&quot;, representing the character of Sita. In his negative review for NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee lamented how Kapoor Khan&#x27;s character was reduced to being &quot;projected as hapless and vulnerable&quot;. &quot;Singham Again&quot; had modest box-office returns on its high production budget.

== Other work ==

=== Fashion and publication ===
Alongside her acting work, Kapoor has established a career as a designer. During her five-year association with the retail chain Globus, Kapoor became the first Indian actress to launch her own line of clothing for women; she described the collaboration as being &quot;special&quot; and &quot;reflective of my personal sense of style&quot;. Her collection made its debut several months later in stores across India, and was well received. Following the end of her contract with Globus, she expressed a desire to work with a design house to release her clothing line internationally, but later explained that those plans were on hold. In August 2018, Kapoor Khan collaborated with Lakmé Cosmetics to launch her own line of cosmetics.

In 2009, Kapoor worked with nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar on &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight&quot;, a book on the principles of healthy eating habits. Published by Random House, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up, &quot;Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha&quot;, was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir, &quot;The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva&quot;, which was criticised by &quot;Mint&quot; for its &quot;too-breezy&quot; writing. Co-written alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the Shobhaa De imprint of Penguin Books—a set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on &quot;The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right&quot;, a documentary film about nutrition. In 2021, Kapoor Khan released &quot;Pregnancy Bible&quot; (co-authored with Aditi Shah Bhimjani), which became a commercial success.

=== Philanthropy ===

During her years in the film industry, Kapoor has been actively involved in promoting children&#x27;s education and the safety of women. In June 2010, she took part in the international campaign 1GOAL Education for All, and was appointed ambassador for the Shakti Campaign—a project launched by NDTV to combat violence against women—in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of International Women&#x27;s Day. Two years later, Kapoor Khan launched Channel V&#x27;s anti-rape mobile app &#x27;VithU&#x27;; she stated that with an increasing amount of violence against women in India, &quot;[i]t [was] important for actors to stand up for issues because they can reach out to a lot of people.&quot;

In January 2014, Kapoor Khan began working with UNICEF to advocate the education of girls and increase quality based education in India. Speaking of her association, she expressed hope in creating places &quot;where children feel safe and secure, and where interactive and creative tools are used to ensure that children are happy and learning.&quot; During the first year, Kapoor Khan visited schools in the states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra where she interacted with students and participated in fundraising events hosted by the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya organisation in the Jalna district. Along with UNICEF India&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador (Sharmila Tagore), Kapoor Khan hosted a charity dinner to help raise awareness for the development of underprivileged kids, and launched the &#x27;Child-Friendly School and Systems&#x27; (CFSS) package. She later donated an equivalent amount of the funds raised during a joint initiative by UNICEF and Groupon for a higher-quality learning environment in Indian schools. She was elevated as a national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for India in May 2024.

The following year, she awarded 31 students and 5 teachers for their contribution towards the field of education in Chhattisgarh at the concluding ceremony of Child Rights Protection week. Also that year, Kapoor Khan provided a voice-over for the documentary film &quot;Girl Rising: Woh Padhegi, Woh Udegi&quot; [She will learn, she will fly] for the organisation of the same name, and produced a documentary on women&#x27;s empowerment. In June 2016, she spoke at an event organised by UNICEF in Lucknow to promote menstrual hygiene management. In 2018 she launched UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;Every Child Alive&quot; campaign to promote affordable and quality health care for mothers and their newborn. In May 2018, she was invited as a keynote speaker for a Mother&#x27;s Day event in New Delhi organised by UNICEF.

Additionally, Kapoor has made public appearances to support other charitable organisations. She performed at a fundraiser for the World Youth Peace Summit in November 2003, and participated in a concert to raise money for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. She visited Indian &quot;jawans&quot; (troops) in Rajasthan, for a special Holi weekend episode of NDTV&#x27;s reality show &quot;Jai Jawaan&quot;. In 2010, Kapoor adopted the village of Chanderi in Madhya Pradesh as part of NDTV&#x27;s Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. Four years later, she participated in a campaign to raise awareness on hunger and malnutrition in the world and made donations to the Kashmir flood relief. In September 2016, Kapoor Khan attended the inaugural of Global Citizen India—a joint initiative by the music festival of the same name and The Global Education and Leadership Foundation. The following year, she became the brand ambassador for Swasth Immunised India, a campaign launched by the Network18 Group and Serum Institute of India to promote immunisation for children.

=== Stage performances, radio and television presenting ===
Kapoor has participated in several stage shows and world tours since 2002. Her first tour (Heartthrobs: Live in Concert (2002) with Hrithik Roshan, Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Aftab Shivdasani) was successful in the United States and Canada. At the end of that year, she performed with several other Bollywood stars at Kings Park Stadium in Durban, South Africa in the show Now or Never.

Four years later, Kapoor returned to the stage with six other Bollywood celebrities in the successful Rockstars Concert world tour. The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed due to the arrest of Salman Khan. It later began the following month and was staged in 19 cities across the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, Katrina Kaif, Ganesh Hegde, Javed Ali and Anusha Dandekar) debuted at the Rotterdam Ahoy venue in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Several months later she again joined Khan, Rampal and Kaif to perform for an audience of 15,000 at Dubai&#x27;s Festival City Arena.

In 2018, Kapoor Khan collaborated with Ishq FM to host a radio show &quot;What Women Want&quot;. The show was well-received, earning Kapoor Khan a nomination at the New York Festivals Radio Awards for &quot;Best Talk Show Host&quot;, and later renewed for three more seasons. The following year, she featured as a talent judge for the seventh season of the dance reality show &quot;Dance India Dance&quot;.

== Public image ==
Known for her nonchalant relationship with the media, Kapoor has gained a reputation for discussing her private life with no reservations. As a child she regularly attended award ceremonies and events with her family, and would also accompany Karisma on-set during filming. In an interview with &quot;Filmfare&quot;, she explained that growing up in a film family helped her develop a sense of professionalism and dedication towards her craft. Kapoor&#x27;s private life has been the subject of media attention in India, with frequent press coverage of her weight and of her relationship with actor Saif Ali Khan. The couple—dubbed &quot;Saifeena&quot; by the entertainment media—has been one of the country&#x27;s most-reported celebrity stories since 2007, and Kapoor Khan gave birth to their sons in 2016 and 2021.

While a segment of the press has described Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticised her for being arrogant and vain—an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of &quot;Chameli&quot; (2004), in which she played a sex worker, Kapoor stated that &quot;there is a certain image that people identify you with [and] [i]t always follows you whichever role you play. I am trying to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly.&quot; &quot;Chameli&quot; helped Kapoor reinvent her on-screen persona, and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance.

Kapoor is also known for her assertive and moody nature, and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career. In an early interview, she confessed to being an introvert yet blunt, reasoning: &quot;Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. I am all about doing what I feel is right. It is not easy to pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions.&quot; Journalist Subhash K. Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes cost her professionally and made her lose out significant projects, it has made her &quot;a favourite among the generation that believes in self-regard being the highest form of creativity&quot;. Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor&#x27;s demeanour is an act; she is &quot;cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her&quot;.

Kapoor is considered one of the most popular Bollywood celebrities in India. Her look and performances have established her as a style icon for young women. In a 2009 poll conducted by &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot;, Kapoor was voted one of India&#x27;s most popular icons; with her partner Saif Ali Khan, she was listed amongst the top celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide. She became the only Indian actress to be featured on CNNGo&#x27;s list of &quot;Who Mattered Most in India&quot;, and was later selected by &quot;Verve&quot; for its list of the country&#x27;s most powerful women from 2008 to 2013 and in 2016. In June 2010, Kapoor was named &quot;India&#x27;s Most Beautiful Woman&quot; by the Indian edition of &quot;People&quot; magazine. In 2013, she was selected by &quot;India Today&quot; for its list of the country&#x27;s most influential women. In 2024, PVR INOX launched the &quot;Kareena Kapoor Khan Film Festival&quot; to celebrate her 25 years in Hindi cinema, marking the first film festival dedicated to an Indian actress. From 2012 to 2018, Kapoor Khan has featured on &quot;Forbes India&quot;″s &quot;Celebrity 100&quot;, a list based on the income and popularity of India&#x27;s celebrities, peaking at the seventh position in 2012 with an estimated annual earning of . As of 2024, Kapoor is India&#x27;s highest tax-paying female celebrity.

== Artistry and analysis ==
Kapoor relies on her instincts and spontaneity as an actor. She is known to commit heavily to each role, and refrains from rehearsing for a project. Commenting on this, director Rajkumar Hirani said &quot;I usually have a habit of conducting rehearsals for my actors, but she insisted on not having them as it would affect her spontaneity. She really surprised me with a couple of emotional scenes which we canned in just one take.&quot; Karan Johar described Kapoor as a &quot;natural&quot;, explaining that &quot;she has no craft, grammar or process attached to her acting [...] It is a great sense of cinema that can keep her going.&quot; According to Rensil D&#x27;Silva (who directed her in &quot;Kurbaan&quot;), &quot;Kareena [..] is instinctive and has emotional intelligence. She absorbs the situation and performs accordingly. Discussing the scene, in fact, harms her.&quot;

In 2010, Rediff.com noted: &quot;[E]ven though a lot of her starring roles have been forgettable, [a] look at her filmography now, however, would show a more thoughtful selection of roles [...] playing to her strengths.&quot; Her portrayal of a series of superficial characters at the start of her career were criticised; film historian Gyan Prakash explained that these roles &quot;tended to infantilise her, packaging her as daddy&#x27;s little girl, all bubble and no fizz&quot;. Critics noted &quot;Chameli&quot; (2004) as her coming of age, claiming that &quot;a new actor in her was discovered&quot;. Following her portrayal of a variety of character types in &quot;Chameli&quot;, &quot;Dev&quot; (2004), &quot;Omkara&quot; (2006) and &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007), Kapoor was noted for her versatility. In 2010, &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine included two of her performances—from &quot;Omkara&quot; and &quot;Jab We Met&quot;—in its list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot;. &quot;India Today&quot; labelled her &quot;the most versatile female lead in the industry&quot;, noting that she &quot;play[s] her roles with trademark spunk&quot;.

Manjula Sen of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2008 that although Kapoor had the worst success ratio among her contemporaries, her marketability remained unaffected. Sen believed Kapoor&#x27;s strength lies in her being versatile; she is &quot;effortlessly honest in her performances. It is a candour that spills over in her personal conduct.&quot; Writing for News18, Rituparna Chatterjee spoke of her transformation to date: &quot;[A]fter 40 films and 10 years of fighting off competition from some of the most versatile actors of her generation, Kareena has matured into a bankable actor reinventing herself with surprising ease.&quot; In 2004, Kapoor placed third on Rediff&#x27;s list of &quot;Top Bollywood Female Stars&quot;. She was later ranked seventh and fifth in 2005 and 2006 respectively, and returned to third place in 2007. In January 2011, Kapoor placed fourth on Rediff&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 10 Actresses of 2000–2010&quot;. Kapoor featured in Box Office India&#x27;s &quot;Top Bollywood Actresses&quot; list for thirteen years, and ranked first for five consecutive years (2007–2011) and in its &quot;All Time Top Actress&quot; list.

== Accolades ==

Kapoor has received six Filmfare Awards out of fifteen nominations. For her role in &quot;Refugee&quot;, Kapoor was awarded the Best Female Debut in 2000. She earned a special jury recognition for &quot;Chameli&quot; (2003), and two Critics Award for Best Actress for &quot;Dev&quot; (2004) and &quot;Omkara&quot; (2006). Kapoor later received the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Jab We Met&quot; (2007) and &quot;We Are Family&quot; (2010) respectively.

<doc id="427019" wikidata="Q455573" url="?curid=427019" title="Amateur Athletic Union">
<text>The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) is an amateur sports organization based in the United States. A multi-sport organization, the AAU is dedicated exclusively to the promotion and development of amateur sports and physical fitness programs. It has more than 900,000 members nationwide, including more than 100,000 volunteers. The philosophy of the AAU is &quot;Sports for All, Forever.&quot;

The AAU was founded on January 21, 1888, by James E. Sullivan and William Buckingham Curtis with the goal of creating common standards in amateur sport. Since then, most national championships for youth athletes in the United States have taken place under AAU leadership. From its founding as a publicly supported organization, the AAU has represented U.S. sports within the various international sports federations. In the late 1800s to the early 1900s, Spalding Athletic Library of the Spalding Company published the Official Rules of the AAU.

The AAU formerly worked closely with what is now today the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee to prepare U.S. athletes for both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, helping in the qualification of athletes to form the national team. As part of this, the AAU Junior Olympic Games were introduced in 1949, with athletes aged 8 to 16 years, or older in certain sports, being able to participate. Many future World and Olympic champions have appeared in these events, which are still held every year.

In the 1970s, the AAU received growing criticism. Many claimed that its regulatory framework was outdated. Women were banned from participating in certain competitions and some runners were locked out. The sporting goods industry also criticized the AAU for stifling innovation by forcing outdated or overreaching standards on their goods and game equipment. During this time, the Olympic Sports Act of 1978 organized the then United States Olympic Committee and saw the re-establishment of independent associations for the Olympic sports, referred to as national governing bodies. The rise of professionalism in all sports in the latter half of the 20th century also hurt the AAU&#x27;s viability. As a result, the AAU lost its influence and importance in international sports, and focused on the support and promotion of predominantly youthful athletes, as well as on the organization of national sports events.

==History==
Prior to the AAU, the National Association of Amateur Athletes of America (NAAA) existed from 1879 to 1888. The AAU was co-founded in 1888 by William Buckingham Curtis to establish standards and uniformity in amateur sports. During its early years the AAU served as a leader in international sport representing the United States in the international sports federations. The AAU worked closely with the Olympic movement to prepare athletes for the Olympic Games.

The AAU conducted its first event, championships for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, on April 6, 1888, at New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House.

The open USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships were organized by the AAU between 1888 and 1978. In 1923 the AAU sponsored the First American Track &amp; Field championships for women.

In 1897, the AAU held its first national men&#x27;s basketball championship. The winner was the 23rd Street YMCA from New York City. The first AAU women&#x27;s basketball tournament was held in April 1926 at the Los Angeles Athletics Club. The Pasadena Athletic &amp; Country Club Flying Rings were crowned the champions.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the NCAA engaged in a bitter power struggle with the AAU.

After the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 broke up the AAU&#x27;s responsibility as the national Olympic sports governing body, the AAU focused on providing sports programs for all participants of all ages beginning at the local and regional levels.

The AAU is divided into 55 distinct district associations, which annually sanction 45 sports programs, 250 national championships, and over 30,000 age division events. The AAU events have over 900,000 participants and over 100,000 volunteers.

===Women barred===
Starting in 1914, the Amateur Athletic Union barred women athletes from competing in events that it sponsored. In 1914 they changed their rules and allowed women to compete in a limited number of swimming events. Just two years later in 1916, AAU was considering discontinuing their experiment in allowing women at swimming events.

In 1922, the Metropolitan AAU in New York City approved a larger program of sanctioned events for women but still barred them from running events over one-half mile because they were considered too strenuous. The reason given for barring women was that if a woman was allowed to run more than a half-mile they would put their reproductive health at risk. But by 1923 the AAU allowed women to compete in most sports, including basketball. The AAU held women&#x27;s basketball tournaments from 1926 through 1970.

In 1961, the Amateur Athletic Union still prohibited women from competing in road running events and even if organizers broke the rule and allowed a woman to participate, her results would not be counted in the official race results. In 1970, the first New York City Marathon ignored the AAU rules and allowed women in the event even if it meant that their scores would not be official. For the second New York City Marathon in 1971 the AAU allowed women to participate if they started the race 10 minutes before, or 10 minutes after the men, or if they ran a separate but equal course. By 1974 women were becoming more vocal about their restrictions.

===Ice hockey breaks away===
Prior to 1936, ice hockey in North America was governed by the AAU and the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. After the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) split ways with its national union, the AAU terminated its working agreement with the CAHA which had allowed for transferring of players and exhibition games between the two countries. The AAU then issued an ultimatum to the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL) in August 1937, not to have any Canadian-born players in its league. EAHL president Tommy Lockhart chose to break away from the AAU and reached an agreement with the CAHA, then founded the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) to govern ice hockey. The AHAUS and the CAHA joined to form the International Ice Hockey Association, which merged into the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace to become the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in 1947. With the merger, the IIHF chose to recognize the AHAUS as the governing body of hockey in the United States, instead of the AAU.

Despite the decision by the IIHF, the AAU sent its own team to compete in ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics. The AAU was supported by the United States Olympic Committee led by Avery Brundage, who threatened a United States boycott the Olympics if an AHAUS team was recognized instead of an AAU team. The status of ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics was not resolved until the night before the Olympics began, after bitter negotiations. The International Olympic Committee allowed the AHAUS team to participate, but they were ineligible to win an Olympic medal.

===Break-up===
The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 was precipitated by grumblings of the inefficiency of the AAU to manage the multitude of sports at the Olympic level. USA Gymnastics was formed initially as a feeder program in 1963 as a response to perceived poor performance by the American performers in the Olympics and at World Championships. The USWF was formed in 1968 as an effort to take over amateur wrestling as an independent governing body. Their position was supported when FILA, then wrestling&#x27;s world governing body, refused to accept membership of &quot;umbrella&quot; sports organizations like the AAU. The International Track Association was formed immediately after the 1972 Olympics. Prior to the formation of the ITA, track and field athletes were amateur athletes, as required by the Olympic creed of the day. The only income they received from their sport was &quot;under the table.&quot; As a result, many American athletes&#x27; careers were frequently cut short shortly after their subsidized participation at the collegiate level ended, even as Eastern Bloc and other international athletes frequently had their careers extended under the facade of being a part of national military or police service (usually being more honorary than productive work) which extended their amateurism. Pressure from the athletes had been mounting for years to find an answer. &quot;Track and Field News&quot; discussed the subject with its cover article &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; in November 1971.

== Headquarters ==
AAU got its start in New York City. But in 1957, the search began for a permanent national office site rather than renting office space in NYC. In 1970, the AAU officially moved its national headquarters to Indianapolis, serving as the catalyst which eventually bills the city as the “Amateur Sports Capital” of the United States. In 1994, the AAU joined forces with the Walt Disney World Resort, signing a 30-year agreement. As part of that agreement, many of AAU&#x27;s national championships in many sports are played at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista. In 1996, the AAU relocated its national headquarters to Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. More than 40 AAU national events are conducted at the complex. The AAU headquarters is located within the former Walt Disney World Preview Center.

==Programs==
Programs offered by the AAU include: AAU Sports Program, AAU Junior Olympic Games, AAU James E. Sullivan Memorial Award and the AAU Complete Athlete Program.

The AAU has 33 national committees to organize its activities in particular sports.
AAU operates under a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status granted in 1996.

===Sports offered===
The Amateur Athletic Union offers participants sport programming in individual and team sports in their local community that they can join and compete with other athletes their own age.

=== AAU Junior Olympic Games ===
The AAU Junior Olympic Games is the largest multi-sport event for youth in the United States. It has become the showcase event of the AAU Sports Program.

The Games originated from ‘telegraphic&#x27; state track and field competitions. National Champions were determined through telephone and/or mail entries instead of head-to-head competition. In 1949, the AAU conducted its first ‘live&#x27; national meet in Cleveland, Ohio — giving birth to the AAU Youth Sports Program.

As the popularity of the AAU Youth Sports Program increased, the AAU leaders decided to conduct two national championships simultaneously. The idea came to fruition when Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey proclaimed the first AAU Junior Olympic Games open on August 21, 1967 in downtown Washington, D.C., at the Departmental Auditorium on Constitution Avenue. Five hundred twenty-three athletes competed in the inaugural AAU Junior Olympic Games in Washington, D.C. in 1967. National champions were determined in swimming and track and field. Eighteen AAU records in swimming and three in track and field were established.

Since its beginning in Washington, D.C. in 1967, the AAU Junior Olympic Games have been conducted in 19 states and 31 cities across the United States. The Games popularity has exploded from the original 523 athletes to more than 18,000 participants representing all 50 states and several United States territories.

The AAU Junior Olympic Games has been honored with Champions of Economic Impact in Sports Tourism Awards from Sports Destination Management in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.

=== AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships ===
The AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships is one of AAU’s premier and award-winning national events. The inaugural AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships took place on June 25, 1974 in Catonsville, Maryland. Nineteen teams participated, representing 10 states.

In June 1997, the AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships was held at Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex (now ESPN Wide World of Sports) for the first time. It was the first volleyball event to be played in the Fieldhouse at the complex, with a total of 127 teams attending.

In 2012, the AAU Girls’ Junior National Volleyball Championships was named the largest volleyball tournament in the world by Guinness World Records. The event was held at ESPN&#x27;s Wide World of Sports and the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida.

The 50th AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships in 2023 was the largest event to date with 5,194 teams (966 boys and 4228 girls) competing. It&#x27;s the largest sporting event ever held at the Orange County Convention Center.

Over the years, this premier AAU event has been recognized as a seven-time winner of the Champions of Economic Impact in Sports Tourism Award by Sports Destination Management, Best Single Amateur Sporting Event by Sports Travel Awards, and Best Sporting Event by Connect Sports.

===AAU Cares===
The AAU Cares program was established in 2016 as the AAU&#x27;s way of giving back to the community. The first event was held in conjunction with the 86th AAU James E. Sullivan Award. With the assistance of New York State Senator Kevin Parker, bicycles were assembled by the AAU Board of Directors and presented to under-served New York City area youth. Other AAU Cares events were held in conjunction with the AAU Girls&#x27; Junior National Volleyball Championships in 2016 and 2017 respectively where the AAU teamed up with Feeding Children Everywhere to pack a total of 120,000 meals in total for hungry children. Currently in conjunction with the AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships are Dig Pink® initiatives benefitting the Side-Out Foundation.

=== AAU Urban Initiative ===
The AAU Urban Initiative was created in 2015 to provide a holistic approach to athletics. It provides participation opportunities to areas that were historically under served. The initiative partners the AAU with local government, law enforcement, faith-based groups, business communities, educational institutions and other groups who work to bring communities together through sports in service to America&#x27;s youth. Through mentoring, the program teaches life skills, character development, and harmony. On September 16–17, 2023, the AAU Urban Initiative program held an inaugural 3v3 AAU Basketball Tournament at Times Square in New York City in cooperation with the NYPD.

===AAU College Hockey===
The AAU College Hockey was established in March 2023, through the collaboration of the Collegiate Hockey Federation and Amateur Athletic Union. Beginning with the 2023–2024 season, AAU College Hockey includes Men&#x27;s Division 1, Division 2, and Division 3, and a Women&#x27;s Division, aiming to offer the best collegiate hockey experience while prioritizing the needs of its member conferences, programs, student-athletes, and staff.

AAU Hockey sponsors national tournaments for minor hockey levels. A North American Championship for Squirt/Atom and PeeWee levels as well as Midget and Bantam levels is set for debut in 2015 in cooperation with the Canadian Independent Hockey Federation (CIHF).

== AAU James E. Sullivan Award ==

The AAU James E. Sullivan Award has been presented annually since 1930 to the best collegiate or Olympic-level athlete in the United States – making this award older than the Heisman Trophy (1935).

The AAU Sullivan Award is a salute to founder and past president of the Amateur Athletic Union, and a pioneer in amateur sports, James E. Sullivan. Based on the qualities of leadership, character, and sportsmanship, the AAU Sullivan Award goes beyond athletic accomplishments and honors those who have shown strong moral character as well.

Golfer Bobby Jones was the first recipient of the AAU Sullivan Award in 1930, beating out other finalists Barney Berling (athletics), Clarence De Mar (athletics), Tommy Hitchcock (polo), Helen Madison (swimming), Helen Wills Moody (tennis), Harlon Rothert (all-around), Ray Rudy (swimming), George Simpson (athletics) and Stella Walsh (athletics) to take home the honor.

In 1944, Ann Curtis, an 18-year-old swimmer from San Francisco, became the first woman to receive the AAU Sullivan Award. Curtis had captured eight AAU titles during the year.

In 2024, the 94th AAU James E. Sullivan Award was presented to college basketball star Caitlin Clark, who became the first ever two-time winner of the award. Other finalists included David Taylor (Wrestler), Emery Lehman (Speedskating), Frederick Richard (Gymnastics), Madisen Skinner (Volleyball) and Noah Jaffe (Para Swimming) .

==Masters Track and Field==
Masters Track and Field officially began in 1968, and in 1971 became a separate group within the AAU organization. Masters Track and Field is now part of USA Track &amp; Field (USATF).

==Documentary films==
The live action short film &quot;The Winning Strain&quot; was filmed at the 1966 AAU Track and Field championships in New York City and was nominated for an Oscar in 1967.

1999 HBO documentary &quot;Dare to Compete: The Struggle of Women in Sports&quot; won the Peabody Award.

In September 2008, &quot;More than a Game&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. LeBron James founded SpringHill Entertainment in 2007 to produce the award-winning documentary, which chronicles his high school basketball career.

The 2011 documentary &quot;Empty Hand: The Real Karate Kids&quot;, written and directed by Kevin Derek, chronicles four young karate competitors compete en route to the annual AAU Karate Championship national tournament.

A 2013 AAU youth basketball documentary &quot;Little Ballers&quot;, was televised by Nickelodeon in 2015, as the first documentary to be aired on &quot;NickSports&quot;. The film was directed by Crystal McCrary and featured AAU youth team New Heights, featuring Cole Anthony, who is her son.

In 2016, &quot;At All Costs&quot; explores how the AAU basketball circuit has professionalized youth basketball across America.

==Criticism==
In the early 1970s, the AAU became the subject of criticism, notably by outspoken track star Steve Prefontaine, over the living conditions for amateur athletes under the AAU, as well as rules that were perceived to be arbitrary.

The AAU ceased to have any governance over Olympic sports in the U.S. when, due to various criticisms, Congress intervened. A three-year commission led to its enactment of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, establishing the United States Olympic Committee (USOPC) and national governing bodies for each Olympic sport. The AAU continues as a voluntary organization which mainly promotes youth sports.

In 2015, Kobe Bryant strongly criticized the AAU, describing it as &quot;Horrible, terrible AAU basketball. It&#x27;s stupid. It doesn&#x27;t teach our kids how to play the game at all so you wind up having players that are big and they bring it up and they do all this fancy crap and they don&#x27;t know how to post. They don&#x27;t know the fundamentals of the game. It&#x27;s stupid&quot;. Bryant, who moved to Italy at age six because of his father playing basketball there, stated that the AAU has been &quot;treating (amateur basketball players) like cash cows for everyone to profit off of&quot;. Steve Kerr has also spoken out against the AAU, stating that the AAU&#x27;s structure devalues winning, with many teams playing as much as four times a day and some players changing teams from one morning to the afternoon of the same day. Kerr also states that &quot;The process of growing as a team basketball player — learning how to become part of a whole, how to fit into something bigger than oneself — becomes completely lost within the AAU fabric&quot;.

Sexual misconduct allegations have come to light several times during the 21st century. Former President Robert W. &quot;Bobby&quot; Dodd was accused of abuse in 2011. Then in 2016, the AAU was sued for allowing Rick Butler, a youth volleyball coach accused of sexually abusing his players in the past, to coach an under-18 team in the AAU Girls&#x27; Junior National Volleyball Championships.

<doc id="427025" wikidata="Q12297894" url="?curid=427025" title="Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)">
<text>The Battle of Hill 60 was one of the last major assault of the Gallipoli Campaign. It was launched on 21 August 1915 to coincide with the attack on Scimitar Hill made from the Suvla front by Major-General H. de B. De Lisle&#x27;s British IX Corps, Frederick Stopford having been replaced in the few days previous. Hill 60 was a low knoll at the northern end of the Sari Bair range which dominated the Suvla landing. Capturing this hill along with Scimitar Hill would have allowed the Anzac and Suvla landings to be securely linked.

Two major attacks were made by Allied forces, the first on 21 August and the second on 27 August. The first assault resulted in limited gains around the lower parts of the hill, but the Ottoman defenders managed to hold the heights even after the attack was continued by a fresh Australian battalion on 22 August. Reinforcements were committed, but nevertheless the second major assault on 27 August fared similarly, and although fighting around the summit continued over the course of three days, at the end of the battle the Ottoman forces remained in possession of the summit.

==Background==
Hill 60 (Kaiajik Aghala) commanded the low ground occupied by a thin line of outposts between the Allied forces at Anzac and Suvla. The hill was to be taken as part of an attack that stretched over a two-mile front from Hill 60 through Hetman Chair, Hill 70 and Oglu Tepe. The initial attacking force was based on troops allocated to Major-General Herbert Cox by Lieutenant-General William Birdwood:
:Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the Otago Mounted Rifles of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (400 men)
:13th and 14th Battalions of the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade (500 men),
:2 Gurkha battalions of the 29th Indian Brigade of the 10th Indian Division,
:5th Battalion of the Irish Connaught Rangers (700 men), 10th Hampshires (330 men) and 4th South Wales Borderers of the British 29th Division.

The initial plan allocated the primary objective of Hill 60 to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles (NZMR). To their left, the Connaught Rangers were to take the water wells at Kabak Kuyu and the Gurkhas the wells at Susak Kuyu. To the right of the NZMR, troops of the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade (4 Aust) supported by the 10th Hampshires were to launch a feint attack, on the spur just above the knoll itself, to draw off Turkish reserves.

==Battle==
On the morning of 21 August, it was decided that the New Zealand artillery support, that had been planned to pre-empt the attack, would be diverted to support the Suvla offensive. The start time for the advance on Hill 60 was put back by 30 minutes, by which time it was expected that the artillery would be available to support it. As a consequence Hill 60, and the area around it, received practically no bombardment and the attackers were guaranteed to face severe opposition because the Turks were alerted.
The NZMR moved out at 3:30 with a approach march to the Ottoman positions. A number of Turks, on seeing the advancing lines abandoned their front trench, ran back to their rear trenches and, by 3:45, the New Zealanders began occupying the forward position. At 4 pm, the NZMR were in their first objective but neither the Indian Brigade on their left nor 4 Aust on their right were up with them though the Connaught Rangers had secured their first objective, the wells at Kabak. Brigadier-General Andrew Hamilton Russell, the NZMR commander, ordered the Australians to push forward and requested that the Connaughts assist on the left flank. Although only &#x27;A&#x27; Company was ordered forward, the Connaughts had become very mixed and the charge was made up from a crowd of men from all the companies, &quot;mad with the lust for battle&quot;. Passing the first line trench on the west of the hill, with Turks running before them, the Connaughts were stopped by heavy rifle and machine gun fire from the crest as well as accurate artillery fire.

The survivors consolidated their position in the first-line trench, and were relieved by the Gurkhas from 5:15, leaving the Connaughts to concentrate on securing and fortifying the wells. The right flank was still having difficulties. From Hill 100 down to Hill 60, the Turkish trenches and artillery commanded the Kaiajik Dere valley which 4 Aust and the Hampshires had to cross. Those that survived the crossing had dug in at 5 pm. An artillery shell had set undergrowth on fire, burning many of the wounded to death. The Connaughts joined up with the NZMR to their right by 7 pm, but there was still a gap between the NZMR and the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade.

On 22 August, the attack was reinforced by the Australian 18th Battalion which was part of the newly arrived Australian 2nd Division. The men were fresh and healthy, in stark contrast to the veteran troops, but were inexperienced and ill-equipped. Attacking only with the bayonet, they suffered 383 casualties, out of 750 men, in their dawn attack on Hill 60.

The assault resumed on 27 August and further progress was made up the slope, but the summit of the hill was still held by the Ottomans. On the evening of 27 August 1915, the 9th Light Horse Regiment, of the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, were sent in as reinforcements. One wave of 75 men led by the new commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carew Reynell, lost its way and was caught in the open by Ottoman machine guns, with many soldiers and Reynell being killed. The 10th Light Horse Regiment was committed to the fighting, and on 28 August, some trenches at the summit were captured but the Ottomans clung to the vital northern face which overlooked Suvla. Attacking and counter-attacking continued until this final assault on Hill 60 ended on 29 August 1915.

==Aftermath==

The attack on Hill 60 was the last offensive action undertaken around Anzac by the Allies prior to the evacuation in December 1915. Historian Chris Coulthard-Clark describes the battle as a series of &quot;...badly handled attacks which resulted in costly and confused fighting&quot;. The Allies were ultimately unsuccessful in capturing the hill&#x27;s summit, although according to Brad Manera, the attack gained some advantage for the Allies, stating that by capturing the &quot;seaward slopes, the Anzac flank was secured and the link with Suvla opened&quot;. Nevertheless, it proved costly with the Allies suffering over 1,100 casualties; the Australian 18th Battalion alone was reduced to one third of its original strength after less than a fortnight of action. One Australian, Second Lieutenant Hugo Throssell of the 10th Light Horse, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle, the last VC to be awarded on the peninsula.

General Ian Hamilton, the overall Allied commander, recorded on 29 August that &quot;this evening we were all in good form owing to the news from Anzac. Knoll 60, now ours throughout, commands the Biyuk Anafarta valley with view and fire —a big tactical scoop.&quot; This was based on a report from Birdwood who mistakenly believed that the knoll itself had been taken whereas, in reality, the Turks still occupied half of Hill 60.

During November, New Zealand sappers drove a mine under Hill 60 creating a large crater at the summit though the Allies did not occupy it. The Turks later mined the Allied positions. The positions on Hill 60 were mined prior to evacuation on 12 December, which was scheduled for 45 minutes prior to the evacuation of Russell&#x27;s Top. On the night of 19–20 December, all survivors of the Anzac front were evacuated from Gallipoli.

After the war, the peace treaty with Turkey included a provision for &quot;full and exclusive rights of ownership over the land in which are situated the graves of those who fell in action, for the purpose of laying out cemeteries or erecting memorials&quot;. In 1920, the Central Graves unit handed over the cemetery to the Imperial War Graves Commission. Today, the hill is the location of the Hill 60 Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

<text>The Big West Conference (BWC) is an American collegiate athletic conference whose member institutions participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division I. The conference was originally formed on July 1, 1969, as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), and in 1988 was renamed the Big West Conference. The conference stopped sponsoring college football after the 2000 season.

Among the conference&#x27;s 11 member institutions, 10 are located in California (nine in Southern California alone), and one is located in Hawaii (though the Hawaii member is leaving for the Mountain West Conference, effective July 1, 2026). All of the schools are public universities, with the California schools evenly split between the California State University and the University of California systems. In addition, one affiliate member plays two sports in the BWC not sponsored by its home conference.

==History==

===Pacific Coast Athletic Association===
The Big West Conference was formed in June 1968 as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. The five original charter members were Fresno State, San Jose State, UC Santa Barbara, San Diego State, and Long Beach State. Two other schools, Cal State Los Angeles and the University of the Pacific, were also considered but they declined at that time to pursue membership. The newly formed conference had several meetings to set up its governance, which was confirmed in October 1968 on the campus of UC Santa Barbara. Before the league started play, Cal State Los Angeles joined as a full member and the University of the Pacific joined for football only, becoming a full member itself two years later. The conference itself lists July 1, 1969, as its founding date, with the seven institutions beginning conference play that fall.

===Evolution===
Since its inception as the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, the conference has seen many changes. Utah State was the first institution outside California to join the conference in 1978. This opened the floodgates for many other schools to affiliate with the PCAA; notable schools include UNLV, Nevada, Louisiana Tech, Boise State, and football-only members, such as Southwestern Louisiana and Arkansas State.

In 1983, the PCAA became the first western conference to introduce women&#x27;s athletic programs, allowing female student-athletes to compete at the same level as their male counterparts. This proved vital for Hawaiʻi as their only participation in the conference was for their women&#x27;s sports.

However, many universities left to join conferences that were perceived as more well-known, such as the Western Athletic Conference or the Mountain West Conference, while others did not see the benefit of travel since historically many of the teams have been California-based.

From the departures of Idaho and Utah State in 2005 until the arrival of Hawaii in 2012, all members were based in California, reducing the cost and travel time between the universities. When Hawaii joined, it agreed to help defray a portion of travel costs to that state for the league&#x27;s California members.

There have been no fewer than 25 full and associate members in the conference&#x27;s history, while only two of the original seven charter members remain (Long Beach State and UC Santa Barbara, with only Long Beach State&#x27;s membership being continuous).

===The change to the Big West===

Effective July 1, 1988, the Pacific Coast Athletic Association changed its name to the Big West Conference. With such schools as Utah State, UNLV, Nevada, New Mexico State, and Hawaii now in the fold, the name change was more representative of its member institutions. In addition, the conference had signed a contract with ESPN to have its men&#x27;s basketball games telecast as the third game of a triple header known as &quot;Big Monday&quot; - the other conferences being featured were the Big East and the Big Ten so the name Big West fit the theme.

===Former members===
Many of the former members of the Big West are now members of the Western Athletic Conference or the Mountain West Conference. Of the nine schools that were in the WAC before its early-2010s realignment, only Hawaii had not spent some time in the Big West as a football participant – it was a Big West member only in women&#x27;s sports. Of the former members, Cal State Los Angeles is the only team that reverted to Division II level.

School names and nicknames reflect those used by the institutions when they were Big West members. One school has changed its name (Southwestern Louisiana, now branded athletically as Louisiana and also known as Louisiana–Lafayette) and another its nickname (Arkansas State, from Indians to Red Wolves).

* Arkansas State played football as an independent from 1996 to 1998 and later rejoined the Big West for football during the 1999 and 2000 seasons.

==Sports==
The Big West Conference currently sponsors 21 NCAA sports, with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving the newest additions for the 2024–25 school year.

In baseball, Cal State Fullerton has won four College World Series titles with national championships in 1979, 1984, 1995, and 2004. In addition, Long Beach State and UC Irvine have made multiple appearances in the College World Series. Fullerton also has a national championship in softball, winning in 1984. Long Beach State has won three NCAA women&#x27;s volleyball titles, as a part of Big West Conference women&#x27;s volleyball, with national championships in 1989, 1993, and 1998. Misty May-Treanor led the 49ers (now known as Beach) to a 36–0 record en route to the program&#x27;s most recent title. UC Santa Barbara was the NCAA men&#x27;s soccer runner-up in 2004, losing the national championship match to Indiana on penalty kicks. The Gauchos returned to the College Cup in 2006 and won the national championship.

Former Big West members UNLV and Pacific won national championships while part of the conference. The UNLV Runnin&#x27; Rebels men&#x27;s basketball team won the 1990 NCAA tournament championship after routing Duke 103-73 in the national title game. UNLV was undefeated during the 1991 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball season before falling to Duke in the final four. The Runnin&#x27; Rebels during this era are widely considered one of the best college basketball teams of all time. The Pacific Tigers women&#x27;s volleyball team won back-to-back national championships in 1985 and 1986.

The Big West did not sponsor men&#x27;s volleyball or men&#x27;s water polo, but it was the primary conference affiliation of several schools that compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation for these sports, respectively. In NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball, UC Irvine has established itself as one of the nation&#x27;s most elite programs, winning four national championships in 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2013. Long Beach State also won men&#x27;s national volleyball titles in 1991, 2018, and 2019. In NCAA men&#x27;s water polo, UC Irvine won three national championships in 1970, 1982, and 1989. UC Santa Barbara also won a men&#x27;s water polo title in 1979.

On May 31, 2016, the Big West announced the conference would sponsor men&#x27;s volleyball as its 18th sport, with five Big West schools leaving the MPSF to establish the new men&#x27;s volleyball league. Men&#x27;s volleyball is the third of four sports in which the MPSF has recently seen a mass exodus of teams to join an existing conference in a newly sponsored sport, with men&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s water polo, and women&#x27;s lacrosse as the others. The men&#x27;s volleyball membership includes core Big West members Cal State Northridge, Long Beach State, Hawaii, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara. UC San Diego joined as an affiliate to bring the league to the NCAA minimum requirement of 6 teams to receive an automatic bid for the NCAA tournament.

Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell explained that adding UC San Diego was not an indicator UC San Diego would be added to the Big West Conference as a full member. UC San Diego had recently passed a bill to move all their sports to Division I and was looking for an invite from the Big West Conference. UC San Diego has long competed at the Division I level in men&#x27;s volleyball; the NCAA conducts a single national championship open to all Division I and II members, and scholarship limits in the sport are the same in both divisions. The Big West regular season for men&#x27;s volleyball will be a double round-robin, with each team playing the others once at home and once on the road. The Big West Tournament will have all six teams participate in single-elimination rounds with the top two teams receiving semifinal byes.

The Big West is the first Division I all-sports conference (defined as a league that sponsors men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball) ever to sponsor men&#x27;s volleyball, and the second NCAA all-sports conference overall to sponsor men&#x27;s volleyball as a scholarship sport (the first was the Division II Conference Carolinas).

On November 26, 2017, the Big West announced that it would add UC San Diego along with Cal State Bakersfield as its 10th and 11th members starting on July 1, 2020. Cal State Bakersfield, which was already a full Division I member competing in the Western Athletic Conference, became a full member effective July 1, 2020. UC San Diego, which had failed to move up from Division II in failed bids to the Big West in 2011 and April 2017, has begun the four-year transition process to Division I and became a full member effective July 1, 2024. UC San Diego&#x27;s men&#x27;s volleyball joined the Big West in 2017, in advance of that sport&#x27;s 2018 season, and women&#x27;s water polo joined in 2019. Because the NCAA does not sponsor a Division II championship in either men&#x27;s volleyball or women&#x27;s water polo, UCSD was eligible for conference championships in both sports upon joining the Big West, and will remain eligible for such during the D-I transition.

UC San Diego and Cal State Bakersfield, the latter now in the process of rebranding its athletic program as Bakersfield, officially joined the conference on July 1, 2020, and Dan Butterly became the new commissioner following the retirement of Dennis Farrell.

===Men&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===


===Women&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===


=== Current conference champions ===
The Big West Conference sponsors championship competition in 9 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving will be added in 2024–25.

Regular-season champions are indicated with &quot;(RS)&quot; and tournament champions with &quot;(T)&quot;.

== Facilities ==
==Commissioner&#x27;s Cup==
Starting during the Big West Conference&#x27;s 1998–99 season, the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup is awarded yearly to the most outstanding program throughout the season in the conference&#x27;s sponsored sports. The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos are the most successful team to date having won 10 total trophies.

===Overall Commissioner&#x27;s Cups Table===

==SoCal Challenge==
Starting in 2021, the Big West Conference served as host of the SoCal Challenge, an eight-team men&#x27;s basketball tournament held during Monday and Wednesday of Thanksgiving week. One Big West team represented the conference in the field of each tournament. Cal Poly, Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield participated in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The final tournament was held in 2023.

<text>On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive&#x27;s pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods.

On diesel and electric locomotives, the driving wheels may be directly driven by the traction motors. Coupling rods are not usually used, and it is quite common for each axle to have its own motor. Jackshaft drive and coupling rods were used in the past (e.g. in the Swiss Crocodile locomotive) but their use is now confined to shunter locomotives.

On an articulated locomotive or a duplex locomotive, driving wheels are grouped into sets with wheels within each set linked together.

==Diameter==
Driving wheels are generally larger than leading or trailing wheels. Since a conventional steam locomotive is directly driven, one of the few ways to &#x27;gear&#x27; a locomotive for a particular performance goal is to size the driving wheels appropriately. Freight locomotives generally had driving wheels between in diameter; dual-purpose locomotives generally between , and passenger locomotives between or so.

The driving wheels on express passenger locomotives have come down in diameter over the years, e.g. from on the GNR Stirling 4-2-2 of 1870 to on the SR Merchant Navy Class of 1941. This is because improvements in valve design allowed for higher piston speeds.

==Flangeless wheels== 
Some long-wheelbase locomotives (four or more coupled axles) were equipped with blind drivers. These were driving wheels without the usual flanges, which allowed them to negotiate tighter curves without binding.

Some three-driving-axle locomotives also had flangeless wheels on the middle axle, such as Everett Railroad 11, and the NZR WH class.

==Balancing==
On locomotives with side rods, including most steam and jackshaft locomotives, the driving wheels have weights to balance the weight of the coupling and connecting rods. The crescent-shaped balance weight is clearly visible in the picture on the right.

==Whyte notation==
In the Whyte notation, driving wheels are designated by the middle number or numbers in the set. The UIC classification system counts the number of axles rather than the number of wheels and driving wheels are designated by letters rather than numbers. The suffix &#x27;o&#x27; is used to indicate independently-powered axles.

The number of driving wheels on locomotives varied quite a bit. Some early locomotives had as few as two driving wheels (one axle). The largest number of total driving wheels was 24 (twelve axles) on the 2-8-8-8-2 and 2-8-8-8-4 locomotives. The largest number of coupled driving wheels was 14 (seven axles) on the ill-fated AA20 4-14-4 locomotive.

==Other uses of the term &quot;driving wheel&quot;==
The term &quot;driving wheel&quot; is sometimes used to denote the &quot;drive sprocket&quot; which moves the track on tracked vehicles such as tanks and bulldozers.

==In popular culture==
Many American roots artists, such as The Byrds, Tom Rush, The Black Crowes and the Canadian band Cowboy Junkies have performed a song written by David Wiffen called &quot;Driving Wheel&quot;, with the lyrics &quot;I feel like some old engine/ That&#x27;s lost my driving wheel.&quot;

These lyrics are a reference to the traditional blues song &quot;Broke Down Engine Blues&quot; by Blind Willie McTell, 1931. It was later directly covered by Bob Dylan and Johnny Winter.

Many versions of the American folk song &quot;In the Pines&quot; performed by artists such as Leadbelly, Mark Lanegan (on &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot;), and Nirvana (On &quot;MTV Unplugged In New York&quot;) reference a decapitated man&#x27;s head found in a driving wheel. In addition, it is likely that Chuck Berry references the locomotive driving wheel in &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; when he sings, &quot;the engineers would see him sitting in the shade / Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.&quot;

<doc id="427040" wikidata="Q6141246" url="?curid=427040" title="Richard O'Kane">
<text>Richard Hetherington O&#x27;Kane (February 2, 1911 – February 16, 1994) was a United States Navy submarine commander in World War II, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for commanding in the Pacific War against Japan to the most successful record of any United States submarine ever. He also received three Navy Crosses and three Silver Stars, for a total of seven awards of the United States military&#x27;s three highest decorations for valor in combat. Before commanding &quot;Tang&quot;, O&#x27;Kane served in the highly successful as executive officer and approach officer under noted Commander Dudley &quot;Mush&quot; Morton. In his ten combat patrols, five in &quot;Wahoo&quot; and five commanding &quot;Tang&quot;, O&#x27;Kane participated in more successful attacks on Japanese shipping than any other submarine officer during the war.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Kane was born in Dover, New Hampshire, on February 2, 1911. He was the youngest of four children of University of New Hampshire entomology professor Walter Collins O&#x27;Kane, of Irish ancestry, and his wife, Clifford Hetherington. O&#x27;Kane graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover in 1930 and the United States Naval Academy in May 1934, upon which he was commissioned an officer in the United States Navy.

==Naval career==
O&#x27;Kane spent his first years of active duty on the heavy cruiser and destroyer . He received submarine instruction in 1938 and was then assigned to the . O&#x27;Kane qualified for submarines aboard &quot;Argonaut&quot; in 1938 and remained aboard until her overhaul at Mare Island in 1942.


===World War II===
In early 1942, Lieutenant O&#x27;Kane joined the pre-commissioning crew of the new submarine and served as its executive officer on five war patrols during World War II, first under Lieutenant Commander Marvin G. &quot;Pinky&quot; Kennedy and later under the legendary Lieutenant Commander Dudley &quot;Mush&quot; Morton. Morton established a record as an excellent tactician, as he preferred to run the demanding analysis and plots while his executive officer manned the periscopes, a reversal of standard practices. Under Morton&#x27;s tutelage, O&#x27;Kane developed the skills which enabled him to become the single most accomplished American submarine commander in history.

In July 1943, following his fifth patrol in &quot;Wahoo&quot;, O&#x27;Kane was detached, promoted to lieutenant commander, and shortly made prospective commanding officer of , which was then under construction. He placed her in commission in October 1943 and commanded her for her entire career. He was an innovator, and developed several operational tactics that markedly increased his ship&#x27;s effectiveness. Among these were daylight surface cruising with extra lookouts, periscope recognition and range drills (enabling clear tactical sureness when seconds counted), drifting when not bound somewhere, and methods of night surface attacks, one of his favorite techniques to obtain and maintain the initiative in battle.

In five war patrols on the &quot;Tang&quot;, O&#x27;Kane was originally recognized with sinking a total of 24 Japanese ships – the second highest total for a single American submarine and the highest for a single commanding officer. Postwar reviews of Japanese war records, corroborated by &quot;Tang&quot;″s surviving logs and crewmen, revised the totals to 33 ships totalling over sunk. This placed &quot;Tang&quot; first for both number of ships and tonnage (ahead of ″s 26 ships and ″s 100,231 long tons). Several times during the war, he took &quot;Tang&quot; into the middle of a convoy and attacked ships ahead and behind – counting on &quot;Tang&quot;″s relative position, speed, and low profile to keep clear of enemy escorts.

&quot;Tang&quot;″s third patrol, into the Yellow Sea, sank more Japanese ships than any other submarine patrol of the war. O&#x27;Kane claimed eight ships sunk; post-war analysis increased this to 10 ships. During one attack, he fired six torpedoes at two large ships. Japanese records showed the torpedoes actually hit four ships. This number of sinkings surpassed the next highest patrol, &quot;Wahoo&quot;″s (with O&#x27;Kane as executive officer) in the same area the year before.

Under O&#x27;Kane, &quot;Tang&quot; also performed &quot;lifeguard duty&quot;, a common joint operation, with a Fast Carrier Task Force, of positioning one or more submarines in a &quot;ditching station&quot; off an enemy island under air attack in order to rescue downed pilots. Off Truk, he and the &quot;Tang&quot; rescued 22 airmen in one mission, thus earning a Presidential Unit Citation.

O&#x27;Kane was captured by the Japanese when &quot;Tang&quot; was sunk in the Formosa Strait by her own flawed torpedo (a circular run of a Mark 18) during a surface night attack on October 24–25, 1944. O&#x27;Kane lost all but eight members of his crew, and was at first secretly held captive at the Ōfuna navy detention center, then later moved to the regular army Omori POW camp. Following his release, O&#x27;Kane received the Medal of Honor for &quot;conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity&quot; during his submarine&#x27;s final operations against Japanese shipping.

===Post-war appointments===
In the years following World War II, O&#x27;Kane served with the Pacific Reserve Fleet as commanding officer of the submarine tender , testified at Japanese war crimes trials, was executive officer of the submarine tender and was Commander, Submarine Division 32 (ComSubDiv 32). He was a student at the Armed Forces Staff College in 1950–51 and was subsequently assigned to the Submarine School at New London, Connecticut, initially as an instructor and, in 1952–53, as the commanding officer.

Promoted to the rank of captain in July 1953, O&#x27;Kane commanded the submarine tender until June 1954 and then became Commander, Submarine Squadron Seven (ComSubRon 7). Following studies at the Naval War College in 1955–56, he served in Washington, D.C., with the Ship Characteristics Board. O&#x27;Kane retired from active duty in July 1957 and, on the basis of his extensive combat record and under the tombstone promotion rule in effect at the time, was simultaneously advanced to the rank of rear admiral on the Retired List.

==Later life and legacy==
O&#x27;Kane died of pneumonia in Petaluma, California, at age 83. O&#x27;Kane and his wife Ernestine (1912–2008) are buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

In 1998, the was named in his honor.

===The O&#x27;Kane Cribbage board===
The wardroom of the oldest fast attack submarine in the United States Pacific fleet (currently , as of 25 July 2023) carries O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s personal cribbage board, and upon decommissioning the board is transferred to the next oldest boat. Prior to &quot;Key West&quot;, the cribbage game set was aboard:
* , as of 29 October 2019. Before that,
* , as of 21 May 2018, 
* , as of 4 February 2011, 
* , as of 19 October 2004,
* , as of 2 April 2002,
* , as of 1994 after the passing of Admiral O&#x27;Kane.

The board used aboard &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was a gift given to then-Admiral O&#x27;Kane in 1957, by his crew from , to replace the board that was lost when the first &quot;Tang&quot; sunk in 1944. The second &quot;Tang&quot; was in commission with the US Navy until 1980 when she was transferred to Turkey.

==Summary of war patrols==
With a total of 31 ships and 227,824t sunk during five patrols with (24 ships and 93,824t, per JANAC), O&#x27;Kane ranks number one compared to all United States Navy skippers.
==Awards and decorations==
In addition to the Medal of Honor, O&#x27;Kane received three Navy Crosses, three Silver Stars, the Legion of Merit with &quot;V&quot; device for valor, the Purple Heart and several other decorations throughout his career. (O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s original ribbon rack is on display at the US Navy Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut.)

<text>The Citroën GS is a front-engine, front-drive, four or five door, five passenger family car manufactured and marketed by Citroën in two series: for model years 1970–1979 in fastback saloon and estate bodystyles and subsequently as the GSA for model years 1980–1986 in hatchback and estate body styles – the latter after a facelift. Combined production reached approximately 2.5 million.

Noted for its aerodynamic body shape with a drag coefficient of 0.318,
 fully independent hydro-pneumatic brakes and self-levelling suspension, and air-cooled flat-four engine, the GS was styled by Robert Opron, with a low nose, a two-box silhouette, semi-enclosed rear wheels and a sharply vertical Kamm-tail. 

When the GS was named the European Car of the Year for 1971, the design was noted as technologically advanced, with class leading comfort, safety and aerodynamics.

==Market placement==
The GS filled the gap in Citroën&#x27;s range, between the 2CV and Ami economy cars and the luxurious DS executive sedan. The DS had moved significantly upmarket from its predecessor the Citroën Traction Avant, and beyond the finances of most French motorists. Leaving this market gap open for fifteen years allowed other manufacturers entry into the most profitable, high volume market segment in France. This combined with the development costs and new factory for the DS-replacing Citroën CX, the 1973/1974 oil crisis, and an aborted Wankel rotary engine, led Citroën to declare bankruptcy in 1974.

The GS met with instant market acceptance and was the largest selling Citroën model for many years. 1,896,742 GS models and 576,757 GSA models were produced in total.

Unlike the 2CV, Ami, DS and SM, the GS was never officially imported to the USA. A US export model was nearly finished when Citroën withdrew from the US market, with a few dozen cars brought over in 1971 for testing purposes and to be displayed in showrooms. After the project was cancelled, these orphaned cars were sold, mostly to employees of the dealerships.

==Design stage==

The GS took 14 years to develop from initial design to launch.

The 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the Citroën Traction Avant, leaving a large gap in the middle range of the market. 

In 1956, Citroën developed the C10, a bubble car prototype to fill the gap in its range between the large DS and the tiny 2CV. Development continued with ideas like a Wankel engine and hydropneumatic suspension suggested as possibilities, with a new, modern body to match. Another iteration was the &quot;C60,&quot; which resembled an &quot;Ami 6&quot; with a long, smooth nose.

In 1963, development had moved to &quot;Project F&quot;, which was close to being production-ready. Citroën decided the car was too similar to the 1965 Renault 16 and by 1967 Project F was suspended. Many of the mechanical components continued to &quot;Project G&quot;, which became the GS. The GS was designed by Robert Opron, with a smooth two box design that bears some resemblance to the 1967 design study by Pininfarina &quot;Berlina Aerodinamica.&quot;

==Launch and ongoing development==
On 24 August 1970, Citroën launched the GS. The body style was as a Berline (a four-door saloon with three side windows), in a fastback style with a sharp Kammback. The aerodynamics gave the best drag coefficient of any vehicle at the time. On its launch, its main competitors in Europe included the Fiat 128, Ford Escort, Renault 6 and Vauxhall Viva.

The GS&#x27;s aerodynamics enabled the car to make the best of the available power, but when introduced, the car was considered underpowered. In September 1972 Citroën addressed the issue with the introduction of an optional 1,222 cc engine. Claimed power increased from to , with improved torque. Both the second gear and final drive ratios were adjusted, increasing the vehicle speed per 1,000 rpm from 23 km/h (14.3 mph) to 24.5 km/h (15.2 mph). Larger front brake discs were also fitted.

From a design perspective, CEO Pierre Bercot considered a hatchback layout too utilitarian. The GS&#x27;s initial fastback design, with a separate trunk/boot, was controversial, though the 1974 CX shared a similar configuration. The trunk/boot was nevertheless large, in part due to the positioning of the spare wheel within the engine compartment.

From September 1971, the GS was also available as a four door station wagon (estate) and a similar two-door &quot;service&quot; van.

Both the early GS (until 1976) and the GSA were fitted with a rotating drum speedometer (similar in construction to bathroom scales), rather than the dials found in a conventional instrument panel. The later GS (from 1977 until the introduction of the GSA) had a conventional speedometer

The GS&#x27;s radio was placed between the seats, and the parking brake was located on the dashboard. Adjacent to the radio was a suspension height adjustment lever. The steering wheel was single-spoke design, minimizing its potential intrusion on the driver in the event of an impact. On the later GSA, controls were organized in flanking satellites and a diagram of the car provided information on indicator lights or mechanical problems.

The GS was offered in four trims: G Special (base), GS Club (midrange), GS X (sports), and GS Pallas (luxury). The GS X and Pallas were only offered as saloons. 
===GSA===
The GS was facelifted in 1979 and given a hatchback, and renamed the GSA. This change reflected the growing sales of small family hatchbacks in Europe since the launch of the Volkswagen Golf. Revisions included the grille, plastic bumpers, taillights, hubcaps and exterior door handles. It also had a revised dashboard with the auxiliary controls on column-shaped pods so they could be reached without moving the hands from the single-spoked steering wheel; similar to the &quot;CX&quot; layout. 

The GSA was joined and gradually replaced by the larger BX in 1982, with production continuing in reduced volumes until 1986. Citroën did not return to the small family hatchback market until the launch of the ZX in 1991.

Contemporary journalists noted the smooth ride quality – the hydropneumatic suspension is designed to absorb bumps and ripples that would be uncomfortable in a conventionally sprung car with just a slight body movement.

==Mechanics==
The vehicle had a front-wheel drive layout and was powered by an air-cooled flat-four engine. A series of small engines were available, displacing 1,015, 1,129, 1,222 and 1,299 cc. Power ranged from to . Mated to a four speed gearbox, these were able to pull this car up to steady at 6,250 rpm (with a 1,222 cc engine), due to the very aerodynamic body shape. Citroën&#x27;s 3-speed C-Matic semi-automatic transmission was available as an alternative to the manual gearbox. With the introduction of the GSA a 5-speed gearbox was offered, which made cruising at high speeds more comfortable and economical (the top speed was raised to for both long and short gearbox ratios). The GS and GSA needed full use of the free-revving engines to maintain progress, except when cruising, in the tradition of the Citroën 2CV.

The four-wheel independent suspension featured a double wishbone layout at the front and trailing arms at the rear. Both axles comprised rigid sub frames that gave the car unmatched ride quality and road holding for the time, even on its narrow tires (factory-mounted Michelin ZX 145SR15).

Its central hydraulic system, powering the four disc brakes (inboard in front to help lower unsprung weight) and the advanced hydro-pneumatic self-levelling suspension, was derived from the Citroën DS. It also has a feature that increased or decreased braking pressure in accordance with cargo load, without any noticeable difference in the brake pedal response. The powered system was different from the typical assisted systems in that there was virtually no travel on the brake pedal even when braking hard. The hydraulic suspension allowed the car to be raised for rough terrain at low speeds (a feature taking account of the country lanes of its native France) and to full height for easy access to the partially enclosed rear wheels. The hand brake lever is mounted on the dashboard as opposed to being mounted between the front seats. In-car entertainment can be fitted in the space that would have been utilised by the handbrake. As with other Citroën cars, the hydraulic system depressurizes over several hours, so the car will gradually sink to the bump stops when the engine is off.

The GS&#x27; 1.3-litre engine was also used in the French &quot;Odyssée&quot; motorcycle. The engines were equipped with a single Solex carburetor and have a bespoke five-speed gearbox with shaft drive. About 650 of these were built between 1981 and 1988, most of them for French police authorities.

==GS Birotor==
A two rotor GS was launched in 1973. Dubbed the Citroën GS Birotor (also called Citroën GZ), it featured a much more powerful Wankel birotor produced by the joint NSU-Citroën Comotor project. This style of motor is noted for its smooth power delivery which complemented the luxurious ride quality of the hydropneumatic suspension. Even better, the engine was small relative to its power, an advantage for Tax horsepower calculations, which drive automobile design in France.
The Birotor was extensively re engineered for the Comotor 624 engine. Discs all around (ventilated in front), different wheels with a five-bolt pattern rather than three, and a three-speed semi-automatic transmission were combined with a more luxurious interior and flared fenders to set the Birotor apart from its lesser siblings.

The Birotor cost as much as the larger Citroën DS, and 70 percent more than the standard GS. The fuel economy was worse than the largest DS – the &quot;DS23EFI.&quot; Since it was not economical for its size, and was launched in October 1973, the exact start of the 1973 oil crisis, the Birotor version achieved poor sales and was quickly pulled from the market, after 847 units were sold.

In 1975, Peugeot S.A, which had been a competitor until then, took over Citroën S.A. as its subsidiary. PSA attempted to buy back and scrap each Birotor, as it did not want to support the model with spare parts. A few of these remarkable vehicles have nonetheless survived in the hands of collectors, many without titles for some time as PSA did not want to recognize the cars.

==GS production abroad==

The GS and GSA were built in a number of countries besides France. 385,000 units were built in Vigo, Spain Besides Portugal, production or assembly took place in countries as varied as South Africa, Chile, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). The South African model was also available as the &quot;GS-X2 Le Mans&quot; special edition, only available in silver, red, or black with an all-white interior. This model received the uprated 1,222 cc engine producing achieved by using high compression pistons, round, rather than oval inlet manifolds, a Weber carburetor, and larger diameter driveshafts. A variant of the X2 marketed in Europe, it featured special wheel trim, twin stripes along the sides incorporating an X2 emblem on the front fenders, a rear spoiler, a rear window louvre, and four round headlights mounted in black plastic housings.

All three body-styles, GS and GSA versions and a mix thereof were built in Cakung in East Jakarta, Indonesia by PT Alun Indah. Indonesian production continued until at least 1990. Many Indonesian cars were fitted with the twin-headlight assembly typically seen on &quot;Grande Exportation&quot; (GE) cars. These modified and reinforced models were fitted with various improvements to deal with warm climates, dust, unpaved roads, and other conditions which would be encountered in French overseas departments and other markets in the developing world.

Renowned moped manufacturer Tomos in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) also assembled the GS saloon at their plant in Koper. In 1973 a new company, Cimos, was formed by Citroën, Iskra, and Tomos and they took over production. Like the Indonesian models, Cimos sometimes used the twin-headlight fixtures developed for export markets on their GSs (although never on the well-equipped Pallas model). Slovenian GSs were commonly finished in &quot;campus beige&quot; color. The GSA was called the GA in Yugoslavia.

==GSA in East Germany==
Between 1979 and 1983, around 5,500 were exported to East Germany making it one of the few western cars in the country. Erich Honecker, the East German party leader, also maintained a fleet of the larger CX model (as well as several Volvos).

<text>Nat Love (June 14, 1854 – February 11, 1921) was an American cowboy and writer active in the period following the Civil War. His reported exploits have made him one of the more famous heroes of the Old West.

==Early life==
Nat Love, (pronounced &quot;Nate&quot;) was born into slavery on the plantation of Robert Love in Davidson County, Tennessee on June 14, 1854. His father was a slave foreman who worked in the plantation&#x27;s fields, and his mother the manager of its kitchen. Love had two siblings: an older sister, Sally, and an older brother, Jordan.

Despite slavery-era statutes that outlawed black literacy, he learned to read and write as a child with the help of Sampson, his father. When slavery ended, Love&#x27;s parents stayed on the Love plantation as sharecroppers, attempting to raise tobacco and corn on about 20 acres, but Sampson died shortly after the second crop was planted. Afterward, Nat took a second job working on a local farm to help make ends meet. At about this time, he was noted as having a gift for breaking horses. After some time of working extra odd jobs in the area, he won a horse in a raffle on two occasions, which he then sold back to the owner for $50 each time. He used the money to leave town, and at the age of 16, headed to the Western United States.

==Life as a cowboy==
Love traveled to Dodge City, Kansas, where he found work as a cowboy with cattle drivers from the Duval Ranch (located on the Palo Duro River in the Texas Panhandle). According to his autobiography, Love fought cattle rustlers and endured inclement weather. He trained himself to become an expert marksman and cowboy, for which he earned from his co-workers the moniker Red River Dick. In 1872, Love moved to Arizona, where he found work at the Gallinger Ranch located along the Gila River. He wrote in his autobiography that he met Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, Billy the Kid, and others while working the cattle drives in Arizona.

===&quot;Deadwood Dick&quot;===
After driving a herd of cattle to the rail head in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, he claimed to have entered a rodeo on the 4th of July in 1876, enticed by the $200 prize money. The only difficulty with this story is that Deadwood newspapers, which covered every event of the Fourth of July celebrations, make no mention of a rodeo that day. He claimed to have won the rope, throw, tie, bridle, saddle, and bronco riding contests. It was at this rodeo that he claims friends and fans gave him the nickname &quot;Deadwood Dick&quot;, a reference to a literary character created by Edward Lytton Wheeler, a dime novelist of the day.

===Capture and escape===
In October 1877, Nat Love wrote that he was captured by a band of Pima Indians while rounding up stray cattle near the Gila River in Arizona. Although he claimed to have received over 14 bullet wounds in his career (with &quot;several&quot; received in his fight with the Native Americans while trying to avoid capture), Love wrote that his life was spared because the Indians respected his heritage, a large portion of the band themselves being of mixed blood. He almost married the chief&#x27;s daughter. The band of Native Americans nursed him back to health, wishing to adopt him into the tribe. Eventually, Love writes, he stole a pony and escaped into West Texas.

==Life after being a cowboy==
Love left the cowboy life before he settled down, and married a woman named Alice Owens, in Denver, Colorado, on August 2, 1888. They lived in Denver initially. He then took a job in 1890 as a Pullman porter, which involved overseeing sleeping cars on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. While working for the railroad, he and his family resided in several western states, before finally moving to southern California.

In 1907, Love published his autobiography titled &quot;Life and Adventures of Nat Love, Better Known in the Cattle Country as &#x27;Deadwood Dick,&#x27; by Himself&quot;, which greatly enhanced his legacy. Love spent the latter part of his life as a courier and guard for a securities company in Los Angeles. He died there in 1921 at the age of 66.

==In popular culture==
===Written===
Joe R. Lansdale used Love as a character in the story, &quot;Nine Hide and Horns&quot;, published in the anthology book &quot;Subterranean Online&quot; (2009); &quot;Soldierin&quot;, published in the anthology book &quot;Warriors&quot; (2010); the novella, &quot;Black Hat Jack&quot; (2014); and the novel, &quot;Paradise Sky&quot; (2015).

In 2012, his story was featured in the graphic novel &quot;Best Shot in the West&quot; by Patricia and Fredrick McKissack (script) and Randy DuBurke (drawings).

In 2022, the Denver Art Museum displayed &quot;Nat Love, A Cowboy&#x27;s Life&quot;, a comic adaptation of his autobiography, written and drawn by R. Alan Brooks and colored by Lonnie MF Allen.

===Film===
In the television movie &quot;The Cherokee Kid&quot; (1996), Nat Love is portrayed by Ernie Hudson.

In &quot;They Die by Dawn&quot; (2013), Love is portrayed by Michael K. Williams.

Jonathan Majors portrayed Nat Love in the film &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (2021).

<text>Uncle Duke is a fictional character in the comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; by Garry Trudeau.
He is nominally Zonker Harris&#x27;s uncle, albeit an &quot;uncle by courtesy&quot; only. Duke appeared in the strip July 1974 and was originally a straightforward caricature of the gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson (see Raoul Duke), but eventually took on a life of his own and a succession of ill-fated ventures in the areas of politics, business and crime.

Duke is an epic consumer of drugs and alcohol and an amoral trickster with a fondness for firearms. He has a son called Earl who resembles him in most ways but is sober and more intelligent.
== Character biography ==
Duke&#x27;s early life is murky. His mother is mentioned very few times in the strip; a flashback has her noting at Duke&#x27;s college graduation that &quot;one of three men I used to know would be very proud of you.&quot; He recalls having been born wearing Ray Bans, and is almost never seen without sunglasses in the strip. As Jim Andrews calls him a &quot;42-year old balding bagman&quot; in the strip for 6 July 1979, his birthyear could be 1936 or 1937. He tells Earl that he does not remember where he attended high school. He mentions to Honey that he fought in the Belgian Congo to pay for college. While in Haiti, he is visited by his former college roommate, Robert Vesco.

Despite Zonker calling him &quot;Uncle Duke&quot;, Duke appears to be his surname, shared by his son Earl and his cousin David. The back matter for the Doonesbury collection &quot;Death of a Party Animal&quot; refers to him as &quot;Raoul Duke,&quot; a throwback to the character&#x27;s origins. Conversely, in one exposé of his past, he is revealed to have no last name.

In early strips, Duke and others would occasionally mention his wife, Sandy, and she makes a brief &quot;appearance&quot; (only her dialogue is shown, as is often the case in the comic strip) in several strips during a visit by Duke to their home in Colorado. Later, Duke forgets to bring her when he goes to his appointed posts in Samoa and China. When he finally returns home, his caretaker informs him that &quot;She left years ago&quot;. They eventually divorced.

===1970s===
Since his first appearance in the strip, Duke has assumed many career hats, each more outlandish than the last. When first introduced, Duke was working as a writer under Jann Wenner for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, much to Wenner&#x27;s chagrin and aggravation over Duke&#x27;s inability to meet deadlines and/or maintain coherence within the confines of his articles, which were often written with the aid of controlled substances. His Hunter S. Thompson comparisons are fairly evident in this beginning, as the first strip to feature him has him drunk and high on tequila and coke, attempting to kill invisible bats with a ruler.

While still on the staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Duke applied for the position of Governor of American Samoa, and to his—and everyone else&#x27;s—surprise, was actually appointed to the post by the United States Senate. Duke&#x27;s tenure as governor was marked by a series of consecutive natural disasters, culminating in Duke himself instigating a hostage crisis.

Despite Duke&#x27;s gross incompetence, he earned the favor of then-President Gerald Ford and was appointed as the United States Ambassador to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a role for which Duke claimed to be perfectly suited due to his being &quot;good with minorities&quot;. (In fact, the United States had no ambassador to mainland China at that time.) His tenure was largely uneventful and mostly consisted of his abusing his authority for personal gain and wagering with other members of the diplomatic community (notably the British ambassador) over the purging of various Chinese officials. During his time in China, he was assisted by interpreter Honey Huan, who developed an unrequited obsession with him, followed him to the US and became his much-abused sidekick for the next 30 years.

Recalled by the newly elected Jimmy Carter in 1977, Duke briefly worked as a laetrile farmer before being appointed as the manager of the Washington Redskins, ostensibly for his experience in &quot;sports medicine&quot; i.e. performance-enhancing drugs. After his activities were exposed by a concerned whistleblower, Duke fled Washington in a hail of bullets.

===1980s===

Shortly after his departure from the Redskins, Duke was hired as a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, owing to his borderline paraphilic love for firearms and gun violence. His role consisted chiefly of threatening members of Congress with write-in campaigns. He was next hired by oil executive Jim Andrews to parachute into Iran and bribe a government accountant for oil rights. The mission went disastrously wrong and Duke accidentally triggered the real-life Iran hostage crisis.

Upon his return to the US, Duke made a living for a while as a former hostage on the lecture circuit, then went on the run again after accidentally shooting his caretaker Zeke Brenner. With Honey&#x27;s help, Duke bought a fishing boat in Florida and began to smuggle drugs and illegal immigrants. This new career move was cut short by an ill-timed sightseeing cruise to the Falkland Islands to witness the war. After running the boat into a reef, Duke and Honey suffered a mutiny at the hands of their own cruise passengers, and ended up shipwrecked for months on what they believed to be a deserted island in the South Atlantic but turned out to be Matagorda Island, a few miles off the coast of Texas.

Upon returning to the mainland, Duke became entangled in Hollywood politics, encountering &quot;superagent&quot; Sid Kibbitz. Kibbitz represented Duke in negotiations for a John DeLorean biopic project entitled &quot;Fast Lanes, White Lines&quot;. In order to secure funding for the film, Duke became a cocaine dealer and was shortly thereafter arrested after trying to deal drugs with men who turned out to be federal agents.

While the strip was on hiatus from January 1983 to October 1984, the characters lived on in a Broadway production entitled &quot;Doonesbury: A Musical Comedy&quot;. Duke was found guilty of drug-dealing, sentenced to five years&#x27; probation, and required by the court to open and manage a drug rehabilitation center for that period. At the end of the musical, Duke&#x27;s efforts to seize the Walden Commune so it could be razed and the land used for the rehab center were thwarted, and Trudeau has stated in interviews and on the official website FAQ that both Duke and Honey were forced to flee the country afterwards.

Back in the strip, Duke opened the &quot;Baby Doc College of Offshore Medicine&quot; in Haiti, a grossly fraudulent medical school which was not above hosting a designer drug conference. One morning, Duke was discovered by Honey looking &quot;more inert than usual&quot; and pronounced dead, prompting the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; to run a full obituary in real life. However, a few days after his funeral, it was discovered that Duke had been zombified, dug out and taken into slavery by the deposed tyrant Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier, who renamed him &quot;Légume&quot; (&quot;vegetable&quot;). After reporter Rick Redfern recognized him during an interview of Duvalier, Zonker Harris bought &quot;Légume&quot;&#x27;s freedom using most of a recently acquired lottery fortune. Duke remained hairless for several years following his zombie period.

Back on his feet, Duke founded the &quot;Dr. Whoopee&quot; condom company to cash in on AIDS-induced panic, but lost control of it following a bad financial deal with John Gotti. After being briefly committed, he resurfaced as captain of Donald Trump&#x27;s executive cruise ship, the &quot;Trump Princess&quot;. During Duke&#x27;s captaincy, Honey returned to Beijing for a college reunion, which led to her inadvertent involvement in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Seeking refuge in the U.S. embassy after being named one of China&#x27;s &quot;25 most-wanted hooligans&quot;, Honey attracted the attention of Trump, who offered a million-dollar reward for her recovery as a &quot;symbol of freedom&quot;. Financial inducement succeeding where personal loyalty failed, Duke smuggled Honey out of China by marrying her, causing her delusions about their relationship to reach new levels. They divorced soon after.

At the decade&#x27;s end, Duke was tapped by President George H. W. Bush to serve as Maximum Proconsul in post-invasion Panama.

===1990s===
The first Gulf War found Duke smuggling arms to the underground resistance in Kuwait, then opening &quot;Club Scud&quot;, a popular wartime watering hole in Kuwait City. After working on David Duke&#x27;s campaign, he began selling doctored photos of the John F. Kennedy assassination in Dallas, Texas, to conspiracy theorists.

After the Republican revolution of 1994 Duke appealed to Speaker Newt Gingrich to help him open a low budget, privatized orphanage in Aspen called &quot;Nothin&#x27; But Orphans&quot;. This resulted in the discovery of an illegitimate son called Earl, who shares his father&#x27;s extreme views and absence of morality. Abandoning the orphans and Honey, father and son lived in a trailer park in Las Vegas, gaming and trafficking in stolen Beanie Babies.

Duke also spent some time in the early nineties as a bodyguard for Oliver North. North was slow to trust him, but Duke soon became a key part of his security during his campaign for senator in Virginia. The public office bug soon became a key part of Duke&#x27;s increasingly cal psyche.

Duke also found work as a bounty hunter, apprehending Zeke Brenner for jumping bail with the assistance of Earl.

===2000 and beyond===
Duke ran for the White House after a short stretch as a key advisor to Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. His campaign, headquartered in a motel in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, was a resounding failure, despite corporate sponsorships by heavy hitters Lipton Tea and Absolut Vodka. (Through the magic of motion capture technology, Duke was able to announce his candidacy in the real world on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;.) A successful business trafficking in stem cells was followed by a lucrative involvement in the messy fallout from the Enron scandal.

In March 2005, following the suicide of Hunter S. Thompson, the strip ran a tribute, with Uncle Duke lamenting the death of the man he called his &quot;inspiration&quot;. The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of Ralph Steadman, who illustrated several of Thompson&#x27;s works, including his 1971 novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;.

During the U.S. occupation of Iraq, Duke installed himself as mayor of the (fictional) Iraqi city of Al Amok by exploiting a power base of looters. In late September 2005, he, having been robbed of his new fortune, relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, to profit from the reconstruction efforts after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. There, after years of verbal abuse and neglect, Honey finally left Duke&#x27;s employ, though they would later cross paths again.

Duke was then contacted by his son, now a successful &quot;K Street lobbyist&quot; in Washington, D.C., and joined his firm as a partner. The pair lobby first in favor of Native American tribes, then the repressive regime of &quot;Greater Berzerkistan&quot;, a fictitious Central Asian country with a genocidal and megalomaniacal dictator called Trff Bmzklfrpz. During summer 2010 he also served as a mouthpiece for BP in conjunction with the Gulf oil leak.

== Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s reaction ==

Author and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, the obvious inspiration for Trudeau&#x27;s Uncle Duke character (Thompson originally wrote &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; under the pseudonym Raoul Duke; in a short sequence of Doonesbury strips, Uncle Duke desires to write a memoir about his shoplifting conviction, entitled, &quot;Fear And Loathing at Macy&#x27;s Menswear&quot;) said in numerous interviews that he was irritated and unhappy with the characterization. After being questioned about his reaction to the character during a 1977 lecture at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Thompson commented that &quot;some people grow up and want to be firemen, and some want to be president; nobody wants to grow up and be a cartoon character&quot;. He repeatedly stated that his anonymity as a journalist and his privacy as a citizen were lost &quot;largely due to our friend Trudeau,&quot; and said he had no desire to meet Trudeau &quot;because I might set the little bastard on fire.&quot; The two men apparently never did meet face to face. Toward the end of his life, Thompson reportedly told friends he had &quot;made peace&quot; with the Duke character, and it no longer bothered him.

<doc id="427056" wikidata="Q6206846" url="?curid=427056" title="Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003">
<text>The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (&quot;JGTRRA&quot;, , ), was passed by the United States Congress on May 23, 2003, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 28, 2003. Nearly all of the cuts (individual rates, capital gains, dividends, estate tax) were set to expire after 2010.

Among other provisions, the act accelerated certain tax changes passed in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, increased the exemption amount for the individual Alternative Minimum Tax, and lowered taxes of income from dividends and capital gains. The 2001 and 2003 acts are known together as the &quot;Bush tax cuts&quot;.

==Description of cuts==

JGTRRA continued on the precedent established by the 2001 EGTRRA, while increasing tax reductions on investment income from dividends and capital gains.

===Accelerated credits and rate reductions===

JGTRRA accelerated the gradual rate reduction and increase in credits passed in EGTRRA. The maximum tax rate decreases originally scheduled to be phased into effect in 2006 under EGTRRA were retroactively enacted to apply to the 2003 tax year. Also, the child tax credit was increased to what would have been the 2010 level, and &quot;marriage penalty&quot; relief was accelerated to 2009 levels. In addition, the threshold at which the alternative minimum tax applies was also increased.

===Investments===

JGTRRA increased both the percentage rate at which items can be depreciated and the amount a taxpayer may choose to expense under Section 179, allowing them to deduct the full cost of the item from their income without having to depreciate the amount.

In addition, the capital gains tax decreased from rates of 8%, 10%, and 20% to 5% and 15%. Capital gains taxes for those currently paying 5% (in this instance, those in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets) are scheduled to be eliminated in 2008. However, capital gains taxes remain at the regular income tax rate for property held less than one year.

Certain categories, such as collectibles, remained taxed at existing rates, with a 28% cap. In addition, taxes on &quot;qualified dividends&quot; were reduced to the capital gains levels. &quot;Qualified dividends&quot; includes most income from non-foreign corporations, real estate investment trusts, and credit union and bank &quot;dividends&quot; that are nominally interest.

==Tax bracket comparison==
The tax cuts enacted by this legislation were retroactive to January 1, 2003, and first applied to taxes filed for the 2003 tax year. These individual rate reductions were scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2011, along with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 unless further legislation was enacted to extend or make permanent its changes. This comparison shows how the ordinary taxable income brackets for each filing status were changed.

<doc id="427057" wikidata="Q800074" url="?curid=427057" title="E-ZPass">
<text>E-ZPass is an electronic toll collection system used on toll roads, toll bridges, and toll tunnels in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southeastern United States. The E-ZPass Interagency Group (IAG) consists of member agencies in several states, which use the same technology and allow travelers to use the same transponder on toll roads throughout the network.

Since its creation in 1987, various independent systems that use the same technology have been folded into the E-ZPass system, including the I-PASS in Illinois and the NC Quick Pass in North Carolina. Negotiations are ongoing for nationwide interoperability in the United States.

==Functionality==
===Technology===

E-ZPass tags are active RFID transponders, historically made by Kapsch TrafficCom (formerly Mark IV Industries Corp—IVHS Division) under a competitively bid contract. They communicate with reader equipment built into lane-based or open-road toll collection lanes by transmitting a unique radio signature. The most common type of tag is an &quot;internal tag&quot; that can be mounted on the inside of the vehicle&#x27;s windshield in proximity to the rear-view mirror. Though toll agencies advise adherence to the windshield with mounting strips (usually 3M&#x27;s Scotch brand &quot;Dual Lock&quot; fasteners), third-party options using trays with suction cups to adhere a pass to a windshield temporarily if used in multiple vehicles are available. Some vehicles have windshields that block RF signals; for those vehicles, historical vehicles, and customers who have aesthetic concerns, an external tag is offered, typically designed to attach to the vehicle&#x27;s front license plate mounting points.

Although a tag can be used with a motorcycle, usually no official instructions are given for mounting, due to the numerous variations between bike designs and the small area of a motorcycle windshield which could prove a hindrance if the transponder is attached following automobile instructions. Transponders may be put in a shirt or jacket pocket, if necessary.

The E-ZPass transponder works by listening for a signal broadcast by the reader stationed at the toll booth. This 915 MHz signal is sent at 500 kbit/s using the TDM (formerly IAG) protocol in 256-bit packets. Transponders use active Type II read/write technology. In April 2013, Kapsch (purchasers of Mark IV Industries) made the protocol available to all interested parties royalty-free in perpetuity and is granting the right to sublicense the protocol. Transponders are powered by a battery designed to last about 10 years. 

===Payment and tag types===
Some E-ZPass lanes are converted manual toll lanes and must have fairly low speed limits for safety reasons (between is typical), so that E-ZPass vehicles can merge safely with vehicles that stopped to pay a cash toll and, in some cases, to allow toll workers to safely cross the E-ZPass lanes to reach booths accepting cash payments. In some areas, however (typically recently built or retrofitted facilities), there is no need to slow down, because E-ZPass users can utilize dedicated traffic lanes (&quot;Express E-ZPass&quot; or &quot;open road tolling&quot;) that are physically separate from the toll-booth lanes. Examples include: 

Other roads in the E-ZPass system have eschewed toll booths altogether, and switched to all-electronic tolling. As vehicles pass at normal speed under toll collection gantries, tolls are collected either through the E-ZPass transponder or by billing the owner of the vehicle via automatic number-plate recognition. Examples include: 

Each E-ZPass tag is specifically programmed for a particular class of vehicle; while any valid working tag will be read and accepted in any E-ZPass toll lane, the wrong toll amount will be charged if the tag&#x27;s programmed vehicle class does not match the vehicle. This will result in a violation and possible large fine assessed to the tag holder, especially if a lower-class (e.g., passenger car) tag is being used in a higher-class vehicle such as a bus or truck. In an attempt to avoid this, E-ZPass tags for commercial vehicles are blue in color, contrasting with the white tags assigned to standard passenger vehicles. The blue E-ZPass is also used in government employee vehicles. In New York, an orange E-ZPass tag is issued to emergency vehicles as well as to employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York State Thruway Authority. New York also offers green-colored E-ZPass tags (and a 10% toll discount plan) to qualifying low-emission and zero-emission vehicles.

For purposes of interoperability, all agencies are connected to each other by a secure network (the &quot;reciprocity network&quot;). This network provides the means to exchange tag data and process toll transactions across the various agencies. Tag data is exchanged among the agencies on a nightly basis. This data can take up to 24 hours on the primary network the unit is issued by (e.g., the New York State Thruway or Illinois Tollway system), but may be delayed by as much as 72 hours on other networks.

===Expiry===
 this is a partial list of states that will expire an E-ZPass account for inactivity:

* New Hampshire: 24 months
* North Carolina: at 24 months they start charging a dollar a month and close the account when it runs out of money
* Virginia: 12 months 

===Retail availability===

Some issuing agencies offer a packaged E-ZPass transponder preloaded with toll funds sold over-the-counter at a retail setting such as a supermarket or pharmacy service desk that is valid immediately. A portion of the balance is available instantly; customers can access the remaining balance when they register their transponders with the issuing E-ZPass agency within several days of first using their E-ZPass.

===Usage===
According to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 83.4% of vehicles crossing its six bridges and tunnels used E-ZPass for toll payment during all of 2016. As of 2020, about 86% of vehicles along the Pennsylvania Turnpike use E-ZPass for payment of tolls. According to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, about 90% of vehicles on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway use E-ZPass.

==History==


===Creation===
The first E-ZPass system was implemented on December 17, 1996, at all toll collection facilities of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, including 7 bridges and 2 tunnels. The earliest test of what was then known as the Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) was conducted by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They tested AVI tags on Staten Island and utilized a paper voucher as a control which proved to be far less accurate than the tags. As a result of the test, the two agencies agreed to convene a larger group of the region&#x27;s toll authorities. Their initial idea was to develop independent systems that did not interfere with each other. TBTA suggested that there be a regionally cooperative system using a single tag, later forming the basis for regional cooperation. The tolling agencies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, which constitute two-thirds of the United States&#x27; $3-billion-a-year toll industry, met at an International Bridge, Tunnel and Toll Association (IBTTA) meeting to create a compatible electronic-tolling technology that could be used on the toll roads and bridges of the three states, in an effort to reduce congestion on some of the busiest roadways and toll plazas in the US.

In 1991, the Interagency Committee was created to develop, and involved the participation and cooperation of seven independent toll agencies: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the New Jersey Highway Authority (which, at the time, operated the Garden State Parkway), the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority), the New York State Thruway Authority, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (operator of the Atlantic City Expressway). The E-ZPass trademark, however, belongs to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority has been aggressive at protecting its trademark, including forcing the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to rename the &quot;EZ Pass&quot; regional transit pass to &quot;EZ transit pass&quot; to protect its rights.

The seven agencies started making plans to test two possible technologies for E-ZPass in 1992. The technologies would be installed along the Garden State Parkway and New York State Thruway. E-ZPass was first deployed on the Thruway at the Spring Valley toll plaza on August 3, 1993. Over the following three and a half years, the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) installed electronic toll-collection equipment, in stages, along the Thruway. By December 1996, it was implemented at all of the Thruway&#x27;s fixed-toll barriers, and by March 1998, E-ZPass was installed at all of the Thruway&#x27;s mainline exits.

The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which maintains all toll bridges and tunnels that begin and end in New York City, is the largest tolling agency by revenue in the United States ($1.9 billion in 2017). It began its E-ZPass implementation in 1995 and completed it at all nine of its toll facilities by January 1997. E-ZPass was popular among motorists who frequently used TBTA crossings, and by August 1996, nearly 2,000 motorists per day were signing up for E-ZPass. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates all bridges and tunnels between New York City and New Jersey, implemented E-ZPass at the George Washington Bridge in July 1997, and at the Holland Tunnel and Lincoln Tunnel in October 1997.

The Pennsylvania Turnpike planned to adopt E-ZPass by 1998; however, implementation of the system was postponed until December 2, 2000, when E-ZPass debuted on the turnpike between Harrisburg West and the Delaware River Bridge. By December 15, 2001, E-ZPass could be used on the entire length of the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to use the system beginning on December 14, 2002, and the entire Turnpike system was taking E-ZPass by 2006.

On October 6, 1998, a U.S. patent for an automated toll collection system was issued to Fred Slavin and Randy J. Schafer.

===Expansion===
Meanwhile, various other agencies began work on similar electronic toll collecting facilities. This resulted in the emergence of other networks:
* The MassPass system used in Massachusetts, changed to the compatible Fast Lane in 1998 and rebranded E-ZPass in 2012
* The I-Pass system used in Illinois
* The I-Zoom system used in Indiana, rebranded E-ZPass in 2012
* The Smart Tag system used in Virginia, merged with E-ZPass in 2004
* The TransPass system used in Maine, since replaced by the E-ZPass system
* The M-Tag system used in Maryland, integrated into and rebranded E-ZPass in 2001
* The Quick Pass system used in North Carolina, partially integrated in 2013 into the E-ZPass system.
* The E-Pass system in Florida, partially integrated in 2018
* The SunPass system in Florida, partially integrated in 2021
* The MnPass system in Minnesota, rebranded into E-ZPass in August 2021
* The PeachPass system used in Georgia, partially integrated with E-ZPass in November 2023.

Originally, these systems were not interchangeable with E-ZPass. However, since most of them use the same technology (or have since converted over to a compatible technology), all of them have been incorporated into the E-ZPass network. Though several still retain their own brand name for their own facilities, users of those systems can use E-ZPass and vice versa. As a result, all E-ZPass holders can use their transponders in any of the states that offer it.

The E-ZPass system continues to expand. The Indiana Toll Road Concession Company upgraded its toll plazas to include E-ZPass functionality on the Indiana East–West Toll Road, while the Ohio Turnpike Commission has upgraded its toll plazas in October 2009 for the Ohio Turnpike (I-76, I-80, I-90). On December 16, 2008, Rhode Island joined the network by activating E-ZPass lanes in the state&#x27;s only toll booth, at the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, which had a toll road system predating the E-ZPass system which was ended in 2006, announced at the end of July 2015 its entrance into the E-ZPass system as part of the financing for the Louisville-area Ohio River Bridges Project involving the new Abraham Lincoln (paired with the retrofitted Kennedy) and Lewis and Clark bridges.

On November 9, 2017, the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) announced that it was joining the E-ZPass group. CFX began accepting E-ZPass along its toll roads on September 1, 2018. On May 28, 2021, the Florida Turnpike Enterprise announced that its SunPass facilities would begin accepting E-ZPass. In addition, E-ZPass facilities began accepting SunPass Pro transponders (but not earlier SunPass transponders).

====Canada====
E-ZPass is generally not accepted in Canada but several exceptions exist. Until 2005, drivers crossing the Peace Bridge between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York, paid a toll before crossing to Canada. Following upgrades to the border crossings in 2005, drivers instead pay a toll on the Canadian side of the Peace Bridge after clearing Canadian customs. This is the first E-ZPass toll gantry outside of the United States. The toll goes to the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority, a bi-national agency responsible for maintaining the international bridge.

On August 11, 2014, E-ZPass began to be accepted at the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, Rainbow Bridge, and Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. The toll for the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge is paid in Canada after clearing Canadian customs, whereas the toll is paid before leaving the United States at the other two bridges. The toll from these three bridges goes to the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission.

On June 27, 2019, E-ZPass began to be accepted at the Thousand Islands Bridge on both the US side and Canada side.

While these facilities take both U.S. and Canadian cash, E-ZPass is only billable in U.S. dollars.

===Out-of-network systems===
E-ZPass ETC transponders do not work on all toll roads in the United States. Currently, the E-ZPass electronic toll-collection system (as well as the other ETC systems that are part of the E-ZPass network) are not compatible with California&#x27;s FasTrak, Kansas&#x27;s K-TAG, Oklahoma&#x27;s Pikepass, Texas&#x27;s TxTag, Utah&#x27;s Express Pass, Puerto Rico&#x27;s AutoExpreso, and Cruise Card, or other ETC systems outside of E-ZPass operating regions. Under MAP-21, passed in 2012, all ETC facilities in the United States were supposed to have some form of interoperability by October 1, 2016; however, no funding was provided for this effort, nor were penalties established for failure to meet this deadline, and this has yet to be accomplished.

In 2009, the Alliance for Toll Interoperability stated that it was exploring the option of using high-speed cameras to take photographs of the cars passing through non-E-ZPass lanes in other states. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, which had been studying going towards all-electronic tolling in order to cut costs, implemented such a system for non-E-ZPass users in 2020 due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.

==Variants==

===E-ZPass Plus===
For E-ZPass subscribers who replenish their accounts with a major credit card, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offers an E-ZPass option to pay for parking at three Port Authority airports—John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty—through a program known as E-ZPass Plus. This program is also available in New York at Albany International Airport in Albany; Syracuse Hancock International Airport in Syracuse; and the parking lots at the New York State Fair when the fair is in progress; as well as in Atlantic City, New Jersey, at Atlantic City International Airport, the New York Avenue Parking Garage, and the Atlantic City Surface Lot.

The parking payment is debited from the prepaid E-ZPass account if the parking fee is less than $20. If it is $20 or more, the amount is charged directly to the credit card used to replenish the E-ZPass account. The Port Authority reports that drivers save an average of 15 seconds by opting to pay for airport parking using E-ZPass.

Subscribers who replenish their E-ZPass accounts with cash or check cannot participate in this program. Additionally, , this service is only available to customers of the DelDOT, Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Delaware River and Bay Authority, in Delaware; of the New Hampshire DOT; in Maryland; in New Jersey and New York to customers of the PANYNJ, the New York MTA, or the NYS Thruway; and to customers of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.

===E-ZPass Flex===
In late 2012, the I-495 HOT (high occupancy toll) lanes in Virginia introduced the E-ZPass Flex transponder. E-ZPass Flex transponders work similarly to regular transponders, but they allow the driver to switch between HOV and toll-paying modes. When a transponder is switched to HOV mode, it is read by the HOT lane&#x27;s toll equipment, but no toll is charged. E-ZPass Flex also works like a standard E-ZPass on all other toll roads where E-ZPass is accepted, regardless of the position of the switch.

, E-ZPass Flex devices are currently issued only by Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota, and North Carolina. The following toll roads support E-ZPass Flex in HOV mode:

Minnesota:
* All toll facilities in the system are variable rate HOV lanes and use the Flex transponder. (Free for HOV 2+.)

North Carolina:
* I-77 Express Lanes (free for HOV 3+)
* E-ZPass Flex transponder has an additional one time cost associated

Virginia:
* I-495, I-395 and I-95 Express Lanes (free for HOV 3+)
* I-66 Express Lanes inside and outside the I-495 Beltway (free for HOV 3+)
* I-64 Express Lanes (free for HOV 2+)

Until April 2021, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York supported E-ZPass Flex in HOV mode, with a reduced toll for HOV 3+. MTA Bridges and Tunnels only issued the transponders to Staten Island residents. The MTA only offers discounted tolls to holders of New York transponders, so holders of Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina E-ZPass Flex devices had to pay the full toll regardless of their HOV status.

===E-PASS uni===
The Central Florida Expressway Authority offers E-PASS &#x27;uni&#x27; (originally E-PASS Xtra), which is compatible with E-ZPass as well as E-PASS, SunPass, LeeWay, PeachPass, NC QuickPass, RiverLink, I-PASS, and FastPass toll systems. It works on E-ZPass toll roads as well as all toll roads in Florida and Georgia. It does not, however, offer the E-ZPass Flex functionality noted above.

===SunPass Pro===
The SunPass system in Florida offers the SunPass Pro, with the same toll road compatibility as the E-Pass uni in addition to being accepted in Kansas, Oklahoma, and parts of Texas. It is meant for vehicles with 2 axles. Vehicles with 3 or more axles that will travel outside of Florida are required to purchase a NC Quick Pass instead.

==Effects==

===Reduced pollution and health improvement===
A study published in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Applied Economics&quot;, &quot;Traffic Congestion and Infant Health: Evidence from E-ZPass&quot;, compared fetal health outcomes for mothers living near congested and uncongested toll plazas on three major highways in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The researchers focused on areas where toll plazas had instituted E-ZPass, which, because cars travel through more efficiently, diminishes congestion and pollution. The study drew its conclusions by looking at the health outcomes of nearly 30,000 births among mothers who lived within two kilometers of an E-ZPass toll plaza. The researchers state that their findings &quot;suggest that the adoption of E-ZPass was associated with significant improvements of infant health.&quot; The study&#x27;s specific findings were: 1) In areas where E-ZPass was adopted, rates of infant prematurity decreased by between 6.7% and 9.1%; this means that, out of the sample studied, 255 preterm births were likely avoided; 2) Introduction of E-ZPass was correlated with a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight by between 8.5% and 11.3%; that means 275 cases of low birth weight may have been avoided.

===Increased home values and subsequent public opinion ramifications===
Another study published in &quot;Research in Transportation Economics&quot;, &quot;The impact of a transportation intervention on electoral politics: Evidence from E-ZPass&quot;, compared changes in home values in areas that switched from manual tolls to E-ZPass compared to similar areas that did not receive the E-ZPass intervention. Using a research design known as difference in differences, the researchers found that traffic indeed was reduced in E-ZPass areas compared to control areas (an average decrease of about 10% in daily commute times). As a consequence, areas near E-ZPasses become more attractive to homeowners, with an estimated resulting increase in home values of $50,185 compared to control areas. The authors then document a 2.37 percentage point decrease in Democratic vote share in the associated E-ZPass areas, which they argue with survey data was largely due to heightened concern around taxation in the areas experiencing the newfound property wealth.

===Privacy concerns===

Civil liberties and privacy rights advocates have expressed concern about how the position data gathered through E-ZPass is used. , several states that employ E-ZPass had provided electronic toll information in response to court orders in civil cases, including divorces and other non-criminal matters.

Position data is collected by antennas at locations in addition to fee collection locations. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), for example, collect transponder information to provide real-time estimates of travel times between common destinations. By subtracting the time when vehicles pass under the first sign from the current time, the sign can display the expected travel time between the sign and the destination point ahead. This information is also used to determine the best times to schedule maintenance-related lane closures and for other traffic management purposes. According to NYSDOT, the individual tag information is encrypted, and is deleted as soon as the vehicle passes the last reader, and is never made available to the department.

==Accounts and agencies==

Within the IAG, each member agency has its own billing and customer service center, and each establishes its own fee and discount structures. The agencies also set their own customer account policies. Areas of variation include the refundable deposit or nonrefundable charge for a tag, periodic maintenance fees, paper statement fees, the low account threshold, and replenishment amounts. E-ZPass is usually offered as a debit account: tolls are deducted from prepayments made by the users. Users may opt to have prepayments automatically deposited when their account is low, or they may submit prepayments manually, either by phone or a toll authority&#x27;s web portal, depending on the agency. For commercial accounts, some agencies allow postpaid plans with a security deposit (which effectively renders them prepaid accounts, with a different replenishment policy).

==Fees and discounts by state==

Some agencies have imposed periodic account maintenance fees on their subscribers. After New Jersey began losing money with the E-ZPass system, a monthly account fee of one dollar was implemented on July 15, 2002 and is still in effect for both individual and business accounts. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also charges a monthly individual account fee of one dollar. On July 1, 2009, the Maryland Transportation Authority began charging a fee of $1.50 a month to account holders which, , only applies to non-residents and is waived if three Maryland E-ZPass tolls were incurred during the previous month.

The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) in New York City once imposed a monthly account fee starting on July 1, 2005, claiming to defray the administrative costs. However, New York State Assembly Bill A06859A in 2005 and 2006 and Senate Bill S6331 in 2006 both considered such a fee threatening the efficiency to move traffic faster with lower tolls and sought to ban it. When the New York State Law started to ban the monthly account fee, the TBTA repealed it on June 1, 2006, and those, especially New Jerseyans, seeking New York accounts and avoiding the monthly fee still imposed by New Jersey and Port Authority, would have to apply for the TBTA or the New York State Thruway accounts at an E-ZPass New York Service Center.

Several agencies offer discounted tolls to E-ZPass customers. The details vary widely, and can include general discounts for all E-ZPass users, variable pricing discounts for off-peak hours, commuter plans with minimum usage levels, flat rate plans offering unlimited use for a period of time, carpool plans for high-occupancy vehicles, and resident plans for those living near particular toll facilities. Many of these plans are available only to customers whose tags are issued by the agency that owns the toll facility in question (reciprocity applies to tag acceptance, not to discounts). Eight authorities in the Northeast (Maine, the Massachusetts Turnpike, the New Hampshire Turnpike, Rhode Island, the New York TBTA, the New York State Thruway, the New Jersey Turnpike, DelDOT and Maryland) restrict their general discounts to their own respective tagholders. While the Delaware Memorial Bridge once restricted its discount plans to New Jersey tags despite its toll plaza being located in Delaware, as of May 2019, all New Jersey and Delaware DoT issued E-ZPass passenger vehicle accounts receive a 25 cent discount at this bridge facility.

Some agencies charge a one-time fee between $10 and $30 for each new transponder, including the Delaware Department of Transportation, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, and the Maine Turnpike Authority. At least two agencies, the Delaware River and Bay Authority and the Maryland Transportation Authority, once charged multiple fees. In a press release dated July 17, 2007, the DRBA stated: &quot;Beginning January 1, 2008, all DRBA E-ZPass account holders will be charged an account management fee of $1.50 per month. The transponder cost will also be passed on to E-ZPass customers for each new transponder.&quot; E-ZPass New York charges a monthly fee of 50 cents for each tag in connection with a business account. The DRBA since merged its service center with New Jersey&#x27;s E-ZPass service center. On July 1, 2015, a plan put forth by Governor Larry Hogan eliminated Maryland&#x27;s monthly fee (except accounts without a Maryland address, unless using Maryland toll facilities at least three times in the previous statement period) along with decreasing some toll rates especially for Maryland-issued E-ZPass tags.

E-ZPass users are not required to maintain their account with an agency in their home state (or if in a toll-free state, the closest one to them). Subscribers can open an E-ZPass account with any member of the IAG regardless of residency. This means that users have the option of choosing an agency based on the fees that it charges, effectively allowing them to circumvent transponder and account maintenance fees.

===Parking===
Although not part of the E-ZPass-Plus program, E-ZPass users may also pay for parking at Pittsburgh International Airport. The E-ZPass transponder is used for identification only. The Southern Beltway, which also uses E-ZPass, has its western terminus at the airport.

The New York State Fair offered E-ZPass Plus as a payment option at two of its parking lots for the first time in 2007, and offered the service again for subsequent seasons. The service was administered by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), and motorists&#x27; E-ZPass accounts were charged the same $5 parking fee that cash customers were charged. Unlike other E-ZPass Plus implementations, the State Fair systems charged motorists at the parking lot entrances; drivers opting to pay by E-ZPass Plus used dedicated &quot;E- ZPass Plus Only&quot; lanes. Since the lots only charge for parking during the twelve days of the State Fair, mobile, self-contained E-ZPass units were used to process vehicles. The units were mounted on trailers with a collapsible gantry for the E-ZPass antennas, used a cellular wireless connection to send transactions to the NYSTA back-office system, and were powered by batteries that were kept replenished by photovoltaic solar panels, with a generator for backup. This service seems to be still existent (as the E-ZPass website lists the State Fair as part of its Plus program).

E-ZPass can be used to pay for parking at the Route 128 station in Westwood, Massachusetts; this is available for Massachusetts customers only. E-ZPass can also be used to pay for parking at John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York City as well as Newark Liberty International Airport.

===Drive-thru retail===
E-ZPass was tested in a since-discontinued program by some McDonald&#x27;s restaurants on Long Island, New York, at which drive-through customers were given the option to pay using their E-ZPass accounts to test out cardless payment platforms. In late 2013, Wendy&#x27;s started a similar system called drive-thru that is E-ZPass compatible, and it underwent testing at five Staten Island Wendy&#x27;s locations. In 2018, a one-year pilot project with the startup Verdeva was announced to test drive-thru and gas station payments via separate accounts set up with the E-ZPass system.

In December 2021, PayByCar launched a pilot program to accept E-ZPass (or its own RFID stickers) at 27 Alltown gas stations in the Boston area.

===Non-transactional traffic monitoring===
E-ZPass transponders are also used to monitor traffic. A transponder-reader is placed above the roadway at various intervals, and the time a particular tag takes between scans at each interval provides information about the speed of traffic between those points. This transit time information is often relayed back to motorists via electronic signs on the roadway or via traffic reporting agencies who use the information as part of radio and television traffic reports. The individual tag data is not collected or used for ticketing purposes, as some sources have suggested.

==Toll facilities that do not accept E-ZPass in E-ZPass states and provinces==
There are many toll facilities, mostly bridges run by independent authorities, that are not part of the E-ZPass network even though they are in a state that is in the E-ZPass region. With Congress seeking a national electronic toll-collection system in place for federal highways, E-ZPass officials are talking to other states that have electronic tolls &quot;to find a common way to do business&quot;. However, the congressional legislation did not include any penalties for agencies and states that failed to comply with the implementation of such a system. , most Florida and Minnesota toll facilities had become compatible with E-ZPass. Georgia toll roads were in the process of becoming compatible by 2022. Other states, like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, California, and Washington were not scheduled to become compatible with E-ZPass in the near future.

===List of facilities===
*Anderson Ferry (Ohio/Kentucky)
*Augusta Ferry (Ohio/Kentucky)
*Cape May–Lewes Ferry (Delaware/New Jersey)
*Downbeach Express (New Jersey)
*Dingman&#x27;s Ferry Bridge (New Jersey/Pennsylvania)
*Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge (Minnesota/Ontario) - cash only toll booth paid by Canada bound vehicles on US side before crossing bridge
*Fort Madison Toll Bridge (Illinois/Iowa)
*Gasparilla Bridge (Florida)
*Greenspring Low Water Toll Bridge (West Virginia/Maryland)
*Hammock Dunes Bridge (Florida)
*Highway 407 (Ontario) - utilizes their own transponder-based system
*Moseywood Road (Lake Harmony, Pennsylvania) – Toll paid upon entry to community. Provides a shortcut to Lake Harmony from Pennsylvania Route 940 to Pennsylvania Route 903
*Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge (New York/Ontario) - toll booth on US side after passing CBP control point
*Seaway International Bridge (New York/Ontario) - toll booth found in Canada for in bound traffic from US and US bound traffic from Canada.
*St. Francisville Bridge – Old Wabash Cannonball Railroad (Illinois-Indiana)
*Wayne Six Toll Bridge (West Virginia/Ohio) – Privately owned

In Michigan, the Ambassador Bridge, Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, Blue Water Bridge, Mackinac Bridge, International Bridge, and Grosse Ile Toll Bridge do not use E-ZPass.

<doc id="427063" wikidata="Q1111176" url="?curid=427063" title="United Liberation Front of Asom">
<text>The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) is an armed separatist insurgent organisation operating in the Northeast Indian state of Assam. It seeks to establish an independent sovereign nation state of Assam for the indigenous Assamese people through an armed struggle in the Assam conflict. The Government of India banned the organisation in 1990 citing it as a terrorist organisation, while the United States Department of State lists it under &quot;other groups of concern&quot;.

According to ULFA sources, it was founded on 7 April 1979 at Rang Ghar and began operations in 1990. Sunil Nath, former Central Publicity Secretary and spokesman of ULFA has stated that the organisation established ties with the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland in 1983 and with the Burma based Kachin Independent Army in 1987. Military operations against the ULFA by the Indian Army began in 1990 and continue into the present. On 5 December 2009, the chairman and the deputy commander-in-chief of ULFA was taken into Indian custody. In 2011, there was a major crackdown on the ULFA in Bangladesh, which greatly assisted the government of India in bringing ULFA leaders to talks. In January 2010, ULFA softened its stance and dropped demands for independence as a condition for talks with the Government of India.

On 3 September 2011, a tripartite agreement for &quot;Suspension of Operations&quot; agreement was signed by the Indian government, the Assam government and the ULFA.

On November 1, 2018, suspected militants of the United Liberation Front of Asom (Independent) killed five people and injured one in Tinsukia district, Assam. The attackers, reportedly traveling on motorcycles, opened fire on a group of young Bengali-speaking workers playing ludo at a dhaba in Kherbari village. The group&#x27;s actions reflect a xenophobic stance, particularly hostile towards non-Assamese communities.

==History==
The ULFA was founded on 7 April 1979 in Sivasagar, Assam by a group of young men that included Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, Anup Chetia, Bhupen Borgohain, Pradip Gogoi, Bhadreshwar Gohain and Budheswar Gogoi. The organisation&#x27;s purpose was to engage in an armed struggle to form a separate independent state of Assam.

During its heyday in the late 80s and 90s, it enjoyed popularity among many of the indigenous Assamese people of the Brahmaputra valley. The majority of the supporters felt that a powerful organization was necessary to get the voice of a peripheral region heard in the corridors of power in Lutyen&#x27;s Delhi. But gradually, the organisation&#x27;s emphasis on extortion and smuggling of weapons in the name of furthering the &#x27;revolution&#x27; led to mindless violence throughout the state. It witnessed a period marked by growing disillusionment and anger amid supporters. In their bloody conflict with the security forces, many innocent civilians were killed and several thousand were permanently maimed. It is estimated that more than 10 thousand local youths perished during that turbulent period. In the process, owing to the twin factors of increasing operations by the security forces and dwindling support among its core sympathisers, ULFA&#x27;s importance in Assam has been declined drastically.

Recruiting for the front did not begin until 1983. Soon after it finished recruitment in 1984, it began to seek out training and arms procurement from other groups such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). In 1986 it launched a fundraising &quot;campaign&quot; across India by way of extortion. It then began to set up camps in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh but was soon declared a terrorist organization by the government on 7 November, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

In less than a decade of its formation, the ULFA emerged as one of the most powerful and violent insurgent outfit in Southeast Asia, largely because of the immense popularity it enjoyed during the first decade of its struggle as well as its economic power which in turn helped it in bolstering its military capabilities. In the early 1990s, ULFA launched an aggressive campaign with victims such as security forces, political opponents, and blasting rail links. In July 1991 the front captured and held 14 people for ransom, included in the abductees was an engineer and a national of the Soviet Union. From the 1990s on the ULFA have continued to carry out attacks.
Till the late 2000s, it maintained a number of camps in Bangladesh, where members are trained and sheltered away from Indian security forces. In April 2004, Bangladesh police and Coast Guard intercepted massive amounts of illegal arms and ammunition, at Chittagong, being loaded into 10 trucks and intended for ULFA. A total of 50 were charged with arms smuggling and arms offenses, including former high-level Bangladesh political appointees including Bangladesh National Party ministers and National Security Intelligence military officers, as well as prominent businessmen, and Paresh Baruah, military wing chief of ULFA who was then living in Dhaka. He fled the country. Trials were still underway in Chittagong in 2012 under tight security.

They had also maintained camps in Bhutan, which were destroyed by the Royal Bhutan Army aided by the Special Frontier Force in December 2003. These camps housed combatants and non-combatant families of ULFA members.

ULFA maintained close relationships with other separatist organisations like NDFB, KLO and NSCN (Khaplang).

In 2008, News Services reported citing Indian police and intelligence officials reported ULFA&#x27;s commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah had taken refuge in Yunnan Province of China, along China-Myanmar border, due to continuous defeat of his Organization. The report also stated that a small batch of militants had also taken refuge along with him. Paresh Baruah had previously visited China in the 1980s. In December 2003, China spurned ULFA&#x27;s chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa appeal to provide safe passage to the rebels from Bhutan.

===Secret killings of the family members of militants ===

During the government of AGP leader Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, as a part of his government&#x27;s counter-insurgency strategy, unidentified gunmen had assassinated a number of family members of ULFA leaders. With the fall of this government following elections in 2001, the secret killings stopped. Dinesh Barua, the elder brother of Paresh Barua, was taken from his house at night by unidentified Assamese men, Later his body was found lying near a cremation center in Chabua. ULFA&#x27;s self-styled Publicity Secretary, Mithinga Daimary, also had his five family members killed during this period.

Government investigations into the killings culminated in the report of the &quot;Saikia Commission&quot;, presented to the Assam Assembly on 15 November 2007. The report describes how the killings were organised by Prafulla Mahanta, then the Assam Home Minister. They were executed by the police. The gunmen were former members of ULFA who had surrendered to the government. They approached their targets at home, at night, knocking on the door and speaking in Assamese to allay suspicion. When the victims answered the door, they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.

==Organizational structure==
During the 1990s and 2000s, the total strength of ULFA was stated to be around 3,000, while various other sources put the figure ranging from 4,000 to 6,000. A military wing of the ULFA, the Sanjukta Mukti Fouj (SMF) was formed on 16 March 1996.

SMF had formed three full-fledged so-called battalions: the 7th, 28th, and the 709th. While remaining battalions exist only on paper at best they have the strengths of a company or so. Their allocated spheres of operation are as follows:

*7th Bn (HQ-Sukhini) is responsible for defence of General Headquarters (GHQ).
*8th Bn – Nagaon, Morigaon, Karbi Anglong
*9th Bn – Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar
*11th Bn – Kamrup, Nalbari
*27th Bn – Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar 
*28th Bn – Tinsukia, Dibrugarh 
*709th Bn – Kalikhola

===Command Structure===
===Enigma Force===
Enigma Force or Enigma Group was an exclusive and near autonomous striking group of the ULFA. It is known to a few top leaders of the outfit and the cadres were isolated from the others. It was designed for hit and run type of operations. It was headed by the Raju Baruah.

==Activities==

===Assassinations===
On 29 July 1990, the Superintendent of Police (SP) of the Dibrugarh district Daulat Singh Negi (IPS) and his PSO and driver were killed by an ambush in Lahoal of Dibrugarh district by the ULFA.

Some of the major assassinations by ULFA include that of Surendra Paul in May 1990, the brother of businessman Lord Swraj Paul, that precipitated a situation leading to the sacking of the Government of Assam under Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and the beginning of Operation Bajrang.

On the ULFA&#x27;s Army Day on 16 March 2003, an IED explosion under a bus on National Highway No. 7 killed six civilians and wounded approximately 55 others.

In 1991 a Russian engineer, and national of the Soviet Union was kidnapped along with others and killed. In 1997, Sanjay Ghose, a social activist and a relative of a high ranking Indian diplomat, was kidnapped and killed. The highest government officer assassinated by the group was local Asom Gana Parishad minister Nagen Sarma in 2000. An unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on AGP Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in 1997. A mass grave, discovered at a destroyed ULFA camp in Lakhipathar forest, showed evidence of executions committed by ULFA.

In 2003, the ULFA was accused of killing labourers from Bihar in response to an alleged molestation of a Mizo girl in a train passing through Bihar. This incident sparked off anti-Bihari sentiment in Assam and ULFA saw it as an opportunity to regain its lost ground. The ULFA killed civilians of Bihari origin and other outsiders of mainland India.

In 2003, during a Railways Recruitment Board Examination for Group (D) posts conducted by Northeast Frontier Railway zone a wing of Indian Railways, a good number of candidates from Bihar and other states were beaten up and stopped from taking the exam by some elements who were seeking 100 percent reservations for unemployed indigenous Assamese people in the said test.

In resentment, conflicts arose with train passengers from North Eastern Indians states passing through some of the stations like Katihar, Jamalpur, Kishanganj in Bihar.

During that period ULFA was already losing its popularity and ground across many pockets in Assam where it had strongholds. However, ULFA took this situation as an opportunity to fan an opposition against &#x27;India&#x27; among people in Assam. They started killing Hindi-speaking people mostly having origin in Bihar in the State.

On 15 August 2004, an explosion occurred in Dhemaji District of Assam in which 13 people died, mainly women and school children. This explosion was carried out by ULFA. The ULFA has obliquely accepted responsibility for the blast. This appears to be the first instance of ULFA admitting to public killings with an incendiary device.

In January 2007, the ULFA once again struck in Assam killing approximately 62 Hindi-speaking migrant workers mostly from Bihar. ULFA notoriety as a directionless and unpopular organisation increased, as the bomb blast victims also included several indigenous Assamese people.

The Central Government made a tough response, forcing a dreaded group of ULFA – 28 Battalion to unilaterally bow down and seek asylum from the government. This particular one-sided ceasefire broke the backbone of ULFA.

On 15 March 2007, ULFA triggered a blast in Guwahati, injuring six persons as it celebrated its &#x27;army day&#x27;.

===Economic subversion===
The ULFA has claimed responsibility for bombings of economic targets like crude oil pipelines, freight trains and government buildings, including 7 August 2005 attack on oil pipelines in Assam. ULFA carried out a bombing and destruction of a five million-liter petrol reservoir at Digboi refinery in Tinsukia, with an estimated property loss of Rs 200million. On the same day they also damaged a gas pipeline in the oil district of Tinsukia.
===Recruitment===
In the initial years of the ULFA movement (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both urban and rural areas of Assam among the indigenous Assamese people), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Northern and Upper Assam and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late Heerak Jyoti Mahanta hailed from a place which is just a few kilometres from Guwahati. However, with the educated Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA&#x27;s method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the predominantly backward areas of predominantly marginalised indigenous communities for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam. The Ulfa also has strong following among the Naga people in Assam.

===Political activities===
After 1985 and before it was banned in 1990, ULFA was credited in the media with many public activities. It has continued a public discourse of sorts through the local media (newspapers), occasionally publishing its position on political issues centred around the nationality question. It has participated in public debates with public figures from Assam. During the last two local elections, the ULFA had called for boycotts. Media reports suggest that it used its forces to intimidate activists and supporters of the then-ruling parties (Congress and AGP respectively).

===Extortion===
The ULFA is credited with some bank robberies during its initial stages. Now it is widely reported to extort businessmen, bureaucrats and politicians for collecting funds. In 1997, the Chief Minister of Assam accused Tata Tea of paying the medical bills of the ULFA cultural secretary Pranati Deka at a Mumbai hospital.

===Other criminal activities===
The ULFA is involved in other organised criminal activities such as drug trafficking.

==Peace Negotiations and Surrenders==
Beginning in 1990, the Government of India has attempted to wean away members of the ULFA. This occurred due to the death of the ULFA&#x27;s deputy Commander in chief Heerak Jyoti Mahanta on 31 December 1991. He had opposed surrenders, but they began after his death. The group has been meeting more local opposition as residents are tired of the violence and disruption, and some energy has gone out of the movement.

In 1992 a large section of second-rung leaders and members surrendered to government authorities. These former members were allowed to retain their weapons to defend against their former colleagues; they were offered bank loans without any liabilities to help them re-integrate into society. This loose group, now called SULFA, has become an important element in the armed politics and business of Assam.

The total number of ULFA militants to have laid down arms has gone up to 8,718. 4,993 cadres surrendered between 1991 and 1998. 3,435 surrendered between 1998 and 2005, when a new policy to deal with the ULFA was unveiled. On 24 January 2012, one of northeast India&#x27;s biggest surrender ceremonies took place in Assam&#x27;s main city of Guwahati, when a total of 676 militants laid down their weapons. In 2020, 1,675 militants of ULFA(I) and allied militant groups surrendered.

In 2003, ULFA had put forward a set of three preconditions for talks and negotiations with the Indian government. Thought government had rejected these preconditions. The preconditions were:

# The talks should be held in a third country.
# The talks should be held under United Nations supervision.
# The agenda of the talks should include the independence of Assam.

Despite dropping the first two key preconditions in 2004 and expressing readiness for talks, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) faced an Indian government unwilling to negotiate on sovereignty. However, progress emerged when ULFA formed the &quot;People&#x27;s Consultative Group&quot; (PCG) in September 2005, aiming to pave the way for negotiations. The government welcomed this initiative. Following sustained army operations in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, ULFA suffered significant losses in leadership, personnel, and infrastructure, prompting their return to the negotiating table in 2005. According to The Times of India, initial talks occurred at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#x27;s residence in December 2005. Three rounds of peace talks with the 11-member PCG, led by Assamese writer Indira Goswami, resulted in a temporary truce in August 2006. However, the truce collapsed by September 23 due to ULFA&#x27;s resumption of violent activities against civilians, primarily targeting tea estates and oil pipelines. They also violated the ceasefire by attacking army columns.

On 24 June 2008, some leaders and cadres of the A and C companies of ULFA declared unilateral ceasefire at a press meet held at Amarpur in Tinsukia district. They declared the ceasefire to pressure the top brass of ULFA to sit on negotiation table with the Government of India. But the top brass of ULFA expelled the leaders of 28 Battalion led by Mrinal Hazarika and Jiten Dutta (who had managed to escape from the cordon of Indian Army in Dibru Saikhowa National Park). The group later renamed as ULFA (Pro-talk).

Lt Bijoy Chinese alias Bijoy Das, Commander of 28th Battalion also surrendered to state authorities in 2013.

Between 2009 and 2018, entire leadership of ULFA was either Captured or surrendered to the government thus leading to disbanding of the all ULFA battalions, besides only part of 27th battalion renamed as Kapili Gut remained. Currently, there are no commanders other than Paresh Baruah. All the others have been downgraded to staff and workers. As per the leaders of the insurgent group, the crackdown against Indian insurgent groups by the Awami league government in Bangladesh pushed them towards joining peace talks with the Indian government in 2011.

In December 2023, a peace accord was signed by the Indian Central government, the Assam government and the pro-talks faction of ULFA, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa. This resulted in the disbandment of ULFA, the vacating of all designated camps, and the surrender of 8,200 cadres. The accord carried a Rs 1.5 lakh crore financial package, which includes setting up of an IIM and an IISER, new railway and national highways in the state. Paresh Barua, leader of the anti-talks faction of the ULFA, termed the tripartite peace agreement signed with the pro-talks faction of the outfit as &#x27;shameful&#x27; and was unwilling to come to the negotiating table unless the issue of &#x27;Assam&#x27;s sovereignty&#x27; is discussed.

The ULFA(I) faction who is not part of the peace deal, which has around 200 members are still active in their camps in Myanmar.

==Beyond the Binary==
This multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious land has captured both strength and fragility over the years. There are numerous facts here that have a long historical connection with violence in the state- the long history of this region, the feelings of in-group-out-group, perceived marginalisation, and “ minority – consciousness ” have variously surfaced as key factors causing ethnic unrest. Depending on varied influences of marginality and ethnicity, some movements remained more explicit and specific than others in articulating and defining their objectives so strategies of operation correspondingly varied. It has a history of violent ethnic conflicts since independence and this history of such balkanization was not a smooth one resulting in the different level of violence in the name of ethnic assertions. 

The struggle between the ULFA and the Indian state has been responsible for large-scale violence in the region for the last three decades. They had a growing body of youth joining every year, almost 250–300 every year. These youths, felt frustrated, cheated and ignored by the government, which often comes to power on the promise of safeguarding ‘jati, mati and bheti‘ (caste, land and base), has become a perfect opportunity for rebel groups like ULFA, to bank on and invest in these youths by attracting them to their ideology. 

In John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice suggests that is the prime basis of all governments and through various means governments have to ensure justice. That is, to have liberty and equality in creating a just society. The theory highlights the continued resource problem of the state- which has been on since the Assam Accord (demand of the oil refineries to generate jobs for the Assamese people while the centre’s motives were to move it out of the state, eg- The Barauni refinery and the Noonmati refinery). 

The issue of the environment is extremely important for Assam. Rhinos and elephants poached in the state do not move far away from the allegedly ‘protector’ itself, most of the time government officials are involved in the illegal movement of body parts and other wildlife materials. Administrative failure is quite prominent in the state and Mary Kaldor’s New Wars helps understand contemporary struggles- where she asserts that there are few aspects which separate them from old conflicts or the old style meaning of fighting. Some of these features include pronounced identity politics, human rights abuses, strong presence of the paramilitary, and that these new conflicts take place within the context of criminality, corruption and administrative failure.

But, the question itself states a very important part of this violence- which is that in a democracy certain groups of people had to reach to a point where they chose to give their blood rather than their land. Ted Robert Gurr’s approach relative deprivation addresses a central question: “what brings a group to a stage where it chooses to exercise political violence in anti-institutional action?” It helps focus on the group’s objective deprivation but rather on its subjective feelings of deprivation. which is essential to understand that political viciousness proceeds as an indistinguishable piece of the human experience.

<doc id="427065" wikidata="Q1465915" url="?curid=427065" title="Nissan Navara">
<text>The is a nameplate used for Nissan pickup trucks with D21, D22, D40 and D23 model codes. The nameplate has been used in Australia, New Zealand, Central America, South America, Asia, Europe, and South Africa. In North, Central and South America and some selected markets, it is marketed as the [[Nissan Frontier (North America)|Nissan Frontier]] or Nissan NP300.

After more than ten years with the D21, Nissan unveiled the similar sized D22. It was replaced with the bigger, taller, longer D40 mid-size pickup. In 2014, Nissan released its successor, the D23, for international markets other than the U.S. and Canada. For these markets, it received the D41 Frontier in 2021 to replace the D40.

The Navara gets its name from the Navarre region of northern Spain. The European version was built at the Nissan Motor Ibérica factory in Barcelona.

== D21 series (1985) ==


The D21 generation was the successor to the Datsun 720, sold as the Nissan Datsun Truck in Japan. The name Navara was used in some markets such as Australia / New Zealand.

Unlike previous generations, this model was available worldwide in two body styles. The &quot;A&quot; body was designed in Japan, and was available in single or dual cab variants, while the &quot;S&quot; body King Cab was designed in the United States, at Nissan&#x27;s styling studios in San Diego, California. Each version had unique front styling, with the American version having a different bonnet, and wider flared front guards. In a few countries, such as Australia, both versions were sold. This was also assembled in Greece for the local market, where it was marketed as the Nissan Pickup and King Cab.


== First generation (D22; 1997) ==


The D22 is a compact size pick up truck manufactured from 1997 to current, Nissan continue to build the D22 as a cheaper alternative to the D40 in many markets. Originally planned to follow the D21 Hard Body in being designed by Nissan Design International in La Jolla, CA, design of the D22 was reluctantly given to Japan during the 1994–1995 period. This was due to NDI being busy with many design projects for concepts and models, such as the Quest (VX54 II), Altima (L30), and Maxima (A32.5). Design of an updated D22 was eventually given to NDI in 1998.

=== North America ===
US production of the Frontier at the Smyrna, Tennessee plant began in 1997 with a 2-door regular cab and 2-door King Cab. A 4-door version of the D22 was designed and developed during 1997–1998, being first produced in April 1999 and launched in May 1999 in the US as the 2000 Frontier Crew Cab. Engines fitted were the petrol (KA24DE) and, for export only, the diesel TD27 (2wd and 4wd) with 5-speed manual transmission. These models were also exported to Central and South America.

A special Desert Runner model was offered in 1999 for the 2000 MY. It was a 2WD King Cab model built on the 4WD frame, which gave it a boost in ride height, larger tires, and a 4- or 5-speed transmission. For 2001 the Desert Runner got a new look and a supercharged version of the V6 engine.

=== Facelift ===
In February 2000 at the Chicago Auto Show, Nissan introduced a facelifted D22 Frontier for 2001, with bolder styling in an effort to make it more appealing to younger buyers in its second generation. The regular cab would be discontinued after the 2001 MY. Sales and production started in North America, with Crew Cab and King Cab versions and new grille, bumper, headlights, taillights. Other body changes included built in fender flares and tailgates.

The D22s badged as &quot;Frontier&quot; had different grille, tailgate details and interior in contrast to the D22s badged as &quot;Navara&quot;.

The D22 was no longer sold in Japan after 2002. Due to incompatible taxation rules and plummeting popularity of pickup trucks in Japan, Nissan discontinued it in their home market with no replacement afterwards, a fate shared by many of its competitors there.

The Egyptian plant exports to the Middle East, and a South African plant to African countries. Mexican production started in 2008: D22 truck Single Cab Chassis and Long Bed (2WD or 4WD, 2.4-litre petrol or diesel), Crew Cab (2WD and petrol) called the D22 Pickup.

In 2009, the D22 was updated with redesigned exterior door handles.

In June 2017, Peugeot announced to produce the &quot;Peugeot Pick-Up&quot; for Northern African states. It is equipped with a 2.5-litre inline-four turbo-diesel, producing and , 5-speed manual transmission, rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive, with optional gear reduction. It is a badge engineered version of the Dongfeng Rich, which has a partnership with PSA. It comes as a Crew Cab (5 passengers) short bed (1.40 m x 1.39 m cargo area) version (5.08 m in length) with a payload of 815 kg. Market introduction started in September 2017.

==== Australia ====
For the Australian market, the D22 Navara ran as a series 1 from the end of the D21 until 2001, when a series 2 was released with a new ZD30 Diesel engine and updated front end. The ZD30 powered D22&#x27;s were fairly reliable unlike the petrol counterparts, but were replaced in 2007 with an upgraded Common Rail 2.5L Diesel engine. The D22 Navara was run in parallel with the larger D40 until 2015. Both were replaced by the D23 Navara - locally known as the NP300 Navara as of 2015.

==== Brazil ====
The Brazilian Nissan plant started production around 2002 (Crew Cab Diesel 2WD or 4WD, five-speed manual, or single cab 2WD diesel. Only for Mexican market: petrol 2.4-litre manufactured in Mexico) and it was exported to Argentina (all Brazilian versions) and Mexico (Crew Cab, petrol 2.4-litre, 2WD, five-speed manual).

==== Bolivia ====
Nissan Bolivia imported from Japan the Nissan Frontier D22 Crew Cab, 2.4-litre petrol or diesel, 4WD. Imported from Mexico, the D22 Crew Cab and single cab long bed, petrol 2WD. Some Frontiers were gray imported from the US. These were V6 with automatic transmission for private importers.

==== Chile ====
In Chile, the D22 was marketed as the &quot;Nissan Terrano&quot; (a name previously used in the WD21 SUV) due to Kia already using the &quot;Frontier&quot; moniker in its Bongo minivan series. It was sold from 1998 to 2014 and according to the National Automobile Association of Chile it was the most sold automobile in 2010. The facelifted &quot;Navara&quot; version arrived in 2003, in 2.4L petrol, 2.5L turbo diesel, 3.0L turbo diesel and 3.2L diesel. Even with the unveiling of the D40 Navara in 2008, it continued to be sold as a cheaper and more work-oriented alternative, outselling the D40. Starting in 2012, all D22 models were imported from Mexico replacing the Japanese model&#x27;s injection pump with a common rail fuel-injection system, among other changes and the 3.0L and 3.2L models were discontinued. The D22 was replaced by the Nissan D23 &quot;NP300&quot; in 2015.

=== Engines ===
Nissan first offered the D22 with a four-cylinder engine, the KA24DE, but added the V6 engine, the VG33E in 1999. In Australia the D22 had the KA24E till 1999, then changed to KA24DE option that year. A 3.0-litre V6 was introduced in June 2000. A supercharged version of the 3.3-litre V6 became available with introduction of the facelifted 2001 models. In February 2003, 4x4 models received a larger 3.3-litre V6 (available only with a 5-speed manual), while 4x2 models continued with the 3.0 (with manual or automatic transmissions). The V6 was dropped in 2005, leaving the 2.5-litre turbo-diesel as the only available engine.

The first series of D22s had larger (QD32) 3.2-litre normally aspirated diesel engines producing 75 kW. It also had a (NA20S) 2.0-litre petrol SOHC 8 valve engine producing 75 kW.

===Safety===
The African version of the NP300 received 0 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for infants from Global NCAP in 2018 (similar to Latin NCAP 2013).

For 2009, the Frontier received a facelift with more options, colours, and new wheels. The Nismo model was replaced by the PRO-4X model. Suzuki discontinued the Equator in 2013, as part of the shutdown of their American passenger car division.

In 2012, production in the United States was shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Canton, Mississippi.

Sales of the PRO-4X model continue in Mexico.

In 2014, Nissan released a concept truck with a 2.8-litre straight-four engine Cummins Diesel engine paired with a ZF 8HP transmission.

=== Outside the U.S. ===
The Navara in Europe came with an updated Euro IV compliant engine on post September 2006 vehicles. It has four trim levels, the S, SE, Outlaw and Aventura. The Aventura trim package is equipped with leather upholstery, dual zone climate control, six-stacker CD/MP3 changer and satellite navigation as standard.

In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, the D40 Navara has a few differences from the UK versions.

The 2.5 diesel engine Mid Power version (2WD and 4WD base models) produces at 4000 rpm and at 2000 rpm, High Power version (4WD upgrade models) produces at 4000 rpm and at 2000 rpm. The V6 produces at 5600 rpm of power and at 4000 rpm. Both engines come with a standard five-speed automatic, with a six-speed manual available for the diesel. These models do not have leather, climate control or satellite navigation system like their UK versions.

The 2008 model of the Navara was launched on 2 July. Changes included a new style of alloy wheels, Bluetooth as standard, side work lights and indicators on the wing mirrors.

The 2008 Single Cab became available in Thailand 6 March. The 2.5-litre engine reduces torque output from at 2,000 rpm. This model has 15-inch wheels. Power steering is standard.

=== Facelift ===
For North American Frontiers model year 2009, and European Navaras model year 2010, Nissan updated the shape of some minor components.

There are subtle changes to the headlights and bonnet. The V-shaped grille shell is less pronounced and the bumper is rounder and projects 80 mm further forward, but the six-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels or optional 18-inch alloy wheels are the biggest change.

Inside the new Navara (top-of-the-line model), Nissan designers have specified softer materials of a better quality for the dash, seats and interior moulds. The centre console and fascia designs have been revised, as have the instrument binnacle layout and door trims. Additional bright/gloss finish surfacing is used throughout the cabin. The six-stack CD audio system or the TV Navigation entertainment console is upgraded with speed-sensing volume, MP3 compatibility and Bluetooth connectivity for the (six disc CD audio system). Other new or revised features include dual-zone climate control, remote audio/Bluetooth/trip computer controls on the steering wheel, trip computer, external temperature gauge, speed-sensitive variable windscreen wipers and &#x27;follow me home&#x27; lighting. The electric mirrors now fold in fully for car washes or parking in narrow spaces.

Importantly, the upgraded Navara (diesel only) gains stability control, which Nissan calls Vehicle Dynamics Control and all petrol V6 and diesel variants gain side-impact and side-curtain airbags to complement the dual front airbags.

Nissan updated the Frontier for the 2020 model year with a new 3.8-litre V6 and a nine-speed automatic, with the manual transmission being discontinued. The 6-speed manual is available in Canada only on the Pro-4X model. The engine replaces both the outgoing 4.0L V6 and the 2.5L I4, and produces , although torque remains the same. The lineup has also been revised: the Frontier King Cab model will offer both rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive configurations on the S and SV models; the Crew Cab model, meanwhile, extends rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive to the SV short bed and SV long bed trims, while the Pro-4X gets four-wheel drive exclusively. Power windows and locks are now standard on all trim levels.

=== Safety ===
The D40 Navara has undergone Euro NCAP crash testing along with the Mitsubishi Triton and Isuzu D-Max, and received one star with a strikeout; however, after retesting with upgraded computer software it went from the lowest in the group to the highest (overall) with 3 stars. Among the problems discovered during the test was delayed airbag deployment and insufficient seatbelt restraint, which were solved with the software upgrade.

On 5 November 2020, Nissan unveiled the facelifted D23 Navara along with the introduction of the Pro-4X trim level. The engines remain the same, but active safety equipment has been added. The facelifted model went on sale in Australia in the first quarter of 2021.

The pre-facelift model was produced in Barcelona plant for European markets until 16 December 2021. The reasons are declining sales of the Navara in the region and the fact the plant has been shut down.

In March 2022, Nissan started producing the facelifted Frontier in Argentina. As of 2022, 34% of its parts are locally made and 65% of its production (including the Renault Alaskan) is exported.

===Nissan Navara EnGuard Concept===
The EnGuard concept is a modified D23 Navara pitched directly towards emergency rescue organisations. Unveiled at the 2016 Hannover Motor Show, the concept is notable for being the first prototype with a Nissan designed and developed portable battery pack. Other features that cater for rescue organisations include an onboard DJI Phantom 4 drone, an increased ride height, strobe lights and a fully adjustable suspension system.

===Renault Alaskan===
Renault revealed the production version of the Alaskan Pickup Concept which will be based on the current Navara platform. The Alaskan was shown alongside other Renault Models at the 2016 Paris Motor Show in October.

From October 2016, the Alaskan is sold in Colombia. The pick-up was sold throughout Europe in 2017.

Production commences in Santa Isabel, Argentina from October 2020 for Latin American markets.

===Mercedes-Benz X-Class===

On 25 October 2016, Mercedes-Benz revealed 2 concept pickup trucks previewing the upcoming joint-built pickup to be called &quot;X-Class&quot;. The X-Class is based on the platform of the D23 Navara and is built in Barcelona, Spain with planned production in Córdoba, Argentina, however, the latter was cancelled due to a disagreement between Nissan and Mercedes-Benz regarding production costs as well as that country&#x27;s economic situation. Production of the X-Class was discontinued in 2020 due to poor sales.
===Dongfeng Rich 6===
In October 2018, the Dongfeng Rich 6 was launched as a more premium pickup option under the Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd. brand and produced by Zhengzhou Nissan alongside the Chinese market Navara. The Dongfeng Rich 6 features a redesigned front end resulting in an extra 35 mm of length with the rest of the vehicle body being shared directly with the Navara.

== Motorsports ==
The D40 Frontier platform is currently being used as a Stage Rally vehicle by the NISMO Stuff Racing effort currently competing in the Coupe Rallye Quebec series. This team has been racing the current D40 Frontier for over two years with eight stage rallies and two hill climbs under its belt having never suffered a mechanical failure of any kind.

Nissan South Africa campaigned both the D22 and D40 platforms very successfully in the local ABSA Off-Road Series, winning eight consecutive driver&#x27;s championships (2001 to 2008). The vehicles were prepared by Hallspeed South Africa. Hallspeed also developed and sold vehicles to the Belgian-based company Overdrive. For several years Overdrive have competed with the Hallspeed built vehicles in the European rally Raid series, including The Dakar.

<text>Patrick Tam Ka-ming (; born 25 March 1948) is a Hong Kong film director and film editor. He is known as the seminal figure of Hong Kong New Wave

== Career ==
Patrick Tam was born in 1948. As a teenager, he was avid film goer and wrote reviews and made film shorts on 16mm cameras. Like many of the other members of Hong Kong New Wave films, Tam began in television. He worked at TVB starting out as a prop assistant in 1967. By 1975, he was directing the stations tops programs like &quot;Superstar Special&quot;. When he was offered a sabbatical to study filmmaking in San Francisco, he spent most of the time at the Pacific Film Archive watching films.

He returned to Hong Kong in 1976 directing episodes of the Hong Kong cop show &quot;C.I.D.&quot; and then the series he was most known for with &quot;Seven Women&quot;. His last major television production was the 10-part series titled &quot;13&quot; in 1977.

His first film was &quot;The Sword&quot; (1980), a &quot;wuxia&quot; film.
Tam directed the 1987 film &quot;Final Victory&quot;, scripted by Wong Kar-wai. He edited Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, contributing the cameo appearance of Tony Leung Chi-wai in the last scene, and &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, as well as Johnnie To&#x27;s &quot;Election&quot;.

As part of Hong Kong&#x27;s New Wave of film directors in the late 1970s and 1980s, Tam&#x27;s work enjoys great acclaim. According to the Hong Kong film critic Perry Lam, writing in &quot;Muse&quot; magazine, &quot;[Tam&#x27;s] unpredictable digressions and swift changes of scene can evoke a dreamer&#x27;s logic, but his sound and images are always sharp and particular.&quot;

As of 2006, Tam was an assistant professor at the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong.

<doc id="427067" wikidata="Q661787" url="?curid=427067" title="Swiss mercenaries">
<text>The Swiss mercenaries were a powerful infantry force constituted by professional soldiers originating from the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy. They were notable for their service in foreign armies, especially among the military forces of the kings of France, throughout the early modern period of European history, from the Late Middle Ages into the 19th century. Their service as mercenaries was at its peak during the Renaissance, when their proven battlefield capabilities made them sought-after mercenary troops. There followed a period of decline, as technological and organizational advances counteracted the Swiss&#x27; advantages. Switzerland&#x27;s military isolationism largely put an end to organized mercenary activity; the principal remnant of the practice is the Pontifical Swiss Guard at the Vatican.

== Ascendancy ==

During the Late Middle Ages, mercenary forces grew in importance in Europe, as veterans from the Hundred Years War (1337–1453) and other conflicts came to see soldiering as a profession rather than a temporary activity, and commanders sought long-term professionals rather than temporary feudal levies to fight their wars. Swiss mercenaries () were valued throughout the kingdoms and states of medieval Europe for the power of their determined mass attack in deep columns with the spear, the pike, and halberd. Hiring them was made even more attractive because entire ready-made Swiss mercenary contingents could be obtained by simply contracting with their local governments, the various Swiss cantons—the cantons had a form of militia system in which the soldiers were bound to serve and were trained and equipped to do so.

The warriors of the Swiss cantons had gradually developed a reputation across Europe as skilled soldiers, due to their successful defense of their liberties against their Austrian Habsburg overlords, starting as early as the late 13th century, including remarkable upset victories over heavily armoured knights at Morgarten and Laupen. This was furthered by later successful campaigns of regional expansion, mainly into the Italian Peninsula. By the 15th century, they were greatly valued as mercenary soldiers, particularly following their series of notable victories in the Burgundian Wars (1474–1477) in the latter part of the century. The standing mercenary army of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, known as the &quot;Black Army&quot; (1458–1490), also contained Swiss pikemen units, who were held in high regard by the king. The native German term &quot;Reisläufer&quot; literally means &quot;one who goes to war&quot; and is derived from the Middle High German &quot;Reise,&quot; meaning &quot;military campaign&quot;.

The Swiss mercenaries, with their head-down attack in huge columns with the long pike, refusal to take prisoners, and consistent record of victory, were greatly feared and admired—for instance, the Italian diplomat and political philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli addressed their system of combat at length in the twelfth chapter of his literary masterpiece, &quot;The Prince&quot; (1513–1532). Although often referred to as &quot;pikemen&quot;, the Swiss mercenary units also contained halberdiers as well until several decades into the 16th century, as well as a small number of skirmishers armed with bows, crossbows, or early firearms to precede the rapid advance of the attack column.

The young men who went off to fight, and sometimes die, in foreign service had several incentives—limited economic options in the still largely rural cantons; adventure; pride in the reputation of the Swiss as soldiers; and finally what military historian Sir Charles Oman describes as a pure love of combat and warfighting in and of itself, forged by two centuries of conflict.

== Italian Wars and the Landsknechts ==
Until roughly 1490, the Swiss had a virtual monopoly on pike-armed mercenary service. However, after that date, the Swiss mercenaries were increasingly supplanted by imitators, chiefly the &quot;Landsknechts&quot;. &quot;Landsknechts&quot; were Germans (at first largely from Swabia) and became proficient at Swiss tactics, even surpassing them with their usage of the &quot;Zweihänder&quot; to crush opposing pike formations. This produced a force that filled the ranks of European armies with mercenary regiments for decades. After 1515 the Swiss pledged themselves to neutrality, other than regarding Swiss soldiers serving in the ranks of the Royal French army. The &quot;Landsknecht&quot;, however, would continue to serve any paymaster, even, at times, enemies of the Holy Roman Emperor (and &quot;Landsknechts&quot; at times even fought each other on the battlefield). The &quot;Landsknecht&quot; often assumed the multi-coloured and striped clothing of the Swiss.

The Swiss were not flattered by the imitation, and the two bodies of mercenaries immediately became bitter rivals over employment and on the battlefield, where they were often opposed during the major European conflict of the early sixteenth century, the Italian Wars. Although the Swiss generally had a significant edge in a simple &quot;push of pike&quot;, the resulting combat was nonetheless quite savage, and known to Italian onlookers as &quot;bad war&quot;. Period artists such as Hans Holbein attest to the fact that two such huge pike columns crashing into each other could result in a maelstrom of battle, with very many dead and wounded on both sides.

Despite the competition from the &quot;Landsknechts&quot;, and imitation by other armies (most notably the Spanish, which adopted pike-handling as one element of its &quot;tercios&quot;), the Swiss fighting reputation reached its zenith between 1480 and 1525, and indeed the Battle of Novara, fought by Swiss mercenaries, is seen by some as the perfect Swiss battle. Even the close defeat at the Battle of Marignano in 1515, the &quot;Battle of Giants&quot;, was seen as an achievement of sorts for Swiss arms due to the ferocity of the fighting and the good order of their withdrawal.

Nonetheless, the repulse at Marignano presaged the decline of the Swiss form of pike warfare—eventually, the two-century run of Swiss victories ended in 1522 with disaster at the Battle of Bicocca when combined Spanish &quot;tercios&quot; and &quot;Landsknecht&quot; forces decisively defeated them using superior tactics, fortifications, artillery, and new technology (i.e. handguns). At Bicocca, the Swiss mercenaries, serving the French king, attempted repeatedly to storm an impregnable defensive position without artillery or missile support, only to be mown down by small-arms and artillery fire. Never before had the Swiss suffered such heavy losses while being unable to inflict much damage upon their foe. The Swiss are generally considered to have been surpassed by the &quot;Landsknechts&quot; after the Battle of Pavia in 1525.

== Organization and tactics ==

The early contingents of Swiss mercenary pikemen organized themselves rather differently than the cantonal forces. In the cantonal forces, their armies were usually divided into the &quot;Vorhut&quot; (vanguard), &quot;Gewalthut&quot; (center) and &quot;Nachhut&quot; (rearguard), generally of different sizes. In mercenary contingents, although they could conceivably draw up in three similar columns if their force was of sufficient size, more often they simply drew up in one or two huge columns which deployed side by side, forming the center of the army in which they served. Likewise, their tactics were not very similar to those used by the Swiss cantons in their brilliant tactical victories of the Burgundian Wars and Swabian War, in which they relied on maneuver at least as much as the brute force of the attack columns. In mercenary service they became much less likely to resort to outmaneuvering the enemy and relied more on a straightforward steamroller assault of the phalanx formation.

Such deep pike columns could crush lesser infantry in close combat and were invulnerable to the effects of a cavalry charge, but they were vulnerable to firearms if they could be immobilized (as seen in the Battle of Marignano). The Swiss mercenaries did deploy bows, crossbows, handguns and artillery of their own, however these always remained very subsidiary to the pike and halberd square. Despite the proven armour-penetration capability of firearms, they were also very inaccurate, slow-loading, and susceptible to damp conditions, and did not fit well with the fast-paced attack tactics used by the Swiss mercenary pike forces (the Spanish invention of the armor piercing arquebus leading to the later tercios formation changed the optimal war tactics).

The Swiss remained primarily pikemen throughout the sixteenth century, but after that period they adopted similar infantry formations and tactics to other units in the armies in which they served. Accordingly, they began to deviate from their previously unique tactics, and they took a normal place in the battle line amongst the other infantry units.

== End of military ascendancy ==

In the end, as proven at Marignano and Bicocca, the mass pike attack columns of the Swiss mercenaries proved to be too vulnerable to gunpowder weapons as firearms technology advanced, especially arquebusiers and artillery deployed on prepared ground (e.g., earthworks) and properly supported by other arms. These &quot;arquebusiers&quot; and heavy cannons scythed down the close-packed ranks of the Swiss squares in bloody heaps—at least, as long as the Swiss attack could be bogged down by earthworks or cavalry charges, and the vulnerable arquebusiers were backed up by melee infantry—pikemen, halberdiers, and/or swordsmen (Spanish sword-and-buckler men or the Doppelsöldner wielding the Zweihänder)—to defend them if necessary from the Swiss in close combat.

Other stratagems could also take the Swiss pikemen at a disadvantage. For instance, the Spanish &quot;rodeleros&quot;, also known as sword-and-buckler men, armed with steel rodelas and &quot;espadas&quot; and often wearing a helmet and a breastplate, were much better armed and armored for man-to-man close quarters combat. Accordingly, they could defeat the Swiss pike square by dashing under their unwieldy pikes and stabbing them. However, this tactic operated in support of allied pike squares and thus required the opposing pike square to be fully engaged in the chaos of the push of pike. Swiss pike columns that retained good formation were often able to beat back Spanish &quot;rodeleros&quot; with impunity, such as in the Battle of Seminara, in which the Swiss pike were heavily outnumbered.

Despite the end of their supremacy after the Battle of Pavia, the Swiss pike-armed mercenaries continued to be amongst the most capable close order infantry in Europe throughout the remainder of the sixteenth century. This was demonstrated by their battlefield performances in the service of the French monarchy during the French Wars of Religion, in particular at the Battle of Dreux, where a block of Swiss pikemen held the Huguenot army until the Catholic cavalry were able to counterattack.

== Capitulations and treaties ==

During the period of formalization of the employment of Swiss mercenaries in organized bodies from the late 16th century on, customary capitulations existed between employing powers and the Swiss cantons or noble families assembling and supplying these troops. Such contracts would generally cover specific details such as the numbers, quality, pay rates and equipment of recruits. Provisions were commonly made that Swiss soldiers would only serve under officers of their own nationality, would be subject to Swiss laws, would carry their own flags and would not be employed in campaigns that would bring them into conflict with Swiss in the service of another country.

It has been claimed that such contracts might also contain a commitment that Swiss units would be returned if the confederation came under attack. However, surviving capitulations from the 16th and 17th centuries are not known to contain provisions to this effect.

With the passing of the amendment to the Swiss Constitution of 1874 banning the recruitment of Swiss citizens by foreign states, such contractual relations ceased. Military alliances had already been banned under the Swiss constitution of 1848, though troops still served abroad when obliged by treaties. One such example were the Swiss regiments serving under Francis II of the Two Sicilies, who defended Gaeta in 1860 during the Italian War of Unification. This marked the end of an era.

== Service by country ==

=== France ===
Swiss soldiers continued to serve as valued mercenaries with a number of European armies from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, in spite of extensive changes in tactics, drill and weapons. The most consistent and largest-scale employer of these troops was the French army, where the Swiss formed an elite part of the infantry. The Swiss Guards regiment, the most senior of the twelve Swiss mercenary regiments in French service, was essentially identical to the French Guards in organization and equipment, other than wearing a red uniform as opposed to the blue coats of the French corps. The Swiss adopted the musket in increasingly large numbers as the seventeenth century wore on, and abandoned the pike, their ancient trademark, altogether at around the same time as other troops in the French army, circa 1700. They also served in the New World: Samuel De Champlain&#x27;s map of the Île Sainte-Croix (Saint Croix Island) settlement shows a barracks for the Swiss.

The Swiss mercenaries were recruited according to contracts (capitulations) between the French monarchy and Swiss cantons or individual noble families. By 1740 more than 12,000 Swiss soldiers were in French service. During the remainder of the eighteenth century, Swiss numbers varied according to need, reaching a peak of 20,000 during the Austrian War of Succession and falling to 12,300 after 1763. In addition to the direct military value of employing Swiss in French service, a political purpose was achieved through the extension of French diplomatic and commercial influence over the neighbouring cantons.

The Swiss soldier was paid at a higher level than his French counterpart but was subject to a harsher disciplinary code, administered by his own officers. The basis of recruitment varied according to regiment – in some units recruits were drawn exclusively from the Swiss inhabitants of specific cantons while in others German or French volunteers were accepted to make up shortfalls in the number of available Swiss. During the latter part of the 18th century, increasing reliance was placed on recruiting from the &quot;children of the regiment&quot; – the sons of Swiss soldiers who had married French women and stayed in France after their term of service had ended. The effect was to partially break down barriers between the Swiss and the French population amongst whom they were garrisoned. On the eve of the French Revolution the log-book of one Swiss regiment expressed concern that Franco-Swiss recruits were becoming prone to desertion as general discontent spread. French-speaking Swiss soldiers were generally to prove more susceptible to revolutionary propaganda than their German-speaking colleagues.

At the outbreak of the French Revolution the Swiss troops were, as at least nominal foreigners, still considered more reliable than their French counterparts in a time of civil unrest. In April 1791 the nominal strength of the Swiss line regiments in French service was 11,429 men with a further 2,330 in the Swiss Guards. Swiss regiments made up a significant proportion of the royal troops summoned to Paris by Louis XVI in early July 1789. A detachment of Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment was sent to reinforce the garrison of the Bastille prison shortly before it was besieged by the mob. The Swiss and other royal troops were subsequently withdrawn to their frontier garrisons. Over the next years The Ernest Regiment in particular faced a series of clashes with local citizens, culminating in a two-day battle with Marseilles&#x27; militia in 1791. This indication of growing popular resentment against the Swiss caused the Canton of Berne to recall the disarmed regiment. Another Swiss regiment, the Châteauvieux, played a major part in the Nancy affair (mutiny) of 1790 and 23 of its soldiers were executed, after trial by their own Swiss officers. The Swiss Guard however remained loyal and was massacred on 10 August 1792, when the mob attacked the Tuileries Palace, although Louis XVI had already left the building. The eleven Swiss regiments of line infantry were disbanded under a decree passed by the French Assembly on 20 August 1792. Over three thousand Swiss soldiers transferred individually to French units and continued in service. However, many of the rank and file returned to Switzerland, where measures had to be taken to provide them with relief and reintegration into the rural society from which most had been drawn.
Following the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798, a project to raise six demi-brigades of Swiss infantry for French service was initiated. However, recruitment proved difficult and by May 1799 only a quarter of the intended establishment of 18,000 had been raised. Napoleon authorized the recruitment of a Swiss infantry regiment for French service in July 1805. A further three infantry regiments were created in October 1807, each including an artillery company. He specified that this newly raised Swiss Corps should comprise only citizens of Switzerland without &quot;mingling in deserters or other foreigners&quot;. The Swiss regiments fought well both in Spain (where they clashed at the Battle of Bailén with Swiss troops in the Spanish Army) and in Russia. During the retreat from Moscow Swiss losses amounted to 80% of their original numbers. The Swiss were allowed to keep the distinctive red coats which had distinguished them prior to 1792, with different facings identifying each regiment.

During the first Bourbon Restoration of 1814–1815, the grenadier companies of the by now under-strength four Swiss regiments undertook ceremonial guard duties in Paris. Upon Napoleon&#x27;s return from Elba in 1815, the serving Swiss units were recalled to Switzerland on the grounds that a new contract signed with the government of Louis XVIII had now been rendered void. Still, one composite regiment of Napoleon&#x27;s Swiss veterans fought at Wavre during the Hundred Days. After the second Bourbon Restoration, a final capitulation was signed in 1816 for the recruitment of six Swiss regiments, four for the line infantry and two for the Royal Guard, with a nominal strength of 14,000 men. All Swiss units were disbanded following the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in the Revolution of 1830, where about three hundred Swiss soldiers were killed in the defense of the Fontainebleau and Louvre palaces.

=== Spain ===

Another major employer of Swiss mercenaries from the later 16th century on was Spain. After the Protestant Reformation, Switzerland was split along religious lines between Protestant and Catholic cantons. Swiss mercenaries from the Catholic cantons were thereafter increasingly likely to be hired for service in the armies of Habsburg Spain in the late 16th century. The first regularly embodied Swiss regiment in the Spanish Army was that of Walter Roll of Uri (a Catholic canton), formed in 1574 for service in the Eighty Years&#x27; War. By the middle of the 17th century, Philip III and his successor Philip IV had signed capitulations for a dozen Swiss regiments. These were deployed in the Portuguese Restoration War, the Reapers&#x27; War, and the Nine Years&#x27; War in the latter half of the century.

Swiss soldiers in Spanish service saw action in Italy during the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1718, in North Africa during the expedition to Oran and Mers el-Kebir in 1732, and in Sicily and Naples during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734–1735. In the War of the Austrian Succession, 30,000 Swiss mercenaries from five regiments fought for the Spanish Crown in Lombardy, Savoy and the County of Nice. During the second half of the 18th century, Spain employed four Swiss regiments which took part in all of its campaigns, including the invasion of Portugal in 1762, the invasion of Algiers in 1775 and the American Revolutionary War.

By the 1790s there were about 13,000 men making up the Swiss contingents in a total Spanish Army of 137,000. The practice of recruiting directly from the Catholic cantons was however disrupted by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Recruiting agents substituted Germans, Austrians and Italians and in some regiments the genuine Swiss element dwindled to 100 or less. Spain&#x27;s Swiss units served against the French in the War of the Pyrenees, and one Swiss regiment (Betschart) formed part of the Allied army at the Siege of Toulon in 1793. Their final role in Spanish service was against the French in the Peninsular War, in which the five Swiss regiments (Rüttimann, Jann, Reding, Schwaller and Courten) mostly stayed loyal to their Spanish employers. At the Battle of Bailén in 1808, the Swiss regiments pressed into French service defected back to the 3rd Swiss Regiment Reding under Theodor von Reding. 

The Swiss regiments suffered heavy losses in the following years of the Peninsular War, numbering only a few hundred men by 1812. They were finally disbanded in 1823 during the &quot;Trienio liberal&quot;. The Swiss fighting in the ranks of the Spanish army generally followed its organization, tactics and dress. The Swiss regiments were however distinguished by their blue coats, in contrast to the white uniforms of the Spanish line infantry.

=== Netherlands ===

The Dutch employed many Swiss units from the late 17th century until the 19th century. After initial attempts by the Dutch Republic to raise Swiss regiments during the Franco-Dutch War failed, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 by Louis XIV of France prompted a feeling of common threat among Protestants. In March 1693, the Dutch envoy to Zürich, Petrus Valkenier, concluded a private capitulation with Swiss mercenary Hercules Capol, a Protestant who had left French service in 1685, raising a regiment of 1,600 men from the Grisons for Dutch service. Zürich authorized the recruitment of 800 men the same year. In 1696, the Protestant cantons of Bern and Schaffhausen, as well as the Republic of Geneva and the Principality of Neuchâtel (both Protestant associate states of Switzerland), entered into similar accords with the Netherlands. 

In 1700, 11,200 Swiss soldiers served in the Dutch States Army. At the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709, during the War of the Spanish Succession, six Swiss regiments in Dutch pay (Chambrier, Schmid von Grüneck, Hirzel, May, Stürler and Mestral) fought a French army which included Swiss infantry regiments and Louis XIV&#x27;s Swiss Guards. The Republic sent Swiss regiments to Scotland in 1715 and 1745; in 1745, three battalions of the Hirzel Regiment formed part of the Dutch contingent sent to serve in England as allies at the time of the Jacobite rising in Scotland that year. With the threat of a French invasion in 1748, the Netherlands concluded a capitulation with all Protestant cantons (except Basel) in addition to Glarus, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, St. Gallen and Neuchâtel. The capitulation of 1748 increased to 20,400 the number of Swiss mercenaries in Dutch service, and additional regiments were taken into service, but that year, the War of Austrian Succession ended and three of these regiments were retired from service. In 1749 a regiment of Swiss Guards (&quot;Zwitsersche Guardes&quot;) was raised, the recruits coming from the ranks of the existing Swiss infantry regiments.

Swiss mercenaries were also deployed to the Dutch colonies in Asia, Africa, South America and the Caribbean. The Fourgeoud Regiment, which was sent to Berbice in 1763 in response to a slave rebellion, undertook numerous expeditions against the maroons in neighboring Surinam until 1778. A narrative of the Surinam campaigns, written by John Gabriel Stedman, was later published. Between 4,000 and 5,000 Swiss mercenaries were employed, mostly on an individual basis, by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for service in the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies. In 1781, the Meuron Regiment was hired for VOC service in the Cape Colony. The regiment was later transferred to Ceylon, where it campaigned against the Kingdom of Kandy.

In 1787, the six Swiss regiments in the Dutch States Army numbered a total of 9,600 men. With the abdication of the &quot;stadhouder&quot; in 1795 and the establishment of the Batavian Republic, all Swiss regiments were disbanded in 1796. After the return of the Prince of Orange in 1813, four regiments of Swiss infantry, numbered 29 to 32 in the line, were raised, of which the 32nd served as a guard regiment performing guard duties at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam after 1815. These units were also disbanded in 1829.

Several Swiss soldiers joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) after the Swiss regiments in the Netherlands were dissolved. Like the French Foreign Legion, the KNIL profited from the dissolution of Swiss units across Europe during the 19th century. In the 1850s, some 1,200 men from the Swiss regiments of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies entered KNIL service, similarly to 240 mercenaries from the short-lived British Swiss Legion, disbanded in 1856. Many of the Swiss participated in mutinies against their Dutch superiors at Java in 1860. The Dutch government then suspended their recruitment, only to resume it in 1866. By the start of the First World War, about 7,600 Swiss mercenaries had served throughout the Dutch colonial empire.

=== Savoy ===
The first Swiss mercenaries in the service of the House of Savoy (rulers of the Duchy of Savoy and later the Kingdom of Sardinia) were recruited in 1577 through a capitulation signed by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy and the Catholic cantons of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug and Fribourg. In 1579, Emmanuel Philibert expanded his personal guard with a Swiss company, initially composed of seventy soldiers and three officers. His successor, Charles Emmanuel, established the unit as the Swiss Guard (&quot;Guardia Svizzera&quot;), also called the &quot;Hundred Swiss&quot; (&quot;Cento Svizzeri&quot;) after the eponymous French unit. The company&#x27;s size varied between 175 men in 1597 and 112 in 1774. In addition to the Swiss cantons, Savoy employed a number of units from the Valais, a Catholic associate state of Switzerland, starting with the Kalbermatten Regiment in 1615.

Swiss Protestants, mostly from Vaud and Bern, entered Sardinian service in the 18th century. Several Swiss regiments were taken into Savoyard service during the War of the Spanish Succession, including the La Reine, Alt, Lombach, Frid, Schmid, and Reding regiments. Due to the French invasion of the Duchy of Savoy, most of the regiments were scattered before they could fully assemble. They served with distinction at the Siege of Turin. The War of the Polish Succession saw a further surge in Swiss mercenaries, now in the service of the Kingdom of Sardinia, with the recruitment of new units such as the Guibert, Du Pâquier, Kyd, and Donatz regiments, most of which were disbanded shortly after the war. The Swiss also fought for the King of Sardinia in the War of the Austrian Succession, suffering heavy losses at the Siege of Villafrance and distinguishing themselves at the battles of Madonna dell&#x27;Olmo and Assietta. By the end of the war in 1748, about 10,600 Swiss soldiers were employed by Sardinia.

Three new Swiss regiments, largely consisting of soldiers from the recently-disbanded Swiss units in French service, were raised for the Sardinian Army in 1793. Each regiment was reduced to a single battalion in 1797, following Sardinia&#x27;s defeat in the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, and later passed into the service of the French Republic in 1798 as the Helvetic Legions in Italy. After his return to Turin in 1814, King Victor Emmanuel I considered raising six Swiss regiments from the cantons of Ticino, Vaud, Bern and the Grisons. However, due to budgetary reasons, he was forced to sign the capitulation for only one regiment (Christ) from the Grisons, which never reached its nominal strength and was disbanded in 1816. The Hundred Swiss of the Guard, who were also disbanded in 1798 and restored in 1814, continued to perform their duties at the Royal Palace of Turin until their final dissolution in 1832.

=== Britain ===

The Kingdom of England began to recruit Swiss mercenaries after the Glorious Revolution of 1689. A first capitulation was signed in 1690 between England and the Protestant cantons of Zürich, Bern, Glarus, Schaffhausen and Appenzell Ausserrhoden, as well as the city of St. Gallen. Starting in the 1750s, Swiss soldiers also served in the armies of the British East India Company (EIC). Between 1751 and 1754, 518 mercenaries, mostly Swiss and Germans, were sent to the East Indies. The EIC&#x27;s Swiss contingent was increased in 1757 by four regiments recruited by Jacques Marc Prevost, a Genevan officer of the Royal American Regiment. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Swiss were numerous among the auxiliary troops from continental Europe that fought in the war&#x27;s Indian theater on behalf of the EIC. Some Swiss mercenaries reached important posts within the company and amassed considerable wealth, notably through looting.

Another important theater of war in the 18th-century was North America, where Swiss mercenaries in the British Army served in the French and Indian War. Some, such as Henry Bouquet and Frederick Haldimand (both from the Royal American Regiment), achieved distinction in North America and held high offices in the British colonial administration. In 1781, Charles-Daniel de Meuron, a former colonel of the French Swiss Guards, founded his own mercenary regiment under the name Regiment de Meuron, first serving the Dutch East India Company, and from 1796, the British East India Company. Under British service, the regiment fought in the Mysore campaign of 1799, the Mediterranean campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars and the Peninsular War.

The Regiment de Watteville was a Swiss regiment founded by Louis de Watteville and recruited from regiments that served between 1799 and 1801 in the Austrian army but in British pay. The Swiss soldiers were then transferred to British service. They fought in the Napoleonic Wars, mainly around the Mediterranean. They were based in Malta and then in Egypt from 1801 to 1803, fighting in Sicily and Naples. The regiment fought in the Battle of Maida in Southern Italy in July 1806. Kept up to strength by Spanish and Portuguese recruits from 1811 to 1813, De Watteville&#x27;s Regiment was involved in the Peninsular War in Spain, defending Cádiz during the Siege of Cádiz. 

The Meuron and Watteville regiments both sailed to Canada in 1813 to fight in the War of 1812. De Watteville&#x27;s Regiment saw action at the Siege of Fort Erie and at the Battle of Fort Oswego. All Swiss units in British service were demobilized in 1816. A short-lived British Swiss Legion, recruited in the 1850s for the Crimean War, was disbanded in 1856 without having been deployed.

=== Naples ===

The permanent employment of Swiss mercenaries by the Kingdom of Naples began with the transfer of the Neapolitan crown to the Spanish Bourbons. In 1731, Philip V of Spain put two of his most experienced Swiss units (the Nideröst and Bessler regiments) at the disposal of his son Charles, Duke of Parma (the future Charles III of Spain). After becoming King of Naples in 1734, Charles raised two new Swiss regiments under the ownership of the Tschudi family of Glarus. The Bessler Regiment was replaced by a regiment belonging to the Jauch family, from Uri. Three of the regiments were stationed in the city of Naples and the surrounding area, with a fourth garrisoned in Sicily. The Swiss regiments in Neapolitan service, totaling between 6,000 and 7,000 men, remained active until 1789. After their dismissal, several Swiss soldiers joined other foreign regiments and went on to fight the French Revolutionary Army. Others followed King Ferdinand IV into exile in 1799, following his overthrow by the Parthenopean Republic, and again from 1806 to 1815 during Napoleonic rule in Naples. 

After his restoration in 1815, Ferdinand, now monarch of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, negotiated with the Swiss Federal Diet and concluded treaties in 1824 with the cantons of Lucerne, Uri, Unterwalden and Appenzell Innerrhoden, and in 1825 with Solothurn and Fribourg, for the formation of two Swiss regiments. A third regiment were raised in 1826, through a treaty with Valais, the Grisons and Schwyz, and fourth by Bern in 1829. These capitulations, concluded for a period of thirty years, offered commercial advantages. The Swiss regiments went through unrest under the reign of Ferdinand II, with frequent changes of garrison. During the Revolutions of 1848–1849, Swiss mercenaries were deployed in two campaigns against the revolutionary Roman Republic and took part in the suppression of the Sicilian Revolution. Their behaviour on this occasion was criticized within Switzerland, which led the Federal Council in 1851 to ban all recruitment for foreign service and to demand the removal of the cantonal and national coats of arms from regimental flags. After Ferdinand II&#x27;s death in 1859, the Swiss regiments in the Two Sicilies were officially disbanded.

=== Venice ===
Mercenaries from Switzerland and the Grisons were individually employed by the Republic of Venice as early as the 15th century. In 1500, a capitulation authorized Venice to recruit 4,000 men from the Grisons, in return for Venice&#x27;s support at the Battle of Calven the previous year. A treaty signed in 1560 raised a Swiss regiment of twelve companies, under the future &quot;landammann&quot; of Nidwalden, Melchior Lussy, for Venetian service. Another regiment, belonging to the Salis family of the Val Bregaglia, was recruited by the Republic around the same time. In 1571, a contingent of six hundred Catholics from the Grisons served at the Battle of Lepanto as rowers in the Venetian Navy. An alliance with the cantons of Zürich and Bern, signed in 1615, served as the basis for several 17th-century capitulations between Venice and the Swiss. Two Swiss units, the Werdtmüller and Weiss regiments, were formed in 1648 and 1658, respectively, for service in Venetian Dalmatia. The Büeler Regiment, from Solothurn, took part in the Cretan War against the Ottoman Empire, serving in Dalmatia from 1652 to 1664.

In 1687, a Swiss regiment of 2,500 men, recruited from the Catholic cantons of Central Switzerland, Solothurn, and the city of St. Gallen, was raised for Venetian service in the Morean War. Led by Sebastian Peregrin Schmid of Uri, the Swiss set sail from Venice in May 1688, arriving at the Peloponnese peninsula (then known as Morea) about a month later. In early July, the regiment was transferred to the Greek island of Negroponte, where it had orders to seize the town of the same name from the Ottomans. The Venetian army suffered enormous losses due to fighting and disease, and the Siege of Negroponte had to be lifted in October 1688. The remaining two hundred Swiss soldiers were then transferred to Lepanto. Poor treatment by the Venetian commanders and disputes among Swiss officers further aggravated the situation, and the regiment was finally disbanded in 1691. The outcome of the Negroponte expedition and overdue payments strained Venetian relations with the Swiss, particularly the Catholic cantons, in the late 17th century. Nevertheless, Venice continued to employ Swiss regiments, concluding a new capitulation with the Protestant cantons of Bern and Zürich, as well as the Grisons, in 1706. Swiss mercenaries served the Republic of Venice until 1719.

=== Others ===

Swiss mercenaries were also employed at various dates by Prussia, Brandenburg, Genoa, Portugal, Tuscany, Poland, Saxony, Denmark, Sweden, and Bavaria, among other states.

== Modern times ==
Since 1859, only one Swiss mercenary unit has been permitted, the Vatican&#x27;s Swiss Guard, which has been protecting the pope for the last five centuries, dressed in colourful uniforms, supposedly drawn by Michelangelo, reminiscent of the Swiss mercenary&#x27;s heyday. Despite its being prohibited, individual Swiss citizens carried on the tradition of foreign military service into the twentieth century. This included 800 Swiss volunteers who fought with the Republican International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, incurring heavy losses.

Swiss citizens also served in the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War, although purely on an individual and voluntary basis. At least 2,000 Swiss fought for Germany during the war, mostly from the German-speaking cantons of Bern and Zürich, and many of them had dual German nationality. Besides the Wehrmacht some also joined the SS, particularly the 6th Mountain Division. Due to Switzerland&#x27;s neutral status, their allegiances were considered illegal and in 1943 the government decided that those who cooperated with Germany would be deprived of their nationality. By 1945, there were only 29 such cases. A number of Swiss citizens were taken prisoner by the Soviet Union while fighting on the Eastern Front.

The plot of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s comedy &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (and of the operetta &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; based on it) is focused on a fictional Swiss mercenary serving in the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War; there is, however, no evidence of actual such mercenaries in that war.

<text>Panhard was a French motor vehicle manufacturer that began as one of the first makers of automobiles. It was a manufacturer of light tactical and military vehicles. Its final incarnation, now owned by Renault Trucks Defense, was formed by the acquisition of Panhard by Auverland in 2005, and then by Renault in 2012. In 2018, Renault Trucks Defense, ACMAT and Panhard combined under a single brand, Arquus.

==History==
Panhard was originally called Panhard et Levassor, and was established as an automobile manufacturing concern by René Panhard, Émile Levassor, and Belgian lawyer Edouard Sarazin in 1887.

===Early years===
Panhard et Levassor sold their first automobile in 1890, based on a Daimler engine license. Levassor obtained his licence from Paris lawyer Edouard Sarazin, a friend and representative of Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s interests in France. Following Sarazin&#x27;s 1887 death, Daimler commissioned Sarazin&#x27;s widow Louise to carry on her late husband&#x27;s agency. The Panhard et Levassor license was finalised by Louise, who married Levassor in 1890. Daimler and Levassor became friends, and shared improvements with one another.

These first vehicles set many modern standards, but each was a one-off design. They used a clutch pedal to operate a chain-driven gearbox. The vehicle also featured a front-mounted radiator. An 1895 Panhard et Levassor is credited with the first modern transmission. For the 1894 Paris–Rouen Rally, Alfred Vacheron equipped his Panhard with a steering wheel, believed to be one of the earliest employments of the principle.

In 1891, the company built its first all-Levassor design, a &quot;state of the art&quot; model: the &quot;Système Panhard&quot; consisted of four wheels, a front-mounted engine with rear wheel drive, and a crude sliding-gear transmission, sold at 3500 &quot;franc&quot;s. (It would remain the standard until Cadillac introduced synchromesh in 1928.) This was to become the standard layout for automobiles for most of the next century. The same year, Panhard et Levassor shared their Daimler engine license with bicycle maker Armand Peugeot, who formed his own car company.

In 1895, a &quot;Panhard et Levassor&quot; vehicles finished first and second in the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race, one piloted solo by Levassor, for 48¾hr. However, during the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris race, Levassor was fatally injured due to a crash while trying to avoid hitting a dog, and died in Paris the following year. Arthur Krebs succeeded Levassor as General Manager in 1897, and held the job until 1916. He turned the Panhard et Levassor Company into one of the largest and most profitable manufacturers of automobiles before World War I.

Panhards won numerous races from 1895 to 1903. Panhard et Levassor developed the Panhard rod, which came to be used in many other types of automobiles as well.

From 1910 Panhard worked to develop engines without conventional valves, using under license the sleeve valve technology that had been patented by the American Charles Yale Knight. Between 1910 and 1924 the Panhard &amp; Levassor catalogue listed plenty of models with conventional valve engines, but these were offered alongside cars powered by sleeve valve power units. Following various detailed improvements to the sleeve valve technology by Panhard&#x27;s own engineering department, from 1924 till 1940 all Panhard cars used sleeve valve engines.

===First World War===
Under the presidency of Raymond Poincaré, which ran from 1913 till 1920, Panhard &amp; Levassor&#x27;s 18CV and 20CV models were the official presidential cars.

During the war Panhard, like other leading automobile producers, concentrated on war production, including large numbers of military trucks, V12-cylinder aero-engines, gun components, and large 75 and 105 diameter shells.

The military were also keen on the sleeve valve engined Panhard 20HP. General Joffre himself used two 35HP Panhard Type X35s with massive 4-cylinder engines for his personal transport, and these were frequently to be seen by Parisians carrying military leaders between the front-line and the Élysée Palace.

===Inter-war period===
Following the return to peace in 1918, Panhard resumed passenger car production in March 1919 with the 10HP Panhard Type X19, which used a 4-cylinder engine. This was followed three months later by three more 4-cylinder models which will have been familiar to any customers whose memories pre-dated the war, but they now incorporated upgraded electrics and a number of other modifications. For the 15th Paris Motor Show, in October 1919, Panhard were displaying four models, all with four cylinder engines, as follows:
:* Panhard Type X19 2,150 cc / 10 HP
:* Panhard Type X31 2,275 cc / 12 HP
:::&quot;(This replaced the 12 HP Panhard Type 25 for 1920.)&quot;
:* Panhard Type X28 3,175 cc / 16 HP
:* Panhard Type X29 4,850 cc / 20 HP

By 1925, all Panhard&#x27;s cars were powered by Knight sleeve valve engines that used steel sleeves. The steel sleeves were thinner and lighter than the cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard sleeve valve engines since 1910, and this already gave rise to an improved friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds. To reduce further the risk of engines jamming, the outer sleeves, which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves, were coated on their inner sides with an anti-friction material, employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since 1923. This was one of several improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve-valve engine concept.

In 1925 a model set the world record for the fastest hour run, an average of 185.51 km/h (115.26 mph).

A surprise appeared on the Panhard stand at the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1926, in the shape of the manufacturer&#x27;s first six-cylinder model since before the war. The new Panhard 16CV &quot;Six&quot; came with a 3445cc engine and sat on a wheelbase. At the show it was priced, in bare chassis form, at 58,000 francs. Of the nine models displayed for the 1927 model year, seven featured four-cylinder engines, ranging in capacity from 1480cc (10CV) to 4845cc (20CV), and in price from 31,000 francs to 75,000 francs (all in bare chassis form). Also on show was an example of the 8-cylinder 6350cc (35CV) &quot;Huit&quot; model which Panhard had offered since 1921 and which at the 1926 show was priced by the manufacturer in bare chassis form at 99,000 francs.

When Panhard presented their 1931 line-up at the Paris Motor Show in October 1930, their last two four-cylinder models had been withdrawn, along with the 10CV six-cylinder Type X59. Instead they concentrated on their &quot;S-series&quot; cars, designated &quot;Panhard CS&quot; and &quot;Panhard DS&quot; according to engine size, and introduced a year earlier. Publicity of the time indicated the &quot;S&quot; stood for &quot;Voitures surbaissées&quot; (cars having an &quot;underslung&quot; chassis,) but, clearly captivated by the power of alliteration, added that &quot;S&quot; also indicated cars that were &quot;...souples, supérieures, stables, spacieuses, silencieuses, sans soupapes (i.e., using valveless cylinders)...&quot;. Four of the five Panhards exhibited featured increasingly lavish and pricey 6-cylinder engined cars, their engine sizes ranging from 2.35-litres to 3.5-litres. There was also an 8-cylinder Panhard Type X67 on display, with a generous wheelbase and listed, even in bare chassis form, at 85,000 francs.

Panhard et Levassor&#x27;s last pre-war car was the unusually styled monocoque Dynamic series, first introduced in 1936.

Panhard et Levassor also produced railbuses, including some for the metre gauge Chemin de fer du Finistère.

===Post-World War II era===
After World War II the company was renamed Panhard (without &quot;Levassor&quot;), and produced light cars such as the Dyna X, Dyna Z, PL 17, 24 CT and 24 BT. The company had long noted the weight advantages of aluminum, and this as well as postwar government steel rationing (designed to limit new car models to ensure an orderly return to production at the major firms), encouraged the firm to proceed with the expensive alternative of making the bodies and several other components out of aluminum. Thus the Dyna X and early Dyna Z series 1 had aluminum bodies. Unfortunately, cost calculations by Jean Panhard, the inheriting son and managing director of the firm, failed to account for the extra cost of aluminum vs steel. His calculations were made for the sheet metal panel area actually utilized per body shell, and did not account for the scrap of each of the stampings making up the shell. Once in production, a re-examination showed a cost of 55,700fr for aluminum shells and only 15,600fr for steel. The use of aluminum had pushed the firm close to bankruptcy, and a hurried engineering job returned the firm to steel. Thus, the later Dyna Z (from mid September 1955) and the successor PL 17 bodies were steel, and the major stampings retained the heavier gauge intended for durability with aluminum, so as to avoid complete replacement of the stamping dies.

The air-cooled flat-twin engine of the Dyna was used by Georges Irat for his &quot;Voiture du Bled&quot; (VdB) off-road vehicle, built in Morocco in small numbers in the early 1950s.

Drawing inspiration from the Panhard Dynavia concept, the styling of the Dyna Z was distinctively smooth and rounded, with an emphasis on aerodynamics and an overall minimalist design. The 24CT was a later (from summer 1963 on) stylish 2+2 seater; the 24BT being a version of the same with a longer wheelbase and space for four.

For a period after the war, the Panhard-based Monopole racing cars received unofficial support from Panhard (as did DB and other clients such as Robert Chancel), using it to good effect in winning the &quot;Index of Performance&quot; class at Le Mans in 1950, 1951, and 1952. In 1953, Panhard moved on to a more direct involvement with Chancel, which however came to an end after the deadly 1955 Le Mans. In the latter half of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Deutsch Bonnet racers (&quot;DB Panhard&quot;) picked up this mantle and went on to dominate the &quot;Index of Performance&quot; as well as other small-engine racing classes.

The last Panhard passenger car was built in 1967. After assembling 2CV panel trucks for Citroën to utilize capacity during falling sales, and raising operating cash by selling ownership progressively to Citroën, respectively to its mother company Michelin (full control as of 1965), in autumn of 1967 the civilian branch was absorbed by Citroën, and the marque was retired. From 1968 Panhard only made armored vehicles.

In 2004, Panhard lost a competition to another manufacturer of military vehicles, Auverland, for the choice of the future PVP of the French Army. This allowed Auverland to purchase Panhard, then a subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroën, in 2005. However, the fame of Panhard being greater, it was decided to retain the name; the PVP designed by Auverland would bear a Panhard badge.

In 2007, it was reported that PSA Group was considering reviving the Panhard name for use on a range of luxury vehicles akin to Toyota&#x27;s Lexus brand. A revival did not occur, although DS Automobiles was later launched as PSA&#x27;s premium brand.

In October 2012, Renault Trucks Defense, division of Swedish Volvo Group since 2001, finalized the acquisition of Panhard for 62.5 million euros.

Today the only use of the name Panhard is in the Panhard rod (also called Panhard bar), a suspension link invented by Panhard that provides lateral location of the axle. This device has been widely used on other automobiles or as an aftermarket upgrade to rear axles for vintage American cars.

<doc id="427070" wikidata="Q16157832" url="?curid=427070" title="Insomniac with Dave Attell">
<text>Insomniac with Dave Attell is an American television show on Comedy Central hosted by comedian Dave Attell, which ran from August 5, 2001, until November 11, 2004.

==Overview==
Host Dave Attell goes through a particular city at night, usually close to midnight beginning with his performance at a local comedy club, then going to various bars, clubs, and city landmarks. Along the way Attell cracks jokes with passersby and takes pictures with a disposable camera which would be shown during the end credits. Every episode concludes with the sun rising into the next morning and Attell saying his catchphrase &quot;Get some sleep!&quot;

Episodes include a visit to Chicago&#x27;s world-famous The Wieners Circle, where the staff routinely got in cursing matches with their customers and a visit to a Phoenix nudist camp.

U.S. cities featured on the show were Albuquerque, Anchorage, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boise, Boston, Charleston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Honolulu, Houston, Kansas City, Key West, Las Vegas, Little Rock, Long Island, Memphis, Miami, Myrtle Beach, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Reno, San Francisco and Salt Lake City. Other cities featured on the show were Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Montreal, Tijuana, Toronto, and specials that took place in Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and the Southern United States.

The 30-minute program ran for four seasons on Comedy Central and continued with four one-hour specials. In 2003, two volumes of the show under the title &quot;The Best of Insomniac Uncensored&quot; were released on DVD.

The producers of &quot;Insomniac&quot; were Nick McKinney, Dave Hamilton and Mala Chapple. McKinney and Hamilton also directed all the episodes. The show&#x27;s theme song and series composer was Bob Golden.

<text>USS &quot;Stickleback&quot; (SS-415), a , was named for the stickleback, a small scaleless fish.

==Construction and launch==

Her keel was laid down on 1 March 1944 by the Mare Island Navy Yard of Vallejo, California. She was launched on 1 January 1945 sponsored by Mrs. John O.R. Coll, and commissioned on 29 March 1945.

==World War II==

&quot;Stickleback&quot; completed outfitting on 26 May and held her shakedown cruise off the California coast. She reported to Commander, Submarines, Pacific Fleet, for duty on 21 June. More modern equipment was installed at Pearl Harbor; and, on 2 August, she arrived at Guam, where she held sea trials for a few more days. She began her first war patrol on 6 August when she departed for the Sea of Japan. She arrived there the following week and began patrolling. However, the atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and it was believed the war would end shortly.

&quot;Stickleback&quot; had only been in the patrol area for two days when the cease-fire order was passed. She remained in the area and, on 21 August, sighted two bamboo rafts containing 19 survivors of a freighter which had been sunk ten days before by . They were taken on board for 18 hours, given food, water, medical treatment, and set afloat again a short distance from one of the Japanese islands.

&quot;Stickleback&quot; returned to Guam on 9 September and sailed for the United States the next day. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 28 September as a unit of Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet. The submarine participated in the Navy Day celebration in October and, on 2 January 1946, made a voyage to Pearl Harbor. She was decommissioned, on 26 June 1946, at Mare Island and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

==Korean War==

&quot;Stickleback&quot; was recommissioned on 6 September 1946 and served at San Diego, California as a training ship until entering the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 6 November 1952 for conversion to a snorkel (GUPPY IIA) type submarine. The vessel was back at sea on 26 June 1953 and joined Submarine Squadron 7 at Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Stickleback&quot; supported the United Nations forces in Korea from February to July 1954 when she returned to Pearl Harbor.

==Foundering==
For the next four years, the submarine participated in training operations and the development of both defensive and offensive submarine tactics. On 28 May 1958, &quot;Stickleback&quot; was participating in an antisubmarine warfare exercise with the destroyer escort and a torpedo retriever in the Hawaiian area. The exercises continued into the afternoon of the next day when the submarine completed a simulated torpedo run on &quot;Silverstein&quot;. As &quot;Stickleback&quot; was going to a safe depth, she lost power and broached approximately ahead of the destroyer escort. &quot;Silverstein&quot; backed full and put her rudder hard left in an effort to avoid a collision but holed the submarine on her port side.

&quot;Stickleback&quot;″s crew was removed by the torpedo retriever and combined efforts were made by &quot;Silverstein&quot;, , , and , to save the stricken submarine. The rescue ships put lines around her, but compartment after compartment flooded and, at 18:57 on 29 May 1958, &quot;Stickleback&quot; sank in of water.

&quot;Stickleback&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June 1958.

&quot;Stickleback&quot; was one of four United States Navy submarines lost since the end of World War II. The others were , and .

Sonar images of her wreckage was made public in March 2020.

<doc id="427075" wikidata="Q7231890" url="?curid=427075" title="Portland Building">
<text>The Portland Building, alternatively referenced as the Portland Municipal Services Building, is a 15-story municipal office building located at 1120 SW 5th Avenue in downtown Portland, Oregon. Built at a cost of US$29 million, it opened in 1982 and was considered architecturally groundbreaking at the time.

The building houses offices of the City of Portland and is located adjacent to Portland City Hall. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. An extensive reconstruction of the building began in December 2017 and was completed in 2020. The building was temporarily closed for that work, and the closure was extended by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
The distinctive look of Michael Graves&#x27; Portland Building, with its use of a variety of surface materials and colors, small windows, and inclusion of prominent decorative flourishes, was in stark contrast to the architectural style most commonly used for large office buildings at the time, and made the building an icon of postmodern architecture. It is the first major postmodern tall office building, opening before Philip Johnson&#x27;s AT&amp;T Building, and its design has been described as a rejection of the Modernist principles established in the early 20th century.

Graves&#x27; design was selected in a large design competition, with Johnson as one of the three members of the selection committee. Graves was added into the competition after Johnson threw out the entry from architect Gunnar Birkerts for having not been Postmodern enough. Birkerts went on to design the Detroit Institute of Arts South Wing, which was re-clad by Graves in 2007.

Portland Mayor Frank Ivancie was among those who expressed the opinion that the modernist style, then being applied to most large office buildings, had begun to make some American cities&#x27; downtowns look &quot;boring&quot;, with most of the newer, large buildings being covered in glass and steel, and largely lacking in design features that would make them stand out. The reaction among architects was mixed, with many criticizing the design while others embraced it as a welcome departure. In 1985, the hammered-copper statue &quot;Portlandia&quot; was added above the front entrance.

Beyond questions of style, many structural flaws came to light shortly after the building&#x27;s completion. The building&#x27;s failings are the subject of much humor and contempt by the civil servants who work there, who describe it as cheaply built and a challenging place to work.

In 1990, only eight years after it was built, the lobby and food court were in need of remodeling. Four firms, including Michael Graves, were bidding for the job. Karen Nichols of Michael Graves&#x27;s firm said &quot;Michael feels like he owes the city one... We have done a lot of public buildings since then. I do know we talk about the Portland Building all the time.&quot;

===Reconstruction===
In 2014, some city commissioners expressed the view that the building should be demolished due to extensive water infiltration and structural issues. The consensus among the city commissioners was mixed, with one member calling the building a &quot;white elephant&quot;, while others opposed the demolition. Michael Graves fiercely opposed demolition. In 2015, city officials were considering spending $175 million to fully renovate the building.

In July 2016, plans to renovate the building moved ahead, with the city council choosing a contractor and setting a maximum cost of $140 million for the work, not including estimated non-construction expenses of up to $55 million, such as for the leasing of office space for around 1,300 city employees who will be temporarily displaced during the renovation work. The contractors for the project are architecture firm DLR Group and Howard S. Wright Construction.

The renovation retains the building&#x27;s basic postmodern architectural style while changing some of the building materials to better withstand weather and earthquakes, and improve interiors for employee satisfaction. The teal colored tiles of the lower three floors would be replaced with larger terracotta rainscreen tiles, the existing painted concrete facade would be covered by a new aluminum rainscreen cladding, the existing dark tinted windows would be replaced with clear glass windows, and the stucco garlands on the side of the building will be rebuilt using formed aluminum. The building envelope was replaced using a unitized curtain wall, allowing the design to reflect Graves&#x27;s original while repairing years of moisture seeping into the facade and preventing further water damage. The Portland Docomomo International chapter decried the building&#x27;s renovation, claiming that the replacement of the building&#x27;s material would threaten the building&#x27;s landmark status.

Work on the extensive rebuilding, known by the city as the Portland Building Reconstruction Project, began in fall 2017, with interior demolition work, followed by an official groundbreaking in December. The project was expected to take about three years, with completion around the end of 2020. The &quot;Portlandia&quot; statue was covered by a shroud, to protect it from potential damage during the work; the covering was removed in September 2019. The statue also underwent preservation work during this period. As of September 2018, the ongoing project remained on-schedule.By early 2020, the reconstruction work was sufficiently close to completion that around 1,700 city employees began moving back into the building; the move-in was spread over eleven weekends and was completed in March 2020. However, almost immediately afterward, the COVID-19 pandemic effectively reversed the building&#x27;s return to use, as most staff were instructed to work from home during the pandemic, and a planned March 19, 2020, event to celebrate the building&#x27;s reopening was canceled.

Only about 30 employees were working in the building in August 2020, and the city was predicting that most employees in the departments that use the Portland Building would continue working from home until sometime in 2021. As of August 2020, renovation work on the interiors of the first floors was continuing but was expected to be finished by the end of the year. The work was completed by October 2020. The George Floyd and police brutality protests in Portland in 2020 were centered near the building.

==Features==
The roof of the Portland Building is covered with a green roof, installed in 2006. The roof was proposed in 2005,
part of an experiment through Oregon State University to test &quot;Sedum spathulifolium&quot; as a water-absorbing plant for the northwest. The new roof will help the building&#x27;s heating, cooling, and storm-water runoff systems.

==Offices==
As of October 2009, the Portland Building housed these municipal bureaus and departments: Office of Cable Communications &amp; Franchise Management, Bureau of Environmental Services, Facilities Services, Bureau of Human Resources, Office of Management and Finance, Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission, Bureau of Parks and Recreation, Bureau of Purchases, Bureau of Risk Management, Bureau of Technology Services, Bureau of Transportation, and the Portland Water Bureau. The Portland Building is located across the street from Portland City Hall.

==Reception==
In May 1983, the building won an American Institute of Architects honor award.

The building&#x27;s style remains controversial among Portlanders as well as the entire architecture field. In 1990, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; stated &quot;it&#x27;s hard to find anyone who doesn&#x27;t like Pioneer Courthouse Square... it&#x27;s even harder to find anyone who admits to liking the Portland Building.&quot; Nearly a quarter century later, &quot;Oregonian&quot; columnist David Sarasohn revisited the theme, noting that the &quot;huge blue tiles, colored glass and odd pastel flourishes meant to evoke early modern French paintings&quot; actually resembled &quot;something designed by a Third World dictator&#x27;s mistress&#x27; art-student brother.&quot;

These laypersons&#x27; appraisals were bolstered by Italian-born modernist architect Pietro Belluschi, who called the building &quot;totally wrong&quot; and declared: &quot;It&#x27;s not architecture, it&#x27;s packaging. I said at the time that there were only two good things about it: &#x27;It will put Portland on the map, architecturally, and it will never be repeated.&#x27;&quot;

Not all commentary has been negative. In the estimation of architectural critic Paul Goldberger: &quot;For better or for worse, the Portland Building overshadows other things. It is more significant for what it did than how well it does it. It had a profound effect on American architecture and brought a return to classicism that brought us better buildings.&quot;

In October 2009, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine called the Portland Building &quot;one of the most hated buildings in America&quot;.

DLR Group&#x27;s reconstruction work on the building was recognized with an American Architecture Award in 2021.

<doc id="427076" wikidata="Q4426930" url="?curid=427076" title="Soke (legal)">
<text>The term soke (; in Old English: &#x27;, connected ultimately with&#x27;, &quot;to seek&quot;), at the time of the Norman conquest of England, generally denoted &quot;jurisdiction&quot;, but its vague usage makes it lack a single, precise definition.

==Anglo-Saxon origins==
The phrase &#x27;Sac and soc&#x27; was used in early English for the right to hold a court (the primary meaning of &#x27;soc&#x27; seems to have involved &quot;seeking&quot;; thus &quot;soka faldae&quot; was the duty of seeking the lord&#x27;s court, just as &quot;&quot; was the duty of seeking the lord&#x27;s mill). 

According to many scholars, such as Frank Stenton and H. P. R. Finberg, &quot;... the Danelaw was an especially &#x27;free&#x27; area of Britain because the rank and file of the Danish armies, from whom sokemen were descended, had settled in the area and imported their own social system.&quot;

Historians such as Paul Vinogradoff considered royal grants of sac and soc as opening the way for national to be replaced by local justice, through the creation of immunities or franchises. As  G. M. Trevelyan wrote, &quot;by grants of &quot;sac and soc&quot; private justice was encroaching on public justice&quot;. Other scholars have viewed the judicial powers represented by the Anglo-Saxon Soke as rather limited. The standard grant of &quot;sac et soc, toll et team et infangthief&quot; represented the equivalent of the authority of the reeve at the hundred court, impinging on royal justice, for instance, in the right to slay a thief caught red-handed (infangentheof).

===Sokemen===
A sokeman belonged to a class of tenants, found chiefly in the eastern counties, especially the Danelaw, occupying an intermediate position between the free tenants and the bond tenants, in that they owned and paid taxes on their land themselves. Forming between 30% and 50% of the countryside, they could buy and sell their land, but owed service to their lord&#x27;s &quot;soke&quot;, court, or jurisdiction. (But Adolphus Ballard argued that a sokeman was a man who rendered service from a sokeland, and was not necessarily under jurisdiction).

Sokemen remained an important rural element after the Conquest, buying and selling property, and providing their overlords with money rents and court attendance, rather than manorial labour. According to the Ely Inquiry, the terms of remit for the Domesday Book specified determining for each manor &quot;how many freemen; how many sokemen...and how much each freeman and sokeman had and has&quot;.

==Later developments==
After the Norman Conquest, doubt developed over the precise meaning of the word soke. In some versions of the much-used tract &#x27;, &quot;soke&quot; is defined: &#x27; (Norman for ‘to have a free court’), and in others as &#x27;, which glosses somewhat ambiguously as &quot;claim &quot;: thus sometimes &quot;soke&quot; denoted the right to hold a court, especially when associated with &quot;sak&quot; or &quot;sake&quot; in the alliterative binomial expression (&#x27;). 

Sometimes only the right to receive the fines and forfeitures of the men over whom it was granted when they had been condemned in a court of competent jurisdiction. The &quot;Leges&quot; also speaks of pleas &quot;&quot; (‘pleas which are in his investigation’).

Ballard in the early twentieth century argued that the interpretation of the word &quot;soke&quot; as &quot;jurisdiction&quot; should be accepted only where it stands for the fuller phrase, &quot;sake and soke&quot;, and that &quot;soke&quot; standing by itself denoted services. Certainly, many passages in the Domesday Book support this contention, but in other passages &quot;soke&quot; seems to serve merely as a short expression for &quot;sake and soke&quot;.

==Territorial==

The term &quot;soke&quot;, unlike &quot;sake&quot;, sometimes applied to the district over which the right of jurisdiction extended (compare Soke of Peterborough). By the same usage, it could designate the ward of a town, as with Aldgate in the charters of Henry I.

==Legal terminology==

The law term, socage, used of this tenure, arose by adding the French suffix &#x27; to &#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Cochino&quot; (SS-345) was a submarine in service with the United States Navy from 1945 to 1949. She sank after a battery explosion off Norway, on 26 August 1949. &quot;Cochino&quot; was named for the cochino, a triggerfish found in the Atlantic.

==Construction==
&quot;Cochino&quot; was laid down by the Electric Boat Company, of Groton, Connecticut, on 13 April 1944. She was launched on 20 April 1945, sponsored by Mrs. M.E. Serat, the wife of the Assistant to the President of Electric Boat Co., and commissioned on 25 August 1945.

==Service history==
During her shakedown cruise out of New London, Connecticut, &quot;Cochino&quot; visited Newport, Rhode Island, 12–15 September 1945, then sailed for the Panama Canal Zone, on 3 October. Reaching her destination on October 9, the new fleet boat carried out training with the Operational Development Force, then visited Miami, Florida, 24–30 October, to observe Navy Day. She then proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where &quot;Cochino&quot; operated in until 27 November, when she shaped a course back to New London.

&quot;Cochino&quot; sailed from New London, on 8 January 1946, in company with , bound for Guantanamo Bay. &quot;Cochino&quot; provided services out of Naval Operating Base, Guantanamo, for much of January, clearing those waters on 25 January&#x27; for her new home port of Key West, Florida, arriving there on 27 January, after which time she returned to Guantanamo Bay, to resume providing services in that area from 24 February–7 March. In-port periods at Key West followed, 9 March–3 May and 7–10 May, punctuated by a call at St. Petersburg, Florida, 4–6 May, before she returned to Cuban waters 12–16 May. Then, following a visit to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, 18–20 May, &quot;Cochino&quot; sailed to conduct simulated attacks upon ships of the 8th Fleet, proceeding then to Key West, upon conclusion of those evolutions.

Following a period of upkeep from 24 May–16 August 1946, &quot;Cochino&quot; operated briefly out of Guantanamo Bay, 18–24 August, before she returned to her home port. Then, sailing in company with , she visited Galveston, Texas, from 2–7 September. Returning to Key West, upon completion of that port call, &quot;Cochino&quot; returned to Guantanamo Bay, for another stint of providing services for fleet units in those waters, from 6–10 October. The boat operated out of Key West, for the remainder of the year, punctuating that time with visits to Havana, Cuba, from 18–21 October, and New Orleans, from 25–29 October, and providing services for the fleet out of Guantanamo Bay, from 1–6 December.

&quot;Cochino&quot; departed her home port on 3 March 1947, and visited St. Thomas, from 7–9 March, before sailing in company with to operate north of Culebra, Puerto Rico. Following another in port period at Key West, from 17–29 March, &quot;Cochino&quot; headed north for a period of repairs and alterations at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. While there, she suffered slight damage when undocking from the marine railway on 20 May. Shifting to the Naval Ammunition Depot, at Fort Mifflin, upon completion of that yard period, she conducted deep diving tests on 21 June, in the waters of the Baltimore Canyon, at , tended by the submarine rescue vessel , after which time she returned to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, remaining there until 3 July. &quot;Cochino&quot; then proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, from 6–12 July, reporting for duty to Commander, Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet, and then shifted to Annapolis, Maryland, from 12–25 July, reporting for duty to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, upon arrival there. She then returned to her home port for upkeep from 28 July–29 August, after which time she visited Havana, from 29 August–1 September. She returned to Key West, on 1 October, where she remained for most of the month, heading out to sea on 11 October, to ride out a storm, returning the following day.

After visiting Miami, from 25–28 October 1947, &quot;Cochino&quot; operated with the 2nd Task Fleet near Bermuda, through mid-November, after which time she returned to her homeport for upkeep through mid-January 1948. Work in the Key West operating area or upkeep in port involved the boat until 31 January, when she sailed for New Orleans, for Mardi Gras festivities, from 2–11 February. She then returned to Key West, and the local operating areas there, the fleet boat worked in those areas into the spring of 1948. Toward the end of that period, on 26 April 1948, while conducting a submerged exercise at a depth, &quot;Cochino&quot; collided with the fleet tug . Attempts to go deep and swing the ship proved unsuccessful, and the boat suffered damage to the periscope shears, both periscopes, and her radar antenna.

&quot;Cochino&quot; then underwent repairs and major renovations at her builders&#x27; yard beginning on 11 May 1948. Converted to a GUPPY/Snorkel boat at Groton, she emerged from the yard on 4 February 1949. Departing New London, on 25 March, the newly modernized submarine visited Boston, from 26–27 March, then returned to New London, from 28 March–2 May, after which time she headed south to return to her home port, arriving at Key West, on 8 May. She then again shaped a course for New London, where she remained from 19 May until 16 July, then proceeded to Argentia, Newfoundland, where she arrived on 22 July, en route to the British Isles and her first deployment to European waters.

She reached Derry, Northern Ireland, on 29 July. She operated locally in those waters for a brief period, then put in to Derry, from 4–8 August, before visiting Portsmouth, England, from 8–12 August. She then put to sea for operations above the Arctic Circle in the Barents Sea before turning for home in late August.

In August 1949, &quot;Cochino&quot; and sailed along the Kola Peninsula to determine whether the Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb.

On 25 August 1949, &quot;Cochino&quot; ran into a violent polar storm off Norway. The huge waves slammed the submarine&#x27;s snorkel so violently, and jolted the boat so severely, that the pounding caused an electrical fire and battery explosion, followed by the release of deadly hydrogen gas. In wretched weather conditions, men of &quot;Cochino&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; fought to save the submarine for 14 hours. A second battery explosion on 26 August prompted an &quot;Abandon Ship&quot; order, and after the crew made a dangerous rope transfer to &quot;Tusk&quot;, the abandoned &quot;Cochino&quot; sank at . &quot;Cochino&quot;″s only fatality was a civilian from the Bureau of Ships, technician Robert W. Philo, swept overboard by an icy wave. &quot;Tusk&quot; lost six of her own men in the same manner.

&quot;Cochino&quot; was stricken from the List of Naval Vessels on 27 October 1949.

&quot;Cochino&quot; is one of four United States Navy submarines to be lost since the end of World War II. The others are , and .

<text>USS &quot;Cisco&quot; (SS-290), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the cisco, a whitefish of the Great Lakes.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Cisco&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 24 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. A. C. Bennett, through her proxy, Mrs. N. Robertson, and commissioned on 10 May 1943 with Commander James W. Coe in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Cisco&quot; reported to the United States Pacific Fleet. She sailed from Panama on 7 August 1943 for Brisbane, Australia, arriving 1 September to assume local patrol duties, until 18 September, when she docked at Darwin, Australia. She put out on her first war patrol 20 September 1943, but never returned. Japanese records tell of sighting a submarine leaking oil on 28 September in an area where &quot;Cisco&quot; is known to have been the only submarine then operating. Japanese records state this submarine was sunk by bombs and depth charges. Japanese records state that the submarine was attacked by Nakajima B5N (Allied reporting name &quot;Kate&quot;) attack bombers of the 954 Naval Air Squadron and the gunboat &quot;Karatsu&quot; (originally the U.S. Navy gunboat , captured by Japanese forces and put to work against her former owners). &quot;Cisco&quot; is thus presumed to have been lost in action 28 September 1943. The only survivor from the crew was taken sick in Darwin and sent ashore to the Navy hospital prior to &quot;Cisco&quot;″s final voyage.

<doc id="427083" wikidata="Q434561" url="?curid=427083" title="Vasily Tropinin">
<text>Vasily Andreevich Tropinin (; – ) was a Russian Romantic painter. Much of his life was spent as a serf, not attaining freedom until he was more than forty years old. Three of his more important works are a portrait of Alexander Pushkin and paintings called &quot;The Lace Maker&quot; and &quot;The Gold-Embroideress&quot;.

==Biography==

Vasily was born as a serf of Count Munnich in the village Korpovo of Novgorod guberniya. He was transferred to Count Morkov as part of the dowry of Munnich&#x27;s daughter. Soon he was sent to Saint Petersburg to study the trade of a confectioner. Instead of learning his trade Tropinin secretly attended free drawing lessons in the Imperial Academy of Arts.

In 1799, his owner allowed Tropinin to study at the Academy as a non-degree student (&quot;Postoronny uchenik&quot;). He took lessons from S. S. Schukin and was supported by the President of the Academy Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganov. In 1804 Tropinin&#x27;s work &quot;Boy Grieving for a Dead Bird&quot; was exhibited in the Academy&#x27;s exhibition and was noted by the Russian Empress at the time (most probably the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna).

At the dawn of his success, Count Morkov recalled Tropinin from St. Petersburg to his Ukrainian estate Kukavka. Tropinin was appointed a confectioner and a lackey. Soon the owner changed his mind and assigned Tropinin to copy the works of European and Russian painters and produce portraits of the Morkovs. Tropinin also painted the local church. Tropinin spent around twenty years of his life in Ukraine, and many of his works from that time were of Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian countryside.

Still Tropinin continued to work and study. As a well-established portraitist, he wrote:
The most notable works of that period are &quot;Portrait of A. I. Tropinina, the Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1809), &quot;Portrait of Arseny Tropinin, son of the artist&quot; (c. 1818), &quot;Portrait of the Writer and Historian N. M. Karamzin&quot; (1818).

==Academician==
In 1823 at the age of 47 Tropinin at last became a free man and moved to Moscow. The same year he presented his paintings &quot;The Lace Maker&quot;, &quot;The Beggar&quot; and &quot;The Portrait of artist Skotnikov&quot; to the Imperial Academy of Arts and received the official certificate of a painter (&quot;Svobodnyj Khudozhnik&quot;). In 1824 he was elected an Academician.

Since 1833 he mastered the Moscow &quot;Public Art Classes&quot; that later became the famous Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In 1843 he was elected an honorary member of the &quot;Moscow Art Society&quot;. He died in 1857 and was interred in Vagankovo Cemetery. During his life Tropinin painted more than 3,000 portraits.

In 1969 the Tropinin Museum was opened in Moscow.

<text>Repoussé () or repoussage () is a metalworking technique in which a malleable metal is shaped by hammering from the reverse side to create a design in low relief. Chasing (French: &quot;ciselure&quot;) or embossing is a similar technique in which the piece is hammered on the front side, sinking the metal. The two techniques are often used in conjunction.

Many metals can be used for chasing and repoussé work, including gold, silver, copper, and alloys such as steel, bronze, and pewter.

These techniques are very ancient and have been extensively used all over the world, as they require only the simplest tools and materials, and yet allow great diversity of expression. They are also relatively economical, since there is no loss or waste of metal, which mostly retains its original size and thickness. Toolmarks are often intentionally left visible in the result.

A few among many famous examples of repoussé and chasing are the prehistoric Gundestrup cauldron, the mask on the mummy of Tutankhamun, the body armours of the Bronze Age, the copper ornaments made by the Native Americans in the Southeastern United States, and the Statue of Liberty in New York City.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;repoussé&quot; is French and means &quot;pushed up&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;pulsare&quot;, which means &quot;to push&quot;. Repoussage is the noun to refer to the technique, with &quot;repoussé&quot; being an adjective referring to a piece to which the technique has been applied (e.g. &quot;&quot;repoussé&quot; work&quot;, &quot;&quot;repoussé&quot; piece&quot;).

Chasing comes from the French word, &quot;chasser&quot; meaning to drive out, or to chase around which is what the artists are doing as they &quot;chase&quot; the forms on their metal in order to create their final design.

== History ==
The techniques of repoussé and chasing date from Antiquity and have been used widely with gold and silver for fine detailed work and with copper, tin, and bronze for larger sculptures.

===European prehistory and Bronze Age===
During the 3rd millennium BC, in the Middle East, a variety of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in &quot;intaglio&quot; in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as jet. The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead &quot;force&quot; over it.

The alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief. Here the detail would be greater on the back of the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail.

The use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire.

The Gundestrup cauldron (a product of the Celtic culture, made between 150 BC and 1 AD) had originally thirteen separate silver panels, with repoussé relief, lining the inside and outside of the vessel.

===Ancient Egypt===
In 1400 BC, the Egyptian Amarna period, resin and mud for repoussé backing was in use.

A fine example of Egyptian repoussé is the mummy mask of Tutankhamun, a Pharaoh of the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The majority of the mask was formed using the technique of repoussé from what appears to be a single sheet of gold. The lapis lazuli and other stones were inlaid in chased areas after the height of the form was completed. The ceremonial beard, Nekhbet vulture, and Uraeus were attached separately.

===Classical antiquity===
By Hellenistic times, combined punches and dies were in use. In 400 BC, the Greeks were using beeswax for filler in repoussé.

Classical pieces using repoussage and chasing include the bronze Greek armour plates from the 3rd century BC. 

The Warren Cup is a Roman silver cup, and the Mildenhall Treasure, the Hoxne Hoard, the Water Newton Treasure and the Berthouville Treasure are examples of hoards of Roman silver found in England and northern France with many pieces using these techniques. Another example piece using this technique is The Stag’s Head Rhyton, dating to around 400 BCE, which is made from a silver sheet and features three scenes of warriors battling, each scene with two warriors.

===India===
Repoussé and chasing are commonly used in India to create objects such as water vessels. These vessels are generally made using sheets of copper or silver.

===Pre-Columbian America===
Repoussage and chasing were used by many Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, such as the Chavín culture of Peru (about 900 to 200 BC), to make ornaments of gold and other metals.

During the Hopewell and Mississippian periods of the American Southeast and Midwest goods of repoussé copper were fashioned as ritual regalia and eventually used in prestige burials. Examples have been found with many S.E.C.C. designs such as Bi-lobed arrow motif headdresses and falcon dancer plaques. Although examples have been found in a widely scattered area (Spiro, Oklahoma, Etowah, Georgia, and Moundville, Alabama), most are in what is known as the &quot;Braden Style&quot;, thought to have originated at the Cahokia Site in Collinsville, Illinois. Several copper workshops discovered during excavations of Mound 34 at Cahokia are the only known Mississippian culture copper workshops.

===Modern works===
The largest known sculpture created with this technique is the Statue of Liberty, properly &quot;Liberté éclairant le monde&quot;, (&quot;Liberty Enlightening The World&quot;), in Upper New York Bay. The statue was formed by copper repoussé in sections using wooden structures to shape each piece during the hammering process. 
== Methods ==
The process of chasing and repoussé requires a number of steps.

===Annealing===
The metal plate should usually be annealed—that is, heated for some time at a temperature sufficient to reduce its internal stresses—to make it as malleable as possible. This process may have to be repeated several times, as many metals harden and become brittle as they are deformed by the hammering.

===Pitch backing===
The plate must then be fixed on a suitable support. A commonly used technique is to place the metal over a layer of chasers pitch. The pitch is heated until it is soft enough to make good contact with the metal, filling all its nooks and crannies, and then allowed to cool. At room temperature, the pitch must be hard enough to adhere to the metal and hold it in place, but still soft and plastic enough to &quot;give&quot; as the metal is hammered into it.

The pitch is often cast as a thick layer over some softer backing material that can absorb larger deformations.

The metal plate will have to be released from the pitch several times, for turning it over and/or for re-annealing. Pitch residues stuck to the plate must be removed with an appropriate solvent.

===Lining===
Once the plate is firmly held by the pitch, front side up, the outline of the desired design is lightly chased (&quot;lined&quot;) on it by a special tool (a &quot;liner&quot;), that creates narrow raised lines on the other side.

===Repoussé and chasing===
The metal is turned over, and firmed again over the pitch, with the back side up. The main repoussé work is then performed, using a variety of punches.

Once the main repoussé is done, the piece is again released by heating. The cavities on the back side, created by the repoussé work, are filled with melted pitch. Once that filling has hardened, the plate is again turned over and placed on top of a layer of softened pitch. Once the pitch has hardened, the design is then refined by chasing. These procedures can be repeated several times, alternating between repoussé and chasing.

===Hot forming===
Repoussé and chasing can also be done on materials, like steel, that are too hard to be cold-formed by hammering. That is accomplished by heating the piece to a high enough temperature to make it malleable, as in forging. In this case pitch must be dispensed with, or replaced by some material (like sand) that can withstand the heat and provide the right kind of &quot;giving&quot; support.

== Tools ==

The tools needed for these techniques are 

* A container for the pitch, such as a &quot;pitch tray&quot; for larger plates, or a heavy hemispherical cast iron &quot;pitch bowl&quot; for smaller ones. The bowl can be placed over a sand bag or leather ring, and tilted to whatever angle is most convenient.
* A heat gun or blow torch to soften the pitch in order to fix the plate, or to release it.
* A set of &quot;punches&quot;, that is, chisels with smooth tips that are used to push the metal:
**A &quot;liner&quot; has a flattened tip with a slightly curved blunt edge. It is used to chase narrow grooves in the metal, or to repoussé narrow ridges from the back side; both for outlining the work, and to refine edges in the final object. 
**A &quot;planisher&quot; has a smooth, flat tip meant for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. 
**A &quot;doming&quot; or &quot;dotting&quot; tool has a round or oval tip of small to moderate diameter, and can be used to chase dimples or grooves, or repoussé bumps and ridges, of various widths.
**A &quot;matting&quot; tool has a pattern cut into the tip, and is used (mainly in chasing) to create textured areas.
**A &quot;hollow-faced&quot; punch has a raised contour (circular, or with some other shape) with a hollowed-out middle, and is used to stamp that contour, usually on the front face.
* A lightweight &quot;chasing hammer&quot;, to drive the punches.
* An oxyacetylene torch, blowtorch, or a forge for annealing or hot-working.

Other tools are usually handy, such as tweezers or tongs to hold the hot plates.

The punches are usually made of steel, especially tool steel—a hard alloy that can keep its shape even after years of use—and are forged and tempered at the tip. They usually have a beveled rear end, to better handle the hammer blows. They can be purchased and used as such, modified by the user to suit the needs of a specific work, or made by the user from bar stock. To make or reform the punches, one needs a saw or other cutting device, as well as a grinder and abrasives to shape and polish the tip.

<text>In music, a motif () or motive is a short musical idea, a salient recurring figure, musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a composition. The motif is the smallest structural unit possessing thematic identity.

== History ==
The defines a motif as a &quot;melodic, rhythmic, or harmonic cell&quot;, whereas the 1958 maintains that it may contain one or more cells, though it remains the smallest analyzable element or phrase within a subject. It is commonly regarded as the shortest subdivision of a theme or phrase that still maintains its identity as a musical idea. &quot;The smallest structural unit possessing thematic identity&quot;. Grove and Larousse also agree that the motif may have harmonic, melodic and/or rhythmic aspects, Grove adding that it &quot;is most often thought of in melodic terms, and it is this aspect of the motif that is connoted by the term &#x27;figure&#x27;.&quot;

A harmonic motif is a series of chords defined in the abstract, that is, without reference to melody or rhythm. A melodic motif is a melodic formula, established without reference to intervals. A rhythmic motif is the term designating a characteristic rhythmic formula, an abstraction drawn from the rhythmic values of a melody.

A motif thematically associated with a person, place, or idea is called a leitmotif or &quot;idée fixe&quot;. Occasionally such a motif is a musical cryptogram of the name involved. A head-motif (German: ) is a musical idea at the opening of a set of movements which serves to unite those movements.

Scruton, however, suggests that a motif is distinguished from a figure in that a motif is foreground while a figure is background: &quot;A figure resembles a moulding in architecture: it is &#x27;open at both ends&#x27;, so as to be endlessly repeatable. In hearing a phrase as a figure, rather than a motif, we are at the same time placing it in the background, even if it is...strong and melodious&quot;.

Any motif may be used to construct complete melodies, themes and pieces. Musical development uses a distinct musical figure that is subsequently altered, repeated, or sequenced throughout a piece or section of a piece of music, guaranteeing its unity.

== Examples ==

Such motivic development has its roots in the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti and the sonata form of Haydn and Mozart&#x27;s age. Arguably Beethoven achieved the highest elaboration of this technique; the famous &quot;fate motif&quot; —the pattern of three short notes followed by one long one—that opens his Fifth Symphony and reappears throughout the work in surprising and refreshing permutations is a classic example.

Motivic saturation is the &quot;immersion of a musical motif in a composition&quot;, i.e., keeping motifs and themes below the surface or playing with their identity, and has been used by composers including Miriam Gideon, as in &quot;Night is my Sister&quot; (1952) and &quot;Fantasy on a Javanese Motif&quot; (1958), and Donald Erb. The use of motifs is discussed in Adolph Weiss&#x27; &quot;The Lyceum of Schönberg&quot;.

Hugo Riemann defines a motif as &quot;the concrete content of a rhythmically basic time-unit.&quot;

Anton Webern defines a motif as, &quot;the smallest independent particle in a musical idea&quot;, which are recognizable through their repetition.

Arnold Schoenberg defines a motif as, &quot;a unit which contains one or more features of interval and rhythm [whose] presence is maintained in constant use throughout a piece&quot;.

==Head-motif==
Head-motif (German: &quot;Kopfmotiv&quot;) refers to an opening musical idea of a set of movements which serves to unite those movements. It may also be called a motto, and is a frequent device in cyclic masses.

<doc id="427091" wikidata="Q1810638" url="?curid=427091" title="Flapjack (oat bar)">
<text>A flapjack (also known as a cereal bar, oat bar or oat slice) is a baked bar, cooked in a flat oven tin and cut into squares or rectangles, made from rolled oats, fat (typically butter), brown sugar and usually golden syrup.

The North American granola bar is similar to a flapjack.

==Varieties==

As well as being baked at home, they are widely available in shops, ready-packaged, often with extra ingredients such as chocolate, dried fruit such as glace cherries, nuts, yoghurt and toffee pieces or coatings, either as individual servings or full unsliced trayfuls. Some flapjacks may contain maple syrup. They are usually an alternative to a biscuit or cake, and textures range from soft and moist to dry and crisp. Because of the high levels of fat and calories in traditional recipes, some &quot;diet&quot; versions are available with lower fat and calorie content.

==History==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the word &quot;flapjack&quot; being used as early as the beginning of the 16th century, although at this time it seems to have been a flat tart. Shakespeare refers to &quot;flap-jacks&quot; in &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, but this is one of the many anachronisms in his historical plays and does not suggest that he thought it was a middle eastern dish, merely a common English dessert of the time:

:&quot;Come, thou shant go home, and we&#x27;ll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo&#x27;er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome.&quot;
::Act II Scene I

Later, flapjack would be used to describe something similar to an apple flan, but it is not until 1935 that the word is first used to describe a food made of oats. In the United Kingdom, this usage has mostly superseded earlier recipes.

==Name==
The food is called a flapjack in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and Newfoundland. In other English-speaking countries, the same item is called by different names, such as cereal bar, oat bar or (in Australia and New Zealand) oat slice.

In the United States and Canada, &quot;flapjack&quot; is a widely-known but lesser-used term for pancake.

<doc id="427097" wikidata="Q825946" url="?curid=427097" title="Good Morning America">
<text>Good Morning America (often abbreviated as GMA) is an American morning television program that is broadcast on ABC. It debuted on November 3, 1975, and first expanded to weekends with the debut of a Sunday edition on January 3, 1993. The Sunday edition was canceled in 1999; weekend editions returned on both Saturdays and Sundays on September 4, 2004. The weekday and Saturday programs airs from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. in all United States timezones (live in the Eastern Time Zone and on broadcast delay elsewhere across the country). The Sunday editions are an hour long and are transmitted to ABC&#x27;s stations live at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, although stations in some media markets air them at different times. Viewers in the Pacific Time Zone receive an updated feed with a specialized opening and updated live reports. A third hour of the weekday broadcast aired from 2007 to 2008, exclusively on ABC News Now.

The program features news, interviews, weather forecasts, special-interest stories, and feature segments such as &quot;Pop News&quot; (featuring popular culture and entertainment news, and viral video), the &quot;GMA Heat Index&quot; (featuring a mix of entertainment, lifestyle and human-interest stories) and &quot;Play of the Day&quot; (featuring a selected viral video or television program clip). It is produced by ABC News and broadcasts from the Times Square Studios in New York City&#x27;s Times Square district. The primary anchors are Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, and former New York Giants defensive end and former &quot;Live&quot; co-host Michael Strahan with Rebecca Jarvis Friday co-host, entertainment anchor Lara Spencer and weather anchor Ginger Zee.

&quot;Good Morning America&quot; has been the most watched morning show in total viewers and key demos each year since summer 2012. &quot;GMA&quot; generally placed second in the ratings, behind NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, from 1995 to 2012. It overtook its rival for a period from the early to mid-1980s with anchors David Hartman and Joan Lunden, from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s with Charles Gibson and Lunden, and in April 2012 with Roberts and Stephanopoulos.

&quot;Good Morning America&quot; won the first three Daytime Emmy Awards for &quot;Outstanding Morning Program&quot;, sharing the inaugural 2007 award with &quot;Today&quot; and winning the 2008 and 2009 awards outright.

==History==
===1975: The inaugural year===
On January 6, 1975, ABC launched &quot;AM America&quot; in an attempt to compete with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. The program was hosted by Bill Beutel and Stephanie Edwards, with Peter Jennings reading the news (Jennings had been a replacement for Bob Kennedy, who had been scheduled to be the program&#x27;s newsreader, but died two months before the premiere from bone cancer). Because the show could not find an audience against &quot;Today&quot; (and its anchor team of Jim Hartz and Barbara Walters), ABC sought a new approach. The network found that one of its affiliates, WEWS in Cleveland, Ohio, had been pre-empting &quot;AM America&quot; in favor of airing a locally produced show called &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;.

Unlike &quot;AM America&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; featured an easygoing and less dramatic approach by offering news and weather updates only at the and using the rest of the time to discuss general interest/entertainment topics. &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; also established a group of regular guests who were experts in certain fields, including health, entertainment, consumer affairs, and travel. Also unlike both the NBC and ABC shows, &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; was not broadcast from a newsroom set but instead one that resembled a suburban living room.

In the process of screening the Cleveland morning program as a creative source, ABC also began looking at another local show, &quot;Good Morning!&quot;, which was produced by Boston ABC affiliate WCVB-TV. &quot;Good Morning!&quot; was very similar in format to &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot;, but with a lesser emphasis on news and weather. In fact, once the revamped ABC morning show took to the air late in 1975 under the title &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, WCVB station manager Bob Bennett accused ABC entertainment president Fred Silverman of deliberately stealing the title of &quot;Good Morning!&quot;; no legal cease and desist action was finalized against ABC in the matter, however. The launch of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; did result in the Boston morning show changing its name—to &quot;Good Day!&quot;. Currently, WCVB&#x27;s morning news program is titled &quot;EyeOpener&quot;.

ABC took an episode of &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; and used it as a television pilot. The format replaced &quot;AM America&quot; on Monday, as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The first cohosts were actor David Hartman and actress Nancy Dussault. Dussault was replaced in April 1977 by previously at KABC-TV The show&#x27;s title is the same as the beginning of the chorus of Steve Goodman&#x27;s song &quot;City of New Orleans&quot;.

For the first seven years, weather forecasts were presented by John Coleman, former chief meteorologist for ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago, who left &quot;GMA&quot; in 1982 to start The Weather Channel with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten. Dave Murray (later chief meteorologist at KTVI in St. Louis) provided the forecasts for both &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and ABC&#x27;s early morning news program &quot;ABC News This Morning&quot; from 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by Spencer Christian, who worked at WABC-TV in New York City and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment.

===1976–1989: Growth and change===
The program&#x27;s Nielsen ratings climbed slowly, but steadily throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s while &quot;Today&quot; experienced a slight slump in viewership, especially with Walters&#x27; decision to leave NBC for a job at ABC News. On August 30, 1976, Tom Brokaw began anchoring &quot;Today&quot; while the program began a search for a female co-host. Within a year, &quot;Today&quot; managed to beat back the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; ratings threat with Brokaw and new co-host Jane Pauley, featuring art and entertainment contributor Gene Shalit. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; continued to threaten &quot;Today&quot;″s ratings dominance into the 1980s, especially after Brokaw left the latter program to become co-anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Roger Mudd for 17 months before being named sole anchor of that program. For the first time, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; became the highest-rated morning news program in the United States as &quot;Today&quot; fell to second place.

At the outset, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; was a talk program with a main host, Hartman, who was joined by a sidekick co-host; Dussault and Hill were scripted as less-than-equal hosts. In 1980, an exasperated Hill left &quot;Good Morning America&quot; after run-ins with Hartman, who was said to have &quot;had a problem with strong women.&quot; She was replaced by Joan Lunden, then a reporter at ABC&#x27;s New York City flagship WABC-TV. Hartman and Lunden led the show through several years of success. Lunden&#x27;s popularity led to her promotion to co-anchor in 1986, and to more equal footing with Hartman than any woman before her. The partnership ended on February 20, 1987, when Hartman retired after 3,189 broadcasts.

After Hartman&#x27;s departure, Lunden was paired with ABC News correspondent Charles Gibson on February 23, 1987, which ultimately resulted in ratings for the program skyrocketing. The team of Lunden and Gibson became the most popular news partnership on television in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for the first time &quot;Good Morning America&quot; regularly won the ratings against &quot;Today&quot;. At one point prior to Spencer Christian&#x27;s arrival in 1986, forecasts on the program were provided by WXYZ-TV chief meteorologist Jerry Hodak via a split screen between the WXYZ studios in Detroit and the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; set in New York City.

===1990–1998: Rise and decline===
&quot;Good Morning America&quot; entered the 1990s with continued overwhelming ratings success. Gibson and Lunden became a hard team to beat; however, the program stumbled from its top spot in late 1995, falling to second place behind &quot;Today&quot; (in what would begin a 16-year streak as the top-rated morning news program for that show, which began the week of December 11, 1995). Lunden began to discuss working less and mentioned to network executives that the morning schedule is the hardest in the business. ABC executives promised Lunden that a prime time program; &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; would premiere on the network in 1996.

On September 5, 1997, Lunden decided to step down as host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; after 17 years and was replaced by ABC News correspondent Lisa McRee. The pairing of Gibson and McRee fared well in the ratings. However, ratings sharply declined when Gibson also left the show to make way for Kevin Newman on May 1, 1998. With McRee and Newman as anchors, longtime viewers of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; switched to &quot;Today&quot;, whose ratings skyrocketed.

===January 1999 – May 2005: Gibson–Sawyer===
To improve &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s ratings performance, which briefly fell to third place among the morning shows in January 1999, ABC News management selected Shelley Ross from the field of executive producer candidates. As part of Rossʼs proposed changes, Ross ousted the McRee-Newman team and lobbied to bring in Diane Sawyer and team her with Charles Gibson, who had been reluctant to return. On January 18, 1999, the Gibson-Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on-air, which during the first full season resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network news franchises saw losses.
The show moved from the ABC News headquarters in Manhattan&#x27;s Lincoln Square district to its present home at the Times Square Studios on September 13, 1999. The new location made it possible for the program to feature a live audience inside the studio, similar to the &quot;Window on the World&quot; set used by &quot;Today&quot;. Under Ross, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; became a competitive 24/7 news operation with more exclusive bookings, news and live stock market updates for West Coast viewers and new on-screen graphics that included a news ticker. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; began originating entire shows from unique locations, which, according to Nielsen Media Research, resulted in more people watching the program and for longer periods of time. &quot;GMA&quot; became the first to originate a live show from an aircraft carrier during wartime (the USS Enterprise), from the White House (after the Columbine High School massacre), from The Pentagon (for the reopening of the wing damaged during the September 11 attacks in 2001), from The Vatican (for the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s election as Pope), and from the Tower of London (on the 50th anniversary of Elizabeth IIʼs accession to the throne). Viewership during this time increased by nearly one million households, and revenue soared.

Although &quot;Today&quot; remained the top-rated morning news show, the Sawyer, Gibson and Ross team inched close, creating a viable rival. According to Linda McLoof, executive director of news research at ABC News from 2001 to 2009, &quot;When Shelley left, her viewing momentum was initially sustained, but a season later, the audience began to decline. It is like passing the baton in a relay race.&quot; Antonio Mora served as newsreader for the program until March 18, 2002, when he left to become an anchor at CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV in Chicago. He was replaced by former ESPN anchor and correspondent Robin Roberts.

===May 2005 – June 2006: Gibson–Sawyer–Roberts===
On May 23, 2005, ABC News announced that Robin Roberts would be promoted from newsreader to co-anchor of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, joining Gibson and Sawyer. Roberts had previously served as a regular substitute for Gibson and Sawyer when either of them were on vacation or assignment. On November 3, 2005, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; celebrated its 30th anniversary with retrospectives on and clips from the show&#x27;s history and by decorating Times Square. Former co-hosts Hartman and Lunden, along with former meteorologist Spencer Christian, were among the guests of honor. Hartman signed off the show that day with his trademark close: &quot;From all of us, make it a good day.&quot; That same day, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; became the first network morning news program to begin broadcasting in high-definition television.

On December 2, 2005, weather anchor Tony Perkins left the program after six years. The last ten minutes of that day&#x27;s edition were dedicated to Perkins, during which he gave thanks to one of the show&#x27;s producers and a heartfelt goodbye to anchors Gibson, Roberts and Sawyer. Perkins left the program to return to his family in Washington, D.C., and join Fox owned-and-operated station WTTG, where he previously served as a weather anchor. He affectionately said to his young son on-air, &quot;Connor, if you&#x27;re watching, daddy&#x27;s comin&#x27; home.&quot; Perkins was replaced by Mike Barz, former WGN Morning News sports anchor at WGN-TV in Chicago.

Gibson left &quot;Good Morning America&quot; for the second time on June 28, 2006. That day&#x27;s edition was dedicated to his 19 years as anchor of the program and celebrated his new role as anchor of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. Gibson ended his tenure at &quot;GMA&quot; by stating, &quot;For nineteen years, my mornings have been not just good—they&#x27;ve been great.&quot;

===June 2006 – December 2009: Sawyer–Roberts===
There had been speculation that Sawyer would leave &quot;Good Morning America&quot; when her contract expired in 2007 to assume the anchor position at &quot;ABC World News&quot; that was given to Gibson. In August 2006, Chris Cuomo was named news anchor while continuing his anchoring duties on the newsmagazine &quot;Primetime&quot; and serving as ABC News&#x27;s senior legal correspondent. Meanwhile, Sam Champion, longtime evening meteorologist at WABC-TV, was named as the new weather anchor for the program and as weather editor for ABC News. Both Cuomo and Champion began their respective duties on the program on September 5, 2006, when &quot;Good Morning America&quot; instituted a new graphics package and new news area for Cuomo to report headlines. The following week, on September 13, 2006, the program introduced a new logo—this time with gold Avant Garde font on a blue background, which bears a resemblance to the original &quot;Good Morning America&quot; logo that was used up to early 1987.

On June 29, 2007, the program&#x27;s longtime film critic Joel Siegel died of complications from colorectal cancer at age 63. The July 9 edition of &quot;GMA&quot; was dedicated to Siegel, with former hosts Hartman, Hill, Lunden, Newman, Christian, Perkins and Gibson all appearing to share their memories. One month later, on July 31, 2007, Robin Roberts announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer after discovering a lump in her breast during a self-examination while preparing the Siegel tribute episode. Roberts remained as anchor while undergoing chemotherapy and completed radiation treatments on March 28, 2008.

On October 22, 2007, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; introduced a new on-air graphics package. Using much of the design features of its former graphics, it went from a basic blue background to a more orangish-gold setting. The program&#x27;s opening changed from the camera&#x27;s zooming in on the hosts while introducing the host to an opening with new music (by the New York City-based music production company DreamArtists Studios) and a background with the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; logo descending onto the frame. It also changed its news ticker and time-and-temperature bug for the first time in years. The ticker featured an orange background with a modified ABC News logo as a breakpoint for each headline. The bug still featured the time and current local temperature to the left, but with an orange backdrop with an alternate &quot;GMA&quot; logo and the ABCNews.com logo to the right.

On January 15, 2008, during an interview with Diane Sawyer on the program, actress Diane Keaton commented on Sawyer&#x27;s physical attractiveness, stating that if she had lips like Sawyer&#x27;s, &quot;then I wouldn&#x27;t have worked on my &quot;[expletive]&quot; personality!&quot; Keaton quickly apologized for the remark and Sawyer jokingly threatened to have her mother &quot;work on your personality with soap in your mouth.&quot; Officials with the Federal Communications Commission declined to take action for the fleeting expletive. Following the death of Michael Jackson, Charles Gibson returned to the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; anchor desk with Roberts on June 26, 2009, while Sawyer was away.

In September 2008, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s anchors rode an Amtrak train to tour the United States as part of ABC News″s &quot;50 States in 50 Days&quot; event, for which the program was broadcast from different locations around the U.S. each day throughout that month. The tour&#x27;s first telecast stop was in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and featured musical guest James Taylor

===December 2009 – April 2014: Roberts–Stephanopoulos===

On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that Sawyer would replace Gibson as anchor of &quot;ABC World News&quot; at the end of that year. Speculation had abounded that either George Stephanopoulos, news anchor Chris Cuomo, weekend anchor Bill Weir, or &quot;World News&quot; Saturday anchor David Muir would replace Sawyer on the program. Representatives for ABC News stated that it wanted to return the show to the original male-female anchor format. On December 10, 2009, Stephanopoulos was announced as Sawyer&#x27;s replacement, with Juju Chang replacing Cuomo as newsreader; the changes took effect four days later on December 14.

In April 2010, the anchor desk in the studio was relocated back in front of the window overlooking Times Square, where it had been when &quot;Good Morning America&quot; moved to the Times Square Studios facility in 1999; the news desk was also moved in front of a window. On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new &quot;light blue and sunny&quot; graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios. An entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the monitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00 a.m. hour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in the same place. This was the first major set change since the show upgraded to high definition in November 2005.

On February 25, 2011 James Goldston moved from &quot;Nightline&quot; to become Senior Executive Producer of &quot;GMA&quot;. On March 17, 2011, ABC News President Ben Sherwood announced that former &quot;GMA&quot; national correspondent Lara Spencer would be rejoining the program in May in a newly created lifestyle anchor position. On March 29, 2011, ESPN anchor Josh Elliott was named news anchor of the program following the departure of Juju Chang.

In the summer of 2011, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; decided to vacate the second floor of the Times Square studios, which overlooked Times Square, due to cost issues. On September 6, 2011, the program began broadcasting from an entirely new studio set located on the first floor (ground level) of the Times Square studios. The main &quot;window&quot; behind the presenters in the new set, which also shows a view overlooking Times Square from an above-ground level, is actually a back-projection, although there are several real windows used in other parts of the set.

Amid declining ratings at &quot;Today&quot; in the aftermath of reports of Matt Lauer&#x27;s alleged role in Ann Curry&#x27;s departure as co-host (though ratings had been in a steady decline for that program during Curry&#x27;s co-hosting tenure), viewership for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; increased starting in 2012. The program beat &quot;Today&quot; for the first time in 16 years during the week of April 9, 2012, ending that program&#x27;s streak of 852 consecutive weeks as the most-watched network morning news program, by a margin of 31,000 more viewers than the NBC program. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; beat &quot;Today&quot; once again during the week of April 16, 2012, by a much larger margin of 166,000 viewers.

During the week of April 1, 2012, ABC News special correspondent Katie Couric, who had recently joined the network as part of a deal to host a syndicated talk show distributed by corporate sister Disney–ABC Domestic Television, filled for Robin Roberts on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Couric had hosted the rival NBC morning program &quot;Today&quot; from 1991 to 2006; her &quot;Good Morning America&quot; stint marked her return to morning news after six years.

On August 30, 2012, Roberts went on medical leave after undergoing a bone marrow transplant (donated by her sister and fellow news anchor SallyAnn Roberts) following her diagnosis with myelodysplastic syndrome. &quot;GMA&quot; correspondent Amy Robach and &quot;20/20&quot; anchor Elizabeth Vargas served as the primary substitutes, typically alternating every other week. Others, including some celebrities, also served as special guest anchors during this time such as Kelly Ripa, Jessica Simpson, Barbara Walters and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. On January 14, 2013, Roberts announced that she hoped to return to the program sometime that February; Roberts performed dry run rehearsals during the week of January 21 in preparation for her return; she and her doctors evaluated her body&#x27;s reaction to the makeup, the lighting, her hair, and the number of people she comes in contact with to avoid compromising her then-gradually-improving health. Roberts returned to &quot;Good Morning America&quot; part-time on February 20, 2013; she announced in August 2013 that she would return to full-time hosting duties on September 3 of that year.

In 2013, &quot;GMA&quot; won its first Nielsen ratings in 18 years. On December 4, 2013, weather anchor Sam Champion departed &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and ABC News after seven years on the program to join The Weather Channel, where he became primary anchor of the competing morning program &quot;America&#x27;s Morning Headquarters&quot; (which debuted in March 2014). He was succeeded the following day by Ginger Zee, who had been serving as meteorologist for the weekend editions of &quot;GMA&quot; and was also appointed to Champion&#x27;s former position as weather editor for ABC News.

On March 30, 2014, news anchor Josh Elliott left ABC News after three years as news anchor of &quot;GMA&quot; to become a correspondent for NBC Sports, amid reports that contract negotiations to increase his annual salary (from $1.2 million to $8 million) broke down; Elliott was replaced as news anchor by Amy Robach later that week. The program continued to dominate over the competition, even with the loss of two major co-hosts in Champion and Elliott.

In early April 2014, several media reports speculated that Michael Strahan would be joining &quot;GMA&quot; as a contributing anchor, while maintaining his co-host duties on &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; (which is also syndicated by Disney–ABC Domestic Television). Strahan&#x27;s new position was confirmed on April 15, 2014, when he was introduced to the audience as the new contributing anchor on the program.

===April 2014 – September 2016: Roberts–Stephanopoulos–Spencer===

On April 18, 2014, Lara Spencer was promoted to co-anchor effective immediately, receiving top billing on the program alongside Roberts and Stephanopoulos.

In September 2014, former NFL player Tim Tebow was announced to be joining the program as a part-time correspondent to help launch the new segment, &quot;Motivate Me Mondays&quot;. He made his debut on the program on September 15, 2014.

On November 19, 2015, the program celebrated its 40th anniversary, with all the main anchors and most of the news and weather anchors returning to join the celebration and share their stories. Clips from all 40 years were shown.

On April 19, 2016, Strahan announced that he would be leaving &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; to join &quot;Good Morning America&quot; full-time.

===September 2016–present: Roberts–Stephanopoulos–Strahan===

On September 6, 2016, Michael Strahan began his run as official full-time co-anchor of the program along with Roberts, Stephanopoulos, and Spencer. A new title sequence was debuted not including Spencer&#x27;s name. The first hour focuses on the news of the morning anchored by Roberts, Stephanopulos, and Strahan. Zee does segments of the weather and Robach reads the morning headlines. The second hour is in the second floor studio and is taped in front of a live studio audience. It focuses on &quot;soft news&quot; and entertainment. It is anchored by the three main co-anchors (including Spencer) and features guests and talk show panel discussion.

In April 2018, it was announced that Spencer would cut back on her hours on &quot;GMA&quot; from five days a week to three to focus on her own projects.
Roberts also announced she would no longer anchor Fridays except for Christmas or New Years.
On May 23, 2018, an afternoon extension of &quot;GMA&quot; (originally titled &quot;GMA Day&quot;, now known as &quot;GMA3&quot;) was announced as a replacement in the fall of 2018 for the cancelled cooking series &quot;The Chew&quot; in the 1:00 p.m. ET/noon CT timeslot.

In April 2022, Roberts celebrated her 20th anniversary with &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, during which an on-air celebration was held with Roberts being honored with a plaque featuring her name on the grounds of Times Square.

An anthropomorphic show mascot, Ray, styled as a sun-like creature, was introduced to the viewers on September 7, 2023.

In the first half of 2024, the show uncharacteristically struggled in the ratings race. It lost the demographic of adults under the age of 54 to the &quot;Today&quot; show for several months, and periodically lost the same demographic in that period to &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;.

The show is expected to relocate with many of ABC News and WABC-TV&#x27;s on-air studio operations to a new Disney facility at 4 Hudson Square some time in 2025.

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;Good Night America&quot;===
&quot;Good Night America&quot; was a late night talk show/news magazine hosted by Geraldo Rivera in the 1970s as part of ABC&#x27;s late night line up, also ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World Special&quot;. Though not exactly like &quot;GMA&quot; it was more of a talk show format, with guests and interviewing them and also topics of current events, with Rivera ending the show with commentary. After &quot;Good Night America&quot; went off the air, Rivera still worked for ABC eventually working for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; when it premiered in November 1975, while still working for ABC News and its other shows such as &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot;.

===&quot;Good Afternoon America&quot;===
A special summer afternoon edition of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, titled &quot;Good Afternoon America&quot;, premiered on July 9, 2012, as a temporary replacement for the canceled talk/lifestyle show &quot;The Revolution&quot; in the 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time weekday slot.

&quot;Good Afternoon America&quot; was taped immediately after the morning program and focused on lighter fare, with the exception of the July 20 edition, which provided live coverage of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. Like its morning counterpart, &quot;Good Afternoon America&quot; originated from Times Square Studios. The limited-run program, which ended on September 7, 2012, was hosted by then &quot;Good Morning America&quot; news anchor Josh Elliott and lifestyle anchor Lara Spencer.

===&quot;GMA Wake Up Call&quot;===
&quot;GMA Wake Up Call&quot; is a pre-morning show hosted by Ginger Zee. Substitute hosts include Rob Marciano. This spin-off is a lead in to the actual GMA program airing live stream on social media outlets. The show airs between 6:45 a.m. and 6:50 a.m. ET and runs for 10–15 minutes.

===&quot;GMA Lunch Break&quot;===
&quot;GMA Lunch Break&quot; is a half-hour afternoon show airing on social media outlets between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. also hosted by Zee. This focuses on a featured lunch recipe.

===&quot;GMA Deals&quot;===
&quot;GMA Deals&quot; airs on social media outlets on select days at 8:30 a.m. Hosted by Zee and Tory Johnson, it is an extension of the show&#x27;s popular segment where influencers and other representatives of companies demonstrate products on-air and offer deal of the day on the offered product or service.

=== &quot;GMA3&quot; ===

&quot;GMA3&quot; is a spinoff/third hour of &quot;GMA&quot; that was originally hosted by Michael Strahan and Sara Haines. The show premiered on September 10, 2018, under the title of &quot;GMA Day&quot;, and later became known as &quot;GMA3&quot; on January 28, 2019, with &quot;Strahan and Sara&quot; being the subtitle. On August 26, 2019, after filling in as a summer co-host during Haines&#x27; maternity leave, actress and singer Keke Palmer joined as a permanent third co-host and the show took the subtitle of &quot;Strahan, Sara and Keke&quot; until March 2020, when it became &quot;GMA3: What You Need to Know&quot;, an hour-long news program hosted by Amy Robach that originally covered the COVID-19 pandemic. Later in 2020, Palmer and industry insiders announced the &quot;Strahan, Sara and Keke&quot; incarnation of the program would not return and was, in effect, cancelled.

==Weekend editions==
==International broadcasts==

In Australia, the Nine Network broadcast &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on all its regional affiliates from 2016 to 2021. Nine Regional had begun broadcasting it before 2016. Since 2021, WIN Television, has broadcast it on a one-day delay every Tuesday through Friday from 3:30 to 5:00, Saturdays from 5:30 to 7:00, Sundays from 6:00 to 7:00 and Monday mornings from 4:00 to 5:00 a.m.

The Nine broadcasts featured a map providing forecasts for Australia in place of the national U.S. weather map. However, as of July 3, 2018, Nine no longer airs the show. Although it aired at the same time as Seven Network and Network 10&#x27;s broadcasts of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; (including its predecessor, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;), &quot;Good Morning America&quot;″s broadcasts by Nine were unchallenged ratings-wise in some regions where other affiliates preempt their networks&#x27; U.S. breakfast programs with paid and religious programming.

==Accolades==
In 1992 and 1993, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk/Service Show. In 21st GLAAD Media Awards, the program was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for &quot;Outstanding TV Journalism Segment&quot; for the segment &quot;Total Transformation: Why Chaz Bono Decided to Change&quot;. At the 32nd GLAAD Media Awards, the program was again nominated for the &quot;Outstanding TV Journalism Segment&quot; category for the segment &quot;Dwyane Wade One-On-One: Basketball Legend Opens Up About Supporting Transgender Daughter.&quot;

<text>In music, precompositional decisions are those decisions which a composer decides upon before or while beginning to create a composition. These limits may be given to the composer, such as the length or style needed, or entirely decided by the composer.

Precompositional decisions may also include which key, scale, musical form, style, genre, or idiom in which to write, to use techniques such as the twelve tone technique, serialism, or not to (consciously) use a system at all. Other examples may include isorhythm, ostinato, passacaglia, chaconne, rhythms, or chord progression.

Precompositional decisions do not necessarily, and almost always do not, preclude compositional decisions, and may actually allow the initial consideration of the choices to be made. One might say that, &quot;thus, while it liberates imagination as to what the world &quot;may&quot; be, it refuses to legislate as to what the world &quot;is&quot;&quot; (Bertrand Russell, &quot;Our Knowledge of the External World&quot;). Thus precompositional decisions do not necessarily ease the compositional choices.

On the other hand, the concept of precompositional decisions is unclear as it is often impossible to determine which decisions occur before or during a composition.</text><links>

<doc id="427105" wikidata="Q231298" url="?curid=427105" title="40–40 club">
<text>In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 40–40 club is the group of batters, currently six, who have collected 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in a single season. Few professional baseball players have possessed both the power and speed to reach this level, and no players have done so more than once. The six players with a 40–40 season are Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano, Ronald Acuña Jr., and Shohei Ohtani. Acuna is the only player to achieve a 40-70 season, achieving this feat in 2023, and Ohtani is the only player to achieve a 50–50 season, having done so in 2024.

==Early history and pioneers==

The first player to approach the mark was Ken Williams in 1922, with 39 home runs and 37 stolen bases, thus making him the first player to reach the 30–30 club. It took another 30 years for another player to come close to 40–40, as Willie Mays did in 1956 with 36 home runs and 40 stolen bases. In 1973, Bobby Bonds achieved 39–43; he hit a home run in the 1973 MLB All Star Game, which did not count as an official home run.

When Jose Canseco predicted he would reach 40–40 in 1988, he mistakenly assumed &quot;five or six players must have done it.&quot; After Canseco became the first player to reach 40–40, Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle was quoted as saying, &quot;Hell, If I&#x27;d known 40–40 was going to be a big deal, I&#x27;d have done it every year!&quot; Mantle&#x27;s closest total was 31–21 in 1959.

==Members==
Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Alfonso Soriano, and Ronald Acuña Jr. were outfielders in their 40–40 seasons, while Alex Rodriguez played shortstop. Shohei Ohtani served as a designated hitter in his 40–40 season due to an arm injury he suffered in the previous year. Acuña Jr. (41–37 in 2019), Soriano (39–41 in 2002, when playing second base), and Bonds (40–37 in 1997) all came close to having multiple 40–40 seasons.

Canseco, Bonds, and Soriano joined the 40–40 club by stealing their 40th bases, while Rodriguez, Acuña Jr., and Ohtani joined by hitting their 40th home runs. Ohtani is the only player to achieve both in the same game, stealing his 40th base in the fourth inning and then hitting a game-winning, walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the ninth for his 40th home run.

Canseco, Acuña Jr., and Ohtani all won the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award in the year of their 40–40 seasons. All three&#x27;s teams also reached the MLB playoffs in their 40–40 years, and Ohtani&#x27;s Dodgers won the World Series in his 50–50 year. Soriano is the only member of the club to have a batting average under .300 in his 40–40 season. Soriano also hit 41 doubles during his 40–40 season, making him the only player to achieve that feat.

As of 2024, Acuña Jr. and Ohtani are the only active players who have achieved a 40–40 season. All four retired 40–40 club members had at least 400 career home runs and 200 stolen bases in their careers, and Bonds and Rodriguez are also members of the 600 home run club. 

No members of the 40–40 club have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Active players are ineligible for the Hall of Fame, and Soriano fell off the Hall of Fame ballot in his first year of eligibility in 2020. The other retired members of the 40–40 club have been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs; Bonds and Canseco were each implicated in the December 2007 Mitchell Report, while Rodriguez admitted in 2009 to using steroids.

==In non-MLB leagues==
After stealing a base in an October 2, 2015 game for the NC Dinos, first baseman Eric Thames became the first player to reach 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in a season in a Korea Baseball Organization season. The feat has never been achieved in Nippon Professional Baseball; the closest effort was Koji Akiyama&#x27;s 1987 season, in which he hit 43 home runs and stole 38 bases.

== 50–50 season== 

As of 2024, players have stolen 50 bases or more in an MLB season almost 500 times, while players have hit 50 home runs or more 50 times, but only Shohei Ohtani in 2024 has done both in the same season. Two other players, Barry Bonds and Brady Anderson, achieved 50 home runs in one season and 50 stolen bases in another season during their careers.

Before Ohtani&#x27;s 50–50 season, the highest number of home runs in a 50-stolen base season was 41 by Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023, and the highest number of stolen bases in a 50-home run season was 24, a mark shared by Willie Mays in 1955 and Alex Rodriguez in 2007.

In the September 19, 2024, game in which Ohtani reached the 50–50 plateau, he also became the first Dodger to achieve 10 or more runs batted in (RBIs) in a single game, a mark only achieved by 16 other batters. In the game, Ohtani went 6-for-6 with three home runs and two doubles, and also stole two bases. He finished the 2024 season with 54 home runs and 59 stolen bases.

<doc id="427110" wikidata="Q188162" url="?curid=427110" title="Ford Five Hundred">
<text>The Ford Five Hundred is a full-size four-door five-passenger front-engine front- or all-wheel drive high-roof sedan manufactured and marketed in North America by Ford in a single generation for model years 2005-2007. It was a direct byproduct of Ford&#x27;s rapid 2006-2011 acquisition of numerous brands (e.g., Volvo Cars in 1999); a critical need to leverage those investments; a strong market shift in automotive tastes away from sedans to minivans and SUV/CUVs — and a concerted effort by Ford to rethink the traditional sedan/wagon formula. 

Presented as a single concept drawing at the 2002 New York Auto Show, the Five Hundred (its name evoking the classic Fairlane 500 and Galaxie 500 models of the 1950s-1970s) was formally presented in production form at the 2004 North American International Auto Show along with its co-developed platform-mates, the Mercury Montego and the crossover Ford Freestyle — the so called &quot;Chicago D3&#x27;s&quot;, for the plant where they were manufactured (Chicago Assembly) and the platform they shared, the D3 platform, a revised variant of Volvo&#x27;s P2 platform. 

Ford chose to continue its fourth generation Taurus, critical to the company&#x27;s fleet sales (to large corporations, small businesses, rental car firms, utility companies, and government agencies) and overlap that production with the Five Hundred, emphasizing its optional all-wheel drive and continuously variable transmission, extensive safety features, large interior volume and high H-point seating, the latter marketed as &quot;Command View&quot; seating. 

Internally designated the &quot;D258&quot; model, the Five Hundred was styled by George Bucher, Chief Designer, under the direction of Ford Vice President of Design, J Mays who gave the Five Hundred its name, recalling the &quot;500&quot; suffix Ford had used to designate a model&#x27;s top trim level, as with the &quot;Galaxie &quot;500&quot;&quot;.

The Five Hundred&#x27;s 203hp engine and conservative styling became points of criticism, and sales fell markedly short of company projections — requiring substantive discounts by its second model year. The Five Hundred was quickly but lightly facelifted and given a new nameplate for model years 2008-2009 — becoming the fifth generation Ford Taurus. 

Having entered production on July 12, 2004 and gone on sale in September 2004, the Five Hundred reached 65% of its projected annual sales of 120,000 — or total domestic sales of 241,000 over three model years. The &quot;Five Hundred&quot; nameplate continued in use outside North America.

== Background ==
As part of the 1999 acquisition of Volvo Cars and its addition to Premier Automotive Group, Ford Motor Company expanded on its vehicle safety technology capabilities and began development of a 4th generation (D186) Taurus replacement. 

In 2000, Ford presented the Prodigy concept, a 72 MPG diesel-electric hybrid designed as part of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. The Prodigy influenced the exterior styling of the Five Hundred as well as the horizontal &quot;three-bar&quot; grille which subsequently became a Ford styling theme.
== Design ==

Noted for its minimalist exterior styling, the &quot;strong graphic simplicity&quot; of its interior design, tall interior cabin, high H-point seating and prominent greenhouse recalling the Volkswagen Passat (1997–2005) and Audi A6 (1997–2004), the Five Hundred was designed by George Bucher, Chief Designer, under the direction of Ford Vice President of Design, J Mays, who&#x27;d previously designed both for Passat and Audi while with the Volkswagen Group. Ford vice president Phil Martens noted that at a time when the industry was trying to design car-based crossovers, the Five Hundred was the first crossover-based car. 

=== Platform and safety ===
The Five Hundred uses the Ford D3 platform shared with the Mercury Montego and Ford Freestyle. An evolution of the Volvo P2 platform (used in the Volvo S80), the D3 platform marked the shift to front-wheel drive in full-size Ford sedans; an electro-hydraulic Haldex all-wheel drive system (based on that used on the Volvo S80 and XC90) was optional in all versions of the Five Hundred or Mercury Montego.

In addition to adapting the P2 platform and its Haldex AWD to the Five Hundred, Volvo engineers incorporated numerous Volvo safety innovations. Front seats sit on a hydroformed cross-car steel beam between the B-pillars (directly below an identical beam above the B-pillars), complemented by reinforced roof crossmember — marketed by Ford as &quot;SPACE&quot; architecture (Side Protection and Cabin Enhancement), an adaptation of Volvo&#x27;s Side Impact Protection System (SIPS), channeling impact forces around the passenger compartment. Front frame rails were redesigned to better absorb impact forces. Volvo co-engineered the collapsible steering column and roof-mounted airbags. With standard dual front airbags, the Five Hundred was available with an optional safety package that included both side airbags and curtain airbags. The Five Hundred received both a five-star rating for front- and side-impact performance in government testing, as well as a &quot;Best Pick&quot; rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for frontal crash performance.

Incorporating independent suspensions front and rear, the Five hundred used MacPherson strut front suspension and a multi-link rear axle with coilover shocks — along with front and rear stabilizer bars and four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes (12.5-inch front, 13-inch rear).

The Five Hundred/Mercury Montego was powered by a single engine, shared with the Ford Taurus: a 203 hp 3.0L Duratec V6, paired with a 6-speed Aisin automatic transmission (for front-wheel drive versions) or a ZF CVT (for AWD), the latter a first for a US domestic automaker.

=== Packaging ===

A major strategy behind the design of the Five Hundred, described by Ford as a &quot;high-package&quot; strategy, combines the interior roominess of a large car and retains the exterior proportions, maneuverability, and fuel-economy benefits of a mid-size car. The Five Hundred&#x27;s driving position, marketed as &quot;command seating&quot; derives from a major selling point of minivans and SUVs buyers: its raised greenhouse allowing an elevated &quot;H-point&quot;and a more &quot;upright&quot; front seating position, and three and half feet of rear leg room.

A distinguishing feature of the &quot;Five Hundred&quot; is its 61.5&quot; overall height — over 5 inches taller than the Ford Taurus marketed alongside it. The high-roof design allowed an elevated H-point (hip point). As with the first-generation Ford Focus, the seats of the Five Hundred were positioned relatively high off the floor, providing an upright seating position for improved visibility, access, egress and driver confidence. The rear seat was positioned higher than the front seats. 60/40 folding rear seat supplemented the 21 cubic foot trunk (larger than the Lincoln Town Car). With the option of a folding front passenger seat, a Five Hundred was able to carry objects up to ten feet long inside the vehicle, with a passenger volume EPA-rated at 107.5 cu ft.

While visibility was one factor behind the higher seating position, safety was another. Derived from the Volvo Side Impact Protection System (SIPS), seating sat atop a cross-car steel beam underneath the front seats.

George Bucher, Ford&#x27;s chief designer said &quot;it was a challenge to sculpt a Ford-styled body around a Volvo chassis, and added that designers used what he calls plainer surfaces with taut lines to give the car a modern look without losing its passenger-car proportions.&quot;

=== Trim levels, equipment and updates===
At introduction, Ford marketed the Five Hundred in three graduating trim levels: &quot;SE&quot;, &quot;SEL&quot;, and &quot;Limited&quot;. An all wheel drive system was available across the range, and included self-leveling shocks. Base prices start at US$22,795 for a front-wheel drive &quot;SE&quot; and range to US$28,495 for an all-wheel drive &quot;Limited&quot;. Interior trim featured a new hydrographic system for simulated metal mesh on the SE trim and burled wood on SEL and Limited. All models received a 36,000 mile, three year warranty.

MY 2005: 2005 trim level equipment included:

::SE - SE equipment included front-wheel drive; cloth upholstery; six way power driver&#x27;s seat with manual lumbar; delayed accessory power; power remote trunk release; folding power mirrors; power locks; power windows with one-touch up/down driver&#x27;s window; cruise control with steering wheel controls, black speedometer and tachometer,tilt collapsable steering column (aligned to the driver&#x27;s size and safety-belt use, two power points, front overhead console with dome light, map lights and sunglasses holder; 17&quot; painted alloy rims; AM/FM stereo with single-CD player; body color mirrors and handles; black front grille; simulated carbon fiber interior and console trim; floor mats front and rear, eight cupholders, sliding sunvisors with illuminated vanity mirrors, air conditioning with rotary controls; illuminated entry, second-row reading lights, 60/40 split-folding rear seatbacks, compact spare tire, anti-lock brakes, Ford&#x27;s proprietary engine immobilizer key passive anti-theft technology, marketed as &quot;SecuriLock&quot;; post-crash alert system and fob-operated remote keyless entry augmented by a door-mounted keypad system, marketed as &quot;Securicode&quot;, to enable tiered or time-restricted permissions, i.e., the code giving access to the vehicle but not its operation — and the code being easily changed to prevent subsequent vehicle access.

=== Engineering ===
The Five Hundred was engineered with a quality control system known internally as &quot;Total Vehicle Geometry&quot; (TVG). Designed by Volvo, TVG was heavily computer-based, allowing access for designers, engineers and suppliers to all data and results related to prototypes at all stages of the design process. With improved participation and access, precision of fit and finish was increased on prototype parts, decreasing the time needed for preliminary production vehicles, so-called &quot;pilot&quot; vehicles.

Using new powertrain electronics, the Five Hundred employed a CAN bus system with a Black Oak controller and PowerPC machine language and floating-point calculations for improved execution times.

== Discontinuation ==


The Five Hundred ended production on April 12, 2007, as did the Mercury Montego and Ford Freestyle. For the 2007 North American International Auto Show, Ford introduced a mid-cycle 2008 update of the Five Hundred and Montego; the new sedans had front and rear fascia styling, new interiors, and new powertrains with a 263 hp 3.5L V6 and a new 6-speed automatic transmission.

Although the changes were positively received, Ford CEO Alan Mulally chose to rename all three D3 platform cars, with the Five Hundred and Montego becoming the fifth-generation Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable; the similarly updated Ford Freestyle continued as the Ford Taurus X. Although the Taurus had been out of retail markets since 2006 (the Sable, since 2005), Mullaly cited the larger brand familiarity of the Taurus/Sable nameplates as the reason for the renaming of the two D3 sedans.

For the 2010 model year, the Ford Taurus underwent an extensive redesign. Retaining the D3 chassis, the exterior and interior was revised, to add more aggressive styling. This became the final generation Taurus for North America. 

== Sales and incentives ==
Intended to increase the company&#x27;s profitability and reduce incentives, Ford projected annual Five Hundred sales of 120,000. Actual sales reached approximately 65% of projections. During its initial model year Ford refrained from market incentives, providing substantive incentives midway into its second model year.
==Reception==
Overall: The Five Hundred was well received for its SUV-like packaging with a raised overall height, elevated seating and large interior volume — as well as its extensive safety features and available CVT transmission and all-wheel drive.
* At the 2004 New York International Auto Show, at the time GM executive, Bob Lutz, said &quot;it is very space- and package-efficient and seems to have a very nice interior from a craftsmanship standpoint. But to me the interesting thing is the broad reuse of that front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive architecture, the fact that it shares a common architecture with the Ford Freestyle and allegedly with some Volvo models. If you do it cleverly, you can get quite an array of vehicles that all look and behave very differently.&quot; 
*Mark Phelan of the Detroit Free Press noted &quot;while there&#x27;s lots to like about Ford&#x27;s new big sedan, there&#x27;s nothing to love. It&#x27;s a practical but unspectacular car with a couple of shortcomings which drop it to average in the family sedan segment.&quot;

Performance: Offering a single 203 hp engine, the Five Hundred&#x27;s performance was considered acceptable albeit lackluster. 
* Ford itself noted the engines deficiencies, the company&#x27;s marketing manager noting at the car&#x27;s introduction that &quot;one of the hurdles we’re going to have to overcome is the 203 horsepower.&quot;
* Noted automotive journalists Tom and Ray Magliozzi said &quot;some reviewers (note: not owners) have complained about the lack of power available from the six-cylinder, 203 horsepower engine, given the weight of the Five Hundred, which is just under 4,000 pounds. But we found the engine to be perfectly adequate. It cruised on the highway at 80 without the least complaint. And the power was just fine around town. Only lead-foots would have reason to whine.&quot; Writing for Motor Trend, Julian Mackie called the exhaust note &quot;flatulent.&quot;

Styling: The Five Hundred&#x27;s design team had aimed for guilt-free, unpretentious luxury, and assessments ranged from handsome and elegant to overly conservative. The New York Times called the Five Hundred&#x27;s styling &quot;rigorously understated.&quot; 

* Stylist George Bucher said &quot;it is not overly styled, but has a large presence because of its size; it&#x27;s designed to look very upscale.&quot; 

* Ford&#x27;s Chief Designer, J Mays, said &quot;It&#x27;s human nature that everybody wants what they can&#x27;t have. Let&#x27;s say you aspire to have a German luxury sedan, but you just don&#x27;t have the cash to do it. With the Five Hundred, you can pull up in front of a very upscale restaurant or hotel in that vehicle and not feel the least bit embarrassed.&quot; 

* In 2003, The New York Times&#x27; Danny Hakim called the Five Hundred Ford&#x27;s &quot;answer to European-style sedans like those from Volkswagen and Audi.&quot; The car&#x27;s upper styling, its greenhouse, was commonly noted for closely if not flagrantly mimicking Volkswagen and Audi designs from Mays&#x27; own previous tenure with the Volkswagen Group.
* MotorWeek said &quot;Ford aimed for a more upscale feel from the Five Hundred, and the styling reflects that. The lines show a strong European influence, with a front end resembling Ford of Europe’s popular Mondeo. The tail is tall and wide, with very German-looking lights and greenhouse. Not surprising since Ford styling chief Jay Mays is a veteran of Volkswagen and Audi design. Regardless, the new Five Hundred is handsome from every angle.&quot; 
* Tom and Ray Magliozzi said &quot;at its best, it&#x27;s plain in a tasteful, slightly Euro way. At its worst, it looks like a geezer-mobile without any thought to styling.&quot; 
* Pulitzer Prize-winning automotive journalist Dan Neil, then of the Los Angeles Times, said &quot;the car&#x27;s conservative design shows &#x27;admirable restraint,&#x27; noting a similarity to the Passat. &quot;Is the car beautiful, exciting? No. But (it&#x27;s) well-balanced, grown-up, and it&#x27;s a terrific packaging job. It suggests mental health, not emotional rescue.&quot; He would later describe the styling of the Five Hundred&#x27;s twin, the Mercury Montego, as &quot;about as sexy as going through your mother&#x27;s underwear drawer,&quot; adding he could not recall &quot;any designed product that is as awesomely cheap-looking as the audio and climate controls in the car. 

* Noted automotive designer and journalist Robert Cumberford said &quot;it&#x27;s a pretty good trick to make a brand-new car look old, bland and boring right out of the box. &#x27;Early Audi with a (Ford) Mondeo front-end graft&#x27; just about describes the styling, and saying it&#x27;s a 5-liter-engine car with only 3 liters under the hood just about describes the mechanical package.&quot;No doubt it&#x27;s a good car, but one fundamentally uninteresting visually.&quot; 
*Autos Canada noted: &quot;George Bucher, chief designer of the Five Hundred, described [the Five Hundred] in terms of having &quot;road authority&quot; and &quot;presence” (rather than using adjectives like beautiful or sleek). With this design Ford [was] emphasizing refinement and lack of ostentation, and while it’s by no means unattractive, neither [was] the Five Hundred particularly exciting.&quot; 

* In 2014, Ford designer J Mays would later call the &quot;Five Hundred&quot; too conservative, likening the vehicle to a beautifully tailored Brooks Brothers suit, another time saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Five Hundred or Freestyle was one of my brighter moments in Ford, but designing a car is not a solo effort and a lot of people have input on the kind of product they want. I&#x27;ve been at the company 13 years and I&#x27;ve been through five CEOs. Some of those CEOs have had more conservative tastes than others.&quot; Mays later conceded of the Five Hundred&#x27;s styling: &quot;It&#x27;s just lacking in the emotional appeal that we should have put into it. We were being good team players, and we did our best to wrap what was a best-in-class package with sheetmetal, and we ended up with a car, I think, that compromised itself in terms of style. But we will never make that mistake again. In fact, we haven&#x27;t made a mistake like that since we did it. I think of all the cars I&#x27;ve designed in my career, I regret not pushing harder on that car.&quot;

<text>The Narrows is the tidal strait separating the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. It connects the Upper New York Bay and Lower New York Bay (of larger New York Bay) and forms the principal channel by which the Hudson River flowing south from upstate New York and the New England regions, empties into the Atlantic Ocean. It has long been considered to be the maritime &quot;gateway&quot; to New York City and the Northeastern United States on the East Coast of North America, and historically has been one of the most important entrances into the seaport harbors of the Port of New York and New Jersey.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The Narrows was most likely formed after deposition of the Harbor Hill Moraine about 18,000 years prior to the end of the last prehistoric ice age. Previously, Staten Island and Long Island / (Brooklyn) were connected and the Hudson River emptied into the Atlantic Ocean through the Raritan River, taking then a more westerly course through parts of present-day northern New Jersey, along the eastern side of the Watchung Mountains ridge to the area around Bound Brook, New Jersey, and then on into the Atlantic via the Raritan Bay. A build-up of water in the Upper New York Bay allowed the river to eventually break through to form current The Narrows less than 12,000 to 13,000 years ago as it exists today.

===Post-European contact===
The first recorded European entrance into The Narrows off the East Coast of North America, was in 1524 by the Italian Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano (1485–1528), who was in the employ of and sailing for the Kingdom of France and its monarch, King Francis I, who set anchor off-shore in the strait and was greeted by a group of Lenape natives, who paddled out to meet him onboard his new strange huge sailing vessel in the strait.

Two and a half centuries later, in July and August 1776, the British naval and land forces under commanding General William Howe (1729–1814), in their campaign to take New York City and destroy the colonial American patriots&#x27; year-old rebellion, had already landed on nearby undefended Staten Island the previous month of early July 1776, undertook an amphibious operation moving northeast across The Narrows and New York Bay and landed south of and near the village of Brooklyn on the South Shore at the western end of Long Island. There they soon routed General George Washington&#x27;s dug-in defending Continental Army by a long sweeping end-run flank attack at the famous Battle of Long Island (a.k.a. the Battle of Brooklyn) of August 27, 1776, before they made their escape, evacuating at night by barge / rowboats across the East River back to Manhattan, during the decisive New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).

The Staten Island Tunnel, carrying the New York City Subway system line under and across The Narrows, was partially built during the 1920s but was never completed. The subsequent prominent landmark of a suspension-style span Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was completed across The Narrows four decades later in November 1964. Designated then as the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, it is still the longest suspension bridge existing in the United States (by length of the main span).
