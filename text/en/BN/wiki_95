<text>James Hamilton Peabody (August 21, 1852 – November 23, 1917) was the 13th and 15th Governor of Colorado, and is noted by some for his public service in Cañon City and by others for his brutality in crushing the miners&#x27; strike in Cripple Creek in 1903–04.

==Family background==
James was the youngest of 17 children. He was born in Topsham, Vermont, where his family raised crops and children. He attended school in Vermont, and later furthered his education there at the Bryant Commercial College at Barre, and Stratton Commercial College at Burlington, Vermont. Three of his brothers fought for the Union in the American Civil War. In 1871, while James was still in business college there, his family moved to Pueblo, Colorado; after completing his degree the following year, Peabody followed his family and kept the books for the family dry goods store for three years (1872 to 1875).

==Early employment==
In early 1875, he moved to Cañon City, Colorado, and worked for James Clelland in his &quot;general mercantile&quot; store. On March 19, 1878, he married his employer&#x27;s daughter, Frances Lillian Clelland, and the couple eventually had four children together (James, Clellan, Cora May, and Jessie Anne). Peabody quickly climbed the ladder at Clelland&#x27;s store, becoming a manager, then a full partner, and then purchasing the store outright in 1882. In 1885, he was elected county clerk for Fremont County, Colorado, unseating the incumbent, who had held the post for 18 years.

==Public service==
In 1889, while still serving in the position of county clerk, Peabody helped to organize the First National Bank of Cañon City, and was elected President of the Bank in 1891. He also served Cañon City as city treasurer for two years and as alderman for two years. He helped organize the Cañon City Water Works Company and served as its secretary and treasurer for many years. He was instrumental in forming the Electric Light Company of Cañon City and served as that organization&#x27;s first president. In addition, he was a member of the Masonic fraternity, and, in 1885, at the age of 32, he was elected Grand Master (Masonic) of the Colorado Masons; at that time, he was the youngest Grand Master Mason in America.

==Administration as governor==

===Election===
Because of his contributions to Cañon City, Fremont County, and the State of Colorado at large, he became widely known in state politics and was an active member of the Colorado Republican Party; in 1902, he was the Republican candidate for Governor of Colorado. He ran on a &quot;law and order&quot; platform and was elected, but his administration met with numerous difficulties, especially labor issues in Colorado&#x27;s many mines.

===Problems===
During Peabody&#x27;s administration, miners&#x27; unions acted on a variety of issues, including wages, hours, and working conditions. One particular issue of consequence was the eight-hour day, and miners conducted strikes in the gold and silver mines at Clear Creek, Cripple Creek, and Telluride, and in the coal mines of Las Animas County. Peabody&#x27;s tactic in dealing with these strikes was to call out the Colorado National Guard whenever he felt it necessary, a strategy many felt was heavy-handed.

The union representing hard rock miners was the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). The coal miners&#x27; union was the United Mine Workers (UMW). Some of the officials in Teller County, and particularly in the Cripple Creek District, were considered sympathetic to the union. In 1903 the WFM called a strike in support of mill workers.

====Strike====
While the Federation worked to expel all non-union miners from the county, mine owners refused to negotiate over the Federation&#x27;s complaints, and the struggle degenerated into violence by both parties; while the mine owners tried desperately to import non-union miners from elsewhere in the state, the union used its clout to barricade roads and rail lines into Cripple Creek. The owners appealed to Peabody, who dispatched an investigatory committee from Denver to look into the situation; on the committee&#x27;s recommendation, Peabody ordered the state militia to &quot;defuse&quot; the situation. On September 4, 1903, almost 1,000 militiamen entered Teller County and essentially established martial law.

On June 6, 1904, after nine months of the strike, someone destroyed the Independence Railway Station near Victor, Colorado, with dynamite, killing 13 non-union miners. County Sheriff Henry Robertson became a target of the Cripple Creek Mine Owners&#x27; Association and their ally, the Citizens&#x27; Alliance, and was forced to resign under threat of hanging. The mine owners used force to take over the press of the &quot;Victor Record&quot;, which had been a largely pro-union periodical, and captured strikers, who were then confined in the infamous &quot;bullpens&quot; or taken under guard to the Kansas border and abandoned.

The Colorado National Guard made several dozen unwarranted arrests of miners and their supporters and held many people without formal charges, some for several days. Colorado National Guard Adjutant General Sherman Bell said of the miners, &quot;Habeas corpus, hell! We&#x27;ll give &#x27;em post mortems.&quot; With the support of the state militia, the owners regained control of the mines, and by midsummer the strike was broken (although it was never officially terminated by the Federation). The mines reopened with non-union labor, and the labor unions lost significant power in Cripple Creek, and in the state.

A union member named Harry Orchard later wrote in a confession to Pinkerton agent James McParland that he had committed the attack at the Independence Station. He also admitted to serving as a paid informant for the Mine Owners Association, and to committing numerous other crimes.

Peabody&#x27;s role in helping mine owners crush the strike at Cripple Creek and, ultimately, the union itself, is particularly ugly. The miners had conducted a nonviolent strike nine years earlier and their policy was one of nonviolence. But when Peabody, a banker, was elected governor of Colorado, Cripple Creek mine owners felt they had an ally and they could provoke the miners with impunity. The mine owners cut back hard-earned benefits and it was those cutbacks that caused the strike of 1903–04. In response to the strike, Peabody sent in The Colorado National Guard which broke into miner&#x27;s homes, harassed their wives and children, and forcefully deported union men out of Cripple Creek. Peabody&#x27;s militia arrested and jailed miners against whom there were no charges, often removing them from their homes. When judicial authorities objected to this illegal treatment Peabody tried to suspend the writ of habeas corpus that was being used to protect illegally-arrested miners. When miners resisted military violence, Peabody responded with martial law. His troops destroyed the offices of the press and assumed military command of Cripple Creek until both the strike and the union had been destroyed.

===Attempt at re-election===

Peabody ran for a second term in 1904, but was vilified by his opponents, who declared &quot;Anybody but Peabody!&quot; and felt that he was in league with the mine owners. Peabody&#x27;s opponent, Democrat Alva Adams, ripped into his handling of the Cripple Creek strike and insisted that he could handle Colorado&#x27;s vicious &quot;industrial warfare.&quot; After the election, it appeared Adams had won, but Republicans, who still controlled the state legislature, insisted that significant fraud and corruption had conspired to steal the election from Peabody (in reality, both sides had committed major violations of election law). On the day that Adams took office (March 17, 1905), the Republican-controlled legislature voted to remove him from office and reinstall Peabody, on the condition that Peabody immediately resign. He did so, and at day&#x27;s end it was Peabody&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Jesse McDonald, who occupied the governor&#x27;s mansion in Denver – thus making Colorado the only state to have three different governors (Adams, Peabody, McDonald) on the same day.

==Death==
After his &quot;victory&quot; and resignation, Peabody returned to Cañon City and retired to private life at the Peabody Mansion built by his father-in-law and employer, James Clelland. There he devoted his time to caring for his various financial interests. He largely faded from the public eye, and died November 23, 1917. He is buried in Cañon City.

<doc id="445075" wikidata="Q2467423" url="?curid=445075" title="Street Fighter III">
<text>is a 1997 fighting game in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, originally released as a coin-operated arcade game. The game, which was designed as a direct sequel to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991), initially discarded every previous character except for Ryu and Ken (hence the &quot;New Generation&quot; subtitle), introducing an all-new roster led by Alex. Likewise, a new antagonist named Gill took over M. Bison″s role from the previous games as the new boss character.

&quot;Street Fighter III&quot; was produced for the CD-ROM-based CP System III hardware, which allowed for more elaborate 2D graphics than the CPS II-based &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; games (the previous incarnation of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series), while revamping many of the play mechanics. Despite the popularity of 3D polygonal fighting games at the time, Capcom decided to keep this game in 2D; 3D graphics were instead implemented in the spin-off game, &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;.

&quot;Street Fighter III&quot; was followed by two updates: &quot;Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; in 1999. A single home version of the game was released for the Dreamcast in 1999 and 2000, in a two-in-one compilation titled &quot;Street Fighter III: Double Impact&quot;, which also includes &quot;2nd Impact&quot;. &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; received a mainly positive reception, although did not manage to be a hit like its predecessor; it was followed up by &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; (2008)&quot;.&quot;

==Gameplay==

Like its predecessors, &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; is a one-on-one fighting game, in which two fighters use a variety of attacks and special moves to knock out their opponent. The gameplay of the original &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; has several new abilities and features introduced. Some abilities are also taken from other Capcom fighting games, such as players being able to dash or retreat like in the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; series, as well as performing super jumps and quick stands after falling from an attack like in &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;. The game also introduced leap attacks, which are small jumping attacks used against crouching opponents. As well, the player cannot perform aerial guards like in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, which are replaced by parrying (&quot;blocking&quot; in the Japanese version).

The 1994 fighting game &quot;Samurai Shodown II&quot; is often credited with the first parry system. The main new feature is the ability to parry an opponent&#x27;s attack, by deflecting any incoming attack without receiving damage. At the exact moment an opponent&#x27;s attack is about to hit his or her character, the player can move the controller toward or down to parry the attack without receiving damage, leaving the opponent vulnerable for a counterattack. Additionally, this allows the player to defend against Special Moves and even Super Arts without sustaining the normal minor damage that blocking normally would incur. However, parrying requires precise timing.

The other new feature introduced in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; is Super Arts. This is a powerful special move similar to a Super Combo in &quot;Super Turbo&quot; and the &quot;Alpha&quot; games. After selecting a character, the player will be prompted to select from one of three character-specific Super Arts to use in battle. Like the Super Combo gauge in previous games, the player has a Super Art gauge which will fill up as the player performs regular and special moves against an opponent. The player can only perform a Super Art once the gauge is filled. Depending on the Super Art chosen by the player, the length of the Super Art gauge will vary, as well as the amount of filled Super Art gauges the player can stock up. The players can now cancel a special move into a Super Art, a technique borrowed from &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;.

Among the elaborated sprites include multiple hit stun sprites, including a new &quot;turned-around state,&quot; in which a character is turned around (his or her back faces the opponent) after being hit. Only certain attacks can put characters in a turned-around state, and grabs and throws can now be comboed, as it typically takes longer for an attacked character to recover from this new type of hit stun.

==Characters==
* Ryu - As usual, Ryu seeks to better his skills and find worthy opponents. Voiced by Wataru Takagi in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Toru Okawa in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Ken - As the current U.S. martial arts champion, Ken seeks to test his strength against his old friend and rival Ryu, once again. Voiced by Koji Tobe in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Yuji Kishi in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Alex - The lead character of the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; series. He fights with close-range grappling techniques and powerful punches. His initial goal is to avenge the defeat of his friend Tom at the hands of Gill. He later gets defeated by Ryu in Third Strike. Voiced by Michael Sommers in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Patrick Gallagan in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Dudley - A gentleman British boxer who seeks to recover his late father&#x27;s antique Jaguar convertible from Gill. Voiced by Bruce Robertson in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Francis Diakowsky in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Elena - An African princess from Kenya who uses the fighting style of capoeira. She seeks to make new friends. All of her attacks use her legs or feet, even the punch button attacks and throws. Voiced by Kaoru Fujino in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Mie Midori in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Ibuki - An aspiring female ninja who is sent to retrieve the G File from Gill&#x27;s organization. Voiced by Yuri Amano in all three games in the series.
* Necro - A Russian man who was kidnapped and experimented on by Gill&#x27;s organization. He seeks revenge only to get trapped and barely escape later on. Voiced by Michael X. Sommers in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Lawrence Bayne in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Oro - A seclusive hermit who seeks a fighter worthy to inherit his fighting style. He binds one arm while fighting, to keep from accidentally killing his opponent (except when performing specific special techniques). Voiced by Kan Tokumaru in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Takashi Matsuyama in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Sean - A young Japanese-Brazilian fighter who becomes Ken&#x27;s self-appointed apprentice. Voice by Isshin Chiba in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Mitsuo Iwata in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Yun and Yang - Twin kung fu experts from Hong Kong who are guardians of their hometown. While the two brothers are head-swaps, their move sets are identical and they share the same slot in the player select screen, but Yang was given a separate moveset and slot in &quot;2nd Impact&quot;. Yun was voiced by Koji Tobe in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Kentaro Ito in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;. Yang was voiced by Wataru Takagi in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and by Masakazu Suzuki in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.
* Gill - The leader of a secret organization which seeks to turn the Earth into a utopia. He can manipulate fire and ice. He is the final opponent for all the characters in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;3rd Strike&quot;, and for most of the characters in &quot;2nd Impact&quot;. Gill is only playable in the console versions of the series. Voiced by Bruce Robertson in &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Lawrence Bayne in &quot;3rd Strike&quot;.

==Development==
Capcom announced that &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; was in development during a March 27, 1996 meeting in Tokyo. They later stated that development took more than two years.

The game was first unveiled at the September 1996 Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association show, in the form of a few minutes of footage incorporated into Capcom&#x27;s PR demo tape. In an interview shortly before this show, Capcom senior planner Shinji Mikami stated that it would be impossible to convert &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; to any of the home consoles then on the market. This prompted rumors that it would be ported to the then-upcoming Panasonic M2. In January 1997, IGN witnessed a demonstration of the game in development on Nintendo 64 and 64DD, so IGN and its anonymous insider speculated that the game might join the launch of the upcoming 64DD peripheral in Japan, which was scheduled for late 1997. Capcom referred to the Nintendo 64 release as &quot;just a rumor&quot;, and Nintendo would coincidentally delay the launch of the 64DD peripheral until December 1999 anyway. Amending Mikami&#x27;s earlier statement, in late 1997 Capcom said it might be possible to port &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; to the Sega Saturn if one of the console&#x27;s RAM expansion cartridges were used.

Because this and the next two &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; games run on the CPS III engine, more elaborate 2D sprites were created. Each character is made up from approximately 700–1200 individually drawn frames of animation, with the game running at 60 frames per second.

General producer Noritaka Funamizu explained the controversial decision to keep the series in 2D: &quot;We feel that 3D is not really suitable for the head-to-head fighting ... and, to be frank, Capcom doesn&#x27;t really have the techniques to display high quality graphics in 3D.&quot;

=== Release ===
The game&#x27;s name as it appears on the arcade cabinet is &quot;Three: A New Generation of Street Fighters&quot;. 

In 1999, Capcom released &quot;Street Fighter III: Double Impact&quot; (&quot;Street Fighter III: W Impact&quot; in Japan) for the Dreamcast, a compilation containing the original game and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;. The compilation features an Arcade, Versus, Training, and Option Mode for both games, as well as a &quot;Parry Attack Mode&quot; in &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, where the player can test parrying skills in the game&#x27;s bonus round. This compilation also allows players to use Gill (in both games) and Shin Akuma (in &quot;2nd Impact&quot; only), who are exclusively computer-controlled characters in the arcade version.

&quot;New Generation&quot; was re-released in 2018 as part of the &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack to the first game in the series was released on CD by First Smile Entertainment in 1997, and the &quot;3rd Strike&quot; original soundtrack was released by Mars Colony Music in 2000 with an arranged version afterward. The soundtrack to &quot;3rd Strike&quot; features three songs and announcer tracks by Canadian rapper Infinite. The themes for the games are predominantly drum and bass, with some jazz, hip-hop, house and techno elements. Yuki Iwai worked on the soundtracks for &quot;New Generation&quot; and &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, and Hideki Okugawa worked on all three games.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; on their April 1, 1997 issue as being the most successful arcade game of the month. However, the game struggled to break even in Japan, with a high budget of 1 billion yen ($8 million), while only selling 1,000 cabinets. Worldwide arcade sales estimates range from between 1,000 and 10,000 units sold.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;The great mystery is why Capcom called this &quot;SFIII&quot; instead of leaving that honor for a more powerful and revolutionary 3D title. Gameplay in the &quot;SF&quot; series reached the ceiling of 2D possibilities a while ago, and as good as this game admittedly is, besides the stunning graphics there&#x27;s little to distinguish it from the 11 games before.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly remarked that while the graphics are outstanding and the controls are flawless, the game lacks the innovation and series evolution that players expected it to deliver. They also said the new characters are a mix, with some of them seeming like they would be more appropriate for the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; series, and concluded that the game &quot;makes you look forward to the next &quot;SF&quot; installment rather than getting you excited about playing this one repeatedly&quot;.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored &quot;Street Fighter III: Double Impact&quot;, the Dreamcast version of the game, 31 out of 40.

Jim Preston reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a no-frills port of the arcade game that is great at a party but pointless for single players.&quot;

<doc id="445086" wikidata="Q6619371" url="?curid=445086" title="List of federal political scandals in the United States">
<text>This article provides a list of political scandals that involve officials from the government of the United States, sorted from oldest to most recent.

==Scope and organization of political scandals==
This article is organized by presidential terms in order, older to recent, and then divided into scandals of the federal Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place, even though they may not be connected with the presiding president.

In this article, the term &quot;politician&quot; (a person who is professionally involved in politics) includes not only those elected, but also party officials, candidates for office, their staffs and appointees. Please note that every president directly selects, appoints or hires several thousand people. Each of them selects thousands more. Private citizens should only be mentioned when they are closely linked to the scandal or politician, such as Jack Abramoff. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician&#x27;s tenure (such as before or after their term in office) unless they specifically stem from acts made while in office and discovered later.

Scandal is defined as &quot;loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety&quot;. Scandals are separate from &#x27;controversies&#x27;, (which implies two differing points of view) and &#x27;unpopularity&#x27;. Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular, that alone does not make them scandals. Breaking the law is a scandal. The finding of a court is the sole method used to determine a violation of law, but it is not the sole method of determining a scandal. Also included as scandals are politicians who resign, quit, run, or commit suicide while being investigated or threatened with investigation.

Notoriety is a major determinant of a scandal, that is, the amount of press dedicated to it. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accused, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. Drunk driving may be a conviction, but is usually too minor and too common to mention unless there are multiple convictions and/or jail time.

Given the political nature of Congress in which the leading party has determining power, politicians who are rebuked, denounced, censured, admonished, condemned, suspended, reprimanded, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, or used poor judgement are &quot;not&quot; included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion or conviction.

<text>Stębark is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Grunwald, within Ostróda County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. The village is chiefly known for two historic battles which took place there or nearby: the 1410 Battle of Grunwald and the (Second) Battle of Tannenberg in World War I.

==Geography==
It is situated on the western edge of the historic Masuria region, southeast of the Dylewska Góra range. It lies approximately south-east of Ostróda and south-west of the regional capital Olsztyn.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Tannenberge&quot; about 1335, when the area was part of the State of the Teutonic Order. The Old Polish name &quot;Sztambark&quot; was already documented in 1426.

On 15 July 1410 a united army of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania led by King Władysław II Jagiełło and Grand Duke Vytautas, with additional mercenary troops from Bohemia, defeated the Teutonic Knights under Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen in the Battle of Grunwald. The site of the cavalry battle, one of the largest in the whole Middle Ages, was actually the heath between the villages of Tannenberg and neighboring Grünfelde (now, Grunwald), mentioned by King Władysław as &quot;loco conflictus nostri ... dicto Grunenvelt&quot;. Adopted as &quot;Grunwald&quot; by the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz (1415–1480), the battle was called &quot;Bitwa pod Grunwaldem&quot; in Polish, while German historiography named it &quot;Schlacht bei Tannenberg&quot;, after the deployment area of the Teutonic troops.

Upon the 1411 Peace of Thorn, the Teutonic Knights had a lady chapel erected at the site, where Ulrich von Jungingen was killed in the battle. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. After the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), it became a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights until 1525, and by secular Ducal Prussia afterwards, following the Prussian Homage. As of 1599, the population was almost entirely Polish. Ravaged by Lipka and Crimean Tatar forces during the Deluge of the Second Northern War in 1656, Stębark, along with Masuria, was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1772 First Partition of Poland and incorporated into the Province of East Prussia.

In 1914 during World War I the German Army under the command of General Paul von Hindenburg won an important victory over the Russian Imperial forces invading East Prussia in the Battle of Tannenberg. The combat lasted from 26 to 30 August and actually included a wide range of battlegrounds centered on Olsztynek, then known as &quot;Hohenstein&quot;. It was, however, named after nearby &quot;Tannenberg&quot; by the victorious Germans at Hindenburg&#x27;s request, for propaganda purposes and to cast it as a kind of revenge for the medieval defeat. In 1934 von Hindenburg&#x27;s funeral occurred there. In World War II, the Tannenberg myth lent the name to the German &quot;Operation Tannenberg&quot; extermination actions directed at the Polish people, while the Battle of Tannenberg Line refers to an Eastern Front campaign which took place in Estonia.

After the German defeat in 1945, Stębark with Masuria became again part of Poland according to the Potsdam Agreement, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s. The remaining German population was expelled, also in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

From 1975 to 1998 the village belonged to Olsztyn Voivodeship.
==Sights==
The main sights of Stębark are the and the historic Holy Trinity church. The Grunwald Battlefield is located nearby.

The game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the Nintendo 64 title &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; is difficult to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, who lives in a house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the Pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place over a few days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.

While several channels are available, only a few are essential to the completion of the game. The player saves the game by reporting on recent accomplishments to Oak at &quot;Prof. Oak Report&quot;, watches episodes of an anime series at &quot;Pichu Bros.&quot;, and listens to plot-advancing news coverage from Psyduck at &quot;Pokémon News Flash&quot; (PNF). On a channel called &quot;Shop &#x27;n Squirtle&quot;, the player uses the game&#x27;s currency, &quot;Poké&quot;, to purchase bus passes to travel among the game&#x27;s locations, as well as non-essential items like Pokémon dolls, new television sets in various styles, and other decorations, all delivered by Delibird (a bird-like Pokémon that carries various items in its satchel). Extraneous channels include the trivia-based game show &quot;Quiz Wobbuffet&quot;, where the player earns Poké, the art exhibition program &quot;Smeargle&#x27;s Art Study&quot;, where Smeargle gives opinions on art that can be created in a paint-by-numbers style in the player&#x27;s house, and the exercise program &quot;Smoochum Shape-Up&quot;.

The main collectibles available in &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; are trading cards that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic and play the respective Pokémon&#x27;s cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from &quot;Shop &#x27;n Squirtle&quot;. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player&#x27;s bed that plays 10 games in the Japanese release and six games internationally. These games are all excerpts from games released for the real-life Pokémon Mini, with the exception of &quot;Snorlax&#x27;s Lunch Time&quot;, which is exclusive to &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;. The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm.

==Plot==

A group of Magnemite delivers a television to the player&#x27;s house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player&#x27;s help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a beta tester. He has them watch an episode of an anime called &quot;Pichu Brothers in Party Panic!&quot; and then introduces the game&#x27;s basic features before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turns out to belong to the mouse-like Pikachu, the reptilian Treecko and the avian Torchic. While the others run off, Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak allows Pikachu to be a second beta tester.

After the player completing a few tasks, Oak remarks that Pikachu has behaved remarkably well. Overexcited, Pikachu inadvertently uses its Thunderbolt attack on the television. Undaunted, Oak gives the player a replacement television the next morning while remarking their viewership has brought life to the network and helped spawn new shows. The player then finds a bus stop and visits Viridian Forest, a location that first appeared in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Over the next two days, Pikachu invites its friends back to the player&#x27;s house, and later visits the snowy Mt. Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast with the player.

On the morning of the fifth day, a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Brothers was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite on their way to the show&#x27;s broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player&#x27;s path until the lamp scares it away. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called &quot;Meowth&#x27;s Party&quot;.

Oak informs the player that every program produced for his network has been aired, thanking the player and Pikachu for their time, and announces the impending arrival of a gift for them. The gift, which arrives the following morning, is a &quot;Star Projector&quot;, a device for viewing images flashed across the sky. That night, Professor Oak notices that a Pokémon has arrived at the player&#x27;s house—the rare and legendary Jirachi—which leaves him in shock. The player, Pikachu, and Jirachi then visit Camp Starlight, the locale for which the Projector is intended. Using it, they project the entire series of Pichu Brothers and Meowth&#x27;s Party onto the sky for the universe to see.

==Development and release==

&quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; was developed by Nintendo subsidiary Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It was created both to serve as a spiritual successor to &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot;—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the e-Reader device itself. When scanned, the cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.

The game uses the visual effect of applying pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game&#x27;s pre-recorded shows on the television. &quot;IGN&quot; writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect&#x27;s implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series, the Pokémon&#x27;s voices are borrowed from the anime and sound like their names.

The game was first announced at E3 2003, where &quot;IGN&quot; staff noted that the game&#x27;s demo appeared to be early in development due to its choppy frame rate. &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. The game was showcased on its Japanese release date at the Sapporo, Hokkaido, location of , a series of promotional events that extended across Japan and lasted about a month. Attendees could play the game at GameCube kiosks.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers felt that the game would only suit existing &quot;Pokémon&quot; fans and young children: staff at &quot;1UP.com&quot; summarized that &quot;the various diversions here are cute, slickly produced, and entertaining, assuming you really, really dig Pokémon&quot;, and that even fans would be bored if over the age of five. Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot; claimed that fans would enjoy it but &quot;everyone else will be turned off, pun intended&quot;. Author Tokyo Drifter of &quot;GamePro&quot; guessed that the game had been &quot;tailored for die-hard fans&quot; and would please no one else. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Mary Jane Irwin stated that its intuitive interface, copious instructions, and &quot;mindless entertainment&quot; would keep young players entertained. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s review called the game &quot;hours of fun for &quot;Pokémon&quot; fans.&quot;

Reviewers complained about the game&#x27;s low level of interactivity due to most of the gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu. Summarizing the gameplay in general as &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Ricardo Torres argued that the game&#x27;s promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by &quot;the gimmick of having to &#x27;virtually&#x27; watch television programs&quot; and the long stretches of time this entails. Leeper claimed that Pikachu &quot;will be content much longer than you will&quot; and decried the channels&#x27; non-interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few. Darryl Vassar of &quot;GameSpy&quot; went even further and claimed that there was &quot;no gameplay&quot;. He gave the game only one star out of five as a result, despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices &quot;decent&quot;. Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for &quot;Pokémon&quot; fan enjoyment, and gave the game a 3.0 on a five-point scale. Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall, with the exception of &quot;Pichu Bros&quot;, which she called &quot;the only worthwhile programming&quot;. &quot;GMR&quot; felt the game was &quot;more of a cross between a virtual pet and one of those edutainment titles from Humongous&quot; and criticizing the game&#x27;s bulk on watching television and noting that isn&#x27;t very interactive. They concluded the game review with a score of 6 out of 10.

The game&#x27;s 3D graphics received lukewarm opinions. Torres called them &quot;decent but unspectacular&quot; and &quot;bland&quot;. His praise focused on the animations of the Pokémon with &quot;distinct animations that suit their personalities&quot;, especially that of Pikachu. Irwin echoed these opinions. Vassar stated that the Pokémon animations were better than those in the then-upcoming GameCube title &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; and found the environments passable, if boring and overly limited. Tokyo Drifter found the environments &quot;bright and colorful&quot; while wholeheartedly praising the smooth and &quot;adorable&quot; Pokémon animations.

The sound and music were negatively received. Torres focused on their repetitiveness, stating that some of the music within the programs was catchy but &quot;it starts to grate after some of the mandatory repeated viewings you&#x27;ll have to endure&quot;, and that the paucity of sound effects &quot;puts the weight of the audio burden on the Pokémon voices, which, while accurate, are naturally repetitive&quot;. Irwin and Vassar gave special focus to the repetitiveness of the voices. Tokyo Drifter gave little opinion on the voices but found the lack of voice acting for Oak to be disappointing.

Critics praised the large number of collectible items and Pokémon in the game. Torres noted the game&#x27;s many items to collect and Pokémon for Pikachu to meet, and praised the game&#x27;s increased replay value as a result. Tokyo Drifter thought similarly, calling the collecting aspects &quot;a prominent part of the gaming experience&quot;. Irwin found the collecting aspects a nice way to pass time and called the incorporation of the virtual Pokémon Mini &quot;a nice diversion&quot;.

Within three days of its Japanese release, &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; sold 12,581 copies, making it the thirteenth best-selling game among all platforms during its release week (July 14 to July 20). By August 17, 2003, its Japanese sales totaled 38,617 copies. The title had sold 66,373 copies in Japan by December 28 of the same year.

<doc id="445099" wikidata="Q509086" url="?curid=445099" title="List of Swedish royal consorts">
<text>This is a list of Swedish queens consort and spouses of Swedish monarchs and regents. The list covers a large time span and the role of a consort has changed much over the centuries. The first Swedish consorts are spoken of in legends. Consorts until c. 1000 are often semi-legendary, as are monarchs. 

Due to unions with Denmark and Norway, many of the Swedish consorts were also consorts of monarchs of those countries. Consorts listed during the period of 1380–1520 were in fact also consorts to monarchs of Denmark. The consorts listed during the period of 1814-1905 were also consorts to monarchs of Norway. 

Finland was from the Middle Ages a part of Sweden, and although there was no official title, such as &quot;Queen Consort of Finland&quot;, from the 16th century until the year of 1809; the queen consort of Sweden also held the title &quot;Grand Princess of Finland.&quot;

<text>Gillette Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Foxborough, Massachusetts, United States. The stadium is southwest of downtown Boston, Massachusetts and 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Providence, Rhode Island. It serves as the home stadium and administrative offices for both the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS). It opened in 2002, replacing the adjacent Foxboro Stadium. It also served as the home venue for the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Minutemen football team in 2012 and 2013, while on-campus Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium underwent renovations; it continued to serve as a part-time home venue for higher attendance UMass games through 2018. Gillette Stadium&#x27;s seating capacity is 64,628, including 5,876 club seats and 82 luxury suites.

The town of Foxborough approved plans for the stadium&#x27;s construction on December 6, 1999, and work on the stadium began on March 24, 2000. The first official event at the stadium was an MLS soccer game on May 11, 2002, where the New England Revolution defeated Dallas Burn, 2–0. Jeremiah Freed was the opening band at the WBCN River Rave on June 9, making them the first band to play at the stadium. Grand opening ceremonies were held on September 9, when the Patriots unveiled their Super Bowl XXXVI championship banner before a Monday Night Football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The stadium was originally known as [[ModusLink Global Solutions|CMGI]] Field before the naming rights were bought by Gillette after the &quot;dot-com&quot; bust. Although Gillette was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble in 2005, the stadium retains the Gillette name. In September 2010, Gillette and the Patriots announced that their partnership, which includes naming rights to the stadium, would extend through the 2031 season. Additionally, uBid (a wholly owned subsidiary of CMGI until 2003) continued to sponsor one of the main entrance gates to the stadium.

Gillette Stadium is served by special MBTA Commuter Rail service from Boston and Providence during events, plus regular weekday service via the Franklin/Foxboro Line, at Foxboro station. The Patriots have sold out every home game since moving to the stadium—preseason, regular season, and playoffs. This streak dates back to the 1994 season at Foxboro Stadium; by September 2016, it had reached 231 games. The stadium is owned and operated by Kraft Sports Group, a subsidiary of the Kraft Group, the company through which businessman Robert Kraft owns the Patriots and Revolution.

The stadium is set to host several matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Due to FIFA rules regarding stadium sponsorships, Gillette will be known as Boston Stadium for the tournament, in reference to the Greater Boston area the stadium sits on.

== History ==
=== Foxboro Stadium ===

The Patriots were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots of the American Football League, and joined the NFL when the AFL merged into the NFL in 1970. For their first 11 seasons, the Patriots played at several venues in and around Boston, none of which were large enough or suitable enough for a professional team. Indeed, the lack of a professional-caliber stadium had stymied numerous past attempts at professional football in Boston; the Patriots are the only pro team in the area&#x27;s sporting history to last more than five seasons.

From 1971 to 2001, the Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium. The stadium was privately funded on an extremely small budget and featured few amenities. Its aluminum benches would freeze over during cold-weather games and it had an unorganized dirt parking lot that turned to mud whenever it rained. It did not bring in the profits needed to keep an NFL team in New England; at just over 60,000 seats, it was one of the NFL&#x27;s smallest stadiums.

In 1984, team executive Chuck Sullivan funded the Victory Tour of The Jacksons, in an attempt to earn more profit for the team. Ticket sales failed, however, and the team&#x27;s debt increased even further – to a final total of US$126 million. After two successive owners bought the team and stadium, it was clear that a new stadium had to be built for the team to stay in New England. This is when other cities in the New England area, including Boston (which was previously home to the Patriots), Hartford, and Providence became interested in building new stadiums to lure the Patriots away from Foxborough.

=== Location discussions ===
The first major stadium proposal from another city came in September 1993. Lowell Weicker, the Governor of Connecticut, proposed to the Connecticut General Assembly that a new stadium should be built in Hartford to attract the Patriots to move there, stating that a stadium had &quot;potentially great benefit&quot; if it were built. The bill passed in the State Assembly on September 27, 1993.

Back in Massachusetts, there was a proposal to build a &quot;Megaplex&quot; in Boston, which would be the site of the stadium, as well as a new Fenway Park (the home park of the Boston Red Sox) and a convention center. The proposed sites for this hybrid convention center-stadium were along Summer Street in South Boston or at the so-called Crosstown site along Melnea Cass Boulevard in Roxbury, adjacent to Boston&#x27;s South End. The administration of Massachusetts Governor William Weld pushed for construction of a full &quot;Megaplex&quot; at the crosstown site, with then-new Boston Mayor Thomas Menino favoring construction of a new, stand-alone convention center in South Boston. Ultimately, the residents of neither of these neighborhoods wanted a stadium, and as a result, Menino backed out, fearing that it would affect his chance at re-election. The Fenway Park plan was cancelled after many &quot;Save Fenway Park!&quot; groups popped up to save the historic ballpark.

Kraft then began a plan to build a new stadium in South Boston. In that plan, Kraft was to pay for the stadium himself, hoping to win the support of Weld and Menino. He began to sketch designs, but the project was leaked to the press in December 1996. The residents of South Boston objected to a stadium being built in that location, causing Menino and Weld to become angry at Kraft. Kraft abandoned all plans for a Boston Stadium after the affair. In January 1997, Kraft began talks with Providence mayor Vincent Cianci to relocate the team to Providence and build a new stadium there. The proposed 68,000-seat domed stadium would have cost $250 million, and would have been paid through income taxes, public bonds, surcharges on tickets, and private funds. Residents of the neighborhood of the proposed project were extremely opposed to the project because the surrounding area would have needed massive infrastructure improvements. The proposal fell through after a few weeks.

During a news conference in September 1998, the team revealed plans to build a new stadium in Foxborough, keeping the team in Massachusetts. It was to be funded by the state as well as Kraft himself. This plan brought more competition from Connecticut, as a $1 billion plan to renovate an area of Hartford, including building a stadium. Kraft then signed an agreement to move the team to Hartford on November 18, 1998. The proposed stadium included 68,000 seats, 60 luxury boxes, and had a projected cost of $375 million. As before in Boston and Providence, construction of the stadium was challenged by the residents. Problems with the site were discovered, and an agreement could not be reached regarding the details of the stadium. The entire plan eventually fell through, enraging then Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, who lobbied hard for the stadium and spent weeks deliberating with Robert Kraft. Rowland announced at a press conference that he was officially &quot;a New York Jets fan, now and probably forever&quot;. In 1999, the team officially announced that it would remain in Foxborough, which led to Gillette Stadium&#x27;s construction. After the Hartford proposal fell through, Robert Kraft paid for 100% of the construction costs, a rare instance of an NFL owner privately financing the construction of a stadium.

=== Design ===
On April 18, 2000, the team revealed plans for the new stadium in Foxborough. It was announced as a 68,000-seat stadium at a cost of $325 million, with the entire cost privately funded. Boston is thus the only city in professional sports in which all facilities are privately owned and operated. The Kraft Group (owner of the NFL team the Patriots and the MLS team the Revolution) owns Gillette Stadium, the Red Sox own Fenway Park, and TD Garden is owned by Delaware North (the owner of the Bruins) (the Celtics rent the TD Garden from Delaware North).

Concurrently announced was a new road to access the stadium from U.S. Route 1, and an additional 3,000 parking spaces to accommodate the increased number of fans.

The stadium was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous). Kraft wanted it modeled on M&amp;T Bank Stadium which had opened in Baltimore in 1998. Kraft insisted on it having a &quot;front door&quot; with a Disneyland-like entrance. Populous went through 200 designs before coming up with one that Kraft liked. The entrance includes a lighthouse (which was originally designed to shoot a light high) and a bridge modeled on Boston&#x27;s Longfellow Bridge. The lighthouse and bridge are now featured on the stadium&#x27;s logo.

For the first eight years of its existence, the stadium used a video display, with a smaller LED scoreboard just beneath it, at each end of the field. The south side also had a large LED scoreboard in addition to the smaller one. In 2010, the stadium installed two new HD Daktronics video displays to replace the entire previous setup at both ends. At the time of their construction, the larger screen, at 41.5 feet tall and 164 feet wide (12.6 m x 50.0 m), was the second-largest video monitor in any NFL stadium; only AT&amp;T Stadium had a larger one.

Gillette Stadium ranks first among all NFL venues in stadium food safety with 0% critical violations. The Gillette Stadium food service, instead of being outsourced like most NFL teams, is run in-house and is led by the Patriots executive director of foods and beverage David Wheeler.

From January 18, 2021, to June 14, 2021, Gillette Stadium was used as a mass distribution site for the COVID-19 vaccine, with a total of 610,283 shots being administered.

Marking the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, a memorial garden was installed outside Gillette Stadium. It has a semicircle of six flowering trees, a commemorative plaque, a mural, and tribute stones with the names of the victims.

==== 2023 renovation project====

On December 10, 2021, a $225 million renovation project was announced. Construction began in January 2022 and was completed in September 2023. The renovations included a new 22,000-square-foot outdoor video board installed at the north end, the largest video board of its kind in the United States. A new lighthouse, which reaches 218 feet at the top, provides 360-degree views of the stadium, Patriot Place, Foxborough, and beyond. 75,000 square feet of hospitality and function spaces were constructed to connect the East and West Putnam Clubs, the Dell Technology Suite Levels, and the upper concourse. The construction of these new spaces connected all levels 360 degrees. A new plaza and fan entrance were also built on the stadium&#x27;s north end.

== Events ==

=== NFL ===

The venue has hosted the NFL&#x27;s nationally–televised primetime season-opening games in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019 (when the Patriots unveiled their championship banners from Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, and LIII.) The first ever NFL game at the stadium was held on September 9, 2002, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a 30–14 Patriots victory. The stadium&#x27;s first playoff game was held the next year following the 2003 regular season. Playing in the Divisional Round against the Tennessee Titans, the Patriots hosted the coldest game (, wind chill) in New England Patriots history. The Patriots won 17–14. The stadium also played host to the 2003 AFC Championship Game, in which the Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24–14.
The Patriots won the first seven playoff games held at the stadium between the 2003 and 2007 seasons, including the 2007 AFC Championship Game, where they beat the San Diego Chargers to improve to 18–0 and advance to Super Bowl XLII. On January 10, 2010, the Baltimore Ravens beat the Patriots 33–14, giving the Patriots their first home loss in the playoffs in Gillette Stadium. The Patriots suffered their second consecutive home playoff loss on January 16, 2011, in a 28–21 New York Jets victory. During the 2011–12 NFL playoffs, the Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos, 45–10, and the stadium hosted its third AFC Championship, where they won against the Baltimore Ravens, 23–20. However, the New York Giants ruined the Patriots&#x27; season by beating them in the Super Bowl for the second time. The following year, they again hosted the AFC Championship game, where they lost 28–13 to the Baltimore Ravens in the final game for long-term Patriots radio announcer Gil Santos. During the Divisional Round of the 2014–15 NFL playoffs, the Patriots avenged their 2012 defeat by the Baltimore Ravens by beating them 35–31. The following week, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45–7 in the 2014 AFC Championship. The stadium hosted its sixth AFC Championship game during the 2016 playoffs, as the Patriots defeated 
the Pittsburgh Steelers 36–17. The seventh AFC Championship hosted at Gillette Stadium came the next year, when the Patriots knocked off the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 24–20. In the 2018 season, Gillette Stadium hosted a Divisional Round game, as the Patriots knocked off the Los Angeles Chargers by a score of 41–28 on the way to winning Super Bowl LIII. In Tom Brady&#x27;s final game as a Patriot, they were upset by the Tennessee Titans in the First Round of the 2019 playoffs with a loss of 20–13. Entering the 2023 season, the Patriots had an all-time playoff record of 19–4 at the stadium.

=== College football ===
As part of the UMass football program&#x27;s move to Division I FBS, the Minutemen played all of their home games at Gillette Stadium for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. The stadium is 95 miles away from the UMass campus in Amherst—the longest trip of any FBS member. The Minutemen&#x27;s on-campus stadium, Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium, was not suitable for FBS football in its previous configuration. Its small size (17,000 seats) would have made it prohibitively difficult to meet FBS average attendance requirements, and its press box and replay facilities were well below Mid-American Conference standards. Additionally, several nonconference teams would not even consider playing games in Amherst. McGuirk Stadium was renovated to FBS standards for the 2014 season, but the Minutemen&#x27;s current deal with the Kraft Group calls for the Minutemen to play four of their home games in Foxborough from 2014 to 2016 in exchange for keeping part of the revenue from ticket sales. Moving forward, Gillette continued to host UMass football for games of anticipated larger attendance.

In 2023, Gillette Stadium was used as a neutral site for the Army–Navy Game. Navy will also play their rivalry game with Notre Dame in Foxborough in 2026.

===Ice hockey===
Gillette Stadium also hosted the eighth edition of the NHL Winter Classic, between the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens, on January 1, 2016.

=== Notable soccer games ===
Memorable Major League Soccer playoff victories include wins over the Chicago Fire in the 2005 and 2007 Eastern Conference Final, sending the Revs to the MLS Cup. Additionally, the venue hosted MLS Cup 2002, four games of the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and some Copa America Centenario matches in 2016.

The crowd of 61,316 drawn to the 2002 MLS Cup Final was the largest stand-alone MLS post-season crowd on record until the 2018 MLS Cup in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The stadium&#x27;s soccer attendance record would once again be broken on April 27, 2024, during a regular season match between the Revolution and Inter Miami CF, who had signed Lionel Messi the year prior; 65,612 would watch the Revolution fall 1–4.

====MLS Cup====
====International soccer matches====
===2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===
===2026 FIFA World Cup===
Gillette Stadium will host seven matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup: five group stage, one Round of 32, and one quarterfinal. It is one of eleven US venues selected to host matches during the tournament. During the event, the stadium will be temporarily renamed to &quot;Boston Stadium&quot; in accordance with FIFA&#x27;s policy on corporate sponsored names.

===Lacrosse===
Gillette Stadium hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships in 2008, 2009, 2012, 2017, and 2018 and was the home of the Boston Cannons for the 2015 season.

====Premier Lacrosse League====
On February 15, 2019, the Premier Lacrosse League announced that Boston would be the first city on the schedule for the 2019 season. It was also announced that Gillette Stadium would be the venue to host the league on June 1 and 2. The PLL was planning on returning to Gillette for the 2020 season, but the COVID-19 pandemic put the season on pause and the league scrapped their 2020 schedule.
====Women&#x27;s Professional Lacrosse League====
On June 2, 2019, Gillette will host a handful of games for the Women&#x27;s Professional Lacrosse League to start their 2019 season.

===Concerts===
=== Other events ===
The AMA Supercross Championship has been racing at Gillette Stadium since 2016.

Monster Jam has been coming to the stadium since 2014.

A Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony for former quarterback Tom Brady was hosted at Gillette Stadium on June 12, 2024.

== Playing surface ==
On November 14, 2006, two days after a rainstorm contributed to the deterioration of the grass surface in a Patriots game against the Jets, team management decided to replace the natural grass surface with a synthetic surface, FieldTurf. Normally, NFL rules insist that such work could only be done during the off-season; however, the grass field was in such poor condition, the league agreed to waive the rule. The entire job was done during a two-week road trip, with three shifts working around the clock. The Patriots&#x27; first game on the surface was a victory over the previously 9–1 Chicago Bears on November 26. Brady and his teammates commended the much-improved surface. At the conclusion of the 2007 season, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had a career record of 31–3 on artificial turf. The team lost a preseason matchup in August 2007 to the Tennessee Titans on the new FieldTurf but otherwise won its first eleven regular-season and playoff games on the surface covering the period of November 2006 until September 2008, when the Patriots lost to the Miami Dolphins.

In February 2010, the surface was pulled and upgraded to FieldTurf &quot;Duraspine Pro&quot;, which was expected to meet FIFA standards that the previous turf did not, preventing the team from having to place sod on top of their turf to host international soccer matches.

The surface was upgraded again in April 2014 to FieldTurf &quot;Revolution&quot; with &quot;VersaTile&quot; drainage system. The FieldTurf Revolution product is currently used at many venues across North America, including Lumen Field (home to the NFL&#x27;s Seattle Seahawks and MLS&#x27;s Seattle Sounders) and Providence Park, home of the MLS&#x27;s Portland Timbers, where its installation was recently completed.

=== Field logo ===
When the field is configured for American football, the Patriots have their &quot;Flying Elvis&quot; logo (or &quot;Pat Patriot&quot; if they are wearing throwback uniforms) painted on the field at dead center of the 50-yard line. Prior to the 2022 season, the Gillette Stadium logo was painted on the field. This is a gray-and-blue stylized representation of the bridge and tower at the north entrance of the stadium. This logo was redone in time for the 2023 renovation project, but is no longer present on the field.

== Patriot Place ==
In 2006, the Patriots and Kraft announced plans to build a &quot;super regional lifestyle and entertainment center&quot; in the area around Gillette Stadium named Patriot Place. The cost of the project was $350 million, more than the cost to build Gillette Stadium itself; Kraft had purchased much of the surrounding land, about , when he bought Foxboro Stadium in the late 1980s.

The first phase of the project opened in fall of 2007, and featured the first Bass Pro Shops in New England, as well as Circuit City (now closed), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Five Guys Burgers, Christmas Tree Shops, and Staples. In December 2007, the Patriots and CBS announced plans to build a themed restaurant and nightclub, named &quot;CBS Scene&quot;, at the site, which would also include studios for CBS-owned WBZ-TV. The restaurant was part of the second phase of the project, which included an open mall, a health center, a Cinema de Lux movie theater, a four-star Renaissance hotel, and &quot;The Hall at Patriot Place&quot;. Attached to Gillette Stadium, the Hall includes a two-level interactive museum honoring the Patriots accomplishments and Super Bowl championships, plus the Patriots Pro Shop. The first restaurants and stores in phase two began opening in July 2008, and were followed by the openings of the Hall at Patriot Place and the CBS Scene in time for the beginning of the 2008 New England Patriots season. More locations, including the health center and hotel, opened in 2009, along with additional sites in phase one.

<text>The Baptist Churches of the Central African Republic () is a Baptist Christian denomination in the Central African Republic.

==History==
Baptist Mid-Missions sent six missionaries to French Equatorial Africa in the fall of 1921. Rev. Haas, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Rosenau, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Young, and Mrs. Rowena Becker reached Africa in January 1921 and journeyed inland to French Equatorial Africa. The first stations were established at Sibut, Crampel, and Bangassou, in what is now the &quot;Central African Republic&quot;. Although Hass died in 1924, the mission continued to expand and by the 1960s had grown to over 100 churches. The Scriptures were translated into the native Sango language, and a hospital, six dispensaries, two Bible schools, and a seminary were established by 1961. In 1960, both Chad and the Republic of Central Africa became independent states. Baptist Mid-Missions separated the two fields of labor, and the current association of Baptist churches was formed in 1963 with 191 churches.

Internal problems caused the dissolution of the association for a period of time in the 1970s. The Eglises Baptistes de la RCA has also suffered two schisms, resulting in the Fraternal Union of Baptist Churches (or &quot;Union Fraternelle des Églises Baptistes&quot;, org. 1977) and the Association of Central African Baptist Churches (or &quot;Association des Églises Baptistes Centrafricaines&quot;). Another Baptist group, the Association of Evangelical Baptist Churches of the Central African Republic, began from mission work of the Swedish Örebro Society in 1923. 

In 1995 the &quot;Eglises Baptistes de la RCA&quot; had 375 churches with about 6,000 members.

<doc id="445107" wikidata="Q5326307" url="?curid=445107" title="Earl of Kintore">
<text>Earl of Kintore is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1677 for Sir John Keith, third son of William Keith, 6th Hereditary Earl Marischal of Scotland (see Earl Marischal for earlier history of the family) and Chief of Clan Keith. He was made Lord Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. At the death of William, the 4th Earl, in 1761, the Earldom and Lordship became dormant, as no-one could prove a claim to them. In 1778, it was decided that the Earldom, Lordship and Chieftaincy of Clan should pass to Anthony Adrian Falconer, Lord Falconer of Halkerton, who changed his surname to Keith-Falconer. The Lordship Falconer of Halkerton and the Earldom of Kintore and Lordship Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall remained united until 1966, when, at the death of the 10th Earl, the Lordship Falconer of Halkerton became dormant.

The 11th holder of the titles, Ethel Sydney Keith-Falconer, married John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven. At the death of Lord Stonehaven, the titles Viscount Stonehaven (created 1938), and Baron Stonehaven (created 1925), both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as well as the Baird of Urie Baronetcy, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, passed to the couple&#x27;s son, James Ian. The Countess of Kintore, who died the day after her one-hundredth birthday, was the longest-lived female holder of a British peerage; upon inheriting his mother&#x27;s titles, her son James Ian changed his surname from Baird to Keith.

The family seat was Keith Hall, near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire.

<text>A toy train is a toy that represents a train. It is distinguished from a model train by an emphasis on low cost and durability, rather than scale modeling. A toy train can be as simple as a toy that can run on a track, or it might be operated by electricity, clockwork or live steam. It is typically constructed from wood, plastic or metal. Many of today&#x27;s steam trains might be considered as real ones as well, providing they are not strictly scale or not enough detailed ones in favor of a robustness appropriate for children or an inexpensive production.

== Definitions ==

&quot;Toy train&quot; usually refers to a reduced-scale model of a train for children to play with. Some similar but larger vehicles are made for children to ride in, typically in parks and playgrounds; often they run on tires and not tracks. If they are meant to resemble trains then these too are called toy trains. Small trains are sometimes also called toy trains. In India, many trains that run on meter-gauge tracks and that are meant for adults are called toy trains. The trains that run on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are an example.

For highly accurate train models made for serious hobbyists and collectors, the term &quot;model train&quot; is preferred.

== Standards ==
The first widely adopted standards for toy trains running on track were introduced in Leipzig, Germany in 1891 by Märklin.

See also List of rail transport modelling scales.

==USA classification==
Z Gauge [1:220]

N Gauge [1:160]

HO Gauge [1:87]

S Gauge [1:64]

O Gauge [1:43 to 1:48, varies]

G Gauge [1:20]

Märklin measured the gauge as the distance between the centers of the two outer rails, rather than the distance between the outer rails themselves. Lionel&#x27;s standard gauge is allegedly the result of Lionel&#x27;s misreading these standards, as are the variances in O gauge between the United States and Europe.

Most of these standards never really caught on, due to their large size, which made them impractical to use indoors, as well as the high price of manufacturing. Wide gauge trains, which are close in size to 2 gauge, are produced in limited quantities today, as are 1 gauge and O gauge trains. Of these, O gauge is the most popular.
The modern standards for toy trains also include S gauge, HO scale, N scale, and Z scale, in descending order of size. HO and N scale are the most popular model railway standards of today; inexpensive sets sold in toy stores and catalogs are less realistic than those sold to hobbyists. O gauge arguably remains the most popular toy train standard. Another size that is attracting interest among hobbyists is building and operating trains from Lego, or L gauge, which is roughly 1/38 scale.

A &quot;de facto&quot; standard is used by some companies making wooden toy trains that run on wooden tracks. This is usually referred to as &quot;Brio&quot; or &quot;Thomas&quot; compatible in reference to two major companies. The term &quot;Vario System&quot; introduced by the company Eichhorn, refers to a variant of the connecting system used by some modern wooden track producers. The tracks don&#x27;t use rails as such but rather grooves set apart a certain distance. The same &quot;gauge&quot; is used by the &quot;Lionel Great American Adventure series&quot; produced by Learning Curve, the Plarail system from Tomy and Trackmaster. Although the rolling stock of each system may be used to some extent on the tracks of other systems the compatibility beyond simple straight track and large radius curves may be rather limited.

Playmobil is an example of a company that offers a complete play world system based on its small plastic dolls and has later extended its play world to railways. It has developed two train systems to date. One is aimed at larger children using electric trains and remote control. This track system is designed such that it can also be used outside much like a garden train. The other system is designed for preschool children or even toddlers. An example of a system aimed at the very young is offered among others by the company &quot;Wader Toys&quot;. This includes tracks for road and rail as well as waterways. The elements are very simple in design, sturdy and washable as they are thought for play including such environments as sandboxes, mud and water. To scale detail is a very minor issue with such systems that focus rather on sturdiness, avoiding sharp edges and avoiding parts that could be a choking hazard.

Although the words &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;gauge&quot; are often used interchangeably, many toy train manufacturers historically had little concern with depicting accurate scale. American Flyer tended to boast its closer accuracy compared to other manufacturers. The terms &quot;O scale&quot; and &quot;S scale&quot; tend to imply serious scale modeling, while the terms &quot;O gauge&quot; and &quot;S gauge&quot; tend to imply toy trains manufactured by Lionel and American Flyer, respectively. While S gauge is fairly consistent at 1:64 scale, O gauge trains represent a variety of sizes. O gauge track happens to be 1/45 the size of real-world standard gauge track, so manufacturers in Continental Europe have traditionally used 1:45 for O gauge trains. British manufacturers rounded this up to 1:43, which is seven millimeters to the foot. U.S. manufacturers rounded it down to 1:48, which is a quarter-inch to the foot. However, most engaged in a practice of selective compression in order to make the trains fit in a smaller space, causing the actual scale to vary, and numerous manufacturers produced 1:64 scale trains—the proper size for S gauge—in O gauge, especially for cost-conscious lines.

Some of the earliest O gauge trains made of tinplate weren&#x27;t scale at all, made to unrealistic, whimsical proportions similar in length to modern HO scale, but anywhere from one and a half to two times as wide and tall. 

Some adult fans of toy trains operate their trains, while others only collect. Some toy train layouts are accessorized with scale models in an attempt to be as realistic as possible, while others are accessorized with toy buildings, cars, and figures. Some hobbyists will only buy accessories that were manufactured by the same company who made their trains. This practice is most common among fans of Marx and Lionel.

== History ==

The earliest toy trains were made of lead and had no moving parts. Some had wheels that turned, but these had to be pushed or pulled. A few of the early 19th-century push toy trains were made of tinplate, like the large, durable, stylized locomotive toys in the U.S., which were painted red and gold and decorated with hearts and flowers.

Around 1875, technological advancements in materials and manufacturing allowed tin to be stamped, cut, rolled, and lithographed faster than ever before.

Toy trains were revolutionized when Märklin, a German firm that specialized in doll house accessories, sought to create an equivalent toy for boys where a constant revenue stream could be ensured by selling add-on accessories for years after the initial purchase. In addition to boxed sets containing a train and track, Märklin offered extra track, rolling stock, and buildings sold separately, creating the predecessor to the modern model train layout featuring buildings and scenery in addition to an operating train. 

Electric trains followed, with the first appearing in 1897, produced by the U.S. firm Carlisle &amp; Finch. As residential use of electricity became more common in the early 20th century, electric trains gained popularity and as time went on, these electric trains grew in sophistication, gaining lighting, the ability to change direction, to emit a whistling sound, to smoke, to remotely couple and uncouple cars and even load and unload cargo. Toy trains from the first half of the 20th century were often made of lithographed tin; later trains were often made mostly of plastic. 

Prior to the 1950s, there was little distinction between toy trains and model railroads—model railroads were toys by definition. Pull toys and wind-up trains were marketed towards children, while electric trains were marketed towards teenagers, particularly teenaged boys. It was during the 1950s that the modern emphasis on realism in model railroading started to catch on.
Consumer interest in trains as toys waned in the late 1950s, but has experienced resurgence since the late 1990s due in large part to the popularity of Thomas the Tank Engine. 

Today, S gauge and O gauge railroads are still considered toy trains even by their adherents and are often accessorized with semi-scale model buildings by Plasticville or K-Line (who owns the rights to the Plasticville-like buildings produced by Marx from the 1950s to the 1970s). However, due to their high cost, one is more likely to find an HO scale or N scale train set in a toy store than an O scale set.

Many modern electric toy trains contain sophisticated electronics that emit digitized sound effects and allow the operator to safely and easily run multiple remote control trains on one loop of track. In recent years, many toy train operators will operate a train with a TV camera in the front of the engine and hooked up to a screen, such as computer monitor. This will show an image, similar to that of a real (smaller size) railroad.

<text>Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA) is an open-source software application designed to reduce the amount of junk email a user receives. TMDA&#x27;s main difference from other anti-spam systems is the use of a challenge/response system that bulk mailing machines and programs are either unwilling (to save bandwidth) or unable (due to lack of programming) to answer.

The technical countermeasures used by TMDA to thwart spam include:

* Whitelists: Whitelists are essentially an ‘accept list’. All messages from addresses in these lists are automatically allowed through no matter what the content is.
* Blacklists: Blacklists are a ‘block list’. All messages from addresses in these lists are automatically blocked.
* [[Challenge-response spam filtering|Challenge/response (C/R)]]: A controversial system in which challenge emails are sent to unfamiliar sending addresses in an attempt to validate those addresses and their associated emails. Legitimate senders who are not yet approved are thus tasked with an additional “response” effort in sending mail. Also, as spam is often crafted with forged sending addresses, people, otherwise unrelated to the incident, may be sent spurious challenges — a form of backscatter.
* Tagged addresses: Special-purpose e-mail addresses such as time-dependent addresses, or addresses which only accept certain kinds of communication. These increase the transparency of TMDA for unknown senders by allowing them to safely circumvent the challenge/response system.

<text>Eastern Oregon is a region of the U.S. state of Oregon. It is not an officially recognized geographic entity; thus, the boundaries of the region vary according to context. It is sometimes understood to include only the eight easternmost counties in the state; in other contexts, it includes the entire area east of the Cascade Range. Cities in the basic eight-county definition include Baker City, Burns, Hermiston, Pendleton, Boardman, John Day, La Grande, and Ontario. Umatilla County is home to the largest population base in Eastern Oregon, accounting for 42% of the region&#x27;s residents — more than twice that of the region’s second most populous, Malheur County. Hermiston, located in Umatilla County, is the largest city in the region, accounting for 10% of the population. Major industries include transportation/warehousing, timber, agriculture and tourism. The main transportation corridors are I-84, U.S. Route 395, U.S. Route 97, U.S. Route 26, U.S. Route 30, and U.S. Route 20.

Compared to that of the western part of the state, the climate of Eastern Oregon has a drier continental climate, with much greater seasonal variations in temperature. Unlike the Willamette Valley, Eastern Oregon receives a significant amount of snow in the winter. Some areas receive fewer than of rain yearly, classifying them as deserts. This desert climate is in part due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Cascade Range. Pine and juniper forests cover 35% of Eastern Oregon, much in the mountains that include the Blue Mountains, Strawberry Mountains, Wallowa Mountains, Trout Creek Mountains, Ochoco Mountains, and Steens Mountain. Volcanic basalt flows from the Columbia River Basalt Group covered large sections of Eastern Oregon 6 to 17 million years ago. Other landforms include the Alvord Desert, Owyhee Desert, Warner Valley, Deschutes River, Owyhee River, Grande Ronde River, Joseph Canyon, The Honeycombs, and Malheur Butte.

== Geography ==

According to the Eastern Oregon Visitors Association, Eastern Oregon includes only the following eight counties: Morrow, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Grant, Baker, Harney, and Malheur. The association divides the eight-county definition into three subregions: the Columbia River Plateau (Morrow and Umatilla counties); northeast Oregon (Baker, Union, and Wallowa counties); and southeast Oregon (Grant, Harney, and Malheur counties). Some definitions of the region are more restrictive, while others include the base eight counties listed above plus several adjacent counties. Still others include the entire area east of the Cascade Range; this meaning would also include Sherman, Crook, Deschutes, Gilliam, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Wasco, and Wheeler counties.

The extreme eastern section of Oregon in the Snake River Valley, including the city of Ontario, is part of the Treasure Valley, which extends east to Boise, Idaho. Unlike the rest of the state, that section lies within the Mountain Time Zone. Sacajawea Peak is the region&#x27;s highest mountain. 
==Politics==
Although Oregon as a whole is generally considered a blue state, Eastern Oregon is far more conservative than the west. Morrow County is the only Eastern Oregon county to have supported Democratic presidential nominees after Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide, having voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 and for Bill Clinton in 1996. In the 2012 presidential election, the Republican candidate Mitt Romney received at least 60% of the vote in every county in Eastern Oregon.

The political divide between the eastern and western parts of the state has led some residents of Eastern Oregon to claim that the state of Oregon, with the majority of its population and political control based in the west of the Cascade Range, has neglected the eastern part of the state, preventing it from developing along with the western part. A movement to have Eastern Oregon secede and join the United States as a 51st state was underway in 2008. 

===&quot;Greater Idaho&quot;===
In 2021, five counties in Eastern Oregon voted to direct their County Commissioners to hold annual hearings on the issue of joining Idaho, the state located east of Oregon. It was initiated by the group &quot;Move Oregon&#x27;s Border for a Greater Idaho&quot;, who support the Greater Idaho movement. As of May 2022, eight counties had voted to direct their County Commissioners to examine the issue further. Some counties, such as Douglas and Josephine, had voted against joining the coalition. By November, three more counties in Eastern Oregon, for a total of eleven, had voted to join Idaho, a number that grew to 12 by June of 2023. 

On January 10, 2023, Senate Joint Memorial 2, also known as the Greater Idaho Bill, was sponsored in the Oregon Senate by politician Dennis Linthicum.

== Cities ==
Top 15 most populated Eastern Oregon cities (according to the 8-county definition):
By extending the boundary outside to include neighboring counties, Eastern Oregon would include three of the largest population centers east of the Cascade Range: Bend, Redmond, and Klamath Falls. However, these lie outside the stricter boundary.

== Climate and ecology ==
Compared to the maritime rainforest climate of Western Oregon, which is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, the climate of Eastern Oregon is a drier continental climate, with much greater seasonal variations in temperature. Unlike the Willamette Valley, Eastern Oregon gets a significant amount of snow in the winter. Some parts of Eastern Oregon receive fewer than of rain yearly, classifying them as deserts. The driest parts are the southeast and the area near Redmond. This desert climate is in part due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Cascade Range. Pine and juniper forests cover 35% of Eastern Oregon, especially in the mountains east of Klamath Falls and in the Blue Mountains.

== Economy ==
The region&#x27;s economy is primarily agricultural. Timber and mining, while formerly key industries, have decreased in importance in recent years. Cultural tourism, agritourism and ecotourism continue to develop. The wheat growing region of Eastern Oregon includes the Columbia Plateau portion of northeastern Oregon, which begins with very marginal wheat fields in central Wasco County and extends east through Umatilla County. Its rich loess soils &quot;help make the Columbia Plateau one of the premier wheat-producing regions in the world.&quot; South of the wheat lands of northeast Oregon, agricultural activity is generally limited to livestock grazing except where irrigation is available. Irrigated areas are often used to produce alfalfa hay.

== Recreation ==
From the high desert to the rugged mountainous areas of the Eagle Cap Wilderness area, Eastern Oregon has a range of outdoor recreational opportunities such as skiing, rafting, and hiking.

Anthony Lakes is the largest ski resort in Eastern Oregon. Spout Springs, located in the Umatilla National Forest in the Blue Mountains, is popular with families. Rafting is often seasonal on the rivers that are snowpack-dependent and not dammed. The Owyhee River is an example of a desert canyon river experience. The Snake River offers boating experiences that range from a quiet drift through the desert to hair-raising thrills of class II to III+ rapids.

== Transportation ==

Historically, the region has been relatively isolated from Western Oregon, due to the difficulty of crossing the Cascades. Early settlers floated down the Columbia River from The Dalles to reach Western Oregon. In 1845, Sam Barlow built a road around the south side of Mount Hood, which served as the final leg of the Oregon Trail. The Applegate Trail and Santiam Wagon Road were constructed soon after, connecting eastern and western Oregon in the southern and central parts of the state. In the early 20th century, Samuel Hill built the Columbia River Highway, allowing automobiles to pass through the Columbia River Gorge.

Railroads began to be important as early as 1858 with the construction of the Oregon Portage Railroad which built a bypass around the rapids at Cascade Locks. This was followed by the 1862 incorporation of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company whose operations included building a rail bypass from The Dalles to Celilo Falls. In 1880 these two short sections of rail were incorporated into the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&amp;N). Shortly thereafter Henry Villard, who then controlled OR&amp;N, moved aggressively to block entry of the then under construction Northern Pacific Railway into the Columbia Gorge. 
In an agreement first made in March 1880 and formalized in the fall of 1880, the Northern Pacific Railway, then controlled by Frederick Billings, and the OR&amp;N, at that time controlled by Henry Villard, agreed to divide the Columbia Plateau at the Snake River, with the Northern Pacific staying to the north and the OR&amp;N staying to the south. Northern Pacific was not to build down the gorge into Portland, but would receive trackage rights on the tracks that OR&amp;N was building on the south bank into Portland. The first St. Paul-Portland Northern Pacific train arrived in Portland on September 12, 1883, via OR&amp;N trackage down the Oregon side of the Columbia River from Wallula, Washington forever ending the isolation of at least the northern portion of Eastern Oregon. A year later in November 1884, the Oregon Short Line was completed across southern Idaho and met the OR&amp;N at Huntington, providing rail service that essentially paralleled the Oregon Trail all the way from Omaha, Nebraska. Later the OR&amp;N became part of the Union Pacific Railway.

The only other railroad ever built east over the Cascade Mountains was trackage that was to become part of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, which was opened in 1926 over Willamette Pass to Klamath Falls to bypass the difficult line south of Eugene to Ashland.

All-weather highways over the Cascade Mountains were not completed until the 1930s and 1940s.

Major road routes through eastern Oregon include I-84 from Ontario to the Columbia River Gorge. The only other interstate freeway in the region is an eleven-mile (18 km) stretch of Interstate 82 that ends at the Columbia River in Umatilla. Other major east–west routes include U.S. Route 26, U.S. Route 30, U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 730. U.S. Route 395 is a major north–south route, passing through Pendleton, Burns, John Day, and Lakeview. Further west, U.S. Route 97 runs north and south from the California border through Klamath Falls, Bend, and Redmond to Biggs Junction on the Columbia River.

<doc id="445112" wikidata="Q175574" url="?curid=445112" title="13th Airborne Division (United States)">
<text>The 13th Airborne Division was an airborne forces formation of division-size of the United States Army that was active during World War II. The division was commanded for most of its existence by Major General Elbridge G. Chapman. It was officially activated in the United States in August 1943 at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, remaining active until February 1946, however it never saw combat.

After activation the division remained in the United States to complete its training. This training was completed by September 1944, but had to be extended by a further four months when the division provided replacements for the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The division also encountered delays in mounting large-scale training exercises due to a lack of transport aircraft in the United States. This shortage was caused by the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions taking priority over the 13th in terms of equipment due to the two divisions serving in combat in Europe. As a consequence of these delays the division was not fully trained and combat-ready until January 1945, and was transferred to France and the European Theater of Operations in February.

When the division arrived in France, it came under the command of the First Allied Airborne Army, which controlled all Allied airborne formations. The division, along with two others, was selected to participate in Operation Varsity, the airborne operation to support the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine, but was removed from the operation due to there being insufficient transport aircraft to carry all three divisions into combat. Several other operations were planned for the division after the end of Operation Varsity, but these operations were cancelled when their objectives were captured by the rapid advance of Allied ground forces and they became superfluous. After the end of the conflict in Europe, the 13th Airborne was shipped to the United States to stage there before it was to participate in the planned invasion of Japan, but the conflict in the Far East ended before it was required and it remained in the United States. The 13th Airborne Division was finally inactivated on 26 February 1946 and its combat personnel were transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.

== Formation ==
The 13th Airborne Division was the fifth airborne division (11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd and 101st) to be formed in the United States during World War II, and was officially activated on Friday 13 August 1943 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under the command of Major General George W. Griner Jr. Only a few months after the activation of the division, however, Major General Griner was ordered to take command of the 98th Infantry Division, and was replaced by Major General Elbridge Chapman, who would go on to command the division for the rest of the conflict. Chapman was one of the early pioneers of the American airborne concept, commanding the experimental 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion in late 1941 when he was a lieutenant colonel, before going on to take command of the 13th Airborne Division. The 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion would be renamed as the 88th Airborne Infantry Regiment, and then finally become the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment on 21 September 1942, forming the core of the 13th Airborne Division. When it was activated, the 13th Airborne Division was initially composed of the 515th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment.

==Shoulder sleeve insignia==

The division&#x27;s shoulder patch, a winged unicorn in orange on an ultramarine blue, the branch of service colors of the United States Army Air Corps, was approved on 2 June 1943. A gold on black &quot;Airborne&quot; tab was worn above the insignia.

== Actions during World War II ==

=== Training ===
Between August 1943 and February 1945, the 13th Airborne Division remained in the United States and did not serve overseas or participate in any airborne operations, as it began training to become a combat-ready formation. In comparison, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had been assigned as active combat formations to serve overseas in Europe, the 11th Airborne Division was scheduled to be deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations, and the 17th Airborne Division had been assigned as the United States strategic reserve formation. During this period, the activities of the division primarily involved airborne training, as well as taking part in several training exercises. However, while airborne training for the first four American airborne divisions was conducted during 1943, the 13th encountered considerable difficulties when it came to its turn for training. By the last few months of 1943 the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had conducted airborne exercises and finished their training, and had then been transferred to Europe; to ensure the divisions could conduct airborne operations, a majority of the transport aircraft available in the United States had been sent with them, and even more were transferred to Europe as replacements after the American airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. Consequently, very few transport aircraft were available for use by the 13th, and the original training exercise for the division that had been scheduled for June 1944 had to be postponed until 17 September, and then once again until 24 September.

The divisional training exercise took place around Camp Mackall, North Carolina, and suffered from a number of difficulties and problems. Poor weather delayed the beginning of the exercise until the night of 25 September, and it was only then that the aircraft carrying the first three battalions of paratroopers could take off and attempt to drop the airborne troops on three separate drop zones. A combination of poor visibility, and a lack of sufficient training for the pilots of the transport aircraft, resulted in the paratroopers being dispersed widely when dropped. Only sixty-five percent of the airborne troops and equipment dropped on the first drop zone were ready for action ninety minutes later, and in the second drop zone the airborne troops were so scattered that by 10:00 the next morning the commander of the battalion only had control over twenty percent of his men. A similar number of paratroopers missed the third drop zone, although the majority were dropped in a relatively small area where they could gather. Further problems were encountered, as a plane crash killed eight paratroopers and four aircrew, and the glider-borne elements of the division due to land were delayed by poor weather. After the initial night, the exercise continued for a further three days and included a complex supply mission designed to test whether it was possible to supply an isolated battalion of airborne troops.

Overall, observers present for the exercise reported that they had been impressed with the performance of the glider-borne elements of the division. However, several noted that the training of the aircraft pilots for night formation flying and navigation was far from satisfactory. A recommendation was made that night glider landings should be considered only when an emergency existed, and that otherwise gliders should take off during the night and land during daylight to avoid the wide dispersal of airborne troops and a decrease in efficiency. After these exercises had ended, the division continued to train, but encountered further delays. These were caused when 1,652 men were removed from the division to provide reinforcements for U.S. Airborne units in the European Theater; this drastically reduced the strength of the division and forced it to extend its training period for a further four months. After completing its training in January the division was preparing to transfer to the Pacific Theatre in early 1945. However, the rapid advances made by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge led to the division being transferred to the European Theatre of Operations to reinforce Allied divisions already in combat.

=== European Theater of Operations ===
The division arrived in the European Theater of Operations in early February, coming under the command of the First Allied Airborne Army, and Major General Chapman was informed that there was a possibility that the division would be required to conduct airborne operations during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge. However, the campaign in the Ardennes ended before the division could be transported there. The next chance for the 13th to participate in an airborne operation, and to actually see combat, was in March 1945 when the Allies had penetrated into Germany itself and reached the River Rhine. A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat jump over the Rhine it was reorganized, after a conference by the War Department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment. Subsequently, the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a veteran unit that had served in Italy, Southern France and the Ardennes, joined the division in early March, and the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment was combined into the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment that remained as the division&#x27;s sole glider-based element. The 517th had recently fought during the Ardennes campaign, and had received a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.

The Rhine river was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies access to the North German Plain and ultimately to advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the &#x27;Broad Front Approach&#x27; laid out by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, it was decided to attempt to breach the Rhine in several areas. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command to breach the Rhine, which he titled Operation Plunder, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, and the U.S. Ninth Army, under Lieutenant General William Simpson, crossing the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, and finally the 13th, all of which were assigned to U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway. However, it was discovered that there were only enough transport aircraft available in Europe to transport two airborne divisions into combat, and as such it was removed from Operation Varsity due to its lack of combat experience.

After its removal from Operation Varsity, the division remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division was scheduled to participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a &#x27;strategic airhead&#x27; in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for the operation once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating the need for the operation. Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for the operation got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.

== Composition ==
The division was composed of the following units:

* 88th Glider Infantry Regiment (disbanded 1 March 1945, assets merged into the 326th GIR)
* 326th Glider Infantry Regiment
* 515th Parachute Infantry Regiment
* 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, (assigned 1 March 1945)

* 153rd Airborne Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion
* 13th Parachute Maintenance Company (assigned 1 March 45)
* 222nd Airborne Medical Company
* 13th Airborne Division Artillery
** 458th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion (75 mm)
** 460th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion (75 mm) (assigned 1 March 1945)

** 409th Airborne Quartermaster Company
** 513th Airborne Signal Company
** 713th Airborne Ordnance Company
** Reconnaissance Platoon (assigned 1 March 45)

== Awards ==
During World War II members of the division were awarded the following awards:
* Medal of Honor: 1
** Private First Class Melvin E. Biddle, awarded for actions before the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment joined the 13th Airborne Division
* Legion of Merit: 6
* Bronze Star Medal: 50

== Inactivation ==

The conflict with Germany came to an end a few weeks after Operation Effective was cancelled, and shortly afterwards it was announced that the division would be redeployed to the Pacific to participate in the invasion of Japan after a brief stop-over in the United States. The deactivation of the 17th Airborne Division meant that the 13th acquired several combat units from that division to bolster it for its envisioned action in Japan. The division arrived in New York City on 23 August, but did not leave the United States before the surrender of Japan in September 1945. With the conflict at an end, the division was no longer required by the United States Army, and it was permanently inactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 25 February 1946, with its personnel transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.

<text>A dog show is an animal show, an event where dogs are exhibited. A conformation show, also referred to as a &quot;breed show&quot;, is a kind of dog show in which a judge, familiar with a specific dog breed, evaluates individual purebred dogs for how well the dogs &quot;conform&quot; to the established breed type for their breed, as described in a breed&#x27;s individual breed standard.

Dog shows can be in the means of evaluating dogs for breeding purposes. A conformation championship from a recognised national kennel club is generally considered as an indication of merit. Many breeders consider championships a prerequisite for breeding. Some critics argue that the shows can encourage selective breeding of traits and lower genetic diversity.

The first modern conformation dog show was held in Newcastle Town Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in June 1859.

==Judging==

A conformation dog show is not a comparison of one dog to another but a comparison of each dog to a judge&#x27;s mental image of the ideal breed type as outlined in the individual breed&#x27;s breed standard. Dog show judges attempt to identify dogs who epitomise the published standards for each breed. Some judgments must be subjective. As an example, what exactly entails a &quot;full coat&quot; or a &quot;cheerful attitude&quot;, descriptions found in breed standards, can be learned different.

Judges are generally certified to judge one or several breeds, usually in the same group, but a few &quot;all-breed&quot; judges can judge a large number of breeds.

==Winning==
Dogs compete at dog shows to earn points or certification towards championship titles.

The Kennel Club (UK) system, which is also used by the Australian National Kennel Council and in other countries, is considered the most difficult to earn a title under.

Fédération Cynologique Internationale sponsors international shows that differ from other shows in that dogs first receive individual written descriptions of positive and negative qualities from the judge, and only dogs with high ratings go on to compete against other dogs in the class. A dog must receive four international &quot;Certificat d&#x27;Aptitude au Championnat International de Beauté&quot; (CACIB) to qualify for a championship; one must be won in the dog&#x27;s own country, and at least two in other countries under at least three different judges.

==United States==
There are seven classes per breed in American Kennel Club dog shows:

#Puppy (sometimes divided between 6–9 months and 9–12 months)
# Twelve-To-Eighteen Months (those that fall in this age range are eligible)
# Novice (dogs over six months old are eligible as long as they have not won any points yet, have not yet won three first place prizes in this class, and have not won first prizes in the Bred-By-Exhibitor, American-bred or Open classes)
# Amateur Owner Handler (where the owner is exhibiting the dog and has not received funds for showing any other dog)
# Bred-By-Exhibitor (where the person handling the dog is an owner and breeder of record.)
# American-Bred (This class is reserved for dogs conceived in the U.S.)
# Open (Any dog that is over six months old can enter into this class. Champions are not allowed in any of the other classes and are only permitted to enter this class, although in most cases they skip the class competition entirely and are entered directly in Best of Breed.)
The American-Bred and Open classes are mandatory for each show, while the others are optional. In some cases, one or more of these classes may be divided by color, height, weight, or coat type. A dog can earn extra points during these awards, depending on the number of dogs of its sex and the Champions that were competing against it.

In the American Kennel Club, a dog needs 15 points to become a Champion, with each win gaining anywhere from zero to five points depending on the number of dogs competing and the area where the show is held. At least two wins must be a set of three or more points (&quot;majors&quot;) under two different judges; at least one additional win under a third judge is also required.

The rules for the United Kennel Club (UKC) use a different points system. A championship requires a combination of points and competition wins. Points are awarded at breed level for each win; for example, winning the class earns 10 points in non-variety breeds and 5 in variety breeds, even if there are no other dogs to beat in the class. Competition Wins are wins over at least one other dog, whether in their own breed (such as going Best Fe/male or Best of Winners) or higher level (placing above at least one other dog in the group or Best/Reserve Best in Multi-Breed show). A championship requires a total of 100 points and three competition wins.
==Canada==
Canadian Kennel Club shows are nearly identical to American Kennel Club dog shows, with the exception of a &quot;Canadian-Bred&quot; class replacing the AKC&#x27;s &quot;American-Bred&quot;. The main difference is the number of points required for a Championship, and the way those points are calculated.

Under the Canadian Kennel Club rules, 10 points are needed for a Championship, with wins awarded by at least three different judges and at least one &quot;major&quot; win of two or more points. Once a Championship is completed, dogs may earn points toward their Grand Championship.

As of January 1, 2013, to reach a Grand Championship, 20 points are needed with two &quot;majors&quot;. Next is the Grand Excellent Championship which may be awarded to dogs who accumulate 100 points and have won at least one Best in the show. Region is not a factor in determining points for a win in Canada—the point schedule is the same across the country.

==Colombia==
In Colombia, dog shows are maintained and organised by the Association Colombian Kennel Club &quot;&quot;. Their conformation shows follow the rules of the International Federation of Kennel Clubs. &quot;(Fédération Cynologique Internationale)&quot;. According to the ACCC, only purebred dogs recognised by the FCI are allowed to participate. Purebreds of Colombian origin must be registered with the ACCC, and therefore they must hold an LOC number &quot;(Number in the Colombian Book of Origins).&quot;

==Notable dog shows==

===Crufts===
In the United Kingdom, the international championship show Crufts was first held in 1891. Since its centenary year in 1991, the show has officially been recognised as the world&#x27;s largest and most prestigious dog show by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, with a total of 22,991 dogs being exhibited that year. 22,964 dogs were exhibited in 2008, 27 short of the previous record.

===World Dog Show===
The World Dog Show is sponsored by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale for international championships in conformation and other dog sports. The location rotates between member countries. The 2008 show was held in Stockholm, Sweden; the 2009 show in Bratislava, Slovakia; and the 2010 show in Herning, Denmark.

===Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show===
The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breed conformation show, historically held in the New York City area. It is one of a handful of benched shows in the United States.

It is often compared to the World Dog Show; the World Dog Show is considered a bit more valuable reputation-wise.

==Criticism==

Some critics state that conformation shows lead to the selection of breeding dogs based solely upon appearance, which is seen by some as detrimental to working qualities and, at worst, as a promotion of eugenics. The shows have been criticized for encouraging breeding of traits that are harmful to the dogs; for example, the Pekingese dog who won at Britain&#x27;s most prestigious dog show in 2003 had to be photographed while lying on an icepack after winning the show because the dog could not breathe well enough to efficiently cool his own overheated body. Breeding selective traits reduces genetic diversity, which can create some health problems in dogs.

In the United States, some working dog breed organisations, such as the American Border Collie Association and the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, have tried to fight to keep their breeds from being recognised by the AKC and some other kennel clubs, as they thought that the introduction of their breeds to the show ring would lead to decreasing numbers of working dogs with adequate qualities.

In August 2008, BBC1 televised a documentary film titled &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot;, which investigated the subject of health issues affecting pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom, with a particular emphasis on dogs bred for showing. The programme provoked criticisms of kennel clubs. Following the broadcast, the BBC withdrew its television coverage of the Crufts dog show from 2009, with other sponsors and partners also withdrawing support, including Pedigree Petfoods, the RSPCA, PDSA and the Dog&#x27;s Trust. In response to the programme, the Kennel Club in the UK announced a review of all breed standards. They stated that they will impose a ban on breeding between dogs that are closely related and will impose greater monitoring to prevent unhealthy dogs from being entered.

==Bench show== 
A bench show is a show which requires dogs to be on display in an assigned location () during the entirety of the show, except when being shown in the ring, groomed for showing, or taken outside to eliminate. The purpose is for spectators and breeders to have an opportunity to see all the entered dogs. In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.

In the United States, benched shows used to be the norm, but now there are only six left, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and the National Dog Show.

Among field trial participants, where dogs are judged on their performance and not their looks, the term &quot;bench show&quot; refers to any conformation show.

<doc id="445118" wikidata="Q197644" url="?curid=445118" title="17th Airborne Division (United States)">
<text>The 17th Airborne Division, &quot;The Golden Talons&quot;, was an airborne infantry division of the United States Army during World War II, commanded by Major General William M. Miley.

Activated in April 1943, the division took part in the Knollwood Maneuver and other exercises that helped ensure that the U.S. Army would retain airborne divisions. It arrived in Britain in August 1944, having missed the Allies&#x27; first two large-scale airborne operations: Operation Husky and Operation Neptune.

In Britain, the 17th came under the command of Maj. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps, a part of Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton&#x27;s First Allied Airborne Army. It was not chosen to participate in Operation Market Garden, the airborne landings in the Netherlands, as Allied planners believed it had arrived too late and could not be &quot;trained up&quot; in time. After Market Garden, the division was shipped to France and then Belgium to fight in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. The 17th gained its first Medal of Honor during its time fighting in the Ardennes, and was then withdrawn to Luxembourg to prepare for an assault over the River Rhine. In March 1945, the division participated in its only airborne operation, dropping alongside the British 6th Airborne Division as a part of Operation Varsity, during which it gained three more Medals of Honor. The division advanced through Northern Germany until the end of World War II, when it briefly undertook occupation duties in Germany before shipping back to the United States. It was inactivated in September 1945, although it was briefly reactivated as a training division between 1948 and 1949.

==Formation==
The German Armed Forces pioneered the use of large-scale airborne formations, first during the invasion of Norway and Denmark and later that year during the assaults on the Netherlands and Belgium in 1940 and later in the Battle of Crete in 1941. The Allied governments were aware of the success of these operations (but not of the heavy German casualties incurred, particularly during the assault on the Netherlands and the invasion of Crete) and decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of five American and two British airborne divisions, as well as many smaller units. The 17th Airborne Division was activated on 15 April 1943 at Camp Mackall in North Carolina, under the command of the newly promoted Major General William Miley, a veteran of World War I. The division was originally composed of the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, activated on 11 January 1943 at Fort Benning, the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment, and the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment. The official dedication ceremony for the unit took place on 1 May 1943, with thousands of civilian and military spectators, including Major General Elbridge Chapman, overall commander of Airborne Command and of all American airborne forces during World War II.

Once activated, the division remained in the United States for training and exercises. As the division, like all airborne units, was intended to be an elite formation, the training regime was extremely arduous. There were and towers built from which prospective airborne troops would jump off of to simulate landing by parachute, lengthy forced marches and practice jumps from transport aircraft; to pause in the doorway of an aircraft during a practice jump resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate. The resultant failure rate was accordingly high, but there was never a shortage of candidates, especially for the American divisions, as the rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman. As the division trained, a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was &quot;en masse&quot; or as small compact units. On 9 July 1943, the first large-scale Allied airborne operation–the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky)–was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division. The Commanding General (CG) of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, Major General Joseph May Swing, had been temporarily assigned to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, for the invasion of Sicily, and had observed the airborne assault, which went badly. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division had been deployed by both parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties, leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives.

===Swing Board===
General Eisenhower had reviewed the airborne role in Operation Husky, and had concluded that large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower to set up a review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until a large-scale maneuver could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committee–the Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange a large-scale maneuver that would effectively decide the fate of the divisional-sized airborne force. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The maneuver would also provide both divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in a large-scale maneuver undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.

===Knollwood Maneuver===
The objective for the 11th as the attacking force was to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, after which the maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport and the surrounding area and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide the success or failure of the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.

==World War II==
The division also participated in the Second Army maneuvers in the Tennessee Maneuver Area from 6 February 1944. It finished its training on 27 March 1944, and transferred to Camp Forrest on 24 March 1944. The division staged at Camp Myles Standish on 12 August 1944 before departing Boston Port of Embarkation on 20 August 1944. The 17th Airborne Division arrived in the United Kingdom on 26 August.

Once in Britain the division was attached to U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, which commanded all American airborne formations, and which in turn became part of the First Allied Airborne Army when it was formed on 21 August, under the command of Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. Although attached to XVIII Airborne Corps, the division was not chosen to participate in Operation Market Garden, a large-scale airborne operation intended to seize several bridges through the Netherlands to allow the Allied armies to bypass the Rhine river and enter Germany. The 17th was passed over in favour of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions because it had only recently arrived in the European Theater and was considered to be unprepared logistically as it was still collecting its combat equipment. The division was also given command of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The 507th had fought in Normandy under command of the 82nd Airborne Division and remained in England as a theater reserve during Market Garden. The 507th continued to remain in England as the Allied armies continued their advance towards Germany.

===Battle of the Bulge===
On 16 December 1944 the Wehrmacht launched an offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, breaking through Allied lines and rapidly advancing towards Antwerp. On the afternoon of 17 December, Eisenhower decided to commit his theater reserve to the Ardennes in an attempt to halt the German advance; this consisted of the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions under the control of XVIII Airborne Corps. The three divisions were to be attached to Courtney Hodges&#x27;s U.S. First Army and were ordered to concentrate around the town of St Vith. However, while the other two airborne divisions were able to immediately make their way to the Ardennes as they were already stationed in France, bad weather prevented the 17th from flying in from where the division was stationed in Britain for several days. On 23 December the weather cleared and the division was finally flown to France by emergency night flights. It moved to an assembly area near Rheims. On Christmas Day, the division was attached to George Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army and ordered to assume a thirty-mile long defensive position that ran along the Meuse River near Charleville.

By 1 January 1945 the threat to Charleville had eased sufficiently for the division to be transferred to another area of the Ardennes, being transported to an area south-west of Bastogne near the village of Morhet on 3 January; there it relieved the 11th Armored Division which had occupied the village prior to its arrival. On 4 January the division entered combat for the first time when it was ordered alongside the 87th Infantry Division to seize a number of key towns to the west of Bastogne, in order to prevent German forces from encircling the town a second time; it had been relieved by the Third Army on 26 December. With the 87th Infantry Division on its left flank, the division advanced towards German positions with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment and 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment forming the division&#x27;s assault element; the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment and the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved behind these two regiments to deal with expected German armoured counter-attacks against them. During its initial advance the division engaged German forces, including infantry and armour, in an attempt to secure a narrow, high-rimmed road to the north-west of Bastogne; during a battle that lasted three days the division suffered nearly 1,000 casualties attempting to hold what the division&#x27;s official historian labeled &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Ridge&quot;. It was during the opening stages of this battle that the division earned its first Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Isadore S. Jachman of the 513th Parachute Infantry engaged and damaged with a bazooka two German tanks that formed part of an armoured column attacking American positions, forcing the column to retreat but simultaneously being killed by machine gun fire. Between 19 and 26 January, the division broke through German lines and captured several towns before linking up with elements of the British 51st Infantry Division. After it had captured the town of Espeler on 26 January the entire division was withdrawn from the front and transported by truck to Luxembourg, effectively ending its participation in the Ardennes campaign.

===Operation Varsity===

====Preparation====
After participating in the Battle of the Bulge, the division was moved behind the front-lines as a reserve formation and theater reserve, whilst the Allies continued their advance towards the German interior. However, even as the division received replacements and trained, it had already been selected to take part in a highly ambitious airborne operation code-named Operation Eclipse. This operation, which got to such an advanced stage that plans had been created and divisional commanders briefed, called for the 17th and 82nd Airborne divisions, along with a brigade from the British 6th Airborne Division, to be dropped in daylight in and around Berlin to capture the city. The operation received the support of General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of the United States Army Air Corps, but planning ended on 28 March, when General Eisenhower sent a message to Joseph Stalin indicating that the Allied armies would not attempt to capture Berlin, thereby making Eclipse obsolete. Eclipse and several other similarly ambitious airborne operations came to nothing, but in February the division finally received word that it would be involved in an Allied airborne operation to cross the River Rhine in support of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group that would take place during March.

By March 1945, the Allies had advanced into Germany and had reached the River Rhine. The Rhine was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies to access the North German Plain and ultimately advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the &quot;Broad Front Approach&quot; laid out by General Eisenhower, it was decided to attempt to breach the Rhine in several areas. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the 21st Army Group, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command to breach the Rhine, which he entitled Operation Plunder, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey and the U.S. Ninth Army under Lieutenant General William Simpson crossing the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps.

However, as planning for Operation Varsity began, it soon became obvious that there was a lack of suitable transport aircraft to transport all three airborne divisions. As such the 13th Airborne Division was dropped from the operational plan, primarily because it had no combat experience, whereas the 6th Airborne Division had participated in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings during Operation Neptune, and the 17th had seen combat in the Ardennes. The plan for the operation was therefore altered to accommodate the two remaining airborne divisions. This would be the first airborne operation the 17th would take part in, and indeed would be its only before it was disbanded. The two airborne divisions would be dropped behind German lines, with their objective to land around Wesel and disrupt enemy defences in order to aid the advance of the British Second Army. To achieve this, both divisions would be dropped near the town of Hamminkeln, and were tasked with a number of objectives; they were to seize the Diersfordter Wald, a forest that overlooked the Rhine and had a road linking several towns together; several bridges over a smaller waterway, the Issel, were to be seized to facilitate the advance; and the town of Hamminkeln was to be captured. Once these objectives were taken, the airborne troops would consolidate their positions and await the arrival of Allied ground forces, defending the territory captured against the German forces known to be in the area.

The 17th Airborne was to land its units in the southern portion of the area chosen for the operation, engaging the German forces that were defending the area, securing the Diersfordterwald Forest which dominated the surrounding area and capturing three bridges that spanned the River Issel. It would then hold the territory it had captured until it linked up units from the British 6th Airborne Division, which would land in the northern section of the operational area, and finally advance alongside 21st Army Group once the Allied ground forces had made contact with the airborne forces. To avoid heavy casualties such as those incurred by the British 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market Garden, both Allied airborne divisions would be dropped only after Allied ground units had secured crossings over the Rhine; the two divisions would also be dropped only a relatively short distance behind German lines, to ensure that reinforcements would be able to link up with them after only a few hours and they would not be isolated.

====Battle====

Operation Plunder began at 21:00 on 23 March after a week-long aerial bombardment of Luftwaffe airfields and the German transport system, involving more than ten thousand Allied aircraft. By the early hours of 24 March units of 21st Army Group had crossed the Rhine against heavy German opposition and secured several crossings on the eastern bank of the river. In the first few hours of 24 March, the transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions that formed Operation Varsity took off from airbases in England and France and rendezvoused over Brussels, before turning north-east for the Rhine dropping zones. The airlift consisted of 541 transport aircraft containing airborne troops, and a further 1,050 troop-carriers towing 1,350 gliders. The 17th Airborne Division consisted of 9,387 personnel, who were transported in 836 C-47 Dakota transports, 72 C-46 Commando transports, and more than 900 Waco CG-4A gliders. At 10:00 on the morning of the 24th, the first Allied airborne units began to land on German soil on the eastern bank of the Rhine, some thirteen hours after the Allied assault had begun.

The 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Edson Raff, was the lead assault formation for the 17th Airborne Division, and was consequently the first U.S. airborne unit to land as part of Operation Varsity. The entire regiment was meant to be dropped in drop zone W, a clearing two miles north of Wesel; however, excessive ground haze confused the pilots of the transport aircraft carrying the 507th, and as such when the regiment dropped it split into two-halves. Colonel Raff and approximately 690 of his paratroopers landed north-west of the drop zone near the town of Diersfordt, with the rest of the regiment successfully landing in drop zone W. The colonel rallied his separated paratroopers and led them to the drop zone, engaging a battery of German artillery en route, killing or capturing the artillery crews before reuniting with the rest of the regiment. By 14:00 the 507th PIR had secured all of its objectives and cleared the area around Diersfordt, having engaged numerous German troops and destroying a German tank. The actions of the regiment during the initial landing also gained the division its second Medal of Honor, when Private George J. Peters posthumously received the award after charging a German machine gun nest and eliminating it with rifle fire and grenades, allowing his fellow paratroopers to gather their equipment and capture the regiments first objective.

The 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment was the second divisional unit to land, and was under the command of Colonel James W. Coutts. En route to the drop zone, the transport aircraft containing the regiment had the misfortune to pass through a belt of German anti-aircraft weapons, losing twenty-two of the C-46 transport aircraft and damaging a further thirty-eight. Just as the 507th had, the 513th also suffered from pilot error due to the ground haze, and as such the regiment actually missed their designated drop zone, and were dropped on one of the landing zones designated for the British 6th Airlanding Brigade. However, despite this inaccuracy the paratroopers swiftly rallied and aided the British glider-borne troops who were landing simultaneously, eliminating several German artillery batteries which were covering the area. Once the German troops in the area had been eliminated, a combined force of American and British airborne troops stormed Hamminkeln and secured that town. By 14:00, Colonel Coutts reported to the Divisional Headquarters that the 513th had secured all of its objectives, having knocked out two tanks and destroyed two complete regiments of artillery during its assault. During its attempts to secure its objectives, the regiment also gained a third Medal of Honor for the division when Private First Class Stuart S. Stryker posthumously received the award after leading a charge against a German machine gun nest, creating a distraction to allow the rest of his platoon to capture the fortified position the machine gun was situated in.

The third component of the 17th Airborne Division to take part in the operation was the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel James Pierce. The regiment landed accurately in landing zone S, but their gliders and the aircraft that towed them took heavy casualties; twelve C-47 transports were lost due to anti-aircraft fire, and a further one hundred and forty were damaged by the same fire. The regiment landed in the midst of a number of German artillery batteries that were engaging Allied ground forces crossing the Rhine, and as such many of the gliders were engaged by German artillery pieces which had their barrels lowered for direct-fire. However, these artillery batteries and their crews were defeated by the glider-borne troops, and the regiment was soon able to report that its objectives had been secured, having destroyed forty-two artillery pieces, ten tanks, two mobile-flak wagons and five self-propelled guns.

====Aftermath====
Operation Varsity was a successful large-scale airborne operation. All of the objectives that the airborne troops of the 17th had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within only a few hours of the operation&#x27;s beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads along which the Germans might have moved reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. By nightfall of the 24th, the British 15th Infantry Division had joined up with elements of the British 6th Airborne Division, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By the 27th, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had fourteen divisions on the east bank of the river which had penetrated up to ten miles. The division also gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following Operation Varsity, when Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which had been turned into a fortified position by the Germans. In terms of casualties, the 17th Airborne Division suffered a total of 1,346 casualties in the space of five days, between 24 and 29 March, when Operation Plunder came to an end. After it had participated in Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division continued to advance through Germany as a part of XVIII Airborne Corps, engaging German forces around Wesel, Essen and Münster. When Germany unconditionally surrendered on 7 May 1945, the division was conducting occupation duties in northern Germany.

<text>Western Oregon is a geographical term that is generally taken to mean the part of the U.S. state of Oregon within of the state’s coastal region, on the west side of the crest of the Cascade Range. The term is applied somewhat loosely, however, and is sometimes taken to exclude the southwestern areas of the state, which are often referred to as Southern Oregon. In that case, Western Oregon refers only to the counties west of the Cascades and north of and including Lane County.

Western Oregon, being in area, is about the same size as New England minus Maine. Unlike the climate of Eastern Oregon, which is primarily dry and continental, the climate of Western Oregon is generally a moderate Mediterranean climate.

<doc id="445152" wikidata="Q181665" url="?curid=445152" title="Agostinho Neto">
<text>António Agostinho Neto (17 September 1922 – 10 September 1979) was an Angolan communist politician and poet. He served as the first president of Angola from 1975 to 1979, having led the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the war for independence (1961–1974). Until his death, he led the MPLA in the civil war (1975–2002). Known also for his literary activities, he is considered Angola&#x27;s preeminent poet. His birthday is celebrated as National Heroes&#x27; Day, a public holiday in Angola.

==Early life==
Neto was born at Ícolo e Bengo, in Bengo Province, Angola, in 1922. Neto attended high school in the capital city, Luanda; his parents were both school teachers and Methodists; his father, also called Agostinho Neto, was a Methodist pastor. After secondary school he worked in the colonial health services, before going on to university. The younger Neto left Angola for Portugal, and studied medicine at the universities of Coimbra and Lisbon. He combined his academic life with covert political activity of a revolutionary sort; and PIDE, the security police force of the Estado Novo regime headed by Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, arrested him in 1951 for three months for his separatist activism. He was arrested again in 1952 for joining the Portuguese Movement for Democratic Youth Unity. He was arrested again in 1955 and held until 1957. He finished his studies, marrying a 23-year-old Portuguese woman who was born in Trás-os-Montes, Maria Eugénia da Silva, the same day he graduated. He returned to Angola in 1959, was arrested again in 1960, and escaped to assume leadership of the armed struggle against colonial rule. When Angola gained independence in 1975 he became president and held the position until his death in 1979.

==Political career==
In December 1956, the Angolan Communist Party (PCA) merged with the Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUAA) to form the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola with Viriato da Cruz, the President of the PCA, as Secretary General and Neto as president.

The Portuguese authorities in Angola arrested Neto on 8 June 1960. His patients and supporters marched for his release from Bengo to Catete, but were stopped when Portuguese soldiers shot at them, killing 30 and wounding 200 in what became known as the Massacre of Ícolo e Bengo. At first Portugal&#x27;s government exiled Neto to Cape Verde. Then, once more, he was sent to jail in Lisbon. After international protests were made to Salazar&#x27;s administration urging Neto&#x27;s release, Neto was freed from prison and put under house arrest. From this he escaped, going first to Morocco and then to Congo-Léopoldville.

In 1962, Neto visited Washington, D.C., and asked the Kennedy administration for aid in his war against Portugal. The U.S. government turned him down, because it had oil interests in colonial Angola, choosing instead to support Holden Roberto&#x27;s comparatively anti-Communist National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA).

Neto met Che Guevara in 1965 and began receiving support from Cuba. He visited Havana many times, and he and Fidel Castro shared similar ideological views.
In February 1973 Neto and MPLA visited Romania to meet with President Nicolae Ceaușescu on a four day official trip between the 12-16th of February, to discuss political matters in Africa. On the 17th of February Neto visited Bulgaria along with Lucio Lara, Ruth Neto and other party officials where he would also seek support from the Bulgarian authorities, as well meeting with some of the MPLA students in Bulgaria amongst them was also Dino Matrosse - who later would become the MPLA General Secretary. The MPLA delegation will then continue with their official trip to Yugoslavia on the 18-22nd of February to meet with President Josip Broz Tito. Agostinho Neto spends most of his time in 1973 in Europe, where he visits Oslo, in Norway, and on the 2nd of July he is in Geneva. The same year on the 15-16th of July 1973 Tito and Ceausescu meet in Yugoslavia to discuss the situation in Angola, whilst the leader of MPLA attended the 17-19th of July 1973 for the Bulgarian Communist Party Plenum Committee, joined by his sister Ruth Neto and Dino Matrosse, who was studying engineering in Bulgaria. 

Following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal during April 1974 (which deposed Salazar&#x27;s successor Marcelo Caetano), three political factions vied for Angolan power. One of the three was the MPLA, to which Neto belonged. On 11 November 1975, Angola achieved full independence from the Portuguese, and Neto became the nation&#x27;s ruler after the MPLA seized Luanda at the expense of the other anti-colonial movements. He established a one-party state and his government developed close links with the Soviet Union and other nations in the Eastern Bloc and other Communist states, particularly Cuba, which aided the MPLA considerably in its war with the FNLA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and South Africa. Neto made the MPLA declare Marxism-Leninism its official doctrine. As a consequence, he violently repressed a movement later called Fractionism which in 1977 attempted a coup d&#x27;état inspired by the Organização dos Comunistas de Angola. In December 1977 at their first congress, they changed their name to MPLA-PT (MPLA Partido do Trabalho) officially adopting the Marxist-Leninist ideology, requested by Nito Alves. Tens of thousands of followers (or alleged followers) of Nito Alves were executed in the aftermath of the attempted coup, over a period that lasted up to two years, although Agostinho Neto only ratified the death sentence of Nito Alves. After corresponding with several relatives of the disappeared, Neto decided to dissolve the Directorate of Information and Security for the &quot;excesses&quot; they had committed.

According to his sons, President Neto never assigned business or privileges to them, suggesting that despite a controversial presidency he never forgot his humble origins.

==Literary career==

Agostinho Neto&#x27;s poetic works were written chiefly between 1946 and 1960, largely in Portugal. He published three books of poetry during his lifetime. Several of his poems became national anthems. Poems included collections like &quot;Sacred Hope&quot;, which was published in 1974 (Titled Dry Eyes in the Portuguese Version). Also, he was the first member voted into the Anglo Writers Union and The Center for African Studies in Lisbon. He was later awarded the Lotus Prize presented by the Conference of Afro-Asian Writers&#x27;

==Death==

Agostinho Neto died on Monday, 10 September 1979 in Moscow after travelling to the Soviet Union to undergo surgery for cancer and hepatitis. He was a week shy of his 57th birthday at the time of his death. Neto had a long battle with pancreatic cancer, as well as chronic hepatitis that ultimately took his life. Neto had been to the Soviet Union multiple times for treatment because of the high level of medical professionals there. Few people knew about his failing health because he and his colleagues thought it was better to hide this information, as to not show weakness.

==Legacy==
The Soviet Union awarded Neto the Lenin Peace Prize for 1975–76.

The public university of Luanda, the Agostinho Neto University, is named after him. A poem by Chinua Achebe entitled &quot;Agostinho Neto&quot; was written in his honour. An airport in Santo Antão, Cape Verde, is named after him, due to the beloved work he performed there as a doctor. For the same reason, the main hospital of Cape Verde in the capital Praia is named &quot;Hospital Agostinho Neto&quot; (HAN). There is also a morna dedicated to him. A street in New Belgrade in Serbia is named after him, the Dr Agostina Neta street.
A street in Ghana (Agostinho Neto Road), which can be found in Airport City in the capital, is named after him.

On the 17-19th of July 1973 was held The Congress The July Plenum in Sofia organised by the Bulgarian Communist Party leader Todor Zhivkov, and also attended by Dr.Neto who at the time stayed in Hotel Rila. During that period he had a brief relationship with Bulgarian woman with whom he had met earlier in the same year on the 17th of February and they had a daughter Mihaela. A DNA test performed in 2013 concluded with 95% confidence that she is Neto&#x27;s daughter.

<doc id="445155" wikidata="Q967509" url="?curid=445155" title="Ted Fujita">
<text>was a Japanese and American meteorologist whose research primarily focused on severe weather. His research at the University of Chicago on severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoons revolutionized the knowledge of each. Although he is best known for creating the Fujita scale of tornado intensity and damage, he also discovered downbursts and microbursts and was an instrumental figure in advancing modern understanding of many severe weather phenomena and how they affect people and communities, especially through his work exploring the relationship between wind speed and damage.

==Biography==
Fujita was born in the village of Sone, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, an area that is now part of the city of Kitakyushu. He studied and taught at Meiji Vocational College, known after 1949 as Kyushu Institute of Technology. In 1953 he was invited to the University of Chicago by Horace R. Byers, who had become interested in Fujita&#x27;s research, particularly his independent discovery of the cold air downdraft. Fujita remained at the University of Chicago until his retirement in 1990.

==World War II==
Fujita was residing in Kokura during World War II. Kokura was the primary target for the &quot;Fat Man&quot; plutonium bomb, but on the morning of August 9, 1945, the city was obscured by clouds and smoke from the neighboring city of Yahata, which had been . As a result, the bomb was dropped on the secondary target, Nagasaki. Studying the damage caused by the nuclear explosions contributed to Fujita&#x27;s understanding of downbursts and microbursts as &quot;starbursts&quot; of wind hitting the Earth&#x27;s surface and spreading out.

==Career==

Fujita is recognized as the discoverer of downbursts and microbursts and also developed the Fujita scale, which differentiates tornado intensity and links tornado damage with wind speed.

Fujita&#x27;s best-known contributions were in tornado research; he was often called &quot;Mr. Tornado&quot; by his associates and by the media. In addition to developing the Fujita scale, Fujita was a pioneer in the development of tornado overflight and damage survey techniques, which he used to study and map the paths of the tornado that hit Lubbock, Texas on May 11, 1970. He established the value of photometric analysis of tornado pictures and films to establish wind speeds at various heights at the surface of tornado vortices. Fujita was also the first to widely study the meteorological phenomenon of the downburst, which can pose serious danger to aircraft. As a result of his work, in particular on Project NIMROD, pilot training worldwide routinely uses techniques he pioneered to provide instruction to students.

Fujita was also largely involved in developing the concept of multiple vortex tornadoes, which feature multiple small funnels (suction vortices) rotating within a larger parent cloud. His work established that, far from being rare events as was previously believed, most powerful tornadoes were composed of multiple vortices. He also advanced the concept of mini-swirls in intensifying tropical cyclones. Ted Fujita also published a model to relate pressure and wind in tropical cyclones. He was notable as he was the first to modify the exponent in the most common template.

Ted Fujita died in his Chicago home on November 19, 1998. The American Meteorological Society (AMS) held the &quot;Symposium on The Mystery of Severe Storms: A Tribute to the Work of T. Theodore Fujita&quot; during its 80th Annual Meeting in January 2000. &quot;Storm Track&quot; magazine released a special November 1998 issue, &quot;A Tribute To Dr. Ted Fujita&quot; and &quot;Weatherwise&quot; published &quot;Mr. Tornado: The life and career of Ted Fujita&quot; as an article in its May/June 1999 issue. He was the subject of &quot;Mr. Tornado&quot;, a documentary film that originally aired on the PBS series &quot;American Experience&quot; on May 19, 2020.

<doc id="445158" wikidata="Q320466" url="?curid=445158" title="White Star Line">
<text>The White Star Line was a British shipping line. Founded out of the remains of a defunct packet company, it gradually grew to become one of the most prominent shipping companies in the world, providing passenger and cargo services between the British Empire and the United States. While many other shipping lines focused primarily on speed, White Star branded their services by focusing more on providing comfortable passages for both upper class travellers and immigrants.

Today, White Star is remembered for its innovative vessel and for the losses of some of its best passenger liners, including the wrecking of in 1873, the sinking of in 1909, the loss of in 1912, and the wartime sinking of in 1916. Despite its casualties, the company retained a prominent hold on shipping markets around the globe before falling into decline during the Great Depression. White Star merged in 1934 with its chief rival, the Cunard Line, operating as Cunard-White Star Line until Cunard purchased White Star&#x27;s share in the joint company in 1950. Cunard then operated as a single company until 2005 and is now part of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. As a lasting reminder of the White Star Line, modern Cunard ships use the term &quot;White Star Service&quot; to describe the level of customer service expected of the company.

== Early history (1845–1868) ==

The first company bearing the name &quot;White Star Line&quot; was founded in Liverpool, England, by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson in 1845. It focused on the UK–Australia trade, which increased following the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851. Because of this, many wished to emigrate to Australia, and the population of Australia increased from 430,000 to 1.7 million inhabitants in three years. From this time on, Pilkington and Wilson emphasized the safety of their ships when addressing the press. In order to make the crossings more pleasant aboard these austere wooden sailboats, musician groups were hired to allow the passengers to dance to popular tunes. In this trade, speed and size became important assets. The fleet initially consisted of the chartered sailing ships , , &quot;White Star&quot;, , &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;Ben Nevis&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot;. &quot;Tayleur&quot;, the largest ship of its day, was the one on which high hope was placed. These hopes were quickly dashed. Departing on its maiden voyage on 19 January 1854, &quot;Tayleur&quot; proved difficult to handle, and its crew was inexperienced. When it struck rocks in very rough seas at Lambay Island, near Ireland, the ship sank, with only 290 of the 650 people on board surviving. Subsequent inquiry placed the blame on its owners, Charles Moore &amp; Co., who did not take the necessary safety precautions when the ship was put into service. This exonerated the White Star Line and the ship&#x27;s captain of any blame.

In order to compensate for the loss of &quot;Tayleur&quot;, the company ordered several clippers of its own, the first of which was &quot;Red Jacket&quot;. The ship proved to be sufficiently efficient on the Australian route to ensure a certain success for the company, which could thus own new, faster ships such as &quot;Shalimar&quot;, &quot;Sultana&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;White Star&quot;. In addition, the company also ran voyages from Liverpool to Victoria, British Columbia, which it promoted in Welsh newspapers as being the gateway to the Klondike Gold Rush. One of the ships on this route was &quot;Silistria&quot;. Travelling around Cape Horn and stopping in Valparaiso and San Francisco, she reached Victoria after a voyage lasting four months.

In 1856, however, the company lost postal contracts, while Wilson persisted in wanting ever larger ships to keep the public&#x27;s attention. Pilkington, becoming disillusioned, then left the company. Wilson replaced him with his brother-in-law, James Chambers, and the company continued its activities, betting everything on sailing ships while its most direct rivals, the Black Ball Line and the Eagle Line merged in 1858 after the difficulties engendered by the establishment of their service using steamships. During these years, Wilson paid attention to migration flows, directing his services to Canada or New Zealand according to trends. In 1863, the company acquired its first steamship, &quot;Royal Standard&quot;.

The original White Star Line merged with two other small lines in 1864, its competitors the Black Ball Line and the Eagle Line, to form a conglomerate: the Liverpool, Melbourne and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited. Meanwhile, under Wilson&#x27;s leadership, the company continued to borrow large amounts of money to finance new construction, including its second steamer, &quot;Sirius&quot;. Worried, Chambers left the company and was replaced by John Cunningham, but business did not improve. &quot;Sirius&quot; had to be sold before it could enter service. The merger did not prosper and White Star broke away to concentrate on Liverpool to New York City services. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company&#x27;s bank, the Royal Bank of Liverpool, failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an incredible debt of £527,000 (approximately ), and was forced into bankruptcy.

=== The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company ===

On 18 January 1868, Thomas Ismay, a director of the National Line, purchased the house flag, trade name and goodwill of the bankrupt company for £1,000 (approximately ), with the intention of operating large steamships on the North Atlantic service between Liverpool and New York. Ismay established the company&#x27;s headquarters at Albion House, Liverpool. Ismay was approached by Gustav Christian Schwabe, a prominent Liverpool merchant, and his nephew, the shipbuilder Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, during a game of billiards. Schwabe offered to finance the new line if Ismay had his ships built by Wolff&#x27;s company, Harland and Wolff. Ismay agreed, and a partnership with Harland and Wolff was established. The shipbuilders received their first orders on 30 July 1869. The agreement was that Harland and Wolff would build the ships at cost plus a fixed percentage and would not build any ships for White Star&#x27;s rivals. In 1870, William Imrie joined the company.

As the first ship was being ordered, Ismay formed the White Star Line, with a capital of £400,000, divided into shares of £1,000. The company was managed by a new firm: Ismay, Imrie and Company. Despite this complex organization, the shipping company was known publicly throughout its existence as the White Star Line. A debate reigned as to which route Ismay expected to compete on when the company was launched. In 1870, four companies were firmly established on the route between Liverpool and New York: the Cunard Line, the Guion Line, the Inman Line and the more modest National Line, in which Ismay once had shares. The characteristics of the ships ordered from Harland and Wolff, however, hinted that Ismay aimed at the North Atlantic from the outset.

== First transatlantic services (1868–1874) ==
=== The &quot;Oceanic&quot; class ===


White Star began its North Atlantic run between Liverpool and New York with six nearly identical ships, known as the &quot;Oceanic&quot; class: , , and , followed by the slightly larger and . It had long been customary for many shipping lines to have a common theme for the names of their ships, and White Star gave their ships names ending in &quot;-ic&quot;. The line also adopted a buff-coloured funnel with a black top as a distinguishing feature for their ships, as well as a distinctive house flag, a red broad pennant with a swallowtail bearing a white five-pointed star. In the initial designs for this first fleet of liners, each ship was to measure in length, in width and approximately , equipped with compound expansion engines powering a single screw, and capable of speeds of up to . They were also identical in passenger accommodations based on a two-class system, providing accommodations for 166 first class passengers amidships, which at the time was commonly referred to as &#x27;Saloon Class&#x27; and 1,000 steerage passengers.

It was within the circles of the massive tides of immigrants flowing from Europe to North America that the White Star Line aimed to be revered by, as throughout the company&#x27;s full history they regularly strived to provide passage for steerage passengers which greatly exceeded that seen with other shipping lines. With the &quot;Oceanic&quot; class, one of the most notable developments in steerage accommodations was the division of steerage at opposite ends of the vessels, with single men being berthed forward, and single women and families berthed aft, with later developments allowing married couples berths aft as well.

White Star&#x27;s entry into the trans-Atlantic passenger market in the spring of 1871 got off to a rocky start. When &quot;Oceanic&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage on 2 March, she departed Liverpool with only 64 passengers aboard, from whence she was expected to make port at Queenstown the following day to pick up more passengers before proceeding to New York. However, before she had cleared the Welsh coast her bearings overheated off Holyhead and she was forced to return for repairs. She resumed her crossing on 17 March and ended up not completing the crossing to New York until 28 March. However, upon her arrival in New York, she drew considerable attention, as by the time she departed on her return crossing to Liverpool on 15 April, some 50,000 spectators had looked her over. White Star&#x27;s troubles with their first ship were short lived and &quot;Oceanic&quot;″s second crossing to New York was more successful. She departed Liverpool on 11 May and arrived in New York on 23 May with 407 passengers aboard.

In the eighteen months that followed, the five remaining ships were completed, and one by one, joined her on the North Atlantic run. &quot;Atlantic&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 8 June without incident. However, later that summer another problem surfaced which posed a threat to public opinion of the company. Of the six ships, the names originally selected for the third and sixth ships of the class had initially been &quot;Pacific&quot; and &quot;Arctic&quot;, which when mentioned in the press appeared alongside references to two ships of the same names which had belonged to the now defunct Collins Line, both of which were lost at sea with large losses of life. In the cases of those ships, both of which had been wooden-hulled paddle steamers, had foundered off the coast of Newfoundland in September 1854 after colliding with another ship, resulting in the loss of over 300 lives, while vanished with 186 people on board in January 1856. As a result, White Star made arrangements to change the names of these two ships. The third ship, which had been launched as &quot;Pacific&quot; on 8 March 1871 was renamed &quot;Baltic&quot; prior to its completion and the keel of the sixth vessel, which had just been laid down at Harland &amp; Wolff and dubbed &quot;Arctic&quot;, was renamed &quot;Celtic&quot; prior to her launch.

The fourth vessel of the &quot;Oceanic&quot; class, &quot;Republic&quot;, sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 February 1872, around which time modifications were being made to the last two ships still under construction. Alterations in their designs called for their hulls to be extended in length by , which also increased their tonnage. &quot;Adriatic&quot; entered service on 11 April 1872, followed by &quot;Celtic&quot; six months later on 24 October. These ships began their careers with notable success. &quot;Adriatic&quot;, after barely a month in service, became the first White Star ship to capture the Blue Riband, having completed a record westbound crossing in 7 days, 23 hours and 17 minutes at an average speed of . In January 1873, &quot;Baltic&quot; became the first of the line to capture the Blue Riband for an eastbound crossing, having completed a return trip to Liverpool in 7 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of .

=== Hesitation and disaster ===

The company did not focus only on the North Atlantic. In 1871, it purchased two ships while they were under construction, and . They were initially placed on the route to India via the Suez Canal, but this route proved to be unprofitable. Once the six &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class ships were in service, and five sufficient for a weekly service, Ismay decided to move &quot;Republic&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Asiatic&quot;, &quot;Tropic&quot; and two recently purchased liners, and , onto the route to South America, in order to compete with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company. Although &quot;Republic&quot; was successful in her only crossing on this route, she was quickly withdrawn, and her fellow liners gradually suffered the same fate. The route remained however, serviced by the company&#x27;s sailboats, whose management returned to William Imrie, and was quickly dedicated to a separate company, the North Western Shipping Company.

The first substantial loss for the company came only four years after its founding, with the sinking of the and the loss of 535 lives near Halifax, Nova Scotia on 31 March 1873. While en route to New York from Liverpool amidst a vicious storm, &quot;Atlantic&quot; attempted to make port at Halifax when a concern arose that the ship would run out of coal before reaching New York. However, when attempting to enter Halifax, she ran aground on the rocks and sank in shallow waters. Despite being so close to shore, a majority of those onboard drowned, with 585 of the 952 onboard perishing. White Star found itself being accused of not having supplied enough coal to the ship, while the captain was sanctioned for having acted in an irresponsible manner. The crew were blamed for serious navigational errors by the Canadian Inquiry, although a British Board of Trade investigation cleared the company of all extreme wrongdoing. Although &quot;Atlantic&quot; was quickly erased from the advertisements of the White Star Line, she was not forgotten. With a personal contribution from Ismay, the company financed the maintenance of the graves of the victims and, in 1915, it contributed to the construction of a monument dedicated to the victims. In order to preserve the financial health of the company, &quot;Asiatic&quot; and &quot;Tropic&quot; were immediately sold.

== Records and diversification (1874–1899) ==

In the wake of the &quot;Atlantic&quot; disaster, the White Star Line continued to expand its fleet. &quot;Gaelic&quot; and &quot;Belgic&quot; joined the five &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class liners, and the company&#x27;s success continued to grow. However, rival companies quickly caught up: Cunard placed &quot;Botnia&quot; and &quot;Scythia&quot; into service, while the Inman Line ordered and &quot;Montana&quot; and &quot;Dakota&quot; entered service with the Guion Line. All were built in response to White Star&#x27;s ground breaking liners and were thus larger.

In response, White Star ordered two new steamers from Harland &amp; Wolff, both of which were designed as considerably larger, two-funnelled versions of the &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class steamers. These two ships measured in length and in width, with a gross tonnage of roughly 5,000 tons and with engines of similar design as seen in the earlier ships, with the exception of greater horsepower, capable of driving their single screws at speeds of up to . Passenger capacity was also increased, with the two vessels able to carry 200 saloon passengers and 1,500 steerage passengers. The first of the pair, which had initially been named &quot;Hellenic&quot;, was launched as on 3 February 1874 and departed on her maiden voyage to New York on 25 June. Her sister was launched on 15 July 1874, but due to complications in her construction, she did not enter service until 20 May 1875. With the introduction of these new ships, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was declared surplus and, in the spring of 1875, was chartered to one of White Star&#x27;s subsidiaries, the Occidental &amp; Oriental Shipping company, under which she operated their trans-Pacific route between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong until her retirement in 1895. The two new steamers proved immensely popular on the North Atlantic run, and both would end up capturing the Blue Riband on two eastbound and three westbound crossings within a two-year period. &quot;Germanic&quot; captured the westbound record in August 1875, then captured the eastbound record in February 1876, while &quot;Britannic&quot; captured both records within less than two months of each other, beating the westbound record in November and the eastbound record in December. &quot;Germanic&quot; captured the westbound record for the last time in April 1877. During that same year, the company began sharing a postal agreement with the Cunard Line, allowing its ships&#x27; names to be prefixed with &#x27;RMS&#x27; (&#x27;Royal Mail Ship&#x27;).

=== Pacific and Indian Oceans ===
The arrival of the two new liners created a surplus of ships on the North Atlantic route for the White Star Line. At the same time, George Bradbury, president of the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, a company formed in 1874 to compete with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, enlisted the help of Thomas Ismay in setting up his new service. The White Star Line responded by lending the new company &quot;Oceanic&quot;, which had become a surplus ship, as well as &quot;Gaelic&quot; and &quot;Belgic&quot;. This charter initiative proved profitable, with &quot;Oceanic&quot; remaining on the San Francisco – Hong Kong route for twenty years. New ships were gradually assigned to this contract in the 1880s, such as in 1881, and the new and in 1885. The partnership continued until 1906, when White Star withdrew from the Pacific route. The Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company disappeared two years later in the face of competition from the new ships of the Pacific Mail Company.

In 1882, the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line was founded, and it decided to open a route to New Zealand, but lacked experience. The White Star Line therefore proposed to provide a joint service, which started in 1884 with &quot;Coptic&quot;, , and supplied by White Star, with Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion providing &quot;Arawa&quot; and &quot;Tainui&quot;. The ships called at Australia on the outward journey, and through the Panama Canal on the return trip. From 1902, more ships were added to this joint service: , and the second , which were operated until the 1930s. The link between the two companies persisted even after the disappearance of the White Star Line, with the Shaw Savill &amp; Albion Line continuing to use White Star&#x27;s nomenclature and giving its ships names ending in &quot;-ic&quot;.

The diversification of the company&#x27;s activities also required an update of its equipment. While the sailing ships gradually disappeared, the company acquired a new type of cargo ship, intended for the transport of live cattle. The first of these was , which entered service in 1888, followed a year later by &quot;Runic&quot;. Others, notably the sister ships and , followed in the 1890s. The latter became famous when, less than a year after her maiden voyage, she mysteriously disappeared with everyone aboard. Two other cattle carriers, and , were built in 1894 and 1895 respectively, before the company abandoned this type of business.

=== &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; ===

Over the next 12 years, White Star focused their attention on other matters of business, expanding their services with the introduction of several cargo and livestock carriers on the North Atlantic as well as establishing a small but lucrative passenger and cargo service to New Zealand. By 1887 however, &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot; and the four remaining &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class liners had aged significantly and were now being outpaced in speed and comfort by newer ships brought into service by White Star&#x27;s competitors, in particular and . In an effort to outdo their competitors, White Star began making plans to put two new liners into service which would prove to be exceptionally innovative in design for the time, and . In order to build these new ships, Thomas Ismay made arrangements with the British Government under which in exchange for financial support from the British government, the two new ships would be designed not only as passenger liners, but also as armed merchant cruisers which could be requisitioned by the Royal Navy in times of war. Measuring in length and in width and with a gross tonnage of just under 10,000 tons, the new liners would be nearly twice the size of &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot;. Additionally, owing to the arrangement with the British Government, Teutonic and Majestic were the first White Star liners to be built with twin screws, powered by triple expansion engines capable of driving the ships at speeds of up to .

&quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; were designed with accommodations for 1,490 passengers in three classes across four decks, titled &#x27;Promenade&#x27;, &#x27;Upper&#x27;, &#x27;Saloon&#x27; and &#x27;Main&#x27;; with 300 in First Class, 190 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. Accommodations for passengers were based on the level of comfort on these sections of a ship. Those closer to the center axis of motion on a vessel felt little to no discomfort in rough seas. However those located near the bow and stern would experience every swell, wave and motion in addition to the noise of the engines in steerage. First Class accommodations were located amidships on all four decks, with Second Class located abaft of first on the three uppermost decks on &quot;Teutonic&quot; and all four decks on &quot;Majestic&quot;, with Third Class located at the far forward and aft ends of the vessel on the Saloon and Main decks.

One notable development associated with the introduction of these two new ships was that they were the first White Star liners to incorporate the three-class passenger system. Prior to this, White Star had made small attempts to enter the market for Second Class passengers on the North Atlantic by adding limited spaces for Second Class passengers on their older liners. Spaces for Second Class were added to &quot;Adriatic&quot; in 1884, &quot;Celtic&quot; in 1887 and &quot;Republic&quot; in 1888, often occupying one or two compartments formerly occupied by steerage berths.

In March 1887, the first keel plates of &quot;Teutonic&quot; were laid at Harland &amp; Wolff, while construction on &quot;Majestic&quot; commenced the following September. Construction on the two liners progressed in roughly six-month intervals, with &quot;Teutonic&quot; being launched in January 1889 and sailing on her maiden voyage to New York the following August; while &quot;Majestic&quot; was launched in June 1889 and entered service in April 1890. Prior to her entry into service, &quot;Teutonic&quot; made a rather noteworthy appearance at the 1889 Naval Review at Spithead. Although she could not take part in the actual review due to scheduling commitments, she briefly anchored amidst a line of merchant ships awaiting review, complete with four guns mounted, during which time she was toured by the Prince of Wales and Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser, impressed by what he saw, is rumored to have mentioned to others in his party that &quot;We must have one of these!&quot;. They would be White Star&#x27;s last speed record breakers, as both ships would capture the Blue Riband in the summer of 1891 within two weeks of each other. &quot;Majestic&quot; beat the westbound record on 5 August 1891, arriving in New York in 5 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes after keeping an average speed of . This record was beaten by &quot;Teutonic&quot;, which arrived in New York on 19 August and beat the previous record by 1 hour and 37 minutes, maintaining an average speed of .

With the introduction of &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, White Star disposed of some of their aging ships to make room for the new ships. Prior to the completion of the two new ships, &quot;Baltic&quot; and &quot;Republic&quot; were both sold to the Holland America Line and respectively renamed &quot;Veendam&quot; and &quot;Maasdam&quot;, after which they were put into service on the company&#x27;s main trans-Atlantic route between Rotterdam and New York. &quot;Veendam&quot; was lost at sea without loss of life after striking a submerged object in 1898, while &quot;Maasdam&quot; was again sold in 1902 to La Veloce Navigazione Italiana and renamed &quot;Citta di Napoli&quot;, after which she was used as an emigrant ship for an additional eight years before being sold for scrap at Genoa in 1910. In 1893, by which time &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; had established themselves on the North Atlantic run, White Star sold &quot;Celtic&quot; to the Danish Thingvalla Line, who renamed her &quot;Amerika&quot; and attempted to use her for their own emigrant service from Copenhagen to New York. This, however, failed to prove profitable for the line and she was sold for scrap at Brest in 1898.

=== &quot;Cymric&quot; and the move from speed to comfort ===

Beginning in the late 1890s, White Star experienced an explosion of rapid growth and expansion of its services, highlighted by a dramatic shift in focus from building the fastest ships on the North Atlantic to building the most comfortable and luxurious. Their first step in this direction came in 1897 during the construction of a new ship, . Initially designed as an enlarged version of the livestock carrier , which had entered service in 1895, &quot;Cymric&quot; had been planned as a combination passenger and livestock carrier, and thus was not designed with engines necessary to qualify her for the express service maintained by &quot;Britannic&quot;, &quot;Germanic&quot;, &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;. However, while she was under construction at Harland &amp; Wolff, a decision was made to convert spaces aboard her designated for cattle into Third Class accommodations after it was deemed that carrying passengers and livestock aboard the same vessel would likely not prove a popular venture. Therefore, in addition to the accommodations planned for 258 First Class passengers, her designs were altered to include berthing for 1,160 Third Class passengers.

&quot;Cymric&quot; was an example of a new type of ocean liners that focused on a more luxurious experience. A typical ocean liner during this era was a microcosmic city. Inhabitants hailed from all levels and areas of various social spectra. Regardless of class or wealth, each passenger received the same core service: passage to the destination. Overall, her modest layout and design placed her between the elderly but well reputable &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot; and the more modern &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;. Measuring just over 13,000 tons and with a length of and a beam of , she was to be the largest liner in the White Star fleet. Additionally, her more utilitarian appearance with a single funnel and four masts contrasted against her four running mates considerably. Due to this design, she was considered the first of White Star&#x27;s &#x27;intermediate&#x27; liners. However, as a result of this partial transition from livestock carrier to passenger liner, &quot;Cymric&quot; came to attain several noteworthy advantages which White Star would employ on several other liners. While her passenger accommodations had been modified, the specifications of her machinery and engines were left in place. Like &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Cymric&quot; was fitted with twin screws, but was instead powered by quadruple expansion engines capable of achieving a modest speed of commonly seen in cargo and livestock carriers of that time. The major difference was that because these engines were designed for more modest speeds, they were considerably smaller and required only seven boilers, leaving more space within the hull for passenger and crew accommodations. At the same time, this also meant she consumed much less coal than steamers designed with larger engines, making her more economical. &quot;Cymric&quot; was launched at Harland &amp; Wolff in October 1897 and entered service in February 1898, and in time proved a popular and profitable addition to the fleet.

=== &quot;Oceanic&quot; and the death of Thomas Ismay ===

In the early months of 1897, while &quot;Cymric&quot; was still under construction at Harland &amp; Wolff, it became clear to Thomas Ismay and other company officials that a new addition to the North Atlantic fleet was needed, as White Star&#x27;s fleet was starting to lag behind those of their competitors, such as Cunard and Norddeutscher Lloyd. By this point, the only remaining ship of the original &quot;Oceanic&quot; class of liners was &quot;Adriatic&quot;, which had been in service for 25 years and was starting to show her age. &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot; were equally outdated, and with advancements in shipbuilding during the 1890s, &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; had been eclipsed by several newer vessels, most recently by Norddeutscher Lloyd&#x27;s . In response, Ismay and his partners at Harland &amp; Wolff set out to design two new liners for the North Atlantic run which would, in a fashion similar to how &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; had done, go down in shipbuilding history.

The new steamers, which were intended to be named and &quot;Olympic&quot;, were designed to be both the largest and most luxurious the world had ever seen. In March 1897, the first keel plates for &quot;Oceanic&quot; were laid at Harland &amp; Wolff, but almost immediately problems arose. Due to the fact that a vessel of this size had never been built, work on the ship was delayed until an overhead gantry crane could be built. Her launch on 14 January 1899 drew an immense crowd of spectators numbering more than 50,000, as &quot;Oceanic&quot; would be the last British transatlantic liner to be launched in the 19th century, as well as the first to exceed the &quot;Great Eastern&quot; in length. She measured in length, with a beam of and had a gross register tonnage of 17,254, making her a full 42% larger than Norddeutscher Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse&quot;. Like &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was designed with capabilities to be converted to an armed merchant cruiser in time of war if needed, specifications for which caused her to be built with a double-plated hull and turrets on her upper decks which could be quickly mounted with guns. She was also built with triple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of achieving a respectable, if not record breaking, service speed of . Additionally, she had a considerably larger passenger capacity of just over 1,700, providing for 410 First Class, 300 Second Class and 1,000 Third Class passengers.

&quot;Oceanic&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 6 September 1899, arriving in New York to much fanfare on the morning of 13 September with 1,456 passengers aboard, many of whom were satisfied with how the crossing had gone. Among those travelling aboard in First Class were Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s managing director, Lord Pirrie, and Thomas Andrews, who had designed &quot;Oceanic&quot; under Thomas Ismay&#x27;s direction. At the same time &quot;Oceanic&quot; had departed from Liverpool, a fireman&#x27;s strike had been ensuing at the docks, which in turn meant she sailed with a boiler room crew consisting of fewer men than her specifications called for. Thus, during her maiden voyage, she maintained an average speed of just under .

Thomas Ismay was unable to enjoy the fruits of his labour. Just a few weeks after &quot;Oceanic&quot; was launched, he began complaining of pains in his chest, from whence his health steadily began to decline. In fact, his health began to deteriorate so rapidly that managers of both White Star and Harland &amp; Wolff decided to cancel plans to construct &quot;Olympic&quot;. The name was shelved, only to be reused 12 years later. His health improved for a brief time, allowing him to visit &quot;Oceanic&quot; upon her completion in Belfast that July. During his visit, Belfast officials awarded him with a key to the city, citing his contributions to the local economy and to British merchant shipping. Unfortunately, in late August he took a turn for the worse and he underwent two operations to alleviate his ailment, both of which proved unsuccessful, and he suffered a heart attack on 14 September. He lingered in worsening agony for another ten weeks until his death on 23 November 1899 at the age of 62. In the immediate aftermath, control of the company was passed to Thomas&#x27; son Bruce, who was named chairman of the line.

== International Mercantile Marine Co. (1899–1914) ==
=== The Boer War and the Big Four ===
With the death of Thomas Ismay, his eldest son, Bruce, took over. He was joined at the helm of Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co. by his friend Harold Sanderson in addition to the members already present, notably the now elderly William Imrie and his brother, James Ismay. The company was quickly involved in the Second Boer War, with several of its ships being requisitioned, starting with the cargo ship in October 1899. Several ships quickly followed, notably &quot;Britannic&quot;, which had become surplus to requirements on the North Atlantic route. A total of ten ships were assisting in the war effort, six of them as part of their regular service. 17,000 men and 4,000 animals were transported to the conflict by White Star ships in just over two years.

Even before &quot;Oceanic&quot; had been completed, White Star had already started making plans for a considerably larger addition to their fleet. In September 1898, before his health began failing, Thomas Ismay negotiated the terms for the orders for the last passenger liner he would ever order for the line he had built. This time, plans were essentially the same as they had been with &quot;Oceanic&quot;, only taking considerably more steps in innovation. While staying with the trend in focusing more on comfort than speed as had been set with &quot;Cymric&quot; and &quot;Oceanic&quot;, Ismay&#x27;s plans called for a new passenger liner of dimensions the world had never seen, and her chosen name was to be , a name taken and reused from the original &quot;Oceanic&quot; class. The initial designs for &quot;Celtic&quot; had her at in length, slightly shorter than &quot;Oceanic&quot;, but with a greater breadth of . Additionally, while &quot;Oceanic&quot; had set the record for length, &quot;Celtic&quot; would triumph in tonnage, measuring just over 20,000 tons.

==== Engines ====
One point of interest about this new ship was in regard to her engines. A comparison was made between the machinery installed aboard &quot;Cymric&quot; and that placed in &quot;Oceanic&quot;. Due to &quot;Cymric&quot; initially being designed as a livestock carrier, she was built with smaller engines capable of modest speeds which both consumed less coal and occupied less space within the hull. As a result, there was an astonishing difference which gave &quot;Cymric&quot; a considerable advantage over &quot;Oceanic&quot;. Although &quot;Cymric&quot; was only about two-thirds of the size of &quot;Oceanic&quot; in terms of gross tonnage (12,552 to 17,274), her net tonnage, a unit of measurement used to account for space aboard a ship usable for passengers and cargo was actually greater than that of the larger vessel (8,123 net tons aboard &quot;Cymric&quot; compared to only 6,996 with the &quot;Oceanic&quot;). Builders and designers used this as a baseline for engine designs for &quot;Celtic&quot;. She was to be equipped with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of modest speeds of just over . As she was geared to lower service speeds, her coal consumption was far less at only 260 tons per day, which compared to the 400 tons per day needed to power &quot;Oceanic&quot;, made her much more economical. At the same time, owing to her broad hull, she was designed with cargo holds capable of storing up to 18,500 tons of commercial cargo, a strategic placement in her design as that cargo was to serve as ballast, keeping her steady in even the roughest seas.

==== Capacities ====

Additionally, &quot;Celtic&quot; was to be designed with far greater capacities for both passengers and cargo. Her plans called for accommodations for a staggering 2,859 passengers: 347 in First Class, 160 in Second Class, and a total of 2,352 in Third Class, the latter being the largest capacity seen on any liner on the North Atlantic at the time. Passenger accommodations were spread across six decks, titled from top to bottom: Boat Deck (A Deck), Upper Promenade (B Deck), Promenade (C Deck), Saloon (D Deck), Upper (E Deck) and Lower (F Deck). First Class accommodations were located amidships on the uppermost four decks and included a lounge and smoke room on the Boat Deck, as well as a grand and spacious dining room on the Saloon Deck. Second Class accommodations were allocated to the starboard sides of the Saloon and Upper Decks. As seen aboard &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot;, and &quot;Oceanic&quot;, Second Class passengers were provided with their own smoke room and library, housed within a separate deckhouse situated just aft of the main superstructure, directly above their dining room on the Saloon deck.

What made &quot;Celtic&quot; rather exceptional was her Third Class accommodations, which in addition to ample open deck space on the Promenade Deck, were located on the Saloon, Upper and Lower Decks at both the forward and aft ends of the vessel, with a vast majority being located aft. The pattern followed that seen on all White Star vessels on the North Atlantic, with single men berthed forward and single women, married couples and families berthed aft. On the Saloon Deck, in addition to baths and lavatories both forward and aft, were two large dining rooms at the far after end of the deck, situated side by side, which when not in use functioned as smoke and general rooms. An additional, fairly larger dining room was located directly beneath these on the Upper Deck, while a fourth dining room was located forward where single men were to be berthed, for which this dining room was equipped with a service bar. Aside from this, the biggest change brought by &quot;Celtic&quot; for Third Class passengers was in sleeping quarters. Open berths were still fairly common on the North Atlantic, which White Star had from the start gradually shied away from. Aboard the &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class liners, &quot;Britannic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot;, steerage passengers had been provided with large rooms which generally slept around 20 people, while aboard &quot;Teutonic&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; the usage of two and four berth cabins had been introduced, but only for married couples and families with children, a policy which also held with &quot;Cymric&quot; and &quot;Oceanic&quot;. &quot;Celtic&quot; broke that mould. At the forward end of the vessel, located in two compartments on the Lower Deck were accommodations of the older style of sleeping arrangements, each compartment providing for 300 single men. The remaining 1,752 berths were located aft, all of which consisted of two, four and six berth cabins.

==== Construction ====

On 22 March 1899, just two months after &quot;Oceanic&quot; was launched, the first keel plates of &quot;Celtic&quot; were laid at Harland &amp; Wolff. Construction progressed rapidly, and as White Star had planned, the new fleet of liners would be constructed in overlapping succession. In October 1900, while &quot;Celtic&quot;″s hull was nearing completion, construction began on the second ship, . When &quot;Celtic&quot; was launched in April 1901, there was much fanfare, as she was the largest ship in the world in terms of tonnage, as well as being the first to exceed the tonnage of the infamous &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. She took a mere four additional months for fitting out before sailing on her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 26 July of that year. Upon her entry into service, one of her most attractive features was her seaworthiness. It was noted that she was &quot;as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.&quot;

Meanwhile, construction on &quot;Cedric&quot; had proceeded as planned and she was launched on 21 August 1902. Although she was of exactly the same dimensions as &quot;Celtic&quot; in length and width, she outweighed her twin by a mere 155 tons, making her the largest ship in the world. Despite their similarities, the two had distinct differences. First Class accommodations aboard &quot;Cedric&quot; included more private bathrooms, as well as more suites consisting of interconnecting cabins provided with sitting rooms. She had accommodations for a total of 2,600 passengers, with a slightly increased number of First Class passengers at 350, her Second Class capacity was increased to 250 and Third Class was scaled back to approximately 2,000. &quot;Cedric&quot; entered service later that winter, departing Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 11 February 1903.

The keel of the third ship, , had been laid down at Harland &amp; Wolff in June 1902, while construction on &quot;Cedric&quot; was still underway. One notable instance in her construction was once her keel was fitted in place, White Star gave orders for her length to be extended by . This change in plans required builders to cut her keel in two to install the added length. The reason for this addition was likely to provide more space for passenger accommodations, which added up to 2,850 passengers. Although &quot;Baltic&quot; was designed with the same layout for Third Class passengers as &quot;Cedric&quot;, with a capacity of 2,000, her First and Second Class capacities were significantly greater. First Class was increased to a capacity of 425 passengers, while capacity for Second Class was extended to 450 passengers, almost twice that of &quot;Cedric&quot; and three times that of &quot;Celtic&quot;. Simultaneously, the added length also increased her gross tonnage to 23,884, making her the largest ship in the world. &quot;Baltic&quot; was launched on 12 November 1903, subsequently fitted out and delivered to White Star on 23 June 1904, sailing on her maiden voyage on 29 June.

While the first three members of the highly regarded quartet of liners were built and put into service with little problem, the fourth and final ship, , experienced a considerable delay in her construction. Initially, her construction had commenced in November 1902 while &quot;Baltic&quot; was still being built, but a series of delays slowed her construction to a snail&#x27;s pace compared to that of her sisters. &quot;Baltic&quot; was launched after roughly 17 months, but by the time &quot;Adriatic&quot; was finally launched in September 1906, she had been under construction for almost 46 months, more than twice the time needed to construct her sisters. Her passenger accommodations followed the same trend as seen with &quot;Baltic&quot;, with added focus on the upper two classes while still maintaining the high standard for Third Class. Her overall passenger capacity was also identical to that of &quot;Baltic&quot; at 2,850, but with differences in capacities for each class, with First Class increased to 450, Second Class increased to 500 and Third Class scaled back to 1,900. Unlike her sisters however, she was unable to attain the title of world&#x27;s largest ship at the time of her completion, as her 24,451 gross register tonnage was just barely outmatched by Hamburg Amerika&#x27;s &quot;Kaiserin Auguste Victoria&quot;, which measured 24,581 tons and entered service four months prior to the launch of &quot;Adriatic&quot;. She would, however, rank briefly as the largest British-built ship until Cunard&#x27;s entered service the following year. She sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 8 May 1907, and not long afterwards gained a considerable reputation for her interiors, enough for the British tabloid &quot;The Bystander&quot; to dub her &#x27;The Liner Luxurious&#x27;. One of her most notable innovations was that she was the first liner to have an onboard Victorian Turkish bath and swimming pool.

=== Integration into the trust of J.P. Morgan ===

As White Star gradually brought the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; into service, they also acquired several smaller &#x27;intermediate&#x27; liners in preparation for a considerable expansion of their passenger services on the North Atlantic. In 1903 alone they came to obtain five new liners, beginning with . Originally laid down as &quot;Minnewaska&quot; for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was transferred to White Star prior to completion and was launched under her new name on 18 December 1902. Similar in size and appearance to &quot;Cymric&quot; with a single funnel and four masts, she measured in length with a beam of , assessed at 15,801 gross register tons with quadruple expansion engines geared to twin screws capable of a service speed of . She was fitted with fairly modest accommodations for 1,400 passengers: 200 in First Class, 200 in Second Class and 1,000 in Third Class. She sailed on her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York on 26 June 1903.

In 1902, White Star Line was bought by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM), owned by the American banker John Pierpont Morgan. He hoped to obtain a monopoly of the North Atlantic route by buying several shipping companies, and by entering into agreements with others such as the German HAPAG and the Norddeutscher Lloyd. The acquisition of the White Star Line was one of its major takeovers. In order to close the deal, Morgan offered the shareholders of the company ten times the value of the profits generated in 1900, which was a very good year for the company. The Ismay family were initially reluctant to accept, knowing that Thomas Ismay would have radically opposed the idea if he were still alive. However, J. Bruce Ismay ultimately agreed with the shareholders. His brother, as well as two of the five other directors of Ismay, Imrie &amp; Company left the company at this time, and Ismay and Harold Sanderson were quickly joined by William James Pirrie, the director of Harland &amp; Wolff. Pirrie and Ismay were also among the thirteen directors of IMM.

Despite the good fortunes of its main subsidiary, the IMM was experiencing great difficulties and was struggling in particular to repay its debts to shipyards. Much effort was needed to get IMM on its feet, efforts that its aging president, Clement Griscom, did not believe he could do. In 1904, it was proposed that Ismay replace him, which he reluctantly accepted on condition of having Morgan&#x27;s full support.

=== Intermediate liners and rapid expansion ===

Meanwhile, as a result of the IMM takeover, White Star obtained four newly completed liners in the last months of 1903, &quot;Columbus&quot;, &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, &quot;New England&quot; and &quot;Mayflower&quot;. These four liners had been owned and operated by the Dominion Line for their services between Liverpool and Boston as well as their Mediterranean cruising and emigrant route, which also connected to Boston. However, the Dominion Line was also absorbed into IMM and the four ships were transferred to White Star. In addition to the acquisition of these ships, White Star also acquired control of the routes as well. Upon their acquisition by White Star, the four liners were respectively renamed , , &quot;Romanic&quot; and . These four ships were greatly similar in appearance to the &quot;Cymric&quot; and &quot;Arabic&quot;, all with a single funnel with two or four masts, with engines geared to twin screws capable of service speeds between . They all also fell within the same range in terms of dimensions, with lengths between , beams between , and similar gross tonnage. There was, however, considerable variances in passenger capacities. &quot;Republic&quot;, which in time would come to obtain the nickname &#x27;The Millionaires&#x27; Ship&#x27;, had the largest capacity with accommodations for 2,400 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 2,000 Third Class). The three remaining ships had considerably smaller capacities, with the &quot;Cretic&quot; designed with accommodations for 1,510 passengers (260 First Class, 250 Second Class, 1,000 Third Class), &quot;Romanic&quot; with accommodations for 1,200 passengers (200 First Class, 200 Second Class, 800 Third Class) and &quot;Canopic&quot; with accommodations for 1,277 passengers (275 First Class, 232 Second Class, 770 Third Class).

Following the conclusion of their service under Dominion Line in late 1903, the four liners were briefly withdrawn from service. Their names were changed, their funnels were repainted into White Star colors, and they were made ready for their new services. &quot;Romanic&quot; was the first to enter service under White Star, sailing for Boston on 19 November, followed by &quot;Cretic&quot; on 26 November. In order to balance the schedule between the Liverpool and Mediterranean services to Boston, &quot;Cymric&quot; was transferred to the Liverpool-Boston route, departing Liverpool for her first trip to Boston on 10 December, while &quot;Republic&quot; entered service to Boston on 17 December. &quot;Canopic&quot; completed the service upon her departure from Liverpool on 14 January 1904. Upon their arrivals in Boston, &quot;Romanic&quot; and &quot;Canopic&quot; were both immediately transferred to the Mediterranean services formerly run by the Dominion Line. This route followed a line which first made port at Sao Miguel in the Azores before passing through the straits of Gibraltar and making port in Naples and Genoa. &quot;Republic&quot; was also put into service on the Mediterranean route following her first crossing to Boston, but only for the first half of the 1904 season, and was switched back to the Liverpool-Boston service until winter, a pattern she would follow for the remainder of her career. &quot;Cretic&quot; remained on the Liverpool-Boston service running opposite &quot;Cymric&quot; for a full year until November 1904, when alongside &quot;Republic&quot; she began sailing on the secondary service to the Mediterranean from New York.

In the early months of 1907, White Star began preparations for another extension of their services on the North Atlantic by establishing an &#x27;express&#x27; service to New York. The new service would depart Southampton every Wednesday, first heading south across the English Channel to the French port of Cherbourg that evening, then sailing back across the channel to Queenstown the following morning before proceeding to New York. On eastbound crossings, ships would forego calling at Queenstown and make port at Plymouth, before proceeding to Cherbourg and Southampton. Due to its proximity to London, Southampton had a clear advantage over Liverpool in reducing travelling time, while by creating a terminal at Cherbourg White Star had established a route which allowed passengers to embark or disembark at either a British or Continental port. Another subsidiary of IMM, the American Line, had moved their operations to Southampton in 1893 and established an express service via Cherbourg which had proved very successful, thus prompting White Star to make a similar move. &quot;Celtic&quot; embarked on two experimental crossings from Southampton to New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown, first on 20 April and then again on 18 May, which proved successful and set the way for the establishment of the route, which was to be maintained by &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Oceanic&quot; and the newly completed &quot;Adriatic&quot;. &quot;Celtic&quot; was returned to the Liverpool service after the second crossing, and her place taken on the new run by &quot;Adriatic&quot;, which sailed from Southampton for the first time on 5 June, followed by &quot;Teutonic&quot; on 12 June, &quot;Oceanic&quot; on 19 June and &quot;Majestic&quot; on 26 June.

=== &quot;Olympic&quot;-class ships ===

White Star moved their express service from Liverpool to Southampton in 1907, providing them with the advantage of a continental stopover in Cherbourg that allowed the vessel to take on more passengers. This service was initially provided by &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Oceanic&quot; and &quot;Adriatic&quot;, the latter being slower but able to carry many more passengers. A ferry, the , was also purchased to help board passengers and luggage during the French stopover. This solution was only temporary, however, and the company was already planning the arrival of much larger and faster vessels in order to establish a regular and more efficient service.

While Harland &amp; Wolff started construction of the new , White Star continued to diversify its activities. Its establishment in Southampton led to a price war between companies, which drastically reduced its third-class fares. It was at this point that the North Atlantic Conference was created to regulate fares and crossings according to demand. In 1909, White Star took over part of the activities of the Dominion Line, another IMM company serving Canada. Two of this company&#x27;s ships, then under construction, were transferred to White Star and became and , bringing the company into the Canadian route. These two ships also served as a testing ground for the propulsion method of the &quot;Olympic&quot;-class liners.

When she entered service in June 1911, was an immediate and highly satisfactory success, with White Star ordering a third ship, . The initial success was quickly disrupted. On 20 September 1911, &quot;Olympic&quot; was damaged following a collision with the cruiser , which led to her return to the shipyard for lengthy repairs and the postponement of the entry into service of &quot;Titanic&quot;.

&quot;Titanic&quot; eventually entered service in April 1912, but her career would be short-lived. She was lost after striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage, leading to the deaths of around 1,500 people. The impact on public opinion was considerable.

The sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; caused a small loss of confidence in large liners, which had to be equipped with additional lifeboats. &quot;Olympic&quot; suffered a mutiny shortly after the sinking, when some of her stokers expressed concern about the seaworthiness of her hastily installed collapsible lifeboats and refused to work. The ship was withdrawn from service in October 1912 and was extensively refitted to improve her safety in light of &quot;Titanic&quot;′s sinking. She returned to service in March 1913. Construction of &quot;Britannic&quot; was postponed in order to allow the lessons learned from the sinking of her sister to be implemented into her design.

== War and reparations (1914–1926) ==
=== World War I ===
When World War I broke out, the White Star fleet became involved in the war. At the time, it controlled 35 ships, and all served in the war effort, either by being directly commissioned by the Royal Navy, or within the framework of the Liner Requisition Act. In these conditions, the losses were numerous. The route from Southampton was stopped in order to avoid losses, and only &quot;Baltic&quot; and &quot;Adriatic&quot; remained on the route from Liverpool to New York, quickly joined by ships loaned from the Red Star Line: , , and .

&quot;Oceanic&quot;, &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Celtic&quot; and &quot;Cedric&quot; were quickly converted into auxiliary cruisers, and joined the 10th Squadron of the Royal Navy. &quot;Majestic&quot; escaped the fighting, its scrapping having begun a few weeks before the start of the conflict. The company&#x27;s first wartime loss was &quot;Oceanic&quot;, which ran aground and was lost on 8 September 1914.

The first White Star ship lost to enemy action was &quot;Arabic&quot;, which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in August 1915 with the loss of 44 lives. November 1916 would see the loss of , the third and final &quot;Olympic&quot;-class vessel, which sank near the Greek island of Kea after striking a naval mine while in service as a hospital ship. &quot;Britannic&quot; was the largest loss for the company, and also the largest ship sunk during the conflict. 1916 also saw the loss of , which was torpedoed off the Irish coast in May, and also of the cargo ship , which was scuttled in December with its cargo of 1,200 horses still on board after being intercepted in the Atlantic by the German merchant raider .

1917 saw the loss of in January, which struck a mine off the Irish coast and sank with the loss of 354 lives and 3,211 gold ingots. The following month the liner was sunk by a torpedo in the English Channel, as was in August. Another large loss came in 1918, when , a liner requisitioned from Holland America Line and operated by White Star, was torpedoed and sunk.

Many White Star ships were requisitioned for various types of war service, most commonly for use as troop ships. The most notable of these was &quot;Olympic&quot;, which transported over 200,000 troops during the conflict. Some ships, still under construction when the war broke out, were sent into military service unfinished and were not completed until after the war. This was the case with &quot;Belgic&quot; and . The company lost ten ships over the course of the conflict, but its fleet carried nearly 550,000 soldiers and four million tons of cargo, and nearly 325 officers, engineers, marshals and medics were decorated during the war. With the end of hostilities, their surviving ships were decommissioned to resume their commercial service.

=== War reparations ===
After the war, the White Star Line found itself in a difficult situation. Of its three &quot;Olympic&quot;-class giants, only one remained to resume commercial service. The losses on other routes were also far from negligible. After the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Big Four resumed service from Liverpool with the help of &quot;Lapland&quot;, &quot;Belgic&quot; and the briefly chartered &quot;Mobile&quot;. In July 1919, &quot;Cretic&quot; and &quot;Canopic&quot; resumed their Mediterranean service. In September 1919, &quot;Lapland&quot; and &quot;Adriatic&quot; reopened the Southampton route. In 1920, &quot;Olympic&quot; returned to service and displaced &quot;Lapland&quot; after undergoing an overhaul that included a conversion to oil burning, which was more economical than coal.

After the ships that had survived the conflict returned to service, the company still had to compensate for its losses, which it decided to do by buying as many second-hand ships as possible, and sometimes by lending them to other shipping companies within the IMM. The company bought two cargo ships built as part of the war effort, &quot;War Argus&quot; and &quot;War Priam&quot;, which became and . They acquired from the American Line in 1921, as well as &quot;Poland&quot; from the Red Star Line in 1922.

In 1922, the White Star Line obtained three former German liners which had been ceded to Britain as war reparations under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, ostensibly as replacements for the war losses of &quot;Britannic&quot;, &quot;Oceanic&quot;, &quot;Arabic&quot;, &quot;Cymric&quot; and &quot;Laurentic&quot;. These were the former SS &quot;Bismarck&quot;, which was renamed , the former SS &quot;Berlin&quot;, renamed , and the former SS &quot;Columbus&quot;, renamed . At 56,551 gross register tons, &quot;Majestic&quot; was then the world&#x27;s largest liner and became the company&#x27;s flagship. The two former German liners operated successfully alongside &quot;Olympic&quot; on the Southampton–New York route until the Great Depression reduced demand after 1930.

In the immediate post-war period there was a boom in transatlantic migration, from which White Star was able to benefit for a time. However, this trade was badly affected by the Immigration Act of 1924, which introduced quotas for immigrants to the United States. This lowered the profits of the shipping lines, for whom migration had been a source of profit for nearly a century. However, the growth in tourism was to some degree able to offset the decline of migration, and White Star made efforts to appeal to this new kind of travellers by gradually overhauling liners still in service and re-configuring Third Class accommodations as Tourist Class.

=== Exit from the IMM ===
In the post-war period, when the situation of the International Mercantile Marine Co. was precarious, its president, Philip Franklin, saw the exclusion of British companies as a lifeline. Indeed, the presence of these British companies and their ships deprived the trust of American subsidies. At that time, Lord Pirrie and Owen Philipps (known from 1923 as Lord Kylsant) offered £27,000,000 to recover all British property from the trust. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, however, vetoed at the last minute. The IMM found itself in an all the more delicate position since the White Star Line signed an agreement with the British Board of Trade stipulating that it should not be considered as a foreign ownership. Under this agreement, all directors of the company were to be approved by the Board of Trade, which created a particularly complex situation.

It was under these conditions that the White Star Line pursued its resumption of activities. In 1923, &quot;Doric&quot; entered service, one of only two ships delivered to the company by Harland &amp; Wolff during the decade. The liner was assigned to a joint service between White Star and the Dominion Line. It was accompanied on this route by &quot;Regina&quot;, a ship of the IMM. Originally owned by the Leyland Line, it was operated by the Dominion Line before switching to White Star. The ship ended its career under the colors of the Red Star Line. Also in 1923, White Star and its rival Cunard Line reached an agreement to alternate their departures during the winter, in order to use fewer ships during this less profitable season, which was conducive to refitting ships.

Although the transatlantic services of the White Star Line held up well in the 1920s, this was not the case for all services. The Australian route was experiencing more and more difficulties. Relations with IMM became increasingly difficult and, in 1925, the trust again announced that it wanted to separate from its non-American subsidiaries. The sale was initially offered for the price of £7,000,000, derisory compared to its original price, and an agreement seemed to have been reached in the spring with the British group Furness Withy, but the deal ultimately failed.

== Lord Kylsant and the Great Depression (1927–1934) ==

Shortly after, Lord Kylsant intervened in the situation with the IMM. As the head of Harland &amp; Wolff since the death of Lord Pirrie in 1924, he was particularly interested in the White Star Line, to which Harland &amp; Wolff had a close business relationship. In November 1926, Kylsant announced that he had bought back all the shares in the White Star Line from IMM for £7,907,661. The sale took effect on 1 January 1927, making Kylsant the owner of the largest fleet in the world thanks to his Royal Mail Steam Packet Company (RMSPC). The IMM continued to manage the American White Star agencies.
Despite everything, Kylsant&#x27;s empire was not to succeed: its vast and aging fleet had to be replaced at a time when the company was experiencing great financial difficulties. This mainly involved repaying Treasury loans that were approaching maturity. Kylsant nevertheless took advantage of his new acquisition to reorganize this fleet: he decided to give White Star the monopoly of the Southampton route within his group, and therefore reassigned two of the ships that the Royal Mail operated on this route, &quot;Ohio&quot; and &quot;Orca&quot;, which became and respectively, to the Canadian route alongside &quot;Laurentic&quot;. As the new chairman of the company, Kylsant was also trying to strengthen the company in its services to Australia. To do this, he bought back the shares of Sir John Ellerman, a minority shareholder of Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line, for £994,000 in 1928. This action followed the buyout, for nearly two million pounds, of the Commonwealth Line. These purchases, made by the company White Star Line Ltd created by Kylsant, pushed the company into bankruptcy, even as the group was demanding delays in repaying the Treasury. The decision also turned out to be erroneous; the route to Australia was already suffering from a surplus of tonnage, and the hopes of Kylsant, who said he believed &quot;in the future of Australia,&quot; turned out to be in vain. It was also in this context that Kylsant was launching a new construction program at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard.

In 1928, a new was ordered and her keel was laid down that year at Harland and Wolff. The thousand foot long liner was to have been a motor ship propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system. However, while the construction of the keel was in progress, work was stopped during 1929, initially to study the new propulsion device. The construction never resumed. Its keel was dismantled and the steel used to construct other ships. The Great Depression of 1929 put an end to the project. Since Lord Kylsant took control of the company, he had been siphoning the revenues of the company for the benefit of the rest of the RMSPC pending an improvement in the financial situation. Also, the dividends declared by the company were constantly decreasing, prompting Harold Sanderson to leave the management. In addition, repeated requests from the Treasury to obtain reimbursement weakened Kylsant, who was eventually arrested in connection with the Royal Mail Case in 1931.

To survive the economic crisis, White Star Line limited its spending. The oldest ships were sold, and many crossings were canceled in order to counter the drop in the number of passengers. Passengers on the transatlantic route numbered 172,000 in 1928, and the number dropped to 157,930 the following year. The liners, including the bigger ones like the &quot;Majestic&quot; and the &quot;Olympic&quot;, were used for cruises during this period in order to bring in more income. A new liner, the entered service in 1930. It adapted perfectly to the circumstances since it was slower and therefore more profitable than the transatlantic ships of the Southampton route. It immediately became the ship making the most money for the company, and a sister ship, the joined it in 1932.

However, the situation was not favorable for the company, which in 1930, recorded the first deficit in its history, a deficit which continued in the following years. Kylsant&#x27;s departure in 1931 left his business empire in a state of disrepair. Its liquidation was then envisaged, with the banks then having the role of keeping the various fleets alive as much as possible based on their values. The operation began in 1932, the most complex then being to untangle the web of links uniting the various companies. Another hard blow then struck White Star: the Australian government demanded reimbursement of a million pounds still owed following the purchases of Kylsant. The company was unable to repay its debt, and its ships serving on the Australian route were sold to a new company, the Aberdeen and Commonwealth Line Ltd, in 1933.

In the same year, when the company appeared to be bankrupt, discussions began to take place to consider a merger with the Cunard Line, which was also in financial difficulty. Joseph Bruce Ismay tried, twenty years after his ouster, to participate in the rescue of the company by proposing to create, with the agreement of the government a new company which would operate and would build other ships similar to the &quot;Britannic&quot; and the &quot;Georgic&quot; in order to become profitable. The idea did not come to fruition and Ismay died in 1937 without having been able to do more. Meanwhile, other aging ships were being scrapped without being replaced, notably the Big Four with the exception of the &quot;Adriatic&quot;.

== Cunard merger ==

In 1933, White Star and Cunard were both in serious financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, plummeting passenger numbers, and the advanced age of their fleets. Work was halted on Cunard&#x27;s new giant, Hull 534, later , in 1931 to save money. In 1933, the British government agreed to provide assistance to the two competitors on the condition that they merge their North Atlantic operations. The agreement was completed on 30 December 1933. The merger took place on 10 May 1934, creating Cunard-White Star Limited. White Star contributed ten ships to the new company while Cunard contributed fifteen. Due to this arrangement, and since Hull 534 was Cunard&#x27;s ship, 62% of the company was owned by Cunard&#x27;s shareholders and 38% of the company was owned for the benefit of White Star&#x27;s creditors. White Star&#x27;s Australia and New Zealand services were not involved in the merger, but were separately disposed of to the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line later in 1934. A year later, &quot;Olympic&quot; was withdrawn from service and scrapped in 1937.

In 1947, Cunard acquired the remaining 38% of Cunard White Star. On 31 December 1949, they acquired Cunard-White Star&#x27;s assets and operations, and reverted to using the name &quot;Cunard&quot; on 1 January 1950. From the time of the 1934 merger, the house flags of both lines had been flown on all their ships, with each ship flying the flag of its original owner above the other, but from 1950, even and , the last surviving White Star liners, flew the Cunard house flag above the White Star burgee until they were each withdrawn from service in 1956 and 1961 respectively. Just as the retiring of Cunard&#x27;s in 1950 marked the end of the pre-World War I &#x27;floating palaces&#x27;, the retirement of &quot;Britannic&quot; a decade later marked the end of White Star Line. All Cunard vessels flew both the Cunard and White Star Line house flags on their masts until late 1968. This was most likely because &quot;Nomadic&quot; remained in service with Cunard until 4 November 1968, and was sent to the breakers&#x27; yard, only to be bought for use as a floating restaurant. After this, the White Star flag was no longer flown, the White Star name was removed from Cunard operations and all remnants of both White Star Line and Cunard-White Star Line were retired.

== The Australia Run ==


White Star had begun as a line serving traffic to and from Australia, especially during the gold rushes of the 1850s, but following the line&#x27;s collapse and its purchase by Thomas Ismay in 1868, the company was rebuilt as a trans-Atlantic line. However, in the late 1890s White Star decided to reinstate a service to Australia, partly because of the discovery of further gold deposits in Western Australia leading to another series of gold rushes and an increase in emigrants to Australia, as well as an increasing trade in minerals, agricultural produce, wool and meat in the other direction. The latter had become a major source of revenue for shipping lines already on the route after the advent of effective mechanical refrigeration systems in the late 1880s, allowing large quantities of cattle carcasses to be preserved on the long voyage back to the British Isles.

Thomas Ismay decided to re-enter the Australian run in 1897 with a monthly service between Liverpool, Cape Town and Sydney. A stop at Tenerife was included in the schedule both outbound and inbound. Outbound ships would call at Adelaide and Melbourne and the return trip would call at Plymouth before ending at Liverpool. With the journey taking six weeks, five ships would be needed to maintain the service in both directions. The specification for the new ships was drawn up and the order placed with Harland &amp; Wolff in the summer of 1897, coinciding with the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, thus they became known as the . In keeping with White Star&#x27;s new philosophy on the Atlantic of size over speed, the Jubilee class were to be the largest ships ever put on the Australia run, at in length and nearly 12,000 gross register tons. They were single-funnel, twin-screw ships designed as mixed cargo/passenger vessels, essentially being enlarged versions of White Star&#x27;s earlier &quot;Naronic&quot; class. With a service speed of , the Jubilee class were significantly slower than the smaller mailships run by the Orient Line and P&amp;O and their size meant they could not transit the Suez Canal, so they would have to take the long route via South Africa and would not attract first-class passengers. Instead they were intended for the emigrant/seasonal worker traffic, carrying 320 passengers solely in what was described as third-class accommodation. However, following White Star&#x27;s long tradition of improving standards for third-class passengers, these facilities were considerably ahead of the equivalent on other lines, being broadly in line with second-class facilities on other ships. Although all of the same class, prices for berths on the Jubilee class varied, allowing passengers the choice of two- or four-berth cabins for a premium or open dormitories. Passengers had use of facilities such as a large dining room, a library and a smoking room, as well as free run of nearly all the ship&#x27;s deck space during the voyage. The ships could carry 15,000 tons of cargo in seven holds, including capacity for 100,000 meat carcasses.

The first Jubilee-class ship, , was launched in November 1898, but her maiden voyage in February 1899 was to New York as a shakedown cruise and to test the new ship on a shorter route – small improvements were made to &quot;Afric&quot; and her sister ships as a result of this trip. The Australian service was actually inaugurated by the second ship, , which left Liverpool in August 1899 and arrived in Sydney in October. The third ship, , began her maiden voyage in December 1899 but was delayed for several weeks in Cape Town after her rudder broke due to faulty metalwork. The final pair of ships for the Australia run were built to a modified design following the experiences with the original trio. The Australian run proved to be more popular with passengers than expected, so these two ships, and , had their bridges moved forward and their poop decks extended. As well as slightly increasing their gross register tonnage, this gave them capacity for a further 50 passengers, bringing the total to 400. &quot;Suevic&quot; made her maiden voyage in May 1901, bringing White Star&#x27;s new Australian service to full strength. By now the return voyage also included a stop at London – most passengers from Australia disembarked at Plymouth to go to their final destination by rail, while much of the cargo was bound for London. The ship would then steam back through the English Channel to offload the last of her cargo and passengers at Liverpool before preparing for the next voyage.
The Australian run was successful and profitable for White Star, and largely uneventful for the ships. In the earliest days of the route the initial three ships were heavily used to transport men, soldiers and supplies to South Africa during the Boer War, while &quot;Suevic&quot; ran aground off Lizard Point, Cornwall in 1907. There were no casualties and, despite the ship being broken in two as part of an ambitious salvage operation, she was repaired and re-entered service in January 1908. The success of the new Australian service in terms of freight led to White Star transferring an older cargo-only ship of a similar size to the Jubilee class, , from the New York service to the Australia Run. In 1910 &quot;Cevic&quot; was used to experiment with routing ships to Australia via the Suez Canal but she ran aground several times in the canal and the ships continued to operate via the Cape. &quot;Cevic&quot; was used on the Australia run on a seasonal basis, mainly carrying cattle and wool at the end of the Australian autumn (February–April) and then being switched to the New York run during the Atlantic summer.

Continued demand for extra passenger capacity led to White Star building a one-off ship for the route. Launched in 1913, was a larger, more sophisticated development of the Jubilee class, at in length and 18,495 gross register tons. Like and the , &quot;Ceramic&quot; was a triple-screw ship with the central propeller driven by a low-pressure turbine using exhaust from the two reciprocating steam engines. This enabled her to be slightly faster – – than the Jubilee-class vessels despite her extra size for a minimal increase in coal consumption. The new ship had a significantly larger superstructure and nearly double the passenger capacity of the Jubilee-class ships – a total of 600 passengers, still carried only in what was advertised as third-class accommodation. She could also carry 19,000 tons of cargo in eight holds, including of refrigerated space. The dimensions of &quot;Ceramic&quot; were restricted by the length of the quay at London&#x27;s Port of Tilbury and the clearance for the masts under the then-proposed Sydney Harbour Bridge. When she arrived in Sydney in September 1914, she took the place of the Jubilee-class ships as the largest vessel on the Australia run from Britain. After the long-delayed construction of the Harbour Bridge in 1932, &quot;Ceramic&quot; would be the tallest ship then in service to pass under it.

All seven ships were requisitioned as troop transports during World War I, forcing White Star to suspend the regular Australia service. &quot;Afric&quot; was torpedoed by a U-boat in the English Channel in 1917 and &quot;Cevic&quot; remained in the ownership of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary after the war, but the remaining five ships were returned to White Star and the service was resumed in 1919. The remaining Jubilee-class liners were withdrawn from service in the late 1920s. &quot;Persic&quot; was scrapped in 1926 while &quot;Medic&quot; and &quot;Suevic&quot; were sold in 1928 and &quot;Runic&quot; in 1929. All were converted into whaling factory ships on account of their size and cargo capacity. The Australia run was no longer as lucrative or as heavily trafficked as it had been before the war and the route was no longer a priority for White Star, especially once it came under the ownership of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1927. A new ship, intended to be the first of a new class to replace the Jubilee class, had been launched in 1917 – . This was the first White Star ship to be powered solely by turbines and had the same emigrant/cargo-carrying role as her predecessors, although at and 9,332 gross register tons, she was smaller than the older ships. &quot;Vedic&quot; went straight from the builders to service as a troopship and was initially used on White Star&#x27;s Canadian service until she was put on the Australia run in 1925. &quot;Ceramic&quot; and &quot;Vedic&quot; maintained a less-intensive Australian service until White Star merged with the Cunard Line in 1934. The new management immediately decided to end White Star&#x27;s routes to the southern hemisphere – &quot;Ceramic&quot; was sold to the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line, which continued to operate her on the same route, while &quot;Vedic&quot; was scrapped.

== The New Zealand Service ==

In 1883 an agreement was made between White Star and the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line (newly formed by merger the previous year) to operate a joint service between London and Wellington. Thomas Ismay had already been considering setting up a New Zealand route for White Star, but with Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion (SS&amp;A) already formed due to the difficulties of competing against the New Zealand Shipping Company (NZSC), sharing the venture with a firm that was already established on the route but looking to expand was an attractive proposition. Two ships were already in-build by the time the agreement was signed – the and the . In fact both these ships were chartered to the would-be rival NZSC immediately after their launch, as well as the older to make up for the very shortfall in ships on the run that White Star was hoping to exploit.

The White Star/Shaw Savill New Zealand service did not begin in earnest until the next year. The three ships were timetabled in addition to the existing Shaw Savill service and were managed and administered by Shaw Savill&#x27;s agents, but White Star provided the crews and the ships retained their White Star names, livery and house flag. The route was an eastward circumnavigation, calling at Tenerife, Cape Town and Dar es Salaam on the way to Wellington, then rounding Cape Horn and calling at Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro on the return.

Traffic on the New Zealand route did not develop as quickly as anticipated, and in 1893 a new dedicated combined cargo/passenger liner, , with nearly twice the gross tonnage of one of the older ships, was introduced. &quot;Coptic&quot; and &quot;Doric&quot; were chartered to White Star&#x27;s long-time partner in the Pacific, the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company.

By the next decade, traffic on the New Zealand service had picked up and was becoming both profitable and over-subscribed. When White Star became part of the International Mercantile Marine Company in 1902, an agreement was made with Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion that White Star would construct and provide three ships for the joint New Zealand service which, as before, would be managed and administered by SS&amp;A. A trio of new liners, the were ordered from Harland &amp; Wolff. Although slightly smaller in length and tonnage, they closely resembled the two modified Jubilee-class liners built for the Australia Run, with bridges mounted far forward to allow for a generous passenger-carrying space. Unlike the Jubilees, the &quot;Athenic&quot; class carried passengers in all three classes. and entered service in 1902 and (re-using the name of one of the ships that began the service 20 years before) in 1903.

All three ships became troop carriers under the auspices of the Minister of Shipping during the First World War, carrying the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to Europe and the Middle East. After the war they returned to the joint service with White Star/Shaw Savill, but the route was no longer in such demand or so profitable, and White Star was becoming more focused on its core Atlantic service between Southampton and New York and increasingly looking to wind down the Australia Run, the Atlantic services to Boston and Canada and the New Zealand service. In 1928 &quot;Athenic&quot; was sold to a Norwegian firm and converted into a whaling factory ship. In 1929 &quot;Corinthic&quot; was re-fitted to have single third/tourist class accommodation only, and she was sold for scrap in 1931. Only &quot;Ionic&quot; was still in service when White Star and Cunard merged in 1934, at which point &quot;Ionic&quot; on the New Zealand run was sold on to Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion along with &quot;Ceramic&quot; on the Australian service. The elderly liner was scrapped in 1936.

== Legacy==
The White Star Line&#x27;s main offices, Albion House, still exist in Liverpool, standing in James Street within sight of the more grandiose headquarters of their rivals, the Cunard Building. The building has a plaque commemorating the fact that it was once the head office of the White Star Line. It was the first open plan office building in Liverpool. J. Bruce Ismay had his office in the building.

The White Star Line&#x27;s London office building, Oceanic House, still exists today, and has been converted into apartments. They are on Cockspur Street, off Trafalgar Square, and the company name can still be seen on the building over the entrances. The Southampton offices in Canute Road still exist, now known as Canute Chambers.

The French passenger tender &quot;Nomadic&quot;, the last surviving vessel of the White Star Line, was purchased by the Northern Ireland Department for Social Development in January 2006. She has since been returned to Belfast, where she has been fully restored to her original and elegant 1912 appearance under the auspices of the Nomadic Preservation Society with the assistance of her original builders, Harland and Wolff. She is currently serving as an outside exhibit of the Titanic Belfast museum, a museum dedicated to the history of Atlantic steam, the White Star Line, and its most famous ship, &quot;Titanic&quot;. The historic &quot;Nomadic&quot; was opened ceremoniously to the public on 31 May 2013.

In 1995, Cunard Line introduced &quot;White Star Service&quot; to as a reference to the high standards of customer service expected of the company. The term is still used today onboard , and . The company has also created the White Star Academy, an in-house programme for preparing new crew members for the service standards expected on Cunard ships.

The White Star flag is raised on all Cunard ships and &quot;Nomadic&quot; every 15 April in memory of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

<doc id="445163" wikidata="Q2246088" url="?curid=445163" title="Earth-616">
<text>In the fictional Marvel Comics multiverse, Earth-616 is the primary continuity in which most Marvel Comics titles take place.

== Origins of the term ==
The designation &quot;Earth-616&quot; has its origins in Captain Britain comics from the early 1980s and can be attributed to both Dave Thorpe and Alan Moore. The term was first used in &quot;Rough Justice&quot;, a story credited to both Alan Moore and Alan Davis published in July 1983 by Marvel UK in the seventh issue of the anthology comic &quot;The Daredevils&quot; (and was later reprinted in the &quot;Captain Britain&quot; trade paperback). Due to this, it is often credited to Moore, though Davis said in 2007 that the term had been internally established earlier by Thorpe, who was the previous writer for &quot;Captain Britain&quot;, as part of the &quot;Captain Britain folklore&quot;. He said that it came from a variation on the number of the beast, picked because Thorpe disliked the modern superhero genre and expressed this in various ways in his stories, including recording his opinion of the Marvel Universe with the 616 designation. As a coincidence, 616 was discovered as a variant of 666 both with the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus and Papyrus 115 in 2005.

In a 2019 interview with Rich Johnston, Thorpe confirmed that the number was derived from subtracting 50 from 666, but that the reference to the number of the beast was because the designation was intended for the &quot;Crooked World&quot; of the Jaspers&#x27; Warp storyline. However, when Moore wrote the story for &quot;The Daredevils&quot;, the Crooked World was designated , and was used by Saturnyne to differentiate Brian Braddock, the Captain Britain of the regular Marvel Comics universe, from the other members of the Captain Britain Corps, each of which inhabit different universes.

After its use in &quot;The Daredevils&quot;, the designation was later used by the American branch of Marvel Comics in the &quot;Excalibur&quot; title, which frequently referred to Captain Britain&#x27;s early UK-published adventures. This comic was written by Chris Claremont, who had created Captain Britain, and pencilled by Alan Davis, the artist on the UK-published series. Davis later had a run as both writer and artist on the book.

== References to Earth-616 ==
Any Marvel comic book since &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; #1 that is not explicitly designated an alternate universe or timeline is assumed to take place within the Earth-616 continuity. It is the &quot;status quo&quot; that all other universes diverge from and iterate on. Earth-616 is referred to by name numerous times over the decades, primarily in Marvel UK titles, in &quot;Excalibur,&quot; or in Marvel reference texts such as the guide to &quot;Alternate Universes&quot; (2005). In addition, there are a number of other references to Earth-616:
* In &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; #6 (March 2004), Uatu the Watcher refers to the universe as Earth-616.
* In &quot;Marvel Knights 4&quot; #15 (April 2005), Earth-616 is mentioned.
* In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #462 (September 2005), an alteration in reality of Earth-616 causes trans-temporal devastation, and Saturnyne attempts to destroy that particular temporal continuity to &quot;cauterize the wound&quot;.
* In &quot;Iron Man: Fatal Frontier&quot; #10, Doctor Doom mentions that they are in either Earth-616 or in Earth-615.
* In all the issues of &quot;Deadpool Kills Deadpool&quot; (July 2013), the story centers around the timeline of the Earth-616 Deadpool rather that any of the alternate universe versions.
* In &quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015) #1, the universe where the main story line takes place is referred to as Earth-616.

The term has also appeared in &quot;Exiles&quot; (in, among others, the House of M tie-in issues) and is in regular use by the writers of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Official Handbook&quot;s for the simplicity of the term. 

There has been at least one attempt within Marvel canon to change the designation of Earth-616. In the final story arc of &quot;X-Man&quot; (issues #71–74), writer Steven Grant began to refer to the planet as &quot;Earth-611&quot; due to the destruction of several other Earths (which were all apparently &quot;higher on the list&quot; of the Multiverse than the Marvel Earth) by a godlike entity. This change, an allusion to the events of DC&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, was not adopted by other writers.

== In other media ==
=== Marvel Cinematic Universe ===

* In the film &quot;&quot; (2013), Erik Selvig is portrayed as being somewhat mentally unstable and in his time at a mental hospital he draws a number of diagrams and equations on a blackboard. Near the center of all of this, the words &quot;616 universe&quot; can be seen underlined.
* In the second season of &quot;Iron Fist&quot; (2018), Misty Knight is driving with Colleen Wing when they hear a police radio broadcast alerting all units to &quot;multiple fatalities at a nearby nightclub&quot; and a &quot;code 616&quot;. Misty explains that 616 is the police code for a &quot;possible suspect with abilities&quot;.
* In the film &quot;&quot; (2019), Ant-Man&#x27;s van was being held in a storage area labeled &quot;616&quot;.
* In the film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), Mysterio claims that the main Marvel Cinematic Universe continuity exists on &quot;Earth-616&quot;, despite every line the character says comes from a fictional writer named Guterman.
* In the film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022), Christine Palmer of Earth-838 informs Doctor Strange that the Illuminati named his universe &quot;Earth-616&quot;.

=== Other films ===
* In the film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018), Earth-616 is seen in a monitor along with other Earths, while Peter B. Parker arrives on Earth-1610 (the home universe of Miles Morales) when the interdimensional machine starts malfunctioning.
* The sequel, &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), designates Peter B. Parker as from &quot;Earth-616B&quot;.

== Editorial reaction ==
Former Marvel Editor in Chief Joe Quesada and Executive Editor Tom Brevoort have each stated their dislike for the term Earth-616.

<text>John Owen (8 April 1827 – 24 November 1901) was an English vicar and amateur chess master. He ranked among the world&#x27;s top ten chess players for certain periods of the 1860s. He was a major figure in English chess from the mid-1850s to the 1890s.

==Biography==
Owen was born in Marchington, and obtained his early schooling at Repton School, Derbyshire. In 1850 he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and received his M.A. from Cambridge three years later. He was ordained by the Church of England in 1851, and served as Vicar of Hooton, Cheshire from 1862 to his retirement in 1900.

In 1858 he won a chess game against the young American master Paul Morphy, the world&#x27;s best player, who was then touring Europe. This led to a match between the two. Despite being given odds of pawn and the move (meaning he started the game with an extra pawn and always moved first), Owen lost the match 6–1, never winning a game.

His performance in the very strong 1862 London tournament, the first international round-robin event (in which each participant plays every other) was more impressive. He finished third, ahead of future world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, and was the only player to win against the eventual tournament winner, Adolf Anderssen. Louis Paulsen placed second. This result was arguably Owen&#x27;s top lifetime chess achievement.

Owen continued to play frequently and often successfully in British tournaments into the 1890s, and performed strongly in several matches against top British players, who were essentially chess professionals. He never competed outside the British Isles. He died in Twickenham.

==Legacy==

Owen is the eponym of Owen&#x27;s Defence, a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 b6. Owen was the first strong player to play this frequently, including in his victory over Morphy.

<text>Stacie Joy Orrico (born March 3, 1986) is an American singer and songwriter. After signing to ForeFront Records, Orrico recorded her first album, &quot;Genuine&quot; (2000). Her second studio album &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; (2003), released by ForeFront and Virgin, debuted at No. 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold with over 500,000 sales in the United States. The first single &quot;Stuck&quot; reached No. 52 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and achieved greater success worldwide. Her second single &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot; peaked at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Her self-titled album has achieved sales worldwide of over 3.5 million. In 2003, she made her first television appearance as an actress in two episodes of &quot;American Dreams&quot;. Her third album, &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot; (2006) spawned two singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Missing You&quot; and &quot;So Simple&quot;.

== Early life ==
Orrico was born in Seattle, Washington to Patti (née Schmautz) and Dean Orrico, who were missionaries. She is of a quarter Italian descent, born to a close-knit family. The family later moved to Denver, Colorado, where Orrico took piano lessons from Cathy Paquette. Orrico is the middle child of five: her siblings are Jesse, Rachel, Alicia, and Joshua. She was a missionary with her family and lived in Ukraine for several years.

Orrico grew up influenced by a wide range of musical styles and was a member in the church choir; she often accompanied on the piano as the family sang Christian hymns. At age six, Orrico wrote her first song, entitled &quot;Always Answer.&quot; She also attended missionary school with singer Allen Stone.

== Career ==

=== 1999–2001: Early work and debut album ===

Orrico got her start at the age of 12, by attending a Christian music festival, Praise in the Rockies, held in her then-home state of Colorado. Orrico inadvertently entered a high-stakes talent competition, and won. A ForeFront Records executive was on hand and approached her for a record deal. She later signed with them. In 2001, she toured with Destiny&#x27;s Child as their opening act on select dates of their &quot;Survivor&quot; tour in the United States.

She went on to release two albums. The first was &quot;Genuine&quot; (2000), which she recorded at age 14. It sold over 13,000 copies in the first week, the highest debut week sales ever for a female Christian artist. The album produced the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Look At Me&quot; which topped Christian charts for ten consecutive weeks. The album had two No. 1 hits, as well as three more top ten singles. &quot;Genuine&quot; eventually sold 500,000 copies, giving the album a Gold certification on word-of-mouth alone.

In 2001, 15-year-old Orrico released her only Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Wish&quot;. The six tracks on the EP were: &quot;Christmas Wish&quot;, &quot;Love Came Down&quot;, &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, &quot;What Child is This&quot;, &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, and &quot;White Christmas&quot;.

=== 2002–2004: International success with &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; ===

Her next effort, the more mainstream and self-titled album &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot;, was released in 2003 and charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (debuting at No. 67), Australian ARIA Albums Chart and the UK Albums Chart. The first mainstream single from this album was &quot;Stuck&quot;, which became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 5 on the majority of the world&#x27;s charts. This was followed by the single &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot;, which peaked in the top 20 in Australia (No. 11) and the UK (No. 12), although, overall, &quot;Stuck&quot; charted better, the exception being in the US. In 2014, English singer Sam Smith mentioned in an interview that &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot; is their favorite music video.

In December 2003, Orrico performed Christmas music such as &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; on NBC&#x27;s news and talk show &quot;Today&quot;. She also performed &quot;Stuck&quot; on UK and Italy&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live.&quot; In 2003, she portrayed Peggy Santiglia of the girl group the Angels in an episode of NBC&#x27;s drama television series &quot;American Dreams&quot;. In the show, she performed the Angels&#x27; song &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back,&quot; which was included on the show&#x27;s soundtrack.

This was then followed by &quot;I Promise&quot;, written by Diane Warren (top 30 in the UK), and the final mainstream single &quot;I Could Be the One&quot; (top 40 in the UK in June 2004). Both singles were given limited releases and limited promotion, meaning they did not fare as well as the first two singles. The last three singles were only released to Christian radio in addition to &quot;Strong Enough&quot;, which reached No. 1 as the CD&#x27;s very first single. &quot;Stacie Orrico&quot; sold over 500,000 copies in the US, enough sales for a Gold certification. The album also sold 600,000 in Japan and an estimated 3.4 million copies worldwide. In 2004, Orrico&#x27;s songs &quot;(There&#x27;s Gotta Be) More to Life&quot; and &quot;Stuck&quot; appeared on the &quot;Barbie Hit Mix&quot;.

She was nominated at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in the category Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album, but the award was given to Michael W. Smith.

In March 2004, she took a break for a couple of years.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot; ===

She was dropped by her label ForeFront Records in 2005 after seven years. After her break, she decided to work on her new album, called &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot;, which was set to be released worldwide on August 29, 2006; however, for reasons unknown, the release of the album was postponed in the US. In an interview, she said that the album was one of the best albums she has worked on and was a personal album; the songs are about her life and more. Though almost all of the songs from the new album leaked onto the internet, &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot; was still released in Japan, the UK, and other countries. The album features production from Dallas Austin, Dwayne Bastiany, KayGee, and The Underdogs, and writing duties are performed by notable songwriters like She&#x27;kspere, Track &amp; Field, Anthony Dent, Nate Butler and newcomer Novel and Orrico herself. The album sold 100,000 copies in Japan.

The first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Missing You&quot;, went for radio adds on June 20, 2006, but due to little promotion was re-released in October. The song peaked at No. 19 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The second single from the album, &quot;So Simple&quot;, was released in Asia in October 2006 and was released in Europe on January 27, 2007. The album release in the US and Canada was canceled and Orrico has no sign of an official US release. &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot; is available to purchase on iTunes.

In 2007, the belated release of &quot;Beautiful Awakening&quot; was postponed once again. In March, Orrico announced that Virgin Records was merging with Capitol Records and she had left them and would not be releasing the album with that label. Her record company terminated her contract and her tour dates were canceled. On her Myspace it was announced that she would spend time in Africa.

=== 2008–2012: Hiatus ===

After a long break from the public eye, Orrico headlined the QB Goes Live concert on March 15, 2008, in Cambodia, performing to an audience of over 50,000 at the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium. Orrico also appeared at Singfest Festival in Singapore. She also held a short Japan tour in July 2008 in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. Orrico collaborated with producer and songwriter Toby Gad and Onree Gill in 2008.

In 2009, she was back in the studio with Brandon Beal and Cannon Mapp to record her upcoming fourth album. One of the tracks she recorded was &quot;Light Years&quot;. Later the song did not make the album and was re-recorded by Albanian-American artist Kristine Elezaj in 2010.

In 2010, she co-wrote a song with Novel for &quot;American Idol&quot; winner and R&amp;B singer Fantasia Barrino called &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Without You&quot; for her third studio album &quot;Back to Me&quot;. Unfortunately the song did not make the final album. Rumor had it that Orrico would retire from the music business, but her long-time collaborator Novel confirmed in 2010 that Orrico is still writing music and in 2011, her friend Rachael Lampa also confirmed Orrico&#x27;s musical return.

In 2012, she featured on The Fray&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Scars and Stories&quot; on the track &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, which is a cover of The Fugees song. The song is only available on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the album. She independently released a new song called &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; on April 2, 2012. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is composed and performed by Orrico and The Gabe Cummins Orchestra, which has a jazzy sound. A release date for a new album was never confirmed.

=== 2013–2015: Comeback, &quot;The Return&quot; concert ===

Orrico posted a video on her YouTube account in 2013 to explain her hiatus and announce plans to return to the studio. Orrico revealed she had been studying women&#x27;s literature and acting at New York University from 2011 to 2013. She announced that she was working on an R&amp;B album, slated to be released in 2014 (as of 2022 this had not been released). She worked with several collaborators, including producers Allen Stone, Hal Linton, Gabe Cummins and The Lions.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://twitter.com/stacieorrico/status/389402907638259712&quot;&gt;@stacieorrico: &quot;Got to make music with...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate her comeback, she performed a virtual concert on November 6, 2013, via Stageit.com.

On November 9, 2015, Orrico performed with the house band at the time, Jon Batiste and Stay Human on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

== Influences ==

When asked about her influences, she responded: &quot;All of my influences are very soulful musicians – my favorite artist is Lauryn Hill, and I&#x27;ve always loved Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Ella Fitzgerald – and I wanted to explore that direction more.&quot; She said when she was young, she listened to Nina Simone, Crystal Lewis, Monica and Destiny&#x27;s Child.
Her other musical influences include Christina Aguilera, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Toni Braxton.

== Personal life ==

In March 2007, Orrico traveled to South Africa as a volunteer with Cross-Cultural Solutions to help children with HIV/AIDS.

After several years of dating, Orrico married actor Isaiah Johnson in July 2016. As of 2023, Orrico and Johnson have a son and a daughter.

Orrico was one of the founders of The Nile Project, &quot;a modern day artist’s salon&quot; focused on providing women &quot;a place for collaborative, feminine ways of healing and creating.&quot;

<doc id="445170" wikidata="Q2903272" url="?curid=445170" title="Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)">
<text>William Francis Lee III (born December 28, 1946), nicknamed &quot;Spaceman&quot;, is an American former professional baseball left-handed pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox (1969–1978) and Montreal Expos (1979–1982). On November 7, 2008, Lee was inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame as the team&#x27;s record-holder for most games pitched by a left-hander (321) and the third highest win total by a Red Sox southpaw (94). On August 23, 2012, he signed a contract to play with the San Rafael Pacifics of the independent North American League, at age 65.

In addition to his statistical baseball accomplishments, Lee is known for his counterculture behavior, his antics both on and off the field, and his use of the &quot;Leephus pitch&quot;, a personalized variation of the eephus pitch.

Lee has co-written four books: &quot;The Wrong Stuff&quot;; &quot;Have Glove, Will Travel&quot;; &quot;The Little Red (Sox) Book: A Revisionist Red Sox History&quot;; and &quot;Baseball Eccentrics: The Most Entertaining, Outrageous, and Unforgettable Characters in the Game&quot;. In 2006, the Brett Rapkin documentary film &quot;Spaceman: A Baseball Odyssey&quot; featured Lee.

==Biography==
Lee was born in Burbank, California, into a family of former semipro and professional baseball players. His grandfather William Lee was an infielder for the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, and his aunt Annabelle Lee was a pitcher in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. &quot;She was the best athlete in the family&quot;, Lee said. &quot;She taught me how to pitch.&quot;

Lee attended and played baseball at Terra Linda High School in San Rafael, California, graduating in 1964 before enrolling at the University of Southern California (USC). From 1964 to 1968, majoring in physical education and geography, Lee attended USC, where he played for Rod Dedeaux. Lee was part of the Trojans team, which won the 1968 College World Series, and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 22nd round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft.

Lee served in the US Army Reserve for six years during the Vietnam War. One of his jobs was to process the dead soldiers from New England and call the families. He was also a chemical, radiation, and biological officer for the 1173rd and earned Soldier of the Cycle at Fort Polk, Louisiana.

Lee is a Rastafarian and a former Catholic. He is married to Canadian-born Diana Donovan.

== Major league career ==
Lacking a good fastball, Lee developed off-speed pitches, including a variation of the Eephus pitch. The Leephus pitch or Space Ball, the names for Lee&#x27;s take on the eephus pitch, follows a high, arcing trajectory and is very slow.

Lee is the last Red Sox player to miss time during the season for his military obligation after being on active duty in the Army Reserve from June 1 to October 1, 1970.

Lee was used almost exclusively as a relief pitcher during the first four years of his career. During that period, Lee appeared in 125 games, starting in nine, and compiled a 19–11 record. In 1973, he was used primarily as a starting pitcher. He started 33 of the 38 games in which he appeared and went 17–11 with a 2.95 Earned Run Average, and was named to the American League All-Star team. He followed 1973 with two more 17-win seasons.

He started two games in the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. He left both the 2nd and 7th games with the lead, although the Red Sox lost both games and the Series. He gave up a two-run home run to Tony Perez on an eephus pitch with a three-run lead in the sixth inning of Game 7.

On May 20 of the 1976 season, Lee started a game against the New York Yankees, pitching six innings, and the Red Sox won 8–2. However, the game is remembered for the final out of the sixth, when Lou Piniella of the Yankees was tagged out at home by Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk. On the play, Piniella ran into Fisk who was blocking home plate. The collision between Piniella and Fisk instigated a fight between the two players resulting in a bench-clearing brawl, during which Lee suffered a torn ligament in his pitching shoulder. Lee missed almost two months of the season and finished with a 5–7 record.

===Later Red Sox career===
During the 1978 season, Lee and Red Sox manager Don Zimmer engaged in an ongoing public feud over the handling of the pitching staff. Lee&#x27;s independence and iconoclastic nature clashed with Zimmer&#x27;s old-school, conservative personality. Lee and a few other Red Sox formed what they called &quot;The Buffalo Heads&quot; as a response to the manager. Zimmer then relegated Lee to the bullpen, and management traded Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins and Bernie Carbo. Lee threatened to retire after his friend Carbo was traded; he subsequently referred to Zimmer as &quot;the gerbil&quot;, which proved to be the last straw. Lee briefly left the Red Sox after pitching in a 10–9 win at home over California on June 12 but returned a few days later; however, during the home stretch, when the Red Sox were battling the Yankees for the pennant, Zimmer refused to pitch Lee. The Red Sox lost the pennant in a one-game playoff with the Yankees.

===Montreal Expos===
Lee was traded at the end of 1978 to the Montreal Expos for Stan Papi, a utility infielder. Lee bade farewell to Boston by saying, &quot;Who wants to be with a team that will go down in history alongside the &#x27;64 Phillies and the &#x27;67 Arabs?&quot; Lee won 16 games for the Expos in 1979 while being named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; National League Left Hander of the Year (over Philadelphia&#x27;s Steve Carlton). His professional career ended in 1982, when he was released by the Expos after staging a one-game walkout as a protest over Montreal&#x27;s decision to release second baseman and friend Rodney Scott.

==Reputation and controversy==
Lee&#x27;s personality earned him popularity as well as the nickname &quot;Spaceman&quot;, given to him by former Red Sox infielder John Kennedy. His outspoken manner and unfiltered comments were frequently recorded in the press. Lee spoke in defense of Maoist China, population control, Greenpeace, and school busing in Boston, among other things. Concerning the last of those issues, he defended W. Arthur Garrity Jr. by stating that he was &quot;the only guy in this town with any guts.&quot; He berated an umpire for a controversial call in the 1975 World Series, threatening to bite off his ear and encouraging the American people to write letters demanding the game be replayed. When asked about his views on mandatory drug testing, Lee quipped: &quot;I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to make it mandatory&quot;. In his 1984 book &quot;The Wrong Stuff&quot;, he claimed his marijuana use made him impervious to bus fumes while jogging to work at Fenway Park. Much of the material in this book is, however, tongue-in-cheek.

His propensity to criticize management led to his being dropped from both the Red Sox and the Expos, and the end of his professional career by 1982.

==Post-professional life==
After the Expos released Lee in May 1982, he played for semi-professional teams, including the single-season Senior Professional Baseball Association in Florida, largely composed of retired major leaguers. He played in Venezuela, and starting in 1984 he lived in Moncton, New Brunswick, where he played first base and pitcher for the Moncton Mets, earning $500 per week. That year, he published his first autobiographical book, &quot;The Wrong Stuff&quot;.

In 1988, he and his second wife, Pamela, announced plans to move to Burlington, Vermont. In 1987, he had announced plans to run for President of the United States for the Rhinoceros Party, which necessitated the move. Since then he has played mostly as a celebrity pitcher in games around the world.

Since 1999, Lee has been an ambassador for Major League Baseball to Cuba helping to bring Cuban players to the US and setting up goodwill tours especially to Canada.

In 2007, Lee joined former major league players Dennis &quot;Oil Can&quot; Boyd, Marquis Grissom, Delino DeShields, and Ken Ryan on the Oil Can Boyd&#x27;s Traveling All-Stars. In June 2008, Lee pitched for the Alaska Goldpanners during the annual Midnight Sun ball game played at night during the Summer Solstice.

In September 2010, Lee pitched innings for the Brockton Rox (a team that was then a member of the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball), picking up the win. At the age of 63, that win made him the oldest pitcher to appear in or to win a professional baseball game.

On October 8, 2011, Lee participated in the &quot;100 Innings of Baseball Game&quot; hosted by the Boston Amateur Baseball Network to raise money for ALS (Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease). On August 23, 2012, Lee pitched a nine-inning complete game for the San Rafael Pacifics in San Rafael, California, beating the Na Koa Ikaika Maui 9–4. Using a homemade bat in the fifth inning, he drove in the first run of the game for the Pacifics. Lee was signed to a one-day contract by Pacifics&#x27; President and General Manager Mike Shapiro. Lee&#x27;s bat and uniform were donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame following the game as the start gave him the record for the oldest pitcher to make a starting appearance, pitch a complete game and also to earn a win in a professional baseball game. In 2013, Lee played all nine positions in one game for the Pacifics.

Lee lives in northern Vermont with his third wife. He is also a regular on &quot;Melnick in the Afternoon&quot; with Mitch Melnick at TSN 690 sports radio in Montreal in a segment called &quot;Answers from Space&quot;. In 2007, Lee was featured in &quot;High Times&quot;, a counterculture, pro-marijuana magazine. He also makes frequent appearances on &quot;Sports Overnight America&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio program hosted by Gerrie Burke (a long-time friend) out of San Francisco.

He is also a regular coach/pro at the annual Red Sox Baseball Fantasy Camp run by the Red Sox Organization in Florida at the team&#x27;s Spring Training Facility.

Lee was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2000.

In 2009, Lee released his own wine label, &quot;Spaceman Red&quot; wine, a California syrah, cabernet and petite sirah blend, produced with winemaker and longtime friend Geoff Whitman, and distributed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. A large portion of the wine project’s proceeds go to support Inner City Youth Baseball and the Red Sox Scholars programs in New England. In 2022, Spaceman Red will be produced by Whitman in Napa, California. In 2004, he released a beer in partnership with Vermont&#x27;s Magic Hat Brewing Company. Called Spaceman Ale, it is no longer in production.

On September 2, 2018, Lee played designated hitter for the Ottawa Champions.

Lee has been affiliated with the Savannah Bananas, an independent baseball team that also puts on comedic performances. He has occasionally appeared in games for the team as a relief pitcher. On August 19, 2022 Lee collapsed while warming up in the bullpen for a game and was taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

===&quot;Spaceman: A Baseball Odyssey&quot;===
In 2003, filmmakers Brett Rapkin and Josh Dixon joined Lee on a barnstorming trip to Cuba, gathering footage for the documentary film &quot;Spaceman: A Baseball Odyssey&quot;. The film premiered at the 2006 SILVERDOCS AFI/Discovery Channel Documentary Festival and later on the New England Sports Network and MLB Network. It is distributed across North America by Hart Sharp Video.

===&quot;Spaceman&quot; (film)===

&quot;Spaceman&quot; is a biographical film about Lee written and directed by Brett Rapkin and starring Josh Duhamel as Lee.

==Political career==
In 1988, Lee was the Rhinoceros Party presidential candidate running on a platform of bulldozing the Rocky Mountains so Alberta could receive a few extra minutes of sunlight and banning guns and butter. His slogan was &quot;No guns, no butter. Both can kill.&quot;

===2016 gubernatorial campaign===
A longtime resident of Craftsbury, Vermont, in May 2016, Lee was chosen by the Liberty Union Party as its nominee for governor in the 2016 election. Lee, who had never heard of the Liberty Union Party before, was contacted by the party to run for governor and accepted. Lee did not take campaign contributions. His campaign slogan was, &quot;So far left, we&#x27;re right&quot;. Lee is a supporter of Bernie Sanders but sees himself as &quot;Bernie-heavy not Bernie-lite&quot; arguing he is Sanders&#x27; policy twin. During the campaign he advocated for a Canadian style health care system, revealing that he got his shoulder surgery in Canada for $5000, estimating it would have cost $50,000 to $70,000 in the US.

Lee lost the election, receiving 8,912 votes (2.78%), the second highest number of votes for a Liberty Union gubernatorial candidate in the party&#x27;s history, second only to Bernie Sanders himself in 1976 who got 11,317 votes (6.1%).

<doc id="445171" wikidata="Q4868359" url="?curid=445171" title="Bastle house">
<text>Bastel, bastle, or bastille houses are a type of construction found along the Anglo-Scottish border, in the areas formerly plagued by border reivers. They are fortified farmhouses, characterised by security measures against raids. Their name is said to derive from the French word &quot;bastille&quot;.

==Characteristics==
The characteristics of the classic bastle house are extremely thick stone walls (about 1 metre thick), with the ground floor devoted to stable space for the most valuable animals, and a vaulted stone or flat timber floor between it and the first floor with internal access such as a stairway or ladder. The family&#x27;s living quarters were on the floor above the ground, and during the times before the suppression of the reivers, were only reachable by a ladder which was pulled up from the inside at night. The windows were small or even only arrow slits.

Bastle houses have many characteristics in common with military blockhouses, the main difference being that a bastle was intended primarily as a family dwelling, instead of a pure fortification.

Many bastle houses survive today; their construction ensured that they would last a very long time, but most are either ruined or much altered for use as residences or farm buildings. They may be seen on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border. Some well-preserved examples are Thropton Pele, Hole Bastle, Woodhouses Bastle and Black Middens Bastle.

<doc id="445172" wikidata="Q128635597" url="?curid=445172" title="Eephus">
<text>Eephus is a 2024 sports film directed by Carson Lund about the final game of an amateur New England baseball league before their stadium is demolished. The film premiered in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it was eligible for the Caméra d&#x27;Or award. The film stars Keith William Richards in his first lead role.

== Premise ==
In a small Massachusetts town in the 1990s, the Adler&#x27;s Paint baseball team, led by Ed Mortainian, face the Riverdogs, led by Graham Morris, in one last game before their stadium is demolished to make room for a new school.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
&quot;Eephus&quot; was filmed on location at Soldiers Field in Douglas, Massachusetts. While the film&#x27;s story centers on this real-life baseball field, the plot concerning the demolition of the field and the construction of a school was fictional. Lund cited &quot;Goodbye, Dragon Inn&quot; as an influence on the film&#x27;s story.

Lund co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Eephus&quot; with Michael Basta and Nate Fisher. Due to his experience as a director of photography, Lund had hoped to serve as cinematographer on the film, but chose Greg Tango for the role when this proved impractical.

== Release ==
&quot;Eephus&quot; world-premiered on May 9, 2024 in the Director&#x27;s Fortnight section of the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. The film also screened at Filmfest München on June 30, 2024, and was selected for the Meeting Point section of the 69th Valladolid International Film Festival.

The film made its North American premiere in the Main Slate of the 62nd New York Film Festival on October 2, 2024. It will also screen at AFI Fest on October 25, 2024. It is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 7, 2025.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===

In a review for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, critic Christian Zilko praised how &quot;Eephus&quot; approached social relationships between men. He lauded the filmmakers&#x27; choice to make a school the cause of the stadium&#x27;s demolition, arguing this decision takes the focus off of a potential villain eroding social space and keeps the emphasis on the passage of time. Echoing these sentiments, Jessica Kiang of &quot;Variety&quot; characterized &quot;Eephus&quot; as an &quot;adorably existential, off-kilter take on the sports movie.&quot;

<text>Earl of Leven (pronounced &quot;&quot;Lee&quot;-ven&quot;) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1641 for Alexander Leslie. He was succeeded by his grandson Alexander, who was in turn followed by his daughters Margaret and Catherine (who are usually not included in the numbering of the Earls). Thereafter, there was a dispute relating to succession to the title between David Melville and John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes. However, in 1681, Melville&#x27;s claim was admitted after the Duke of Rothes died. In 1707, Melville succeeded to the title [[Earl of Melville]], and thereafter the earldoms have been united.

The other titles held by the Earl are: Viscount of Kirkaldie (created 1690), Lord Melville of Monymaill (1616), Lord Balgonie (1641), Lord Raith, Monymaill and Balwearie (1690). All are in the Peerage of Scotland.
The heir apparent to the Earldoms is styled Lord Balgonie.

The family seat is Glenferness House, near Nairn, Highland.

Archibald Ronald Leslie-Melville (born 1957), whose heir presumptive is the present peer&#x27;s first cousin once removed James Hugh Leslie-Melville (born 1960), a grandson of the 13th Earl by the Hon. George David Leslie Melville (1924–1997), the younger twin brother of the 14th Earl. Leslie-Melville&#x27;s heir is his elder son John Alistair Leslie-Melville (born 1991).

<text>Ivan &quot;Ico&quot; Hitrec (13 April 1911 – 11 October 1946) was a Croatian and Yugoslav football player.

He was the first technical officer and in his office in the Zagreb power-works in Gundulićeva Street, the best players from Građanski met and discussed forming a new club with blue shirts which later became Dinamo Zagreb.

==Club career==
The centre-forward became a legend after scoring twice against then famous Spanish keeper Ricardo Zamora during the first night game in Zagreb between Zagreb and Madrid in 1931. As one of the first Croatian international players, he went on to play for Grasshopper of Switzerland, and &quot;Kicker&quot;, at the time the foremost sports journal in Europe, chose him as a member of the European elite 11.

==International career==
Hitrec was a goal-scorer for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia national team. He appeared in 14 international games and scored 9 goals in 7 of them. He was one of seven Croatian players to boycott the Yugoslavia national team at the 1930 FIFA World Cup after the Football Association of Yugoslavia was moved from Zagreb to Belgrade. His final international was an October 1939 friendly match against Germany.

==Style of play==
Hitrec&#x27;s play was characterized by excellent technique and dribbling skills. He was able to sprint 100 meters in under 12 seconds in football conditions making him one of the fastest footballers of the era. He was also known for very powerful kicks, and was quoted as saying jokingly that he did not like to perform 11 m penalty kicks because they were &quot;too close&quot; (to the goal). Severino Minelli, his Grasshopper teammate, reminisced about Hitrec: &quot;I played many matches where Hitrec was brilliant, the best. But, above all, I remember his kicks. Frightful! Goalkeepers would move away from his balls, I&#x27;m not exaggerating, that&#x27;s indeed how it was.&quot;

<text>Anger management is a psycho-therapeutic program for anger prevention and control. It has been described as deploying anger successfully. Anger is frequently a result of frustration, or of feeling blocked or thwarted from something the subject feels is important. Anger can also be a defensive response to underlying fear or feelings of vulnerability or powerlessness. Anger management programs consider anger to be a motivation caused by an identifiable reason which can be logically analyzed and addressed.

== Overview ==

The ideal goal of anger management is to control and regulate anger so that it does not result in problems. Anger is an active emotion that calls a person feeling it to respond. People get into anger issues because both the instigator and instigated lack interpersonal and social skills to maintain self-control. Research on affect and self-regulation shows that 
it occurs because negative emotional states often impairs impulse control. They can train to respond to their anger as unwanted and unpleasant rather than react to its need. Turning a blind eye or forgiveness is a tool to turn anger off. Getting enough sleep, exercise and good diet are tools which can assist in preventing anger. Professionals who deal with those who have trouble managing anger include occupational therapists, mental health counselors, drug and alcohol counselors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.

==History==

The negative effects of anger have been observed throughout history. Advice for countering seemingly uncontrollable rage has been offered by ancient philosophers, pious men, and modern psychologists. In &quot;de Ira,&quot; Seneca the Younger (4 BC – 65 AD) advised for pre-emptively guarding against confrontational situations, perspective taking, and not inciting anger in anger-prone individuals. Other philosophers echoed Seneca with Galen recommending seeking out a mentor for aid in anger reduction. In the Middle Ages, the people would serve as both examples of self-control and mediators of anger-induced disputes. Examples of intercession for the common people from the wrath of local rulers abound in hagiographies. The story of St. Francis of Assisi and the metaphorical Wolf of Gubbio is one famous instance.

In modern times, the concept of controlling anger has translated into anger management programs based on the research of psychologists. Classical psychotherapy based anger management interventions originated in the 1970s. Success in treating anxiety with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions developed by Meichebaum inspired Novaco to modify the stress inoculation training to be suitable for anger management. Stress and anger are sufficiently similar that such a modification was able to create a successful branch of treatment. Both stress and anger are caused by external stimuli, mediated by internal processing, and expressed in either adaptive or maladaptive forms. Meichebaum, and later Novaco, used each aspect of experiencing the relevant emotion as an opportunity for improvement to the patient&#x27;s overall well-being.

== Potential causes for development of problems ==
===Medical causes===
Drug addiction, alcoholism, a mental disability, biochemical changes and PTSD can all lead to a person committing an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills on how to handle oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness or depression.

Migraines: Frequent migraine can be associated with levels of aggression and the need for anger management. A 2013 study examined migraines and its association with anger problems in young children (m = 11.2 years of age). The patients in the study were split into low migraine attack frequency (AF), intermediate AF, high frequency, and chronic migraine AF. The tendency for a participant to inhibit his anger and not lash out was found more in children with higher AF. Children that qualified for low migraine AF actually had more anger expression.

===Psychological causes===
Psychological factors such as stress, abuse, poor social or familial situations, and poverty can be linked to anger problems. Without proper anger management, individuals may be more prone to violence. They also may have increased stress levels, which can have both mental and physical symptoms if not taken care of sooner rather than later. Thankfully, there are many different methods of treatment that can help an individual control and cope with their anger.

=== Trauma ===
A history of trauma can result in increased anger. Anger is not associated with aggression in all individuals with symptoms of PTSD. Sexual trauma is particularly correlated with anger, as well as childhood trauma since more often than not, they either didn&#x27;t know what was going on and/or didn&#x27;t have any control over what was going on. It is important to recognize and validate trauma, rather than ignoring it and having their symptoms worsen.

== Types of treatment ==

Anger treatments&#x27; success rates can be difficult to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The best practice for anger treatment is to use multiple techniques rather than a single technique. The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment. The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of meta-analyses. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy. In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted. Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long-lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of aggression, but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.

Some effective anger management techniques include relaxation techniques, monitored breathing exercises, cognitive restructuring and imagery (e.g. Stosny&#x27;s Healing imagery Explain oneself emphatically what and why it makes you respond angrily Apply kindness and compassion to self Love oneself Solving the co-morbid problems phases), problem solving, improving communication strategies and interpersonal skills (DEAR MAN &amp; GIVE). 

=== Decreasing arousal ===
A 2024 meta-analysis of 154 studies found that anger management treatments that focus on decreasing arousal are effective in decreasing anger and aggression. These include breathwork, mindfulness and meditation.

Relaxation therapy can reduce cognition and motivations to act out, and through relaxation, clients gain coping skills to better manage their anger. This therapy addresses various aspects of anger such as physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social. These aspects combined are what make relaxation an effective treatment for anger. Mindfulness attempts to teach clients acceptance of bodily sensations and emotions. Mindfulness originated in Eastern spiritual traditions that are practiced through meditation. A two-prong component of mindfulness includes: self-regulation and orientation toward the present moment. The center of this therapy technique is experiencing the present moment in a non-judgmental manner that is reflective of meditation. In practice, clients observe breathing, sitting and walking during meditations. The goal is for clients to understand that his or her thoughts of anger are merely thoughts rather than reality. Mindfulness is also a technique used in the relaxation approach because the technique halts physiological arousal. An example of this is &quot;Meditation on the Soles of the Feet (SoF)&quot; which has been shown to help persons with mild intellectual disability decrease aggressive behavior by mindfully focusing on the soles of their feet.

=== Catharsis ===
Following psychoanalytic theory, there is a belief that expressing anger can reduce it through catharsis. A 2024 meta-analysis found no evidence for this hypothesis. Anger management interventions that increased arousal (such as hitting a bag, jogging or cycling) had no effect on anger and aggression. 

=== Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program ===

The Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) is a program that was used in a study consisting of Air Force families. The families were assigned to either a traditional multi-couple group format or a self-directed book version focusing on relationship satisfaction and anger management skills. There was a significant main effect for time related to both relationship satisfaction (pretest M = 49.8, SD = 17.6; post-test M = 53.8, SD = 17.6, F(1, 76) = 6.91, p &lt; .01), and anger management skills, (pretest M = 32.2, SD = 4.2; post-test M = 34.6, SD = 4.0, F(1, 74) = 31.79, p &lt; .001).

The self-directed book version did not show as positive of results. Improving a couple&#x27;s anger management skills can be a vital step in ensuring there are no violent outbreaks throughout the relationship.

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===

The use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is frequent in anger management treatment. By trying to get patients to open up about their emotions and feelings and being driven to accomplish a specific task (in this case controlling anger), a person is cognitively motivated to use positive skills towards their behavior.

Studies show using a mix of CBT as well as other therapies on the participants/clients increased the effective usage of the anger management techniques and that they also felt more in control of their own anger. Personal changes like these can lead to less aggression and fewer violent acts. The use of play therapy with this is also found efficient in tackling anger issues among children.

Rational emotive behavior therapy explains anger through the client&#x27;s beliefs and emotion, rather than the event itself. The concept involves clients interpreting events in a rational manner in order to avoid irrational thoughts that lead to anger. Delayed reaction technique is when clients attempt to uncover what is making them angry before acting out on their anger. This allows them to have time to change what is making them angry and increase time before their response; this encourages thought on a more rational level. In addition, clients are also encouraged to avoid demands in an anti-oppressive order to avoid anger. An example of a demand placed on a client may be that, &quot;I have to have this done by my standards&quot;. Research is starting to show that the better individuals understand what anger management is and how it can help them personally and in relationships, aggressive actions are less likely to occur.

=== Positive mentalization and personal development ===

This is a style that is commonly used in elementary schools for students expressing anger outbursts. Researchers who have looked into the reason for young student anger have found that one common reason could be the inability to adjust socially. Students that were selected for this study received a daily one-hour session throughout one week of school. The researchers of the mentalization program educated children through group therapy in positive psychology and tried to do activities that put the child in a happy mood while interacting. At the end of the week, research showed that there was a negative correlation between anger and social adjustment. This process lowered the overall anger levels of the students involved in social adjustment deficits.

Use of personal development (PD) led to higher views of themselves and more positive self-esteem. Aggression has been shown to be a result of poor self-worth as well as thinking that those around us do not care or support us, so this PD is vital in helping change a person&#x27;s self-perception.

=== Anger journaling ===

Understanding one&#x27;s own emotions can be a crucial piece of learning how to deal with anger. Children who wrote down their negative emotions in an &quot;anger diary&quot; actually ended up improving their emotional understanding, which in turn led to less aggression. When it comes to dealing with their emotions, children show the ability to learn best by seeing direct examples of instances that led to certain levels of anger. By seeing the reasons why they got angry, they can in the future try to avoid those actions or be prepared for the feeling they experience if they do find themselves doing something that typically results in them being angry.

Simply logging episodes of anger could also be beneficial. Middle school students with emotional disorders who completed regular “anger logs” showed pronounced improvement of anger management. According to Keller, Bry and Salvador, students who used anger logs “were observed to exhibit significantly more prosocial behaviors toward their teachers and showed a trend toward exhibiting fewer negative behaviors toward peers”.

Reflecting on feelings of anger in writing can be a type of Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CBI), or a self-strategy used to combat negative thoughts.

=== Other evidence-based approaches ===

Anger management interventions are based in cognitive behavioral techniques and follow in a three-step process. First, the client learns to identify situations that can potentially trigger the feeling of anger. A situation that elicits anger is often referred to as an anger cue. If a potential trigger can be avoided, the individual can not only avoid unwanted outbursts, but also avoid internal conflict. Often anger occurs through automatic thought and irrational beliefs, these pose a problem for treatment because the patient may respond too quickly to change the thought or behavior. Wright, Day, &amp; Howells referred to this phenomenon as the &quot;hijacking of the cognitive system by the emotional system&quot;. Second, relaxation techniques are taught as appropriate responses to the identified situations. Common techniques include regulating breathing and physically removing themselves from the situation. Finally, role-play is used to practice the application of the learned techniques for future encounters with anger-inducing situations in the individual&#x27;s life. The result of repetition is an automatic response of learned beneficial techniques. Modifications of each general step result in distinctive programs. Additionally, different fields of psychology will change aspects of the above three-step process, which is primarily based in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Group, family, and relaxation only therapies each contribute to the wider range of available anger management programs.

=== Medication ===
As anger is a psychological concern, treating with medication is a secondary line of approach. However, if there is a medical reason for an anger response certain psychotropic medications are prescribed by doctors to complement the psychotherapy intervention. Medications include antidepressants, anti-psychotics, anti-seizure medications, and beta blockers. These drugs specifically do not target anger directly, but they have a calming outcome that can support control of rage and negative feeling.

Antidepressants may have a particular role when anger is a manifestation of depression. Anger attacks are found in 40% of those with major depressive disorder with 64–71% of cases responding to an SSRI such as fluoxetine.

==Affected populations==

===Adults===
One motivation for seeking anger management can be career-related. As both a preventative and corrective tool, anger management is available to help individuals cope with potentially anger-inducing aspects of their jobs. One such situation applies to caretakers of individuals with mental illness. The daily stress combined with slow or no progress with the people under their care can create a high level of frustration. Skills training for caretakers of relatives with dementia has been developed to help cope with these feelings of frustration in a positive manner.

Anger management is also beneficial in law enforcement. The role of police officers is to protect civilians, however, conflicts between the police and the general public can develop. The goal of anger management would be to reduce such occurrences like police brutality from negatively impacting the relationship between law enforcement and citizens. Anger management programs tailored towards this goal could orient themselves towards these means by focusing on conflict resolution and including specific law enforcement scenarios in the training. This need was noticed by Novaco, who originally designed an intervention for anger management based on cognitive behavioral therapy, resulting in a specialized skills training program for law enforcement.

Couples also in the brink of dissolution of their marriage need to understand what to do about intimate partner violence, and the more knowledgeable the individuals are on how to manage their anger, the better prepared they are when confronted with a problem with another person.

===Children and adolescents===
The ability for young children to understand their emotions and how to react in certain situations can greatly increase their chance of expressing themselves in an appropriate manner. A 2010 study from the &quot;Journal of Applied School Psychology&quot; looked at four 4th grade boys who took part in different activities with the school psychologist, ranging from how to deal with emotions to practicing anger reduction strategies. They found a positive correlation between partaking in these meetings and less anger expressing in a multitude of locations (school, home, etc.).

Anger management programs with a cognitive-behavioral basis have been modified for children and adolescents. There are three common types of CBT aimed at the youth. First, life skills development (communication, empathy, assertiveness, etc.) uses modeling to teach appropriate reactions to anger. Second, effective education focuses on identifying the feelings of anger and relaxation. Finally, problem solving conveys a view of cause and effect for situations as an alternative to anger. A wide range of methods can be used to convey these three components, with both age and severity being important factors. For younger children, involvement can be increased by presenting anger management in more of a fun format with educational games and activities being available. For adolescents, group therapy can be an effective form given the resemblance to the individual&#x27;s natural social environment. The severity of expressed anger issues often relates to the intensity of the subsequent anger management program. A few violent outbursts in a classroom setting could result in several sessions with the school&#x27;s counselor. However, more severe juvenile delinquency could result in court-mandated anger management sessions in a juvenile correctional facility.

The effectiveness of anger management has been studied in children and adolescents for the purpose of evaluating existing programs and designing more effective programs. In a meta-analyses of 40 studies, an overall effect size of 0.67 was found for CBT anger management treatment, suggesting anger management as a legitimate approach to problematic levels of anger. Skills development (0.79) and problem solving (0.67) both had a higher impact than affective education (0.36). This was believed to be due to behavioral aspects being more easily conveyed than cognitive for children. The true value from early interventions aimed at youths comes from the preventative aspect. Curbing negative behaviors early in life could lead to a more positive outlook as an adult.

===Individuals with intellectual disabilities===

Individuals with intellectual disabilities can struggle with managing anger. When faced with aggression from individuals with an intellectual disability, caretakers often employ a combination of four different strategies. Depending on both the setting and individual, the following strategies for aggression minimization present in different ways.

# Reactive strategies – Aim to minimize impact of overtly aggressive behavior by using established protocols. E.g., enforced isolation after the start of a violent outburst.
# Ecological interventions – Attempt to reduce aggression level by changing an aspect of the environment for a more calming effect. E.g., reducing ambient noise to lower irritation.
# Contingency management – Focuses on modifying behavior through a combination of reinforcement and punishment. E.g., using a token economy to enforce rules concerning behavior.
# Positive programming – Teaches positive reaction skills as an alternative to aggression. E.g., anger management with a CBT background.

The need for anger management is also evident in situations where individuals with intellectual disabilities are prescribed psychotropic medication as the result of aggressive or self-injurious behavior. The medication&#x27;s role as a chemical restraint does not help modify the underlying cause of aggression. Sedation is best used as an emergency measure with skills training as a long-term solution to decreasing the overall rate of violent incidents. In a meta-analysis reviewing 80 studies, behavioral-based interventions were found to be generally effective in modifying behavior. Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy as administered by lay therapists was found to be effective, which supports the feasibility of such anger management programs.

This is a group that a majority of the population might not associate with having AM problems, but research shows over half of the population of Americans with intellectual disabilities displays violent and aggressive actions somewhat regularly. People with a learning disability tend to express anger and aggression to even those who help them on a daily basis. Adults with intellectual disabilities are at high risk of acting aggressive and being sent to clinics due to their actions.

The &quot;theory of the mind&quot; approach states that people with anger management problems tend to be unsteady mentally and are not able to internalize any blame for their actions. One of the main reasons for anger outbursts is externalizing blame and having a quick impulse to lash out. These individuals need to have a better understanding of what their actions mean and that they should understand that blaming themselves for problems can sometimes be the right thing to do.

One study found that offenders who were currently in high-security hospitals that went through a self-report 20 class training program had positive results. Results of the self-report showed a decrease in aggression and a lack of responding when angry. There were two issues to keep in mind though; a hospital setting and a setting in which the researchers did not want to provoke much anger due to the instability of the patients.

In one meta-analysis study composed of studies completed from 1979 to 2010, school-aged children who were identified as having aggressive personalities were given several different anger management classes. Overall, results showed slightly positive results for children receiving the classes (less aggression). The courses aimed at reducing negative emotions in the children and trying to help them with self-control. While no overarching conclusions could be made, researchers state that children going through anger management courses are more prepared to combat their anger internally and less likely to act out.

=== Substance abusers ===

There is no statistical information that shows people who substance abuse also have high rates of aggressive actions. However, researchers believe this is a group of people that should be studied due to their questionable decision-making and typically unstable mental health. Substance abusers could benefit from anger management to prevent potential aggression.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) individuals ===

This group can benefit from extended CBT dealing with anger management issues. One study dealing with n=86 war veterans found that during the 12 sessions of training, anger traits slightly dropped as well as small reductions in expressing anger. Research also indicates that their antisocial personality traits upon return can put them behind in society, so finding the right anger management courses is of vital importance. There were not significant enough findings from this study to definitely recommend veterans with PTSD to use CBT anger management courses.

=== People with traumatic brain injuries ===

People with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) can display impulsive, aggressive and dangerous actions. A study in the &quot;Brain Injury&quot; showed that one way to prevent such actions is a community-based treatment of people with TBI. Results indicated that the need to lash out diminished after the 12-week program, and a series of post-treatment testing showed a decline in self-reported frequency of angry actions. Other specific results included: significant decreases in the frequency of experiencing angry feelings and the frequency of outward expression of anger as well as significant increases in the frequency of controlling feelings of anger.

== Associated scholars ==

=== Seneca ===

One of the first people to study anger and the control of anger was the Roman philosopher Seneca. He studied anger during his lifetime, c. 4 BC – AD 65, and from his experiences and observations, he formulated ways to control anger. This could be considered an early form of anger management. Seneca noted the importance of how to avoid becoming angry, quitting being angry, and dealing with anger in other people.
Before him, Athenodorus Cananites (74 BC – 7 AD) counseled Octavian to recite the alphabet before acting in anger.

Another theorist who came after Seneca was Galen, a Roman era philosopher, who built on the work of Seneca to formulate new ideas in the area of anger management. Galen stresses the importance of a mentor to help deal with excess anger.

=== Peter Stearns ===

Sir Peter Stearns played an important part in researching the differences in anger between genders. Stearns concluded that there are similarities between male and females experience of anger. June Crawford came up with an opposing idea about how the two genders deal with anger. Her research concluded that men and women deal with anger by different means.

=== Raymond Novaco ===
Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s have contributed to many of the recent ideas on the management of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at the situations that led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated that anger is an emotional response to situations, and that anger occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral. After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify the situations that lead to anger and deal with the anger depending on the step that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.

==Benefits==
The benefits of undergoing anger management brings around the successful reduction in anger and violent outbursts. Personal relationships that have been previously strained by a high level of aggression may undergo improvement. Professionally, workplace relationships have a similar outcome that are beneficial to an individual&#x27;s career and personal sense of satisfaction. Legally, continued attendance to anger management programs, mandated or not, can be seen as a sign of good faith. For incarcerated individuals, an earlier parole time can be the result of good behavior learned from anger management classes. From an emotional standpoint, reducing the internal level of anger results in a decrease in stress and an increase in overall happiness as a result.

From a medical standpoint, physical illnesses also improve from positive emotional and behavioral changes. Anger management style and overall level of anger has been associated with both acute and chronic pain sensitivity. Blood pressure is another physiological aspect affected by anger, with increased levels of anger being correlated with higher blood pressure. The implications of an effect on blood pressure for overall health is made evident by the link between high blood pressure and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. An increase in the immune system&#x27;s efficacy has also been observed as a result of the increased level of relaxation. Successful anger management could also lead to an overall longer life span due to the decrease in reckless behavior and violent altercations.

==Impediments==
There are a number of factors that can lower the probability of a successful anger management intervention. One such obstacle is the level of the individual&#x27;s motivation. Overall low readiness is an impediment to the effectiveness of anger management due to the lower attendance rates and negative effect on the therapeutic alliance. Involuntary assignment to an anger management program, for example court mandated sessions, will result in a lower average motivation level than voluntary admission. In one study with incarcerated inmates, there was a correlation found between individual readiness and improvement.

Additionally, given the component of anger as a social construct, difficulty with communication between cultures can serve as another impediment. What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, a mismatch between client and therapist could result in a misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender-dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same violent outburst for a man and woman is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.

The cost of taking anger management could also be a significant obstacle if the person does not have health insurance. The time required for anger management depends on the program. Weekly one-hour sessions with eight to 12 sessions per program are common, but a single intensive all-day session variety exists as well. The monetary cost can amount to $90–$120 per session for general therapy, or much higher fees for specialized coaching. The availability of anger management programs locally can be problematic for more isolated areas, creating an additional cost for travel. However, online options can follow the same structure as an in-person intervention with similar outcomes.

<text>Earl of Melville is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1690 for the Scottish soldier and statesman George Melville, 4th Lord Melville. He was made Lord Raith, Monymaill and Balwearie and Viscount of Kirkcaldy at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He married Catherine Leslie, daughter of Alexander Leslie, Lord Balgonie, and granddaughter of Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven. Lord Melville was succeeded upon his death in 1707 by his eldest surviving son, David, who already in 1681 had succeeded to the earldom of Leven through his mother. The two earldoms have since remained united. For further history of the titles, see Earl of Leven.

The title Lord Melville, of Monymaill, was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1616 for Robert Melville, an Extraordinary Lord of Session under the judicial title Lord Murdochairnie, with remainder to his elder brother, John Melville. He was succeeded by his son, Robert, the second Lord. He was a Lord of Session under the judicial title Lord Burntisland. In 1628 he obtained a regrant of the title with remainder to his heirs general bearing the name of Melville. Lord Melville died childless and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, John Melville, the third Lord, grandson of the aforementioned John Melville, elder brother of the first Lord. The third Lord was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned fourth Lord, who was created Earl of Melville in 1690.

<doc id="445210" wikidata="Q6484933" url="?curid=445210" title="Landover Baptist Church">
<text>The Landover Baptist Church is the website of a parody fundamentalist Baptist church. The church lampoons fundamentalist, Independent Baptist churches and Biblical literalism, and originated as a satire of Liberty University.

==Origin==
The site was created by Chris Harper, who obtained his master&#x27;s degree in English literature from George Mason University in 1993 after being expelled from Liberty University (founded by Jerry Falwell) in 1989 for producing a radio show satirising the school&#x27;s procedures which Liberty&#x27;s administration found offensive. Harper responded to the expulsion by creating the Landover Baptist Church website, described by Pop Matters as both a parody and an exposé of the religious subculture at Liberty.

In an example of Poe&#x27;s law, some members of the Christian community have supported some of the outlandish stories on the website, and a book about Hello Kitty mistakenly cites a joke article on the Landover site as an example of the &quot;dead seriousness&quot; of the Christian right&#x27;s opposition to Japanese culture.

==Description==
The church is located in the fictional town of Freehold, Iowa. It is described as operating under a dictatorial structure whereby its &quot;Pastor&quot; holds all authority over the church, its members, and its extensive holdings. The church supposedly uses an elaborate fine system to maintain its authority over its members, parodying Jerry Falwell&#x27;s system at Liberty University, and in addition can force its members to comply with any and all of its wishes (a common phrase on the website used in such cases is that the member &quot;mandatorily volunteered&quot; to comply). In cases of expulsion the member is also removed from the church property. The website describes Landover as having a &quot;permanent injunction&quot; against all &quot;unsaved&quot; persons, prohibiting them from being within ten miles of the Landover property as well as forbidding them to enter Landover&#x27;s website.

Within the Landover universe, the church is described as owning well over in Freehold, with twenty-eight paid pastors, 412 full-time staff members, eleven fully equipped chapels, seven sanctuaries, a 100,000 seat amphitheater, twelve television studios, two radio stations, an academy, a university, two gated communities, twenty-seven developments, three office parks, as well as a shopping mall, amusement park, golf course, retirement community, foundation, fire and police department, circus camp, resort center, retreat center, and a number of fitness centers, swimming pools, hot springs, and cemeteries. An annual feature on the website is a story about the church&#x27;s Halloween hell house.

The site records that the initial pastor of Landover was Ben Ebeneezer Smith, and that upon his death his brother (Deacon Fred Smith) assumed the office. In and around June 2010 a &quot;coup&quot; was related to website visitors (in accordance with a spurious interpretation of ) whereby Pastor Harry Harkwell took over leadership. The site went on to describe Deacon Fred being &quot;restored&quot; to his pastorship after a &quot;reconciliation&quot; during Glenn Beck&#x27;s Restoring Honor rally.

The Landover site also features material from Betty Bowers, a fictional central character on the satirical website BettyBowers.com. Bowers is portrayed by voice actress and comedian Deven Green, appearing both in photographs and numerous satirical videos. According to Bradley&#x27;s fictional satirical biography of Bowers, she proclaims herself &quot;America&#x27;s Best Christian&quot;. Listed as a member of the Landover Baptist Church, Bowers operates several Christian ministries with names like &quot;Bringing Integrity To Christian Homemakers&quot; (B.I.T.C.H.) and &quot;Baptists Are Saving Homosexuals&quot; (B.A.S.H.).

<text>The Association of College and Research Libraries defines information literacy as a &quot;set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals&#x27; definition also makes reference to knowing both &quot;when&quot; and &quot;why&quot; information is needed.

The 1989 American Library Association (ALA) Presidential Committee on Information Literacy formally defined information literacy (IL) as attributes of an individual, stating that &quot;to be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively the needed information&quot;. In 1990, academic Lori Arp published a paper asking, &quot;Are information literacy instruction and bibliographic instruction the same?&quot; Arp argued that neither term was particularly well defined by theoreticians or practitioners in the field. Further studies were needed to lessen the confusion and continue to articulate the parameters of the question.

The Alexandria Proclamation of 2005 defined the term as a human rights issue: &quot;Information literacy empowers people in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, use and create information effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupational and educational goals. It is a basic human right in a digital world and promotes social inclusion in all nations.&quot; The United States National Forum on Information Literacy defined information literacy as &quot;the ability to know when there is a need for information, to be able to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information for the issue or problem at hand.&quot; Meanwhile, in the UK, the library professional body CILIP, define information literacy as &quot;the ability to think critically and make balanced judgements about any information we find and use. It empowers us as citizens to develop informed views and to engage fully with society.”

A number of other efforts have been made to better define the concept and its relationship to other skills and forms of literacy. Other pedagogical outcomes related to information literacy include traditional literacy, computer literacy, research skills and critical thinking skills. Information literacy as a sub-discipline is an emerging topic of interest and counter measure among educators and librarians with the prevalence of misinformation, fake news, and disinformation.

Scholars have argued that in order to maximize people&#x27;s contributions to a democratic and pluralistic society, educators should be challenging governments and the business sector to support and fund educational initiatives in information literacy.

==History of the concept==
The phrase &quot;information literacy&quot; first appeared in print in a 1974 report written on behalf of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science by Paul G. Zurkowski, who was at the time president of the Information Industry Association (now the Software and Information Industry Association). Zurkowski used the phrase to describe the &quot;techniques and skills&quot; learned by the information literate &quot;for utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary sources in molding information solutions to their problems&quot; and drew a relatively firm line between the &quot;literates&quot; and &quot;information illiterates.&quot;

The concept of information literacy appeared again in a 1976 paper by Lee Burchina presented at the Texas A&amp;M University library&#x27;s symposium. Burchina identified a set of skills needed to locate and use information for problem solving and decision making. In another 1976 article in Library Journal, M.R. Owens applied the concept to political information literacy and civic responsibility, stating, &quot;All [people] are created equal but voters with information resources are in a position to make more intelligent decisions than citizens who are information illiterates. The application of information resources to the process of decision-making to fulfill civic responsibilities is a vital necessity.&quot;

In a literature review published in an academic journal in 2020, Oral Roberts University professor Angela Sample cites several conceptual waves of information literacy definitions as defining information as a way of thinking, a set of skills, and a social practice. The introduction of these concepts led to the adoption of a mechanism called metaliteracy and the creation of threshold concepts and knowledge dispositions, which led to the creation of the ALA&#x27;s Information Literacy Framework.

The American Library Association&#x27;s Presidential Committee on Information Literacy released a report on January 10, 1989. Titled as the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report, the article outlines the importance of information literacy, opportunities to develop it, and the idea of an Information Age School. The recommendations of the Committee led to establishment of the National Forum on Information Literacy, a coalition of more than 90 national and international organizations.

In 1998, the American Association of School Librarians and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology published &quot;Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning&quot;, which further established specific goals for information literacy education, defining some nine standards in the categories of &quot;information literacy,&quot; &quot;independent learning,&quot; and &quot;social responsibility.&quot;

Also in 1998, the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy updated its final report. The report outlined six recommendations from the original report, and examined areas of challenge and progress.

In 1999, the Society of College, National and University Libraries (SCONUL) in the UK published The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy to model the relationship between information skills and IT skills, and the idea of the progression of information literacy into the curriculum of higher education.

In 2003, the National Forum on Information Literacy, along with UNESCO and the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, sponsored an international conference in Prague. Representatives from twenty-three countries gathered to discuss the importance of information literacy in a global context. The resulting Prague Declaration described information literacy as a &quot;key to social, cultural, and economic development of nations and communities, institutions and individuals in the 21st century&quot; and declared its acquisition as &quot;part of the basic human right of lifelong learning&quot;.

In the United States specifically, information literacy was prioritized in 2009  during President Barack Obama&#x27;s first term. In effort to stress the value information literacy has on everyday communication, he designated October as National Information Literacy Awareness Month in his released proclamation. 

==Presidential Committee on Information Literacy==

The American Library Association&#x27;s Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defined information literacy as the ability &quot;to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information&quot; and highlighted information literacy as a skill essential for lifelong learning and the production of an informed and prosperous citizenry.

The committee outlined six principal recommendations. Included were recommendations like &quot;Reconsider the ways we have organized information institutionally, structured information access, and defined information&#x27;s role in our lives at home in the community, and in the work place&quot;; to promote &quot;public awareness of the problems created by information illiteracy&quot;; to develop a national research agenda related to information and its use; to ensure the existence of &quot;a climate conducive to students&#x27; becoming information literate&quot;; to include information literacy concerns in teacher education democracy.

In the updated report, the committee ended with an invitation, asking the National Forum and regular citizens to recognize that &quot;the result of these combined efforts will be a citizenry which is made up of effective lifelong learners who can always find the information needed for the issue or decision at hand. This new generation of information literate citizens will truly be America&#x27;s most valuable resource,&quot; and to continue working toward an information literate world.

The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy resulted in the creation of the National Forum on Information Literacy.

==National Forum on Information Literacy==

In 1983, United States published &quot;A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform&quot;, a report declaring that a &quot;rising tide of mediocrity&quot; was eroding the foundation of the American educational system. The report has been regarded as the genesis of the current educational reform movement within the United States.

This report, in conjunction with the rapid emergence of the information society, led the American Library Association (ALA) to convene a panel of educators and librarians in 1987. The Forum, UNESCO and International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) collaborated to organize several &quot;experts meetings&quot; that resulted in the Prague Declaration (2003) and the Alexandria Proclamation (2005). Both statements underscore the importance of information literacy as a basic, fundamental human right, and consider IL as a lifelong learning skill.

==Global==

===International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)===

IFLA has established an Information Literacy Section. The Section has, in turn, developed and mounted an Information Literacy Resources Directory, called InfoLit Global. Librarians, educators and information professionals may self-register and upload information-literacy-related materials. (IFLA, Information Literacy Section, n.d.) According to the IFLA website, &quot;The primary purpose of the Information Literacy Section is to foster international cooperation in the development of information literacy education in all types of libraries and information institutions.&quot;

===The International Alliance for Information Literacy (IAIL)===
This alliance was created from the recommendation of the Prague Conference of Information Literacy Experts in 2003. One of its goals is to allow for the sharing of information literacy research and knowledge between nations. The IAIL also sees &quot;lifelong learning&quot; as a basic human right, and their ultimate goal is to use information literacy as a way to allow everyone to participate in the &quot;Information Society&quot; as a way of fulfilling this right.
The following organizations are founding members of IAIL:
*Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL), based in Australia and New Zealand
*European Network on Information Literacy (EnIL), based in the European Union
*National Forum on Information Literacy (NFIL), based in the United States
*NORDINFOlit, based in Scandinavia
*SCONUL (Society of College, National and University Libraries) Advisory Committee on Information Literacy, based in the United Kingdom

===UNESCO Media and Information Literacy===
According to the UNESCO website, their &quot;action to provide people with the skills and abilities for critical reception, assessment and use of information and media in their professional and personal lives.&quot; Their goal is to create information literate societies by creating and maintaining educational policies for information literacy. They work with teachers around the world, training them in the importance of information literacy and providing resources for them to use in their classrooms.

UNESCO publishes studies in multiple countries, looking at how information literacy is currently taught, how it differs in different demographics, and how to raise awareness. They also publish tools and curricula for school boards and teachers to implement.

==Specific aspects==
In &quot;Information Literacy as a Liberal Art,&quot; Jeremy J. Shapiro and Shelley K. Hughes (1996) advocated a more holistic approach to information literacy education, one that encouraged not merely the addition of information technology courses as an adjunct to existing curricula, but rather a radically new conceptualization of &quot;our entire educational curriculum in terms of information.&quot;

Drawing upon Enlightenment ideals like those articulated by Enlightenment philosopher Condorcet, Shapiro and Hughes argued that information literacy education is &quot;essential to the future of democracy, if citizens are to be intelligent shapers of the information society rather than its pawns, and to humanistic culture, if information is to be part of a meaningful existence rather than a routine of production and consumption.&quot;

To this end, Shapiro and Hughes outlined a &quot;prototype curriculum&quot; that encompassed the concepts of computer literacy, library skills, and &quot;a broader, critical conception of a more humanistic sort,&quot; suggesting seven important components of a holistic approach to information literacy:

*&quot;Tool literacy&quot;, or the ability to understand and use the practical and conceptual tools of current information technology relevant to education and the areas of work and professional life that the individual expects to inhabit.
*&quot;Resource literacy&quot;, or the ability to understand the form, format, location and access methods of information resources, especially daily expanding networked information resources.
*&quot;Social-structural literacy&quot;, or understanding how information is socially situated and produced.
*&quot;Research literacy&quot;, or the ability to understand and use the IT-based tools relevant to the work of today&#x27;s researcher and scholar.
*&quot;Publishing literacy&quot;, or the ability to format and publish research and ideas electronically, in textual and multimedia forms ... to introduce them into the electronic public realm and the electronic community of scholars.
*&quot;Emerging technology literacy&quot;, or the ability to continuously adapt to, understand, evaluate and make use of the continually emerging innovations in information technology so as not to be a prisoner of prior tools and resources, and to make intelligent decisions about the adoption of new ones.
*&quot;Critical literacy&quot;, or the ability to evaluate critically the intellectual, human and social strengths and weaknesses, potentials and limits, benefits and costs of information technologies.

Ira Shor further defines critical literacy as &quot;[habits] of thought, reading, writing, and speaking which go beneath surface meaning, first impressions, dominant myths, official pronouncements, traditional clichés, received wisdom, and mere opinions, to understand the deep meaning, root causes, social context, ideology, and personal consequences of any action, event, object, process, organization, experience, text, subject matter, policy, mass media, or discourse.&quot;

==Information literacy skills==
===Big6 skills===

Big6 (Eisenberg and Berkowitz 1990) is a six-step process that provides support in the activities required to solve information-based problems: task definition, information seeking strategies, location and access, use of information, synthesis, and evaluation. The Big6 skills have been used in a variety of settings to help those with a variety of needs. For example, the library of Dubai Women&#x27;s College, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates which is an English as a second language institution, uses the Big6 model for its information literacy workshops. According to Story-Huffman (2009), using Big6 at the college &quot;has transcended cultural and physical boundaries to provide a knowledge base to help students become information literate&quot; (para. 8). In primary grades, Big6 has been found to work well with variety of cognitive and language levels found in the classroom.

Issues to consider in the Big6 approach have been highlighted by Philip Doty:

Eisenberg (2004) has recognized that there are a number of challenges to effectively applying the Big6 skills, not the least of which is information overload which can overwhelm students. Part of Eisenberg&#x27;s solution is for schools to help students become discriminating users of information.

===Another conception===
This conception, used primarily in the library and information studies field, and rooted in the concepts of library instruction and bibliographic instruction, is the ability &quot;to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively the needed information.&quot; In this view, information literacy is the basis for lifelong learning. It is also the basis for evaluating contemporary sources of information.

In the publication &quot;Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning&quot; (AASL and AECT, 1998), three categories, nine standards, and twenty-nine indicators are used to describe the information literate student.

The categories and their standards are as follows:

====Category 1: Information literacy====

Standards: The student who is information literate

# accesses information efficiently and effectively.
# evaluates information critically and competently.
# uses information accurately and creatively.

====Category 2: Independent learning====

Standards: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and

# pursues information related to personal interests.
# appreciates literature and other creative expressions of information.
# strives for excellence in information seeking and knowledge generation.

====Category 3: Social responsibility====

Standards: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and

# recognizes the importance of information to a democratic society.
# practices ethical behavior in regard to information and information technology.
# participates effectively in groups to pursue and generate information.

Since information may be presented in a number of formats, the term &quot;information&quot; applies to more than just the printed word. Other literacies such as visual, media, computer, network, and basic literacies are implicit in information literacy.

Many of those who are in most need of information literacy are often amongst those least able to access the information they require:

As the Presidential Committee report points out, members of these disadvantaged groups are often unaware that libraries can provide them with the access, training and information they need. In Osborne (2004), many libraries around the country are finding numerous ways to reach many of these disadvantaged groups by discovering their needs in their own environments (including prisons) and offering them specific services in the libraries themselves.

==Effects on education==
The rapidly evolving information landscape has demonstrated a need for education methods and practices to evolve and adapt accordingly. Information literacy is a key focus of educational institutions at all levels and in order to uphold this standard, institutions are promoting a commitment to lifelong learning and an ability to seek out and identify innovations that will be needed to keep pace with or outpace changes.

Educational methods and practices, within our increasingly information-centric society, must facilitate and enhance a student&#x27;s ability to harness the power of information. Key to harnessing the power of information is the ability to evaluate information, to ascertain among other things its relevance, authenticity and modernity. The information evaluation process is crucial life skill and a basis for lifelong learning. According to Lankshear and Knobel, what is needed in our education system is a new understanding of literacy, information literacy and on literacy teaching. Educators need to learn to account for the context of our culturally and linguistically diverse and increasingly globalized societies. We also need to take account of the burgeoning variety of text forms associated with information and multimedia technologies.

Evaluation consists of several component processes including metacognition, goals, personal disposition, cognitive development, deliberation, and decision-making. This is both a difficult and complex challenge and underscores the importance of being able to think critically.

Critical thinking is an important educational outcome for students. Education institutions have experimented with several strategies to help foster critical thinking, as a means to enhance information evaluation and information literacy among students. When evaluating evidence, students should be encouraged to practice formal argumentation. Debates and formal presentations must also be encouraged to analyze and critically evaluate information.

Education professionals must underscore the importance of high information quality. Students must be trained to distinguish between fact and opinion. They must be encouraged to use cue words such as &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot; to help distinguish between factual information and opinions. Information related skills that are complex or difficult to comprehend must be broken down into smaller parts. Another approach would be to train students in familiar contexts. Education professionals should encourage students to examine &quot;causes&quot; of behaviors, actions and events. Research shows that people evaluate more effectively if causes are revealed, where available.

Information in any format is produced to convey a message and is shared via a selected delivery method. The iterative processes of researching, creating, revising, and disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these differences (Association of College, p. 5).

Some call for increased critical analysis in Information Literacy instruction. Smith (2013) identifies this as beneficial &quot;to individuals, particularly young
people during their period of formal education. It could equip them with the skills they need to understand the political system and their place within it, and, where necessary, to challenge this&quot; (p. 16).

==Education in the U.S.==

===Standards===
National content standards, state standards and information literacy skills terminology may vary, but all have common components relating to information literacy.

Information literacy skills are critical to several of the National Education Goals outlined in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, particularly in the act&#x27;s aims to increase &quot;school readiness,&quot; &quot;student achievement and citizenship,&quot; and &quot;adult literacy and lifelong learning.&quot; Of specific relevance are the &quot;focus on lifelong learning, the ability to think critically, and on the use of new and existing information for problem solving,&quot; all of which are important components of information literacy.

In 1998, the American Association of School Librarians and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology published &quot;Information Literacy Standards for Student Learning,&quot; which identified nine standards that librarians and teachers in K–12 schools could use to describe information literate students and define the relationship of information literacy to independent learning and social responsibility:

*Standard One: The student who is information literate accesses information efficiently and effectively.
*Standard Two: The student who is information literate evaluates information critically and competently.
*Standard Three: The student who is information literate uses information accurately and creatively.
*Standard Four: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and pursues information related to personal interests.
*Standard Five: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and appreciates literature and other creative expressions of information.
*Standard Six: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and strives for excellence in information seeking and knowledge generation.
*Standard Seven: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and recognizes the importance of information to a democratic society.
*Standard Eight: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and practices ethical behavior in regard to information and information technology.
*Standard Nine: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and participates effectively in groups to pursue and generate information.

In 2007 AASL expanded and restructured the standards that school librarians should strive for in their teaching. These were published as &quot;Standards for the 21st Century Learner&quot; and address several literacies: information, technology, visual, textual, and digital. These aspects of literacy were organized within four key goals: that &quot;learners use of skills, resources, &amp; tools&quot; to &quot;inquire, think critically, and gain knowledge&quot;; to &quot;draw conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new situations, and create new knowledge&quot;; to &quot;share knowledge and participate ethically and productively as members of our democratic society&quot;; and to &quot;pursue personal and aesthetic growth.&quot;

In 2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), released &quot;Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education,&quot; describing five standards and numerous performance indicators considered best practices for the implementation and assessment of postsecondary information literacy programs. The five standards are:

*Standard One: The information literate student determines the nature and extent of the information needed.
*Standard Two: The information literate student accesses needed information effectively and efficiently.
*Standard Three: The information literate student evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value system.
*Standard Four: The information literate student, individually or as a member of a group, uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose.
*Standard Five: The information literate student understands many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally.

These standards were meant to span from the simple to more complicated, or in terms of Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, from the &quot;lower order&quot; to the &quot;higher order.&quot; Lower order skills would involve for instance being able to use an online catalog to find a book relevant to an information need in an academic library. Higher order skills would involve critically evaluating and synthesizing information from multiple sources into a coherent interpretation or argument.

In 2016, the Association of College and Research Librarians (ACRL) rescinded the Standards and replaced them with the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, which offers the following set of core ideas:

*Authority is constructed and contextual
*Information creation as a process
*Information has value
*Research as inquiry
*Scholarship as conversation
*Searching as strategic exploration

The Framework is based on a cluster of interconnected core concepts, with flexible options for implementation, rather than on a set of standards or learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of skills. At the heart of this Framework are conceptual understandings that organize many other concepts and ideas about information, research, and scholarship into a coherent whole.

===K–12 education restructuring===
Today instruction methods have changed drastically from the mostly one-directional teacher-student model, to a more collaborative approach where the students themselves feel empowered. Much of this challenge is now being informed by the American Association of School Librarians that published new standards for student learning in 2007.

Within the K–12 environment, effective curriculum development is vital to imparting Information Literacy skills to students. Given the already heavy load on students, efforts must be made to avoid curriculum overload. Eisenberg strongly recommends adopting a collaborative approach to curriculum development among classroom teachers, librarians, technology teachers, and other educators. Staff must be encouraged to work together to analyze student curriculum needs, develop a broad instruction plan, set information literacy goals, and design specific unit and lesson plans that integrate the information skills and classroom content. These educators can also collaborate on teaching and assessment duties

Educators are selecting various forms of resource-based learning (authentic learning, problem-based learning and work-based learning) to help students focus on the process and to help students learn from the content. Information literacy skills are necessary components of each. Within a school setting, it is very important that a students&#x27; specific needs as well as the situational context be kept in mind when selecting topics for integrated information literacy skills instruction. The primary goal should be to provide frequent opportunities for students to learn and practice information problem solving. To this extent, it is also vital to facilitate repetition of information seeking actions and behavior. The importance of repetition in information literacy lesson plans cannot be underscored, since we tend to learn through repetition. A students&#x27; proficiency will improve over time if they are afforded regular opportunities to learn and to apply the skills they have learnt.

The process approach to education is requiring new forms of student assessment. Students demonstrate their skills, assess their own learning, and evaluate the processes by which this learning has been achieved by preparing portfolios, learning and research logs, and using rubrics.

===Efforts in K–12 education===
Information literacy efforts are underway on individual, local, and regional bases.

Many states have either fully adopted AASL information literacy standards or have adapted them to suit their needs. States such as Oregon (OSLIS, 2009) increasing rely on these guidelines for curriculum development and setting information literacy goals. Virginia, on the other hand, chose to undertake a comprehensive review, involving all relevant stakeholders and formulate its own guidelines and standards for information literacy. At an international level, two framework documents jointly produced by UNESCO and the IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) developed two framework documents that laid the foundations in helping define the educational role to be played by school libraries: the School library manifesto (1999).

Another immensely popular approach to imparting information literacy is the Big6 set of skills. Eisenberg claims that the Big6 is the most widely used model in K–12 education. This set of skills seeks to articulate the entire information seeking life cycle. The Big6 is made up of six major stages and two sub-stages under each major stages. It defines the six steps as being: task definition, information seeking strategies, location and access, use of information, synthesis, and evaluation. Such approaches seek to cover the full range of information problem-solving actions that a person would normally undertake, when faced with an information problem or with making a decision based on available resources.

===Efforts in higher education===

Information literacy instruction in higher education can take a variety of forms: stand-alone courses or classes, online tutorials, workbooks, course-related instruction, or course-integrated instruction.

The six regional accreditation boards have added information literacy to their standards. Librarians often are required to teach the concepts of information literacy during &quot;one shot&quot; classroom lectures. There are also credit courses offered by academic librarians to instruct college students in becoming more information literate. Additionally, information literacy instruction is usually tailored to a specific disciplines. One such attempt in the area of physics was published in 2009 but there are many many more published.

In 2016, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL, part of the American Library Association) adopted a new &quot;Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education,&quot; replacing the ACRL&#x27;s &quot;Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education&quot; that had been approved in 2000. The standards were largely criticized by proponents of &quot;critical information literacy&quot;, a concept deriving from critical pedagogy, for being too prescriptive. It&#x27;s termed a &quot;framework&quot; because it consists of interconnected core concepts designed to be interpreted and implemented locally depending on the context and needs of the audience. The framework draws on recent research around threshold concepts, or the ideas that are gateways to broader understanding or skills in a given discipline. It also draws on newer research around metaliteracy, and assumes a more holistic view of information literacy that includes creation and collaboration in addition to consumption, so is appropriate for current practices around social media and Web 2.0. The six concepts, or frames, are:
* Authority is constructed and contextual
* Information creation as a process
* Information has value
* Research as inquiry
* Scholarship as conversation
* Searching as strategic exploration

This draws from the concept of metaliteracy, which offers a renewed vision of information literacy as an overarching set of abilities in which students are consumers and creators of information who can participate successfully in collaborative spaces (Association of College, p. 2)
There is a growing body of scholarly research describing faculty-librarian collaboration to bring information literacy skills practice into higher education curriculum, moving beyond &quot;one shot&quot; lectures to an integrated model in which librarians help design assignments, create guides to useful course resources, and provide direct support to students throughout courses. A recent literature review indicates that there is still a lack of evidence concerning the unique information literacy practices of doctoral students, especially within disciplines such as the health sciences.

There have also been efforts in higher education to highlight issues of data privacy, as they relate to information literacy. For example, at the University of North Florida, in 2021, data privacy was added to their Library and Information Studies curriculum. The history of data privacy was included in this change, as well as topics such as, &quot;data collection, data brokers, browser fingerprinting, cookies, data security, IP ranges, SSO, http vs https, anonymization, encryption, opt out vs opt in. These are all areas in which information professionals can improve information literacy, through understanding data privacy, practicing good techniques for data privacy, and teaching patrons about the importance/techniques for data privacy. Additionally, information literacy instruction has been offered focusing on fake news.

===Distance education===

Now that information literacy has become a part of the core curriculum at many post-secondary institutions, the library community is charged to provide information literacy instruction in a variety of formats, including online learning and distance education. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) addresses this need in its Guidelines for Distance Education Services (2000):

Within the e-learning and distance education worlds, providing effective information literacy programs brings together the challenges of both distance librarianship and instruction. With the prevalence of course management systems such as WebCT and Blackboard, library staff are embedding information literacy training within academic programs and within individual classes themselves.

== Education in Singapore ==

=== Public education ===
In October 2013, the National Library of Singapore (NLB) created the S.U.R.E, (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) campaign. The objectives and strategies of the S.U.R.E. campaign were first presented at the 2014 IFLA WLIC. It is summarised by NLB as simplifying information literacy into four basic building blocks, to &quot;promote and educate the importance of Information Literacy and discernment in information searching.&quot;

Public events furthering the S.U.R.E. campaign were organised 2015. This was called the &quot;Super S.U.R.E. Show&quot; involving speakers to engage the public with their anecdotes and other learning points, for example the ability to separate fact from opinion.

=== Higher Education ===
Information literacy is taught by librarians at institutes of higher education. Some components of information literacy are embedded in the undergraduate curriculum at the National University of Singapore.

==Assessment==
Many academic libraries are participating in a culture of assessment, and attempt to show the value of their information literacy interventions to their students. Librarians use a variety of techniques for this assessment, some of which aim to empower students and librarians and resist adherence to unquestioned norms. Information literacy instruction has been shown to improve student outcomes in higher education. Oakleaf describes the benefits and dangers of various assessment approaches: fixed-choice tests, performance assessments, and rubrics.

==Public libraries==
In public libraries, information literacy is connected to lifelong learning, development of employability skills, personal health management, and informal learning.

<text>Biodynamic agriculture is a form of alternative agriculture based on pseudo-scientific and esoteric concepts initially developed in 1924 by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). It was the first of the organic farming movements. It treats soil fertility, plant growth, and livestock care as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasizing spiritual and mystical perspectives.

Biodynamics has much in common with other organic approaches – it emphasizes the use of manures and composts and excludes the use of synthetic (artificial) fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on soil and plants. Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals, crops, and soil as a single system, an emphasis from its beginnings on local production and distribution systems, its use of traditional and development of new local breeds and varieties. Some methods use an astrological sowing and planting calendar. Biodynamic agriculture uses various herbal and mineral additives for compost additives and field sprays; these are prepared using methods that are more akin to sympathetic magic than agronomy, such as burying ground quartz stuffed into the horn of a cow, which are said to harvest &quot;cosmic forces in the soil&quot;.

No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and integrated farming practices. Biodynamic agriculture is a pseudoscience as it lacks scientific evidence for its efficacy because of its reliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs.

As of 2022, biodynamic techniques were used on 255,051 hectares in 65 countries, led by Germany, Italy and France. Germany accounts for 42% of the global total. The remainder average 1,750 ha per country. Biodynamic methods of cultivating grapevines have been taken up by several notable vineyards. There are certification agencies for biodynamic products, most of which are members of the international biodynamics standards group Demeter International.

==History==
=== Origin of a theory ===

Biodynamics was the first modern organic agriculture. Its development began in 1924 with a series of eight lectures on agriculture given by philosopher Rudolf Steiner at Schloss Koberwitz in Silesia, Germany (now Kobierzyce in Poland). These lectures, the first known presentation of organic agriculture, were held in response to a request by farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers. The 111 attendees, fewer than half of whom were farmers, came from six countries, primarily Germany and Poland. The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as &quot;The Agriculture Course&quot;.

Steiner emphasized that the methods he proposed should be tested experimentally. For this purpose, Steiner established a research group, the &quot;Agricultural Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners of the General Anthroposophical Society&quot;. Between 1924 and 1939, this research group attracted about 800 members from around the world, including Europe, the Americas and Australasia. Another group, the &quot;Association for Research in Anthroposophical Agriculture&quot; (&quot;Versuchsring anthroposophischer Landwirte&quot;), directed by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch, was formed to test the effects of biodynamic methods on the life and health of soil, plants and animals; the group published a monthly journal, &quot;Demeter&quot;. Bartsch was also instrumental in developing a sales organisation for biodynamic products, Demeter, which still exists today. The Research Association was renamed the Imperial Association for Biodynamic Agriculture (&quot;Reichsverband für biologisch-dynamische Wirtschaftsweise&quot;) in 1933. It was dissolved by the National Socialist regime in 1941. In 1931 the association had 250 members in Germany, 109 in Switzerland, 104 in other European countries and 24 outside Europe. The oldest biodynamic farms are the Wurzerhof in Austria and Marienhöhe in Germany.

In 1938, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer&#x27;s text, &quot;Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening&quot;, was published in five languages – English, Dutch, Italian, French, and German; this became the standard work in the field for several decades. In July 1939, at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne, Pfeiffer travelled to the UK and presented the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne&#x27;s farm in Kent. The conference has been described as the &#x27;missing link&#x27; between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming because, in the year after Betteshanger, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, &quot;Look to the Land&quot;, in which he coined the term &#x27;organic farming&#x27; and praised the methods of Rudolf Steiner. In the 1950s, Hans Mueller was encouraged by Steiner&#x27;s work to create the organic-biological farming method in Switzerland; this later developed to become the largest certifier of organic products in Europe, &quot;Bioland&quot;.

===Geographic developments===

Today biodynamics is practiced in more than 50 countries worldwide and in a variety of circumstances, ranging from temperate arable farming, viticulture in France, cotton production in Egypt, to silkworm breeding in China. Demeter International is the primary certification agency for farms and gardens using the methods. In 2020 Demeter International and the International Biodynamic Association joined to become the Biodynamic Federation – Demeter International.

* In the United States, biodynamic farming dates from 1926. From 1926 through to 1938, 39 farmers and gardeners in the US pursued biodynamic practices. The Biodynamic Farming &amp; Gardening Association was founded in 1938 as a New York state corporation.
* In Great Britain, biodynamic farming dates from 1927. In 1928 the &quot;Anthroposophical Agricultural Foundation&quot; was founded in England; this is now called the &quot;Biodynamic Agriculture Association&quot;. In 1939, Britain&#x27;s first biodynamic agriculture conference, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Agriculture, was held at Lord Northbourne&#x27;s farm in Kent; Ehrenfried Pfeiffer was the lead presenter.
* In Australia, the first biodynamic farmer was Ernesto Genoni who in 1928 joined the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners, followed soon after by his brother Emilio Genoni. Ernesto Genoni&#x27;s first biodynamic farm was at Dalmore, in Gippsland, Victoria, in 1933. The following year, Ileen Macpherson and Ernesto Genoni founded Demeter Biological Farm at Dandenong, Victoria, in 1934 and it was farmed using biodynamic principles for over two decades. Bob Williams presented the first public lecture in Australia on biodynamic agriculture on 26 June 1938 at the home of the architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin at Castlecrag, Sydney. Since the 1950s research work has continued at the Biodynamic Research Institute (BDRI) in Powelltown, near Melbourne under the direction of Alex Podolinsky. In 1989 Biodynamic Agriculture Australia was established, as a not for profit association.
* In France the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) was formed in 1972 with five founding members, one of which was the Swedish Biodynamic Association.
* The University of Kassel had a Department of Biodynamic Agriculture from 2006 to March 2011.
*Emerson College (UK) was founded in 1962 and named after Ralph Waldo Emerson, American poet and transcendentalist. Since then it has held courses inspired by the philosophy and teachings of Rudolf Steiner, including on biodynamic agriculture.
*In Canada, there are currently three biodynamic organizations, The Society for Biodynamic Farming and Gardening in Ontario, The Biodynamic Agricultural Society of British Columbia and the Association de Biodynamie du Québec that are members of Demeter Canada.

==Biodynamic method of farming==
In common with other forms of organic agriculture, biodynamic agriculture uses management practices that are intended to &quot;restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony&quot;. Central features include crop diversification, the avoidance of chemical soil treatments and off-farm inputs generally, decentralized production and distribution, and the consideration of celestial and terrestrial influences on biological organisms. The Demeter Association recommends that &quot;(a) minimum of ten percent of the total farm acreage be set aside as a biodiversity preserve. That may include but is not limited to forests, wetlands, riparian corridors, and intentionally planted insectaries. Diversity in crop rotation and perennial planting is required: no annual crop can be planted in the same field for more than two years in succession. Bare tillage year round is prohibited so land needs to maintain adequate green cover.&quot;

The Demeter Association also recommends that the individual design of the land &quot;by the farmer, as determined by site conditions, is one of the basic tenets of biodynamic agriculture. This principle emphasizes that humans have a responsibility for the development of their ecological and social environment which goes beyond economic aims and the principles of descriptive ecology.&quot; Crops, livestock, and farmer, and &quot;the entire socioeconomic environment&quot; form a unique interaction, which biodynamic farming tries to &quot;actively shape ...through a variety of management practices. The prime objective is always to encourage healthy conditions for life&quot;: soil fertility, plant and animal health, and product quality. &quot;The farmer seeks to enhance and support the forces of nature that lead to healthy crops, and rejects farm management practices that damage the environment, soil, plant, animal or human health...the farm is conceived of as an organism, a self-contained entity with its own individuality,&quot; holistically conceived and self-sustaining. &quot;Disease and insect control are addressed through botanical species diversity, predator habitat, balanced crop nutrition, and attention to light penetration and airflow. Weed control emphasizes prevention, including timing of planting, mulching, and identifying and avoiding the spread of invasive weed species.&quot;

Biodynamic agriculture differs from many forms of organic agriculture in its spiritual, mystical, and astrological orientation. It shares a spiritual focus, as well as its view toward improving humanity, with the &quot;nature farming&quot; movement in Japan. Important features include the use of livestock manures to sustain plant growth (recycling of nutrients), maintenance and improvement of soil quality, and the health and well-being of crops and animals. Cover crops, green manures and crop rotations are used extensively and the farms to foster the diversity of plant and animal life, and to enhance the biological cycles and the biological activity of the soil.

Biodynamic farms often have a cultural component and encourage local community, both through developing local sales and through on-farm community building activities. Some biodynamic farms use the Community Supported Agriculture model, which has connections with social threefolding.

Compared to non-organic agriculture, BD farming practices have been found to be more resilient to environmental challenges, to foster a diverse biosphere, and to be more energy efficient, factors Eric Lichtfouse describes being of increasing importance in the face of climate change, energy scarcity and population growth.

===Biodynamic preparations===
In his &quot;agricultural course&quot; Steiner prescribed nine different preparations to aid fertilization, and described how these were to be prepared. Steiner believed that these preparations mediated terrestrial and cosmic forces into the soil. The prepared substances are numbered 500 through 508, where the first two are used for preparing fields, and the other seven are used for making compost. A long term trial (DOK experiment) evaluating the biodynamic farming system in comparison with organic and conventional farming systems, found that both organic farming and biodynamic farming resulted in enhanced soil properties, but had lower yields than conventional farming. Regarding compost development beyond accelerating the initial phase of composting, some positive effects have been noted:
* The field sprays contain substances that stimulate plant growth including cytokinins.
* Some improvement in nutrient content of compost is evident from the ingredients included, but not necessarily as a result of the practices and exact preparations as Steiner described them.

Although the preparations have direct nutrient values, modern biodynamic practitioners believe their benefit is to support the self-regulating capacities of the biota already present in the soil and compost. Critics of the practice have pointed out that no evidence or logic underlies the practices themselves, which instead are dependent on magical thinking and debunked theories of Steiner himself. There is no evidence that biodynamic practices have any benefit beyond the direct nutrients they add as fertilizer, which may itself be of smaller benefit than other traditionally organic or commercial fertilizers.

====Field preparations====
Field preparations, for stimulating humus formation:
* 500: A humus mixture prepared by filling a cow&#x27;s horn with cow manure and burying it in the ground (40–60 cm below the surface) in the autumn. It is left to decompose during the winter and recovered for use as fertilizer the following spring.
* 501: Crushed powdered quartz stuffed into a cow&#x27;s horn and buried in the ground in springtime and taken out in autumn. It can be mixed with 500 but is usually prepared on its own. The mixture is sprayed under very low pressure over the crop during the wet season, as a supposed antifungal.

====Compost preparations====
The compost preparations Steiner recommended employ herbs which are frequently used in alternative medical remedies. Many of the same herbs Steiner referenced are used in organic practices to make foliar fertilizers, green manure, or in composting. The preparations Steiner discussed were:
* 502: Yarrow blossoms (&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;) stuffed into the urinary bladders from red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), placed in the sun during summer, buried in the ground during winter, and retrieved in the spring.
* 503: Chamomile blossoms (&quot;Matricaria recutita&quot;) stuffed into the small intestines of cattle, buried in humus-rich earth in the autumn, and retrieved in the spring.
* 504: Stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;) plants in full bloom stuffed together underground surrounded on all sides by peat for a year.
* 505: Oak bark (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) chopped in small pieces, placed inside the skull of a domesticated animal, surrounded by peat, and buried in the ground in a place near rain runoff.
* 506: Dandelion flowers (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot;) stuffed into the mesentery of a cow, buried in the ground during winter, and retrieved in the spring.
* 507: Valerian flowers (&quot;Valeriana officinalis&quot;) extracted into water.
* 508: Horsetail (&quot;Equisetum&quot;).

===Planting calendar===
The approach considers that there are lunar and astrological influences on soil and plant development—for example, choosing to plant, cultivate, or harvest various crops based on both the phase of the moon and the zodiacal constellation the moon is passing through, and also depending on whether the crop is the root, leaf, flower, or fruit of the plant. This aspect of biodynamics has been termed &quot;astrological&quot; and &quot;pseudoscientific&quot; in nature.

===Seed production===
Biodynamic agriculture has focused on the open pollination of seeds (with farmers thereby generally growing their own seed) and the development of locally adapted varieties.

==Biodynamic certification==
The Demeter biodynamic certification system established in 1924 was the first certification and labelling system for organic production. As of 2018, to receive certification as biodynamic, the farm must meet the following standards: agronomic guidelines, greenhouse management, structural components, livestock guidelines, and post-harvest handling and processing procedures.

The term &quot;Biodynamic&quot; is a trademark held by the Demeter association of biodynamic farmers for the purpose of maintaining production standards used both in farming and processing foodstuffs. The trademark is intended to protect both the consumer and the producers of biodynamic produce. Demeter International an organization of member countries; each country has its own Demeter organization which is required to meet international production standards (but can also exceed them). The original Demeter organization was founded in 1928; the U.S. Demeter Association was formed in the 1980s and certified its first farm in 1982. In France, Biodyvin certifies biodynamic wine. In Egypt, SEKEM has created the Egyptian Biodynamic Association (EBDA), an association that provides training for farmers to become certified. As of 2006, more than 200 wineries worldwide were certified as biodynamic; numerous other wineries employ biodynamic methods to a greater or lesser extent.

== Effectiveness ==
Research into biodynamic farming has been complicated by the difficulty of isolating the distinctively biodynamic aspects when conducting comparative trials. Consequently, there is no strong body of material that provides evidence of any specific effect.

Since biodynamic farming is a form of organic farming, it can be generally assumed to share its characteristics, including &quot;less stressed soils and thus diverse and highly interrelated soil communities&quot;.

A 2009/2011 review found that biodynamically cultivated fields:
* had lower absolute yields than conventional farms, but achieved better efficiency of production relative to the amount of energy used;
* had greater earthworm populations and biomass than conventional farms.

Both factors were similar to the result in organically cultivated fields.

== Reception ==

In a 2002 newspaper editorial, Peter Treue, agricultural researcher at the University of Kiel, characterized biodynamics as pseudoscience and argued that similar or equal results can be obtained using standard organic farming principles. He wrote that some biodynamic preparations more resemble alchemy or magic akin to geomancy.

In a 1994 analysis, Holger Kirchmann, a soil researcher with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, concluded that Steiner&#x27;s instructions were occult and dogmatic, and cannot contribute to the development of alternative or sustainable agriculture. According to Kirchmann, many of Steiner&#x27;s statements are not provable because scientifically clear hypotheses cannot be made from his descriptions. Kirchmann asserted that when methods of biodynamic agriculture were tested scientifically, the results were unconvincing. Further, in a 2004 overview of biodynamic agriculture, Linda Chalker-Scott, a researcher at Washington State University, characterized biodynamics as pseudoscience, writing that Steiner did not use scientific methods to formulate his theory of biodynamics, and that the later addition of valid organic farming techniques has &quot;muddled the discussion&quot; of Steiner&#x27;s original idea. Based on the scant scientific testing of biodynamics, Chalker-Scott concluded &quot;no evidence exists&quot; that homeopathic preparations improve the soil.

In Michael Shermer&#x27;s &quot;The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot;, Dan Dugan says that the way biodynamic preparations are supposed to be implemented are formulated solely on the basis of Steiner&#x27;s &quot;own insight&quot;. Skeptic Brian Dunning writes &quot;the best way to think of &#x27;biodynamic agriculture&#x27; would be as a magic spell cast over an entire farm. Biodynamics sees an entire farm as a single organism, with something that they call a life force.&quot;

Florian Leiber, Nikolai Fuchs and Hartmut Spieß, researchers at the Goetheanum, have defended the principles of biodynamics and suggested that critiques of biodynamic agriculture which deny it scientific credibility are &quot;not in keeping with the facts...as they take no notice of large areas of biodynamic management and research&quot;. Biodynamic farmers are &quot;charged with developing a continuous dialogue between biodynamic science and the natural sciences &quot;sensu stricto&quot;&quot;, despite important differences in paradigms, world views, and value systems.

Philosopher of science Michael Ruse has written that followers of biodynamic agriculture rather enjoy the scientific marginalisation that comes from its pseudoscientific basis, revelling both in its esoteric aspects and the impression that they were in the vanguard of the wider anti-science sentiment that has grown in opposition to modern methods such as genetic modification.

Steiner&#x27;s theory was similar to those of the agricultural scientist Richard Krzymowski, who was teaching in Breslau since 1922. The environmental scientist Frank M. Rauch mentioned in 1995, concerning the reprint of a book from Raoul Heinrich Francé, another source probably used by Steiner.

According to a scientific paper of Holger Kirchmann in 2021, the auras and forces mentioned by Steiner are not known to science. His statement (hypothesis) of “living forces” affecting crops cannot be tested, and is thus not falsifiable. However, when a hypothesis is not falsifiable, this is a sign of pseudoscience.

A research team from the Botanical Garden and Department of Experimental and Social Sciences Education of the Faculty of Teacher Training of the University of Valencia warned in 2021 about the risk of pseudoscience in relation with myths or beliefs about the influence of the moon on agriculture. The findings of this scientific review of over 100 papers (including scientific articles, papers and higher education textbooks) have been published in the journal &quot;Agronomy&quot;. They found that there is no reliable, science-based evidence for any relationship between lunar phases and plant physiology in any plant–science related textbooks or peer-reviewed journal articles justifying agricultural practices conditioned by the Moon. Nor does evidence from the field of physics support a causal relationship between lunar forces and plant responses. Therefore, popular agricultural practices that are tied to lunar phases have no scientific backing.

<doc id="445232" wikidata="Q951898" url="?curid=445232" title="Trompe le Monde">
<text>Trompe le Monde is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released on September 23, 1991 on 4AD in the United Kingdom and on September 24, 1991, on Elektra Records in the United States. Recorded in Burbank, California, Paris and London, the album was produced by Gil Norton, and was Pixies&#x27; final studio album before their break-up two years later. There would be no Pixies&#x27; albums of new material for 23 years after &quot;Trompe le Monde.&quot;

==Composition==
&quot;Head On&quot; is a cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain track. It was released as a single and reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. 

&quot;U-Mass&quot; is a song about the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Black Francis met Joey Santiago before dropping out to form Pixies. In a 2001 interview, Santiago recalled that the original guitar riff was written while they were still enrolled at the school.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album name comes from the title of the first track, &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, a French phrase () meaning &quot;Fool the World&quot;. Unlike previous albums, the title of the album comes from the name of a song (rather than a song lyric), and is a play on the French phrase &quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, a painting technique in which the painter fools the viewer into thinking objects presented are real. On some versions of the CD, the title is erroneously printed as &quot;Tromp le Monde&quot; on the disc itself.

== Critical reception ==
Michael Bonner of &quot;Lime Lizard&quot; described &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; as &quot;one of the best albums that you may very well ever hear&quot; and &quot;a strong contender for best album of the 20th century&quot;. 

In a retrospective review, AllMusic writer Heather Phares noted the reduced role of Kim Deal, calling it &quot;essentially Black Francis&#x27; solo debut&quot;. Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; named &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; his ninth favorite album of the 1990s, describing it as &quot;clean-lined sci-fi popmetal, perpetually underrated.&quot;

<doc id="445233" wikidata="Q1039472" url="?curid=445233" title="SNK vs. Capcom">
<text>SNK vs. Capcom, or alternately Capcom vs. SNK, is a series of crossover video games by either Capcom or SNK featuring characters that appear in games created by either company. Most of these are fighting games, and take on a similar format to Capcom&#x27;s own &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series, in which the players create teams of fighters and have them fight each other. Games in this series either contain &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; or &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; in their titles, with the first company named denoting the company behind the game&#x27;s development.

Reception to the series has been varied; while the Capcom-developed titles were the most positively-received (and are still widely well regarded by critics), the SNK-developed installments received more mixed reviews by the time of its releases, although these have been the subject of reappraisal as time went on, now being considered cult classics by players and critics alike.

==History==


The supposed origin behind this series was an issue of &quot;Arcadia&quot; magazine in which there were articles covering both &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, both of which were released at around the same time. Readers had misread the cover, which said &quot;KOF vs. SF&quot;, to mean that there was a fighting game that would pit characters from &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. Because of this uproar, Capcom and SNK supposedly signed a deal that would allow them to produce only two fighting games concerning both franchises in 1999 (the &quot;Card Fighters&quot; series (see below) were not fighting games and therefore were exempt from the rule). It is highly suggested that &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; was only made in order to fulfill the contract obligations that SNK made prior to the company filing bankruptcy and their eventual closing in 2000. Also, if one company was the main creator of one game, the distributing company would gain the profits and not the company that licensed the characters for use (although SNK gave the rights to use the SNK characters to Capcom for the first &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; game, SNK did not profit from the game, which did not help their financial problems).

===Series hiatus===
In a 2021 interview with &quot;Polygon&quot;, director Hideaki Itsuno confirmed that at one point, there had been plans for a new, 3D installment in the series, but that it had been cancelled due to SNK&#x27;s bankruptcy. The 3D assets created for &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 3&quot; were later repurposed for the cancelled &quot;Capcom Fighting All-Stars&quot;; said project was set to include &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; protagonist Kyo Kusanagi as a guest character during its planned release after a deal was struck with the then-reformed SNK Playmore. There were interviews with SNK that it would be possible to renew their contract with Capcom to make new &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; games, but in another interview, both companies stated that they would not do any further collaboration with each other, claiming &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS&quot; would probably be the last crossover game between both companies. However, in an interview from January 2009, Yoshinori Ono, the producer of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, expressed interest in a possible third game if fans demanded it.

While no new &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; titles have been released since &quot;Card Fighters DS&quot;, characters from both companies have appeared together in a handful of titles by other developers, including Bandai Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, and Cygames&#x27; &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot;.

====Crossover appearances and re-releases====
&quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; were re-released for the first time in 2021 and 2022 respectively on Windows and Nintendo Switch. In March 2022, &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters were added to Netmarble and SNK&#x27;s &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;. In August 2022, SNK and Capcom artists Eisuke Ogura and Shinkiro – the latter of whom is currently at Capcom after famously working at SNK – created special promotional posters featuring both companies&#x27; characters to celebrate the 2022 Evolution Championship Series tournament, the first live EVO since the COVID-19 pandemic. In a subsequent interview, SNK producer Yasuyuki Oda stated that &quot;both parties&quot; were interested in a potential revival of the series. Oda stated in a later interview that the EVO artwork opened the doors for further collaboration between the two companies.

Multiple crossovers between SNK and Capcom were announced throughout 2024. At Summer Game Fest in June, both Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui were revealed as part of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;″s second season of downloadable content, making them the first third-party guest characters in a mainline &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game. The next month, during EVO 2024, a re-release of &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; for Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 was announced and released that day. The following August, it was announced that the Capcom-developed titles in the series would be included in &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;, set for release in 2025. During Tokyo Game Show in September, it was announced that Ken Masters and Chun-Li would be part of the first season of DLC for &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;, similarly making them the first third-party guest characters in a &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; game. These announcements sparked speculation about a potential revival of the series, an interest acknowledged by Capcom producer Shuhei Matsumoto in an interview. In another interview, Oda stated that while there were certain hurdles in the way, they were aware of the fan demand and the odds of a revival were not impossible.

**A version for GameCube and Xbox was released under the title of &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO&quot;. According to the Japanese official website for the GameCube version, &quot;EO&quot; stands for &quot;Easy Operation&quot;, because of a new feature that allows the player to assign special techniques to the right analog stick (C Stick for the GameCube version). This version will also be included in &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

==Characters==

==Reception==

<doc id="445234" wikidata="Q1750824" url="?curid=445234" title="StepMania">
<text>StepMania is a cross-platform rhythm video game and engine. It was originally developed as a clone of Konami&#x27;s arcade game series &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, and has since evolved into an extensible rhythm game engine capable of supporting a variety of rhythm-based game types. Released under the MIT License, &quot;StepMania&quot; is open-source free software.

Several video game series use &quot;StepMania&quot; as their game engines. This includes &quot;In the Groove&quot;, &quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot;, &quot;Pump It Up Infinity&quot;, and &quot;StepManiaX&quot;. &quot;StepMania&quot; was included in a video game exhibition at New York&#x27;s Museum of the Moving Image in 2005.

==Development==
&quot;StepMania&quot; was originally developed as an open-source clone of Konami&#x27;s arcade game series &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; (DDR). During the first three major versions, the Interface was based heavily on DDR&#x27;s. New versions were released relatively quickly at first, culminating in version 3.9 in 2005. In 2010, after almost 5 years of work without a stable release, &quot;StepMania&quot; creator Chris Danford forked a 2006 build of &quot;StepMania&quot;, paused development on the bleeding edge branch, and labeled the new branch &quot;StepMania&quot; 4 beta. A separate development team called the Spinal Shark Collective forked the bleeding-edge branch and continued work on it, branding it sm-ssc. On 30 May 2011, sm-ssc gained official status and was renamed &quot;StepMania&quot; 5.0. Development on the upcoming version, 5.1, has gone cold over the past few years after a couple of betas were released over at GitHub. &quot;Project OutFox&quot; (formerly known as &quot;StepMania&quot; 5.3, initially labeled as &quot;FoxMania&quot;) is a currently closed-source fork of the 5.0 and 5.1 codebase originally planned to reintegrate in StepMania, however further in development, it was decided to become an independent project due to its larger scope of goals while still sharing codebase improvements to future versions of StepMania. These improvements include modernizing the original codebase to improve performance and graphical fidelity, refurbishing aspects of the engine that have been neglected, and to improve and expand its support for other game types and styles.

==Gameplay==
The primary game type features the following game play: as arrows scroll upwards (or downwards if the player has selected the &quot;Reverse&quot; scroll modifier) on the screen, they meet a normally stationary set of target arrows. When they do, the player presses the corresponding arrows on their keyboard or dance mat. The moving arrows meet the targets based on the beat of the song. The game is scored based upon how accurately the player can trigger the arrows in time to the beat of the song. The player&#x27;s efforts are given a letter grade and a number score that tell how well they have done. An award of AAA+ (triple A plus, formerly AAAA or quadruple A) is the highest possible award available on a standard installation and indicates that a player has triggered all arrows with &quot;Flawless&quot; timing (within 0.0225 seconds under official settings) and avoided all mines and completed all hold (freeze) arrows. An E indicates failure for a player to survive the length of the song without completely draining their life gauge. Default scoring and grading for &quot;StepMania&quot; is similar to scoring in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;; however, timing and scoring settings can easily be changed.

During a song, if the player successfully triggers all arrows with &quot;great&quot; or better timing, the player will receive the message &quot;Full combo&quot; alongside their grade. Players can also achieve &quot;Full perfect combo&quot; for completing a song with all arrows triggered with perfect timing or better, and a &quot;Full flawless combo&quot; if all arrows are triggered with &quot;flawless&quot; timing.

&quot;StepMania&quot; allows for several input options. Specialized adapters that connect console peripherals like PS2 and Xbox controllers or dance pads to one&#x27;s computer can be used. Alternatively, the keyboard can be used to tap out the rhythms using arrow or other keys. Many song charts designed for keyboard are unable to be passed using a pad. In addition, the game possesses the capability to emulate other music games, such as &quot;Beatmania&quot; itself, o2Jam and &quot;DJMax&quot;&#x27;s 7-key arrangement, &quot;Pump It Up&quot; and &quot;TechnoMotion&quot; - scoring however, remains similar to old DDR-style play by default (i.e. more weight is given for later notes).

==Features==
*Custom Songs (&quot;Stepfiles&quot;) also known as &quot;Simfiles&quot;: StepMania allows users to create their own custom dance patterns to any song in .ogg or .mp3 format. The program includes a comprehensive Step editor to aid the creation of these stepfiles. Many Simfile websites exist where users share and distributed Simfiles for songs. Additionally, official DDR and &quot;In The Groove&quot; songs with their original steps are commonly available for StepMania.
*Background animations: Support for many types of animations behind the arrows onscreen, including sprite-based animation sequences, a single full-motion video or multiple FMV visualization overlays but are disabled if the song contains exclusive video.
*Modifiers: Visual mods that affect the scroll of arrows and either increase or decrease difficulty. StepMania includes multiple modifiers featured in Dance Dance Revolution as well as dozens of additional modifiers created exclusively for StepMania, including custom SPEED options.
*Multiple arrow types:
** Mines (&quot;Shock&quot; arrows in &quot;DDR X&quot;): An object that scrolls onto the screen along with the arrows. If a player triggers the mines, they will be penalized by having their dance gauge reduced and, customizing a theme, breaks the current combo chain that the player had going. However, the mines in &quot;StepMania&quot; are different from the Shock Arrows in &quot;DDR X i&quot;n that the latter also turns the notes invisible for a brief period of time and breaks the current combo chain that the player had going. This step type was developed for the &quot;StepMania&quot;-based arcade game &quot;In The Groove&quot;, and was ported into &quot;StepMania&quot; itself during development of that title. There are several variations of these objects that effect scoring in different ways.
** Holds (also called Freeze Arrows): A long arrow that requires you to keep your feet or finger on the corresponding panel for its duration.
** Rolls: A special hold arrow which requires a rapid tap on to keep alive. This step type was developed for the sequel to &quot;In The Groove&quot;, &quot;In the Groove 2&quot;.
** Lift: a special type of arrow (colored Gray by default) which requires the key (or panel) to be held down before the note passes and released when the note passes the target arrows. This is different from freeze arrows in that the timing of the press is not important, only when the note is released.
* Multiple game types, including partial simulation of other rhythm games like &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, &quot;ParaParaParadise&quot; and &quot;beatmania IIDX&quot;.
* Real-time lyrics, which display on the opposite side of the screen for stepfiles that have accompanying lyric data.
* Custom themes: users can create their own skins for &quot;StepMania&quot;. Themes can vary from simple replacement of images to drastic changes that can be implemented by scripting its Lua backend.
* Dancing characters: 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional character models that dance in the background according to a pre-defined routine.
* Infinite BPMs: an official implementation in &quot;StepMania&quot; 4 of a bug in the 3.9 series that could be exploited to create &quot;warps&quot; in stepcharts using negative speeds.
* Network play: support for lobby-based online play, dubbed &quot;StepMania Online.&quot; Typically, users connect through the &quot;StepMania Online&quot; centralized server. Support for network play was added to the &quot;StepMania&quot; tree in 2005 and is available in all later builds. All players must have a copy of the song chosen by the host in order to play.

==Availability==

Some versions of &quot;StepMania&quot; will run on most common operating systems (Microsoft Windows 98/Me/2000/XP/Vista/7/8, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X), as well as the Xbox console. It has also been used as the base engine in a variety of free software and proprietary products for various platforms.

===Use in products===
Several &quot;StepMania&quot;-based commercial games have been released due to its open nature:

*&quot;In the Groove&quot; (ITG) is an arcade dance game series developed by the core &quot;StepMania&quot; developers, and is based on 3.9 and a CVS build of StepMania often known as version 3.95. To prevent unauthorized copying, &quot;StepMania&quot; was re-licensed under a more permissive license (changed from GPL to the MIT License with the agreement of all coders, in exchange for their names appearing on the ITG credits screen), not requiring source code to be published on derivative works, and thus allowing ITG&#x27;s copy control to remain proprietary and closed source.
*&quot;Pump It Up Pro&quot; is a spinoff of the &quot;Pump it Up&quot; series headed by former ITG developers and musicians. The game utilizes a build of StepMania 4 for its engine, which also led to improved Pump support in &quot;StepMania&quot; itself.
*&quot;Pump It Up Infinity&quot; is another spinoff of the &quot;Pump it Up&quot; series aimed primarily at North American audiences. Unlike the Pro series, however, it is managed directly by Andamiro. The game is based on &quot;StepMania&quot; 5.
* &quot;StepManiaX&quot; is a spiritual successor to In The Groove, with the addition of the Center panel and other features.

==StepMix==
&quot;StepMania&quot; developers conducted StepMix contest for step builders to create stepcharts/stepfiles that can be played using &quot;StepMania&quot;. StepMix 1, 2, 3, and 4 were run successfully. Participants need to have a song to be used in the stepchart/stepfile. The song must be under a compatible license for distribution or be authorized for use in StepMix 4, or the entry is automatically disqualified. Additionally, if the graphics used in the entry are found to have been copied from another artist and used without their authorization (as happened once in StepMix 2), the entry may be disqualified.

The scoring is determined by the overall quality of the song, steps and graphics.

== Reception ==
&quot;StepMania&quot; became a quite popular free software game; the game was downloaded alone over SourceForge between 2001 and May 2017 over 6.3 million times.

<doc id="445239" wikidata="Q1542052" url="?curid=445239" title="Active learning">
<text>Active learning is &quot;a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active learning, depending on student involvement.&quot; states that &quot;students participate [in active learning] when they are doing something besides passively listening.&quot; According to Hanson and Moser (2003) using active teaching techniques in the classroom can create better academic outcomes for students. Scheyvens, Griffin, Jocoy, Liu, &amp; Bradford (2008) further noted that &quot;by utilizing learning strategies that can include small-group work, role-play and simulations, data collection and analysis, active learning is purported to increase student interest and motivation and to build students ‘critical thinking, problem-solving and social skills&quot;. In a report from the Association for the Study of Higher Education, authors discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting active learning. They cite literature that indicates students must do more than just listen in order to learn. They must read, write, discuss, and be engaged in solving problems. This process relates to the three learning domains referred to as knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA). This taxonomy of learning behaviors can be thought of as &quot;the goals of the learning process.&quot; In particular, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.

==Nature of active learning==

There are a wide range of alternatives for the term &quot;active learning&quot; and specific strategies, such as: learning through play, technology-based learning, activity-based learning, group work, project method, etc. The common factors in these are some significant qualities and characteristics of active learning. Active learning is the opposite of passive learning; it is learner-centered, not teacher-centered, and requires more than just listening; the active participation of each and every student is a necessary aspect in active learning. Students must be doing things and simultaneously think about the work done and the purpose behind it so that they can enhance their higher order thinking capabilities.

Many research studies have proven that active learning as a strategy has promoted achievement levels and some others say that content mastery is possible through active learning strategies. However, some students as well as teachers find it difficult to adapt to the new learning technique.

There are intensive uses of scientific and quantitative literacy across the curriculum, and technology-based learning is also in high demand in concern with active learning.

Barnes (1989) suggested principles of active learning:
# Purposive: the relevance of the task to the students&#x27; concerns.
# Reflective: students&#x27; reflection on the meaning of what is learned.
# Negotiated: negotiation of goals and methods of learning between students and teachers.
# Critical: students appreciate different ways and means of learning the content.
# Complex: students compare learning tasks with complexities existing in real life and making reflective analysis. 
# Situation-driven: the need of the situation is considered in order to establish learning tasks. 
# Engaged: real life tasks are reflected in the activities conducted for learning.

Active learning requires appropriate learning environments through the implementation of correct strategy. Characteristics of learning environment are:
# Aligned with constructivist strategies and evolved from traditional philosophies.
# Promoting research based learning through investigation and contains authentic scholarly content.
# Encouraging leadership skills of the students through self-development activities.
# Creating atmosphere suitable for collaborative learning for building knowledgeable learning communities.
# Cultivating a dynamic environment through interdisciplinary learning and generating high-profile activities for a better learning experience.
# Integration of prior with new knowledge to incur a rich structure of knowledge among the students.
# Task-based performance enhancement by giving the students a realistic practical sense of the subject matter learnt in the classroom.

== Teacher&#x27;s characteristics in active learning ==
A study by Jerome I. Rotgans and Henk G. Schmidt showed a correlation between three teachers&#x27; characteristics and students&#x27; situational interest in an active learning classroom.

Situational interest is defined as &quot;focused attention and an affective reaction that is triggered in the moment by environmental stimuli, which may or may not last over time&quot; according to Hidi and Renninger.

students&#x27; situational interest is inspired by three teacher traits as represented in the study. The three traits are social congruence, subject-matter expertise, and cognitive congruence:

# When a teacher is socially congruent which means that he/she has a harmonious interaction with the student, the positive relationship allows students to express their opinions and participate without fear of making mistakes. Also, students will ask questions when the topic is not clear; as a result, they become more interested in the classroom.
# Subject-matter expertise: When a teacher is an expert and has a broad knowledge of the subject being taught, students are expected to work harder and put more effort into their work. In contrast, If a teacher is less knowledgeable, students might lose interest in learning. Moreover, expert teachers are more helpful to their students in an effective way. This trait will positively impact student&#x27;s success during the active learning process.
# Cognitive congruence: This happens when a teacher can simplify hard concepts and use simple terms, so students can easily understand the topic. The teacher guides the students in the learning process by asking questions and allowing students to share their thoughts without interruption. As a result, students will trust their ability to learn on their own and will develop an organized way of thinking about a topic. Therefore, they will be more engaged in an active learning classroom.

== Ensuring that all students are actively learning ==
Total participation offers two major techniques for teachers to apply in their classrooms. The first helpful tool is asking students higher-order questions instead of lower-order questions. According to Bloom&#x27;s Cognitive Taxonomy, a higher-order question will allow students to go beyond their basic knowledge, opening the door for their thinking to dive into new topics, and make connections related to real life. When students make these connections and analyze the topic that needs to be learned, the topic will become unforgettable. In contrast, lower-order questions are straightforward questions based on memorized facts or predictable conclusions. These types of questions may engage all students to participate but will not allow students to expand their thinking. They will likely forget the concept later because it lacks connections to real life, and their thinking didn&#x27;t go through deep analysis. The second tool is called &quot;The Ripple.&quot; This technique will ensure that every student will participate and come up with an answer regarding a higher-order question because it gives a student the time needed to think independently and generate ideas. The drawback of the traditional teaching method is that it only allows some students to respond to the prompt, while others may need extra time to develop ideas. &quot;The Ripple&quot; will motivate students through different stages. First, the students think independently, then they expand their ideas with peers, and finally, this discussion will expand to the whole class.

=== Constructivist framework ===
Active learning coordinates with the principles of constructivism which are, cognitive, meta-cognitive, evolving and effective in nature. Studies have shown that immediate results in construction of knowledge is not possible through active learning as the child first goes through the process of knowledge construction, knowledge recording and then knowledge absorption. This process of knowledge construction is dependent on previous knowledge of the learner where the learner is self-aware of the process of cognition and can control and regulate it by themselves. There are several aspects of learning and some of them are: 
# Learning through meaningful reception, influenced by David Ausubel, who emphasizes the previous knowledge the learner possesses and considers it a key factor in learning.
# Learning through discovery, influenced by Jerome Bruner, where students learn through discovery of ideas with the help of situations provided by the teacher.
# Conceptual change: misconceptions takes place as students discover knowledge without any guidance; teachers provide knowledge keeping in mind the common misconceptions about the content and keep an evaluatory check on the knowledge constructed by the students.
# Constructivism, influenced by researchers such as Lev Vygotsky, suggests collaborative group work within the framework of cognitive strategies like questioning, clarifying, predicting and summarizing.

== Science of active learning ==
Active learning can be used effectively for teaching comprehension and memory. The reason it is efficient is that it draws on underlying characteristics of how the brain operates during learning. These characteristics have been documented by thousands of empirical studies (e.g., Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2011) and have been organized into a set of principles. Each of these principles can be drawn on by various active learning exercises. They also offer a framework for designing activities that will promote learning; when used systematically, Stephen Kosslyn (2017) notes these principles enable students to &quot;learn effectively—sometimes without even trying to learn&quot;.

=== The principles of learning ===
One way to organize the empirical literature on learning and memory specifies 16 distinct principles, which fall under two umbrella &quot;maxims&quot;. The first maxim, &quot;Think it Through&quot;, includes principles related to paying close attention and thinking deeply about new information. The second, &quot;Make and Use Associations&quot;, focuses on techniques for organizing, storing, and retrieving information.

The principles can be summarized as follows.

==== Maxim I: Think it through ====
* Evoking deep processing: extending thinking beyond &quot;face value&quot; of information (Craig et al., 2006; Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972)
* Using desirable difficulty: ensuring that the activity is neither too easy nor too hard (Bjork, 1988, 1999; VanLehn et al., 2007)
* Eliciting the generation effect: requiring recall of relevant information (Butler &amp; Roediger, 2007; Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006)
* Engaging in deliberate practice: promoting practice focused on learning from errors (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Ericsson, Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Romer, 1993)
* Using interleaving: intermixing different problem types
* Inducing dual coding: presenting information both verbally and visually (Kosslyn, 1994; Mayer, 2001; Moreno &amp; Valdez, 2005)
* Evoking emotion: generating feelings to enhance recall (Erk et al., 2003; Levine &amp; Pizarro, 2004; McGaugh, 2003, 2004)

==== Maxim II: Make and use associations ====
* Promoting chunking: collecting information into organized units (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2003)
* Building on prior associations: connecting new information to previously stored information (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000; Glenberg &amp; Robertson, 1999; Mayer, 2001)
* Presenting foundational material first: providing basic information as a structural &quot;spine&quot; onto which new information can be attached (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000; Wandersee, Mintzes, &amp; Novak, 1994)
* Exploiting appropriate examples: offering examples of the same idea in multiple contexts (Hakel &amp; Halpern, 2005)
* Relying on principles, not rote: explicitly characterizing the dimensions, factors or mechanisms that underlie a phenomenon (Kozma &amp; Russell, 1997; Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000)
* Creating associative chaining: sequencing chunks of information into stories (Bower &amp; Clark, 1969; Graeser, Olde, &amp; Klettke, 2002)
* Using spaced practice: spreading learning out over time (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Cepeda et al., 2006, 2008; Cull, 2000)
* Establishing different contexts: associating material with a variety of settings (Hakel &amp; Halpern, 2005; Van Merrienboer et al., 2006)
* Avoiding interference: incorporating distinctive retrieval cues to avoid confusion (Adams, 1967; Anderson &amp; Neely, 1996)

Active learning typically draws on combinations of these principles. For example, a well-run debate will draw on virtually all, with the exceptions of dual coding, interleaving, and spaced practice. In contrast, passively listening to a lecture rarely draws on any.

==Active learning exercises==
Bonwell and Eison (1991) suggested learners work collaboratively, discuss materials while role-playing, debate, engage in case study, take part in cooperative learning, or produce short written exercises, etc. The argument is &quot;when should active learning exercises be used during instruction?&quot;. Numerous studies have shown that introducing active learning activities (such as simulations, games, contrasting cases, labs..) before, rather than after lectures or readings, results in , understanding, and transfer. The degree of instructor guidance students need while being &quot;active&quot; may vary according to the task and its place in a teaching unit.

In an active learning environment learners are immersed in experiences within which they engage in meaning-making inquiry, action, imagination, invention, interaction, hypothesizing and personal reflection (Cranton 2012).

Examples of &quot;active learning&quot; activities include

* A &quot;class discussion&quot; may be held in person or in an online environment. Discussions can be conducted with any class size, although it is typically more effective in smaller group settings. This environment allows for instructor guidance of the learning experience. Discussion requires the learners to think critically on the subject matter and use logic to evaluate their and others&#x27; positions. As learners are expected to discuss material constructively and intelligently, a discussion is a good follow-up activity given the unit has been sufficiently covered already. Some of the benefits of using discussion as a method of learning are that it helps students explore a diversity of perspectives, it increases intellectual agility, it shows respect for students&#x27; voices and experiences, it develops habits of collaborative learning, it helps students develop skills of synthesis and integration (Brookfield 2005). In addition, by having the teacher actively engage with the students, it allows for them to come to class better prepared and aware of what is taking place in the classroom.
* A &quot;think-pair-share&quot; activity is when learners take a minute to ponder the previous lesson, later to discuss it with one or more of their peers, finally to share it with the class as part of a formal discussion. It is during this formal discussion that the instructor should clarify misconceptions. However students need a background in the subject matter to converse in a meaningful way. Therefore, a &quot;think-pair-share&quot; exercise is useful in situations where learners can identify and relate what they already know to others. It can also help teachers or instructors to observe students and see if they understand the material being discussed. This is not a good strategy to use in large classes because of time and logistical constraints (Bonwell and Eison, 1991). Think-pair-share is helpful for the instructor as it enables organizing content and tracking students on where they are relative to the topic being discussed in class, saves time so that he/she can move to other topics, helps to make the class more interactive, provides opportunities for students to interact with each other (Radhakrishna, Ewing, and Chikthimmah, 2012).
* A &quot;learning cell&quot; is an effective way for a pair of students to study and learn together. The learning cell was developed by Marcel Goldschmid of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (Goldschmid, 1971). A learning cell is a process of learning where two students alternate asking and answering questions on commonly read materials. To prepare for the assignment, the students read the assignment and write down questions that they have about the reading. At the next class meeting, the teacher randomly puts students in pairs. The process begins by designating one student from each group to begin by asking one of their questions to the other. Once the two students discuss the question, the other student ask a question and they alternate accordingly. During this time, the teacher goes from group to group giving feedback and answering questions. This system is also called a &quot;student dyad&quot;.
* A &quot;short written exercise&quot; that is often used is the &quot;one-minute paper&quot;. This is a good way to review materials and provide feedback. However a &quot;one-minute paper&quot; does not take one minute and for students to concisely summarize it is suggested that they have at least 10 minutes to work on this exercise. (See also: .)
* A &quot;collaborative learning group&quot; is a successful way to learn different material for different classes. It is where you assign students in groups of 3-6 people and they are given an assignment or task to work on together. To create participation and draw on the wisdom of all the learners the classroom arrangement needs to be flexible seating to allow for the creation of small groups. (Bens, 2005)
* A &quot;student debate&quot; is an active way for students to learn because they allow students the chance to take a position and gather information to support their view and explain it to others.
* A &quot;reaction to a video&quot; is also an example of active learning.
* A &quot;small group discussion&quot; is also an example of active learning because it allows students to express themselves in the classroom. It is more likely for students to participate in small group discussions than in a normal classroom lecture because they are in a more comfortable setting amongst their peers, and from a sheer numbers perspective, by dividing the students up more students get opportunities to speak out. There are so many different ways a teacher can implement small group discussion in to the class, such as making a game out of it, a competition, or an assignment. Statistics show that small group discussions is more beneficial to students than large group discussions when it comes to participation, expressing thoughts, understanding issues, applying issues, and overall status of knowledge.
* &quot;Just-in-time teaching&quot; promotes active learning by using pre-class questions to create common ground among students and teachers before the class period begins. These &quot;warmup exercises&quot; are generally open ended questions designed to encourage students to prepare for class and to elicit student&#x27;s thoughts on learning goals. 
* A &quot;class game&quot; is also considered an energetic way to learn because it not only helps the students to review the course material before a big exam but it helps them to enjoy learning about a topic. Different games such as &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and crossword puzzles always seem to get the students&#x27; minds going.
* &quot;Learning by teaching&quot; is also an example of active learning because students actively research a topic and prepare the information so that they can teach it to the class. This helps students learn their own topic even better and sometimes students learn and communicate better with their peers than their teachers.
* &quot;Gallery walk&quot; is where students in groups move around the classroom or workshop actively engaging in discussions and contributing to other groups and finally constructing knowledge on a topic and sharing it.
*In a learning factory production-related subjects can be learned interactively in a realistic learning environment.
*&quot;Problem based learning&quot; or &quot;PBL&quot; is an active learning strategy that provides students with the problem first and has been found as an effective strategy with topics as advanced as medicine.

== Effective strategies in large classes ==
Transformational Active Learning Experience (TALE) could be challenging in large classes where students may exceed 200, typically found in universities.

Examples of some challenges in large classes:

* Student&#x27;s grades and academic performance might be decreased.
* The student&#x27;s ability to think critically might be lower.
* The professor&#x27;s feedback and instructions might be minimized.
* The students will become less active in the learning process.

Despite the challenges, obvious benefits can be seen; in a large class, many ideas could be generated with multiple opinions. The diverse population could expand and create strong connections and relationships between classmates.

1- Using software for students&#x27; participation without revealing their identities could be a solution to students&#x27; discomfort with representing their thoughts in front of a large population.

2-What is called the &quot;one minute paper&quot; could be a useful strategy for students to respond. When the teacher asks a question related to a topic that has been taught, students will write their answers individually within 60 seconds.

3- &quot;Think-pair-share&quot; is a method that has been used to walk students through three ways of learning. First, every student will come up with an answer regarding a question presented by the instructor. Then, Each student will share the answer with another peer for analysis and deeper thinking. Lastly, the entire class will discuss their responses together.

== Elements of High-Impact Practices ==
George D. Kuh identified High-Impact practices (HIPs) as &quot; a Specific set of practices that tended to lead to meaningful experiences for students.&quot; Kuh and his coworkers identified several elements that were important and could be applied in a wide range of learning opportunities.

# Breaking down the skills that need to be taught, one step at a time, is more beneficial than teaching a large amount of knowledge all at the same time. This concept was developed based on the Zone of Proximal Development theory by Lev Vygotsky (1978). In practice, students start a lesson with higher expectations and in a positive class environment. As a result, all students will picture their goals as achievable, leading them to trust their abilities and be encouraged to participate actively in their learning process. When lower-level students start to face some challenges, the teacher&#x27;s role becomes crucial to provide new resources and techniques to increase students&#x27; performance.
# Reaching effective learning will be a common result of &quot;spaced learning&quot;. This idea was first introduced by Hermann Ebbinghaus (1913) in his book: &quot;Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.&quot; He identified spaced learning as the process of learning new information over a long period in multiple ways using different activities.
# High-quality learning could be achievable when students have a positive relationship with their classmates and teachers. Students are more likely to get motivated and reach their goals when connecting with teachers and classmates who are supportive and helpful.
# Having diverse backgrounds in a class allows students to be exposed to different opinions and generate new ideas when connecting with peers from different identities.

== Use of technology ==
The use of multimedia and technology tools helps enhance the atmosphere of the classroom, thus enhancing the active learning experience. In this way, each student actively engages in the learning process. Teachers can use movies, videos, games, and other fun activities to enhance the effectiveness of the active learning process. The use of technology also stimulates the &quot;real-world&quot; idea of active learning as it mimics the use of technology outside of the classroom. Incorporating technology combined with active learning have been researched and found a relationship between the use and increased positive behavior, an increase in effective learning, &quot;motivation&quot; as well as a connecting between students and the outside world. The theoretical foundations of this learning process are:

# Flow: Flow is a concept to enhance the focus level of the student as each and every individual becomes aware and completely involved in the learning atmosphere. In accordance with one&#x27;s own capability and potential, through self-awareness, students perform the task at hand. The first methodology to measure flow was Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s Experience Sampling. 
# Learning styles: Acquiring knowledge through one&#x27;s own technique is called learning style. Learning occurs in accordance with potential as every child is different and has particular potential in various areas. It caters to all kinds of learners: visual, kinesthetic, cognitive and affective. 
# Locus of control: Ones with high internal locus of control believe that every situation or event is attributable to their resources and behavior. Ones with high external locus of control believe that nothing is under their control.
# Intrinsic motivation: Intrinsic motivation is a factor that deals with self-perception concerning the task at hand. Interest, attitude, and results depend on the self-perception of the given activity.

==Research evidence==
Numerous studies have shown evidence to support active learning, given adequate prior instruction.

A meta-analysis of 225 studies comparing traditional lecture to active learning in university math, science, and engineering courses found that active learning reduces failure rates from 32% to 21%, and increases student performance on course assessments and concept inventories by 0.47 standard deviations. Because the findings were so robust with regard to study methodology, extent of controls, and subject matter, the National Academy of Sciences publication suggests that it might be unethical to continue to use traditional lecture approach as a control group in such studies. The largest positive effects were seen in class sizes under 50 students and among students under-represented in STEM fields.

Richard Hake (1998) reviewed data from over 6000 physics students in 62 introductory physics courses and found that students in classes that utilized active learning and interactive engagement techniques improved 25 percent points, achieving an average gain of 48% on a standard test of physics conceptual knowledge, the Force Concept Inventory, compared to a gain of 23% for students in traditional, lecture-based courses.

Similarly, Hoellwarth &amp; Moelter (2011) showed that when instructors switched their physics classes from traditional instruction to active learning, student learning improved 38 percent points, from around 12% to over 50%, as measured by the Force Concept Inventory, which has become the standard measure of student learning in physics courses.
In &quot;Does Active Learning Work? A Review of the Research&quot;, Prince (2004) found that &quot;there is broad but uneven support for the core elements of active, collaborative, cooperative and problem-based learning&quot; in engineering education.

Michael (2006), in reviewing the applicability of active learning to physiology education, found a &quot;growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted&quot;.

In a 2012 report titled &quot;Engage to Excel&quot;, the United States President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology described how improved teaching methods, including engaging students in active learning, will increase student retention and improve performance in STEM courses. One study described in the report found that students in traditional lecture courses were twice as likely to leave engineering and three times as likely to drop out of college entirely compared with students taught using active learning techniques. In another cited study, students in a physics class that used active learning methods learned twice as much as those taught in a traditional class, as measured by test results.

Active learning has been implemented in large lectures and it has been shown that both domestic and International students perceive a wide array of benefits. In a recent study, broad improvements were shown in student engagement and understanding of unit material among international students.

Active learning approaches have also been shown to reduce the contact between students and faculty by two thirds, while maintaining learning outcomes that were at least as good, and in one case, significantly better, compared to those achieved in traditional classrooms. Additionally, students&#x27; perceptions of their learning were improved and active learning classrooms were demonstrated to lead to a more efficient use of physical space.

A 2019 study by Deslauriers et al. claimed that students have a biased perception of active learning and they feel they learn better with traditional teaching methods than active learning activities. It can be corrected by early preparation and continuous persuasion that the students are benefiting from active instruction.

In a different study conducted by Wallace et al. (2021), they came to the conclusion that in a comparison between students being taught by an active-learning instructor vs. a traditional learning instructor, students who engaged in active-learning outperformed their counterparts in exam environments. In this setting, the instructor focused on active-learning was a first-time instructor, and the individual who was teaching the traditional style of learning was a long-time instructor. The researchers acknowledged the limitations of this study in that individuals may have done better because of depth in specific sections of the class, so the researchers removed questions that could be favoring one section more than the other out of this analysis.

<doc id="445247" wikidata="Q1033718" url="?curid=445247" title="Cantarell Field">
<text>Cantarell Field or Cantarell Complex is an aging supergiant offshore oil field in Mexico. It was discovered in 1976 after oil stains were noticed by a fisherman, Rudesindo Cantarell Jimenez, in 1972. It was placed on nitrogen injection in 2000, and production peaked at in 2004. In terms of cumulative production to date, it was the largest oil field in Mexico, and one of the largest in the world. However, production has declined since 2004, falling to in 2022. In 2009 it was superseded by Ku-Maloob-Zaap as Mexico&#x27;s largest oil field.

==Location==
Cantarell is located offshore in the Bay of Campeche. This complex comprises four major fields: Akal (by far the largest), Nohoch, Chac and Kutz. The reservoirs are formed from carbonate breccia of Late Cretaceous age, the rubble from the asteroid impact that created the Chicxulub Crater. The recently discovered Sihil field (1-15,000 million barrels) contains light oil in Jurassic strata below the other reservoirs and is generally referred to as a separate field, although its development will obviously benefit from the infrastructure already in place above it. Cantarell&#x27;s oil production peaked in 2004 and has declined in subsequent years, with further decline expected in the future.
==Geology==
The Chicxulub impactor produced the Chicxulub crater and subsequent carbonate-debris breccia, which became the oil reservoir for the fields around Villahermosa and the Bay of Campeche where the Cantarell Complex is located.
The porosity is 8%-12% in the reservoir at a depth of about 1500 m, which grades from being coarse-grained to fine-grained, called Unit 1 and 2 respectively, and overlain by a seal of shaly ejecta-rich layer called Unit 3.

Following impact, the carbonate platform collapsed, depositing the coarse breccias, which were then overlain mixed and overlain by finer breccias from the consequent tsunamis. Folding occurred in the early Miocene to Pliocene and the compression forced up Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic blocks forming the Structural trap in which hydrocarbons migrated in the Miocene. There are four blocks in the Cantarell Complex, Akal, Nohoch, Chac and Kutz with the Akal block underlain by a fifth block, Sihil, where oil was discovered in 1998.

==Production history==
By 1981, the Cantarell complex was producing . However, the production rate dropped to in 1995. The nitrogen injection project, including the largest nitrogen plant in the world, installed onshore at Atasta Campeche, started operating in 2000, and it increased the production rate to , to in 2002 and to of output in 2003, which ranked Cantarell the second fastest producing oil field in the world behind Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia. However, Cantarell had much smaller oil reserves than Ghawar, so production began to decline rapidly in the second half of the decade. Unfortunately, the nitrogen has migrated into the gas, lowering its heating value and thus, economic value, and soon will require treatment to remove the nitrogen from the gas, to be able to use the gas as a fuel.

Luis Ramírez Corzo, head of PEMEX&#x27;s exploration and production division, announced on August 12, 2004 that the actual oil output from Cantarell was forecast to decline steeply from 2006 onwards, at a rate of 14% per year. In March 2006 it was reported that Cantarell had already peaked, with a second year of declining production in 2005. For 2006, the field&#x27;s output declined by 13.1%, according to Jesús Reyes Heróles, the director-general of PEMEX.

In July 2008, the daily production rate fell sharply by 36% to from a year earlier. Analysts theorize that this rapid decline is a result of production enhancement techniques causing faster short-term oil extraction at the expense of field longevity. By January 2009, oil production at Cantarell had fallen to , a drop in production of 38% for the year, resulting in a drop in total Mexican oil production of 9.2%, the fifth year in a row of declining Mexican production.

In 2008, Pemex expected Cantarell&#x27;s decline to continue to 2012 and eventually stabilizing at an output level of around . By September 2009 this figure was already achieved, marking one of the most dramatic declines ever seen in the oil industry. Production was now expected to stabilize at . However the production declined to by April 2012. The shortfall had a negative effect on Mexico&#x27;s annual government budget and sovereign-credit rating. Production continued to decline and production was at 340,000 barrels per day in June 2014. Pemex planned to spend 6 billion US dollars until 2017 to stop the decline and maintain production level at around 325,000 barrels per day for another decade. Production continued to decline, reaching 159,300 barrels per day in 2019.

In order to try to maintain heavy crude production in the Bay of Campeche, PEMEX was focusing its efforts on the development of the Ku-Maloob-Zaap complex in an adjacent area, which can be connected to the existing facilities of Cantarell. Ku-Maloob-Zaap complex is expected to produce by the end of decade. In 2009, Ku-Maloob-Zaap replaced Cantarell as Mexico&#x27;s most productive oil field.

<text>Sheldon &quot;Shelly&quot; Manne (June 11, 1920 – September 26, 1984) was an American jazz drummer. Most frequently associated with West Coast jazz, he was known for his versatility and also played in a number of other styles, including Dixieland, swing, bebop, avant-garde jazz, and later fusion. He also contributed to the musical background of hundreds of Hollywood films and television programs.

==Family and origins==
Sheldon &quot;Shelly&quot; Manne was born June 11, 1920, in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Manne&#x27;s father Max Manne and uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired many of the leading swing drummers of the day, especially Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne&#x27;s father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. 

From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also worked with a number of musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.

In 1942, during World War II, Manne joined the Coast Guard and served until 1945.

In 1943, Manne married a Rockette named Florence Butterfield (known affectionately to family and friends as &quot;Flip&quot;), a marriage that would last 41 years, until his death.

When the bebop movement began to change jazz in the 1940s, Manne loved it and adapted to the style rapidly, performing with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Around this time he also worked with rising stars like Flip Phillips, Charlie Ventura, Lennie Tristano, and Lee Konitz.

Manne rose to stardom when he became part of the working bands of Woody Herman and, especially, Stan Kenton in the late 1940s and early 1950s, winning awards and developing a following at a time when jazz was the most popular music in the United States. Joining the hard-swinging Herman outfit allowed Manne to play the bebop he loved. The controversial Kenton band, on the other hand, with its &quot;progressive jazz&quot;, presented obstacles, and many of the complex, overwrought arrangements made it harder to swing. But Manne appreciated the musical freedom that Kenton gave him and saw it as an opportunity to experiment along with what was still a highly innovative band. He rose to the challenge, finding new colors and rhythms, and developing his ability to provide support in a variety of musical situations.

==In California==
In the early 1950s, Manne left New York and settled permanently on a ranch in an outlying part of Los Angeles, where he and his wife raised horses. From this point on, he played an important role in the West Coast school of jazz, performing on the Los Angeles jazz scene with Shorty Rogers, Hampton Hawes, Red Mitchell, Art Pepper, Russ Freeman, Frank Rosolino, Chet Baker, Leroy Vinnegar, Pete Jolly, Howard McGhee, Bob Gordon, Conte Candoli, Sonny Criss, and numerous others. Many of his recordings around this time were for Lester Koenig&#x27;s Contemporary Records, where for a period Manne had a contract as an &quot;exclusive&quot; artist (that is, he needed permission to record for other labels).

Manne led a number of small groups that recorded under his name and leadership. One consisting of Manne on drums, trumpeter Joe Gordon, saxophonist Richie Kamuca, bassist Monty Budwig, and pianist Victor Feldman performed for three days in 1959 at the Black Hawk club in San Francisco. Their music was recorded on the spot, and four LPs were issued. Highly regarded as an innovative example of a &quot;live&quot; jazz recording, the Black Hawk sessions were reissued on CD in augmented form years later.

==West Coast jazz==

Manne is often associated with the once frequently criticized West Coast school of jazz. He has been considered &quot;the quintessential&quot; drummer in what was seen as a West Coast movement, though Manne himself did not care to be so pigeonholed. In the 1950s, much of what he did could be seen as in the West Coast style: performing in tightly arranged compositions in what was a cool style, as in his 1953 album named &quot;The West Coast Sound&quot;, for which he commissioned several original compositions. Some of West Coast jazz was experimental, avant-garde music several years before the more mainstream avant-garde playing of Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman (Manne also recorded with Coleman in 1959); a good deal of Manne&#x27;s work with Jimmy Giuffre was of this kind. Critics would condemn much of this music as overly cerebral.

Another side of West Coast jazz that also came under critical fire was music in a lighter style, intended for popular consumption. Manne made contributions here too. Best known is the series of albums he recorded with pianist André Previn and with members of his groups, based on music from popular Broadway shows, movies, and television programs. (The first and most successful of these was the &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; album based on songs from the musical, recorded by Previn, Manne, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar in 1956.) The recordings for the Contemporary label, with each album devoted to a single musical, are in a light, immediately appealing style aimed at popular taste. This did not always go over well with aficionados of &quot;serious&quot; jazz, which may be one reason why Manne has been frequently overlooked in accounts of major jazz drummers of the 20th century. 

Much of the music produced on the West Coast in those years, as Robert Gordon concedes, was in fact imitative and &quot;lacked the fire and intensity associated with the best jazz performances&quot;. But Gordon also points out that there is a level of musical sophistication, as well as an intensity and &quot;swing&quot;, in the music recorded by Manne with Previn and Vinnegar (and later Red Mitchell) that is missing in the many lackluster albums of this type produced by others in that period.

West Coast jazz, however, represented only a small part of Manne&#x27;s playing. In Los Angeles, and occasionally returning to New York and elsewhere, Manne recorded with musicians of all schools and styles, ranging from those of the swing era through bebop to later developments in modern jazz, including hard bop, usually seen as the antithesis of the cool jazz frequently associated with West Coast playing.

==Collaborations==

From the 78-rpm recordings of the 1940s to the LPs of the 1950s and later, to the hundreds of film soundtracks he appeared on, Manne&#x27;s recorded output was enormous and often hard to pin down. According to the jazz writer Leonard Feather, Manne&#x27;s drumming had been heard on well &quot;over a thousand LPs&quot;—a statement that Feather made in 1960, when Manne had not reached even the midpoint of his 45-year-long career.

An extremely selective list of those with whom Manne performed includes Benny Carter, Earl Hines, Clifford Brown, Zoot Sims, Ben Webster, Maynard Ferguson, Wardell Gray, Lionel Hampton, Junior Mance, Jimmy Giuffre, and Stan Getz. In the 1950s, he recorded two solid albums with Sonny Rollins—&quot;Way Out West&quot; (Contemporary, 1957) received particular acclaim and helped dispel the notion that West Coast jazz was always different from jazz made on the East Coast—and, in the 1960s, two with Bill Evans. Around the same time in 1959, Manne recorded with the traditional Benny Goodman and the iconoclastic Ornette Coleman, a striking example of his versatility.

One of Manne&#x27;s most adventurous 1960s collaborations was with Jack Marshall, the guitarist and arranger celebrated for composing the theme and incidental music for &quot;The Munsters&quot; TV show in that period. Two duet albums (&quot;Sounds Unheard Of!&quot;, 1962, and &quot;Sounds!&quot;, 1966) feature Marshall on guitar, accompanied by Manne playing drums and a wide variety of percussion instruments unusual in jazz, from &quot;Hawaiian slit bamboo sticks&quot;, to a Chinese gong, to castanets, to piccolo Boo-Bam.

Another example of Manne&#x27;s ability to transcend the narrow borders of any particular school is the series of trio albums he recorded with guitarist Barney Kessel and bassist Ray Brown as &quot;The Poll Winners&quot;. (They had all won numerous polls conducted by the popular publications of the day; the polls are now forgotten, but the albums endure, now reissued on CD.) Manne even dabbled in Dixieland and fusion, as well as &quot;Third Stream&quot; music. He participated in the revival of that jazz precursor ragtime (he appears on several albums devoted to the music of Scott Joplin), and sometimes recorded with musicians best associated with European classical music. He always, however, returned to the straight-ahead jazz he loved best.

==Style and influences==
In addition to Dave Tough and Jo Jones, Manne admired and learned from contemporaries like Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, and later from younger drummers like Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. Consciously or unconsciously, he borrowed a little from all of them, always searching to extend his playing into new territory.

Despite these and numerous other influences, however, Shelly Manne&#x27;s style of drumming was always his own—personal, precise, clear, and at the same time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.

Whether playing Dixieland, bebop, or avant-garde jazz, in big bands or in small groups, Manne&#x27;s self-professed goal was to make the music swing. His fellow musicians attested to his listening appreciatively to those around him and being ultra-sensitive to the needs and the nuances of the music played by the others in the band, his goal being to make them—and the music as a whole—sound better, rather than calling attention to himself with overbearing solos.

Manne refused to play in a powerhouse style, but his understated drumming was appreciated for its own strengths. In 1957, critic Nat Hentoff called Manne one of the most &quot;musical&quot; and &quot;illuminatively imaginative&quot; drummers. Composer and multi-instrumentalist Bob Cooper called him &quot;the most imaginative drummer I&#x27;ve worked with&quot;. In later years this kind of appreciation for what Manne could do was echoed by jazz notables like Louie Bellson, John Lewis, Ray Brown, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, and numerous others who had worked with him at various times. Composer, arranger, bandleader, and multi-instrumentalist Benny Carter was &quot;a great admirer of his work&quot;. &quot;He could read anything, get any sort of effect&quot;, said Carter, who worked closely with Manne over many decades.

Though he always insisted on the importance of time and &quot;swing&quot;, Manne&#x27;s concept of his own drumming style typically pointed to his melody-based approach. He contrasted his style with that of Max Roach: &quot;Max plays melodically from the rhythms he plays. I play rhythms from thinking melodically&quot;.

Manne had strong preferences in his choice of drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued by the sound of a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.

==Singers==
Manne was also acclaimed by singers. Jackie Cain, of the vocal team of Jackie and Roy (&quot;Roy&quot; being Roy Kral), claimed that she had &quot;never heard a drummer play so beautifully behind a singer&quot;. Jackie and Roy were only two of the many singers he played behind, recording several albums with that husband-and-wife team, with their contemporary June Christy, and with Helen Humes, originally made famous by her singing with the Count Basie orchestra.

Over decades, Manne recorded additional albums, or sometimes just sat in on drums here and there, with renowned vocalists like Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Ernestine Anderson, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Blossom Dearie, and Nancy Wilson. Not all the singers Manne accompanied were even primarily jazz artists. Performers as diverse as Teresa Brewer, Leontyne Price, Tom Waits, and Barry Manilow included Manne in their recording sessions.

==Film and television==
At first, jazz was heard in film soundtracks only when a jazz-band performance was an element of the story. Early in his career, Manne was occasionally seen and heard in the movies, for example in the 1942 film &quot;Seven Days Leave&quot;, as the drummer in the highly popular Les Brown orchestra (soon to be known as &quot;Les Brown and His Band of Renown&quot;).

In the 1950s, however, jazz began to be used for all or parts of film soundtracks, and Manne pioneered in these efforts, beginning with &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953). As jazz quickly assumed a major role in the musical background of films, so did Manne assume a major role as a drummer and percussionist on those soundtracks. A notable early example was 1955&#x27;s &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;; Manne not only played drums throughout but functioned as a personal assistant to director Otto Preminger and tutored star Frank Sinatra. The Decca soundtrack LP credits him prominently for the &quot;Drumming Sequences&quot;.

From then on, as jazz became more prominent in the movies, Manne became the go-to percussion man in the film industry; he even appeared on screen in some minor roles. A major example is Johnny Mandel&#x27;s jazz score for &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; in 1958.

Soon, Manne began to contribute to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), &quot;Hatari!&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963) are only a few of Mancini&#x27;s films where Manne&#x27;s drums and special percussive effects could be heard.

Manne frequently collaborated with Mancini in television as well, such as in the series &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; (1958–1961) and &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; (1959–1960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series &quot;Richard Diamond&quot; (music by Pete Rugolo, 1959–1960), and &quot;Checkmate&quot; (music by John Williams, 1959–1962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961).

In the late 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, such as that for &quot;The Proper Time&quot; (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and sometimes writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children&#x27;s classic &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin&#x27;s music for the cartoon series &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot; (1969–1971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, &quot;Young Billy Young&quot; (1969) and &quot;Trader Horn&quot; (1973), and, for television, &quot;Daktari&quot;, 1966–1969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children&#x27;s stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne&#x27;s drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.

==Shelly&#x27;s Manne-Hole==
Manne was part-owner of the Los Angeles nightclub Shelly&#x27;s Manne-Hole, located at 1608 North Cahuenga Boulevard from 1960 to 1972, then at a second location at Tetou&#x27;s restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard until it closed in 1973. The house band at the nightclub was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of Manne&#x27;s favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing at the club was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau and Miles Davis. A substantial number of live albums were recorded there, including &quot;Live! Shelly Manne &amp; His Men at the Manne-Hole&quot; (1961), Bill Evans&#x27;s &quot;At Shelly&#x27;s Manne-Hole&quot; (1963), Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Cannonball Adderley Live!&quot; (1964), Les McCann&#x27;s &quot;Live at Shelly&#x27;s Manne-Hole&quot; (1965) and Keith Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere Before&quot; (1969).

Late in 1973, Manne was forced to close the club for financial reasons. Stan Getz was the last artist to be featured there, at the briefly-occupied second location.

==Later career==
After the close of Shelly&#x27;s Manne-Hole, Manne refocused his attention on his own drumming. It might be argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.

From 1974 to 1977 he joined guitarist Laurindo Almeida, saxophonist and flutist Bud Shank, and bassist Ray Brown to perform as the group The L.A. Four, which recorded four albums before Manne left the ensemble.

In the 1980s, Manne recorded with such stars as trumpeter Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, saxophonist Zoot Sims, guitarists Joe Pass and Herb Ellis, and pianist John Lewis (famous as the musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet).

Meanwhile, he continued to record with various small groups of his own. Just one representative example of his work in this period is a live concert recorded at the Los Angeles club &quot;Carmelo&#x27;s&quot; in 1980 with pianists Bill Mays and Alan Broadbent and bassist Chuck Domanico. With their enthusiasm and spontaneity, and the sense that the audience in the intimate ambience of the club is participating in the music, these performances share the characteristics that had been celebrated more than two decades before in the better-known Black Hawk performances. Although this phase of his career has frequently been overlooked, Manne, by this time, had greatly refined his ability to back other musicians sympathetically, yet make his own musical thoughts clearly heard.

Manne&#x27;s heavy load of Hollywood studio work sometimes shifted his attention from his mainstream jazz playing. Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often succeeded in making art of what might be called hackwork. Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne&#x27;s labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, to which he had dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.

Manne died somewhat before the popular revival of interest in jazz had gained momentum. But in his last few years, his immense contribution to the music regained at least some local recognition, and the role Manne had played in the culture of his adopted city began to draw public appreciation. Two weeks before his sudden death of a heart attack, he was honored by the City of Los Angeles in conjunction with the Hollywood Arts Council when September 9, 1984, was declared &quot;Shelly Manne Day&quot;.

<doc id="445252" wikidata="Q740092" url="?curid=445252" title="Sibylline Oracles">
<text>The Sibylline Oracles (; sometimes called the pseudo-Sibylline Oracles) are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters ascribed to the Sibyls, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in a frenzied state. Fourteen books and eight fragments of Sibylline Oracles survive, in an edition of the 6th or 7th century AD. They are not to be confused with the original &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; of the ancient Etruscans and Romans which were burned by order of the Roman general Flavius Stilicho in the 4th century AD. Instead, the text is an &quot;odd pastiche&quot; of Hellenistic and Roman mythology interspersed with Jewish, Gnostic and early Christian legend.

The &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot; are a valuable source for information about classical mythology and early first millennium Gnostic, Hellenistic Jewish and Christian beliefs. Some apocalyptic passages scattered throughout seem to foreshadow themes of the Book of Revelation and other apocalyptic literature. The oracles have undergone extensive editing, re-writing, and redaction as they came to be exploited in wider circles.

One passage has an acrostic, spelling out a Christian code-phrase with the first letters of successive lines.

==Introduction==
The &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot; in their existing form are a chaotic medley. They consist of 12 books (or 14) of various authorship, date, and religious conception. The final arrangement, thought to be due to an unknown editor of the 6th century AD (Alexandre), does not determine identity of authorship, time, or religious belief; many of the books are merely arbitrary groupings of unrelated fragments.

These oracles were anonymous in origin and as such were apt to modification and enlargement at pleasure by Hellenistic Jews and by Christians for missionary purposes. Celsus called Christians (&#x27;sibyl-mongers&#x27; or &#x27;believers in sibyls&#x27;) because of prophecies preached among them, especially those in the book of Revelation. The preservation of the entire collection is due to Christian writers.

==Sources for the Sibylline texts==
The oldest of the surviving Sibylline oracles seem to be books 3–5, which were composed partly by Jews in Alexandria. The third oracle seems to have been composed in the reign of Ptolemy VI Philometor. Books 1–2 may have been written by Christians, though again there may have been a Jewish original that was adapted to Christian purposes.

All the oracles seem to have undergone later revision, enrichment, and adaptation by editors and authors of different religions, who added similar texts, all in the interests of their respective religions. The Sibylline oracles are therefore a pastiche of Greek and Roman pagan mythology, employing motifs of Homer and Hesiod; Judeo-Christian legends such as the Garden of Eden, Noah and the Tower of Babel; Gnostic and early Christian homilies and eschatological writings; thinly veiled references to historical figures such as Alexander the Great and Cleopatra, as well as many allusions to the events of the later Roman Empire, often portraying Rome in a negative light.

Some have suggested that the surviving texts may include some fragments or remnants of the &quot;Sibylline Books&quot; with a legendary provenance from the Cumaean Sibyl, which had been kept in temples in Rome. The original oracular books, kept in Rome, were accidentally destroyed in a fire in 83 BC, which resulted in an attempt in 76 BC to recollect them when the Roman senate sent envoys throughout the world to discover copies. This official copy existed until at least AD 405, but little is known of their contents.

That the use of the Sibylline Oracles was not always exclusive to Christians is shown by an extract from Book III concerning the Tower of Babel as quoted by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, in the late 1st century AD.

The Christian apologist Athenagoras of Athens, writing &quot;A Plea for the Christians&quot; to Marcus Aurelius in , quoted the same section of the extant Oracles verbatim, in the midst of a lengthy series of classical and pagan references including Homer and Hesiod, and stated several times that all these works should already be familiar to the Roman Emperor.

Varro enumerated ten Sibyls: Persian, Libyan, Delphic, Cimmerian, Erythrean, Samian, Cumean, Hellospontian, Phrygian, and Tiburtine. The list omits the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Egyptian Sibyls. The &quot;Suda&quot; repeats this list but identifies the Persian Sibyl with the Hebrew.

The Sibyls themselves, and the so-called Sibylline oracles, were often referred to by other early Church fathers; Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch (), Clement of Alexandria (), Lactantius (), and Augustine (), all knew various versions of the pseudo-Sibylline collections, quoted them or referred to them in paraphrase, and were willing to Christianize them, by as simple means as inserting &quot;Son of God&quot; into a passage, as Lactantius:

Some fragmentary verses that do not appear in the collections that survive are only known because they were quoted by a Church Father. Justin Martyr (), if he is truly the author of the &quot;Exhortation to the Greeks&quot;, gives such a circumstantial account of the Cumaean Sibyl that the &quot;Address&quot; is quoted here at the Cumaean Sibyl&#x27;s entry. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;Through the decline and disappearance of paganism, however, interest in them gradually diminished and they ceased to be widely read or circulated, though they were known and used during the Middle Ages in both the East and the West.&quot; Thus, a student may find echoes of their imagery and style in much early medieval literature.

These books, in spite of their pagan content, have sometimes been described as part of the Pseudepigrapha. They do not appear in the canonical lists of any Church.

==Manuscripts and editions==
The text has been transmitted in fourteen &quot;books&quot;, preserved in two distinct manuscript traditions, one containing books 1–8, the other 9–14. However, &quot;book 9&quot; consists of material from books 1–8 and &quot;book 10&quot; is identical to &quot;book 4&quot;, so that the edition by Collins (1983) contains only books 1–8 and 11–14. The main manuscripts date to the 14th to 16th centuries (Collins 1983:321):

*Group φ: books 1–8 with an anonymous prologue
**Z: Codex Hierosolymitanus Sabaiticus 419 (late 14th century)
**A: Codex Vindobonensis hist gr. XCVI 6 (15th century) 
**P: Codex Monacensis 351 (15th century) 
**B: Codex Bodleianus Baroccianus 103 (late 15th century)
**S: Codex Scorialensis II Σ 7 (late 15th century) 
**D: Codex Vallicellianus gr. 46 (16th century)
*Group ψ: books 1–8, without prologue
**F: Codex Laurentianus plut. XI 17 (15th century) 
**R: Codex Parisinus 2851 (late 15th century) 
**L: Codex Parisinus 2850 (1475) 
**T: Codex Toletanus Cat 88.44 ()
*Group Ω: books 9–14
**M: Codices Ambrosiani E64 sup. (15th century)
**Q: Codex Vaticanus 1120 (14th century) 
**V: Codex Vaticanus 743 (14th century) 
**H: Codex Monacensis gr. 312 (1541)

To this may be added the ample quotations found in the writings of the early Church Fathers.

In 1545 Xystus Betuleius (Sixt Birck of Augsburg) published at Basel an edition based on manuscript P, and the next year a version set in Latin verse appeared. Better manuscripts were used by Johannes Opsopaeus, whose edition appeared at Paris in 1599. Later editions include those by Servaas Galle (Servatius: Amsterdam 1689) and by Andrea Gallandi in his (Venice, 1765, 1788).

Books 11–14 were edited only in the 19th century. In 1817 Angelo Mai edited a further book, from a manuscript in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan () and later he discovered four more books, in the Vatican Library, none of which were continuations of the eight previously printed, but an independent collection. These are numbered XI to XIV in later editions. Several fragments of oracles taken from the works of Theophilus and Lactantius, printed in the later editions, show that even more Sibylline oracles formerly existed. In the course of the 19th century, better texts also became available for the parts previously published.

==Contents==
The Sibylline Oracles are written in hexameter. 

The 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; characterizes the Oracles as an eclectic mixture of texts of unclear origin and largely middling quality. Its speculations on the most likely provenances of the various books are as follows:
* Book 1: Christian revision of Jewish original
* Book 2: Christian revision of Jewish original
* Book 4: the oldest text; completely Jewish
* Book 5: likely Jewish, though with controversy among critics
* Book 6: Christian; likely 3rd century
* Book 7: Christian
* Book 8: first half likely 2nd century Jewish; second half Christian, likely 3rd century
* Book 11: 3rd century, Christian at least in revision
* Book 12: Christian revision of Jewish original
* Book 13: Christian, at least in revision
* Book 14: 4th century, Christian at least in revision
