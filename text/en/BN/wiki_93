<text>The &quot;Balao&quot; class was a design of United States Navy submarine used during World War II, and with 120 boats completed, the largest class of submarines in the United States Navy. An improvement on the earlier , the boats had slight internal differences. The most significant improvement was the use of thicker, higher yield strength steel in the pressure hull skins and frames, which increased their test depth to . &quot;Tang&quot; actually achieved a depth of during a test dive,
and exceeded that test depth when taking on water in the forward torpedo room while evading a destroyer.

== Design ==
The &quot;Balao&quot;s were similar to the &quot;Gato&quot;s, except they were modified to increase test depth from to . In late 1941, two of the Navy&#x27;s leading submarine designers, Captain Andrew McKee and Commander Armand Morgan, met to explore increasing diving depth in a redesigned &quot;Gato&quot;. A switch to a new High-Tensile Steel (HTS) alloy, combined with an increase in hull thickness from to , would result in a test depth of and a collapse depth of . However, the limited capacity of the trim pump at deep depths, and lack of time to design a new pump, caused Rear Admiral E. L. Cochrane, Chief of the Bureau of Ships, to limit test depth to . Fortunately, in 1944 a redesigned Gould centrifugal pump replaced the noisy early-war pump, and effective diving depth was increased.

The &quot;Balao&quot;s incorporated the fairwater, conning tower and periscope shears reduction efforts that were being retrofitted to the &quot;Gato&quot;s and the preceding classes in the original design, refining the reductions and reducing the sail to the smallest practical size. By the time the boats began to be launched, lessons learned from patrol reports had been worked into the design and the bridge and sail proved to be efficiently laid out, well equipped, and well liked by the crews.

For the masts and periscope shears, the original arrangement for both the Government and Electric Boat designs had (forward to aft) the two tapered cone shaped periscope support shears, followed by a thin mast for the SJ surface search radar, and then by a thin mast for the SD air search radar. There were minor differences in how the periscopes were braced against vibration, but both designs were nearly identical. About halfway through their production run, Electric Boat altered their design, moving the SJ radar mast forward of the periscopes, then altered it again a few boats later by enlarging the SD radar mast. Late in the war, many &quot;Balao&quot;s built with the original design had the SD air search radar moved slightly aft onto a thickened and taller mast. These mast arrangements, along with the tremendous variation in the gun layout as the war progressed account for the numerous exterior detail differences among the boats, to the point that at any given time no two &quot;Balao&quot;s looked exactly alike.

=== Engines ===

The propulsion of the &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines was generally similar to that of the preceding &quot;Gato&quot;-class. Like their predecessors, they were true diesel-electric submarines: their four diesel engines powered electrical generators, and electric motors drove the shafts. There was no direct connection between the main engines and the shafts.


&quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines received main engines from one of two manufacturers.
General Motors Cleveland Model 16-278A V-type diesels or Fairbanks-Morse 38D 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine. The General Motors Cleveland Model 16-248 V-type as original installations, while boats from onward received 10-cylinder engines. Earlier General Motors boats received Model 16-248 engines, but beginning with Model 16-278A engines were used. In each case, the newer engines had greater displacement than the old, but were rated at the same power; they operated at lower mean effective pressure for greater reliability. 
 Both the Fairbanks-Morse and General Motors engines were two-stroke cycle types.

Two submarines, and , were to receive Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) diesels, which proved unreliable on previous classes, but both boats were cancelled.

Two manufacturers supplied electric motors for the &quot;Balao&quot; class. Elliott Company motors were fitted primarily to boats with Fairbanks-Morse engines. General Electric motors were fitted primarily to boats with General Motors engines, but some Fairbanks-Morse boats received General Electric motors. Allis-Chalmers motors were to be used in SS-530 through SS-536, but those seven boats were cancelled before even receiving names.

Earlier submarines carried four high-speed electric motors (two per shaft), which had to be fitted with reduction gears to slow their outputs down to an appropriate speed for the shafts. This reduction gearing was very noisy, and made the submarine easier to detect with hydrophones. Eighteen late &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines received low-speed double armature motors which drove the shafts directly and were much quieter, but this improvement was not universally fitted until the succeeding . The new direct drive electric motors were designed by the Bureau of Ships&#x27; electrical division under Captain Hyman G. Rickover, and were first equipped on . On all US World War II-built boats, as the diesel engines were not directly connected to the shafts, the electric motors drove the shafts all the time.

===Deck guns===

Many targets in the Pacific War were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo, so the deck gun was an important weapon. Early &quot;Balao&quot;s began their service with a /50 caliber Mk. 9 gun. Due to war experience, most were re-armed with a /25 caliber Mk. 17 gun, similar to mounts on battleships and cruisers but built as a &quot;wet&quot; mount with corrosion resistant materials, and with power-operated loading and aiming features removed. This conversion started in late 1943, and some boats had two of these weapons beginning in late 1944. , commissioned in March 1944, was the first newly built submarine with the purpose-built /25 submarine mount. Additional anti-aircraft guns included single 40 mm Bofors and twin 20 mm Oerlikon mounts, usually one of each.

====Mine armament====
Like the previous &quot;Tambor&quot;/&quot;Gar&quot; and &quot;Gato&quot; classes, the &quot;Balao&quot; class could substitute mines in place of torpedoes. For the Mk 10 and Mk 12 type mines used in World War II, each torpedo could be replaced by as many as two mines, giving the submarine a true maximum capacity of 48 mines. However, doctrine was to retain at least four torpedoes on mine laying missions, which further limits the capacity to 40 mines, and this is often stated as the maximum in various publications. In practice during the war, submarines went out with at least 8 torpedoes, and the largest minefields laid were 32 mines. Post-war, the Mk 49 mine replaced the Mk 12, while the larger Mk 27 mine was also carried which only allowed one mine replacing one torpedo.

==Boats in class==
This was the most numerous US submarine class; 120 of these boats were commissioned from February 1943 through September 1948, with 12 commissioned postwar. Nine of the 52 US submarines lost in World War II were of this class, along with five lost postwar, including one in Turkish service in 1953, one in Argentine service in the Falklands War of 1982, and one in Peruvian service in 1988. Also, flooded and sank while fitting out at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 15 March 1945. She was raised but not repaired, and was listed with the reserve fleet postwar until struck in 1958. Some of the class served actively in the US Navy through the middle 1970s, and one (&quot;Hai Pao&quot; ex-) is still active in Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Navy.

SS-361 through SS-364 were initially ordered as &quot;Balao&quot;-class, and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the &quot;Balao&quot; class (SS-285 to SS-416 &amp; 425–426). Thus, in some references they are listed with that class. However, they were completed by Manitowoc as &quot;Gato&quot;s, due to an unavoidable delay in Electric Boat&#x27;s development of &quot;Balao&quot;-class drawings. Manitowoc was a follow yard to Electric Boat, and was dependent on them for designs and drawings. Also, and are listed with the &quot;Tench&quot; class in some references, as their hull numbers fall in the range of that class.

=== Cancellations ===

A total of 125 U.S. submarines were cancelled during World War II, all but three between 29 July 1944 and 12 August 1945. The exceptions were three &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats, cancelled 7 January 1946. References vary considerably as to how many of these were &quot;Balao&quot;s and how many were &quot;Tench&quot;es. Some references simply assume all submarines numbered after SS-416 were &quot;Tench&quot; class; however, and were completed as &quot;Balao&quot;s. This yields 10 cancelled &quot;Balao&quot;-class, SS-353-360 and 379–380. The &quot;Register of Ships of the U. S. Navy&quot; differs, considering every submarine not specifically ordered as a &quot;Tench&quot; to be a &quot;Balao&quot;, and further projecting SS-551-562 as a future class. This yields 62 cancelled &quot;Balao&quot; class, 51 cancelled &quot;Tench&quot; class, and 12 cancelled future class. Two of the cancelled &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines, and , were launched incomplete and served for years as experimental hulks at Annapolis and Norfolk, Virginia. The cancelled hull numbers, including those launched incomplete, were SS-353–360 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 379–380 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 427–434 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 436–437 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 438–474 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 491–521 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 526–529 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 530–536 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 537–550 (&quot;Tench&quot;), and 551–562 (future).

==Service history==
===World War II===
The &quot;Balao&quot;s began to enter service in mid-1943, as the many problems with the Mark 14 torpedo were being solved. They were instrumental in the Submarine Force&#x27;s near-destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet and significant attrition of the Imperial Japanese Navy. One of the class, , brought down what remains the largest warship sunk by a submarine, the (59,000 tons). , the highest-scoring of the class, sank 33 ships totaling 116,454 tons, as officially revised upward in 1980.

Nine &quot;Balao&quot;s were lost in World War II, while two US boats were lost in postwar accidents. In foreign service, one in Turkish service was lost in a collision in 1953, one in Peruvian service was lost in a collision in 1988, and was sold to the Argentinian Navy. She was renamed the ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (S-21) and was lost in the 1982 Falklands War after being damaged, when she sank while moored pierside. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was refloated and disposed of a few years after the war by being taken out to deep water and scuttled.

Additionally, , commissioned but incomplete and still under construction, flooded and sank pierside at the Boston Navy Yard on 15 March 1945, after a yard worker mistakenly opened the inner door of an aft torpedo tube that already had the outer door open. No personnel were lost in the accident and she was raised, decommissioned, and never completed or repaired. Her 42 days in commission is the record for the shortest commissioned service of any USN submarine. Postwar, she was laid up in the Reserve Fleet until stricken in 1958 and scrapped in 1959.
===&quot;Balao&quot; class losses===

===Notable submarines===
* was second on the list of number of ships sunk with 33 and first on the list of tonnage with 116,454. Her third war patrol was the most successful of any U.S. submarine with 10 ships for 39,100 tons. Sunk in the Taiwan Strait by a circular run of her own torpedo, her skipper Richard O&#x27;Kane and eight others escaped; some escaped the submerged wreck with the only known successful use of the Momsen Lung. &quot;Tang&quot;″s survivors were imprisoned by the Japanese for the rest of the war. After his release following the Japanese surrender, Richard O&#x27;Kane was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions commanding &quot;Tang&quot; during the convoy battles of 24 and 25 October 1944.
* Archerfish sank the aircraft carrier &quot;Shinano&quot;. &quot;Shinano&quot; is the largest ship sunk by a submarine. Commander Enright was awarded the Navy Cross.
* Batfish is preserved as a museum ship in Oklahoma. She is famous for sinking three Japanese submarines, &quot;RO-55&quot;, &quot;RO-112&quot;, and &quot;RO-113&quot; in a 3 day time span. She is the only US submarine to have sunk 3 ships in a 72 hour period. She also sank the destroyer &quot;Samidare&quot;.
* &quot;Redfish&quot; participated in the destruction of two Japanese aircraft carriers. On December 9th, she was part of a submarine wolfpack which damaged the aircraft carrier &quot;Junyō&quot; beyond repair, then just 10 days later she torpedoed and sank the aircraft carrier &quot;Unryū&quot;. After the war, &quot;Redfish&quot; became something of a movie star, playing the role of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the Walt Disney film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,&quot; then played the part of the fictional submarine USS &quot;Nerka&quot; in the 1958 motion picture &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;. She capped her film career by making several appearances in the popular black-and-white television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;.
* Sealion launched a torpedo attack which sank the Japanese battleship &quot;Kongō&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Urakaze&quot;.
* Blackfin sank the Japanese destroyer &quot;Shigure&quot;. Up to that point, &quot;Shigure&quot; was seen as a fortune ship, having survived the entirety of the Solomon Islands campaign without losing a single man in combat, and in turn served in several naval battles, which included helping to sink the submarine USS &quot;Growler&quot; and being the only Japanese ship of her formation to survive the battles of Vella Gulf and Surigao Strait. Her actions were heavily publicized, and her sinking was a huge blow to Japanese morale.

==Postwar service history==

Postwar, 55 &quot;Balao&quot;s were modernized under the Fleet Snorkel and Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) programs, with some continuing in US service into the early 1970s. The last &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in United States service was , which was decommissioned in June 1975. Seven were converted to roles as diverse as guided-missile submarines (SSG) and amphibious transport submarines (SSP). 46 were transferred to foreign navies for years of additional service, some into the 1990s, and remains active in Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Navy as &quot;Hai Pao&quot;.

===Naval Reserve trainer===

Interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists, the Navy assigned at least 58 submarines from 1946 to 1971 to various coastal and inland ports (even in Great Lakes ports like Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit), where they served as training platforms during the Reservists&#x27; weekend drills. At least 20 &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats served in this capacity. In this role, the boats were rendered incapable of diving and had their propellers removed. They were used strictly as pierside trainers. These were in commission but classed as &quot;in service in reserve&quot;, thus some were decommissioned and recommissioned on the same day to reflect the change in status.

===Foreign service===

The large numbers of relatively modern, but surplus U.S. fleet submarines proved to be popular in sales, loans, or leases to allied foreign navies. 46 &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines were transferred to foreign navies, some shortly after World War II, others after serving nearly 30 years in the US Navy. These included 17 to Turkey, 2 to Greece, 3 to Italy, 2 to the Netherlands, 5 to Spain, 2 to Venezuela, 4 to Argentina, 5 to Brazil, 2 to Chile, 2 to Peru, 1 to Canada and 1 to Taiwan. One of the Venezuelan boats, &quot;ARV Carite&quot; (S-11) formerly USS &quot;Tilefish&quot; (SS-307), featured in the 1971 film &quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot; with some cosmetic modification.

==GUPPY and other conversions==

At the end of World War II, the US submarine force found itself in an awkward position. The 111 remaining &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines, designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed, were obsolete despite the fact they were only one to three years old. The German Type XXI U-boat, with a large battery capacity, streamlining to maximize underwater speed, and a snorkel, was the submarine of the immediate future. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion program was developed to give some &quot;Balao&quot;- and &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines similar capabilities to the Type XXI. When the cost of upgrading numerous submarines to GUPPY standard became apparent, the austere &quot;Fleet Snorkel&quot; conversion was developed to add snorkels and partial streamlining to some boats. A total of 36 &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines were converted to one of the GUPPY configurations, with 19 additional boats receiving Fleet Snorkel modifications. Two of the GUPPY boats and six of the Fleet Snorkel boats were converted immediately prior to transfer to a foreign navy. Most of the 47 remaining converted submarines were active into the early 1970s, when many were transferred to foreign navies for further service and others were decommissioned and disposed of.

Although there was some variation in the GUPPY conversion programs, generally the original two Sargo batteries were replaced by four more compact Guppy (GUPPY I and II only) or Sargo II batteries via significant re-utilization of below-deck space, usually including removal of auxiliary diesels. All of these battery designs were of the lead-acid type. This increased the total number of battery cells from 252 to 504; the downside was the compact batteries had to be replaced every 18 months instead of every 5 years. The Sargo II battery was developed as a lower-cost alternative to the expensive Guppy battery. All GUPPYs received a snorkel, with a streamlined sail and bow. Also, the electric motors were upgraded to the direct drive double-armature type, along with modernized electrical and air conditioning systems. All except the austere GUPPY IB conversions for foreign transfer received sonar, fire control, and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) upgrades.

The Fleet Snorkel program was much more austere than the GUPPY modernizations, but is included here as it occurred during the GUPPY era. The GUPPY and Fleet Snorkel programs are listed in chronological order: GUPPY I, GUPPY II, GUPPY IA, Fleet Snorkel, GUPPY IIA, GUPPY IB, and GUPPY III.

===GUPPY I===

Two &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats were converted as prototypes for the GUPPY program in 1947. Their configuration lacked a snorkel and was not repeated, so no &quot;Balaos&quot; received this conversion.

===GUPPY II===

This was the first production GUPPY conversion, with most conversions occurring in 1947–49. Thirteen &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats (, &quot;Clamagore&quot;, , , , , , , , , , , and ) received GUPPY II upgrades. This was the only production conversion with Guppy batteries.

===GUPPY IA===

This was developed as a more cost-effective alternative to GUPPY II. Nine &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats (, , , , , , , , and ) were converted in 1951–52. The less expensive Sargo II battery was introduced, along with other cost-saving measures.

===Fleet Snorkel===

The Fleet Snorkel program was developed as an austere, cost-effective alternative to full GUPPY conversions, with significantly less improvement in submerged performance. Twenty-three &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) received this upgrade, six immediately prior to foreign transfer. Most Fleet Snorkel conversions occurred 1951–52. Unlike the GUPPY conversions, the original pair of Sargo batteries were not upgraded. Each boat received a streamlined sail with a snorkel, along with upgraded sonar, air conditioning, and ESM. The original bow was left in place, except on three boats (&quot;Piper&quot;, &quot;Sea Owl&quot;, and &quot;Sterlet&quot;) that received additional upper bow sonar equipment. A few boats initially retained the 5&quot;/25 deck gun, but this was removed in the early 1950s.

===GUPPY IIA===

This was generally similar to GUPPY IA, except one of the forward diesel engines was removed to relieve machinery overcrowding. Thirteen &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats (, &quot;Diodon&quot;, , , , , , , , , , , and ) received GUPPY IIA upgrades in 1952–54. One of these, &quot;Diodon&quot;, had previously been upgraded to GUPPY II.

===GUPPY IB===

This was developed as an austere upgrade for two &quot;Gato&quot;-class and two &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats ( and ) prior to transfer to foreign navies in 1953–55. They lacked the sonar and electronics upgrades of other GUPPY conversions.

===GUPPY III===

Nine submarines, six of them &quot;Balao&quot;s (&quot;Clamagore&quot;, &quot;Cobbler&quot;, &quot;Corporal&quot;, &quot;Greenfish&quot;, &quot;Tiru&quot;, and &quot;Trumpetfish&quot;), were upgraded from GUPPY II to GUPPY III in 1959-63 as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II (FRAM II) program. All except &quot;Tiru&quot;, the pilot conversion, were lengthened by 15 feet in the forward part of the control room to provide a new sonar space, berthing, electronics space, and storerooms. &quot;Tiru&quot; was lengthened only 12.5 feet, and both forward diesel engines were removed. The other GUPPY IIIs retained all four engines. A taller &quot;Northern&quot; sail was included, to allow improved surfaced operations in rough seas; this was also backfitted to some other GUPPYs. The BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility Study (PUFFS) sonar system, with its three tall domes topside, was fitted. Additionally, fire control upgrades allowed the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo to be used.

===Radar picket===

The advent of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; demonstrated the need for a long range radar umbrella around the fleet. Radar picket destroyers and destroyer escorts were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. Four submarines including the &quot;Balao&quot;-class boat &quot;Threadfin&quot; prototyped the concept at the end of World War II but were not used in this role. Ten fleet submarines were converted for this role 1946-53 and redesignated SSR as radar picket submarines. was the only &quot;Balao&quot;-class SSR. Experiments on the first two SSR submarines under the appropriately named Project Migraine I showed that placement of the radars on the deck was inadequate and that more room was needed for electronics. Thus &quot;Burrfish&quot; was given the Migraine II (project SCB 12) conversion, which placed a Combat Information Center (CIC) in the space formerly occupied as the aft battery room. The after torpedo room was stripped and converted into berthing, and the boat lost two of her forward torpedo tubes to make room for additional berthing and electronics. The radars were raised up off the deck and put on masts, giving them a greater range and hopefully greater reliability.

The SSRs proved only moderately successful, as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable, and the boats&#x27; surface speed was insufficient to protect a fast-moving carrier group. The radars were removed and the boats reverted to general purpose submarines after 1959. &quot;Burrfish&quot; was decommissioned in 1956 and, with her radar equipment removed, transferred to Canada as HMCS &quot;Grilse&quot; (SS-71) in 1961.

===Guided-missile submarine===

The Regulus nuclear cruise missile program of the 1950s provided the US Navy with its first strategic strike capability. It was preceded by experiments with the JB-2 Loon missile, a close derivative of the German V-1 flying bomb, beginning in the last year of World War II. Submarine testing of Loon was performed 1947–53, with and converted in to guided-missile submarines as test platforms in 1947 and 1948 respectively. Initially the missile was carried on the launch rail unprotected, thus the submarine was unable to submerge until after launch. &quot;Cusk&quot; was eventually fitted with a watertight hangar for one missile and redesignated as an SSG. Following a brief stint as a cargo submarine, was converted in 1955 to carry two surface-launched Regulus missiles and was redesignated as an SSG, joining the &quot;Gato&quot;-class in this role. She made strategic deterrent patrols with Regulus until 1964, when the program was discontinued in favor of Polaris. A number of fleet boats were equipped with Regulus guidance equipment 1953–64, including &quot;Cusk&quot; and &quot;Carbonero&quot; following the Loon tests.

===Transport submarine===

 and were converted to amphibious transport submarines in 1948 and redesignated as SSPs. Initially, they were equipped with a watertight hangar capable of housing a Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT), and retained one /25 caliber deck gun for shore bombardment. Both torpedo rooms and one engine room were gutted to provide space for embarked Special Operations Forces (SOF) and their equipment. Snorkels were fitted. Due to the extra personnel, to avoid excessive snorkeling they were equipped with a scrubber and extra oxygen storage. Initially, a squadron of 12 SSPs was considered, capable of landing a reinforced Marine battalion, but only two &quot;Balao&quot;-class SSPs (out of four overall) were actually converted. &quot;Perch&quot; landed British commandos on one raid in the Korean War, and operated in the Vietnam War from 1965 until assignment to Naval Reserve training in 1967 and decommissioning in 1971, followed by scrapping in 1973. &quot;Perch&quot; was replaced in the Pacific Fleet transport submarine role by in 1967 and in 1968. &quot;Sealion&quot; operated in the Atlantic, deploying for the Cuban Missile Crisis and numerous SOF-related exercises. She was decommissioned in 1970 and expended as a target in 1978. The LVT hangar and gun were removed from both boats by the late 1950s. They went through several changes of designation in their careers: ASSP in 1950, APSS in 1956, and LPSS in 1968.

===Sonar test submarine===

 was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine (AGSS) in 1949 and converted to a sonar test submarine in 1958–59 to test a system known as LORAD. This included a extension aft of the forward torpedo room, with swing-out arrays near the bow. Later, three large domes were installed topside for a wide aperture array.

===Cargo submarine===

&quot; Barbero&quot; was converted to a cargo submarine and redesignated as an SSA in 1948. The forward engine room, after torpedo room, and all reload torpedo racks were gutted to provide cargo space. From October 1948 until March 1950, she took part in an experimental program to evaluate her capabilities as a cargo carrier. Experimentation ended in early 1950, and she was decommissioned into the reserve on 30 June 1950. In 1955, she was converted to a Regulus missile submarine and redesignated as an SSG.

== Operational submarines ==

As of 2007 , a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was one of the last two operational submarines in the world built during World War II. The boat was transferred to Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Navy in the early 1970s. The &quot;Tench&quot;-class ex- is the other one. They are named &quot;Hai Pao&quot; and &quot;Hai Shih&quot;, respectively, in Taiwanese service.

== Museums ==

Six &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines are open to public viewing. They primarily depend on revenue generated by visitors to keep them operational and up to U.S. Navy standards; each boat gets a yearly inspection and a &quot;report card&quot;. Some boats, like &quot;Batfish&quot; and &quot;Pampanito&quot;, encourage youth functions and allow a group of volunteers to sleep overnight in the crew&#x27;s quarters.

<doc id="444625" wikidata="Q6942041" url="?curid=444625" title="Music of Castile and León">
<text>Central Spain includes the cultural melting pot of Madrid and Castile. A down-tempo version of jota is common, as well as other dances as fandango, habas verdes, 5/8 charrada. Bagpipes are still used in northern León and Zamora provinces. Tabor pipe (in León) and &quot;dulzaina&quot; (a small shawm-like instrument) enjoy rich repertoires. Although &quot;dulzaina&quot; were popular in the folk music of Castile and León, the instrument is no longer manufactured and has become rare.

The city of Madrid is known for keeping its own version of chotis music. Salamanca is home to tuna, a form of serenade played on guitar, bandurria and tambourine, traditionally by students in medieval clothing.

Castilian dances include:

*Agudo
*Agudillo
*Charrada
*Fandango
*Jota
*Jotilla
*Habas verdes
*Rebolada

The Province of León is dominated by palatial dances that are extremely complex:
*Baile a lo Alto
*Baile del Pandero
*Danza de las Doncellas Cantadoras
*Danza de la Muerte
*El Corrido

<text>Cleanth Brooks ( ; October 16, 1906 – May 10, 1994) was an American literary critic and professor. He is best known for his contributions to New Criticism in the mid-20th century and for revolutionizing the teaching of poetry in American higher education. His best-known works, &quot;The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry&quot; (1947) and &quot;Modern Poetry and the Tradition&quot; (1939), argue for the centrality of ambiguity and paradox as a way of understanding poetry. With his writing, Brooks helped to formulate formalist criticism, emphasizing &quot;the interior life of a poem&quot; (Leitch 2001) and codifying the principles of close reading.

Brooks was also the preeminent critic of Southern literature, writing classic texts on William Faulkner, and co-founder of the influential journal &quot;The Southern Review&quot; (Leitch 2001) with Robert Penn Warren.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
On October 16, 1906, in Murray, Kentucky, Brooks was born to a Methodist minister, the Reverend Cleanth Brooks Sr., and Bessie Lee Witherspoon Brooks (Leitch 2001). He was one of three children: Cleanth and William, natural born sons, and Murray Brooks, actually born Hewitt Witherspoon, whom Bessie Lee Witherspoon kidnapped from her brother Forrest Bedford Witherspoon as a young baby after the natural mother had died. She later was able to change his name to Murray Brooks and continued to raise him as her own, causing quite a rift in her own family and alienating herself from Cleanth and William. Cleanth mentioned on more than one occasion that she so doted on Murray (Hewitt) that she no longer had a relationship with Cleanth and William. Attending McTyeire School, a private academy, he received a classical education and went on to study at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received his B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1928 (Leitch 2001). In 1928, Brooks received his M.A. from Tulane University and went on to study at Exeter College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He received his B.A. (first class) in 1931 and his B.Litt. the following year. Brooks then returned to the United States and from 1932 to 1947 was a professor of English at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (Singh 1991). In 1934, he married Edith Amy Blanchord.

===Vanderbilt===
During his studies at Vanderbilt, he met literary critics and future collaborators Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Andrew Lytle, and Donald Davidson (Singh 1991). Studying with Ransom and Warren, Brooks became involved in two significant literary movements: the Southern Agrarians and the Fugitives (Singh 1991). Brooks admitted to reading the Southern Agrarian manifesto, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; (1930) &quot;over and over&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001). While he never argued for the movement&#x27;s conservative Southern traditions, he &quot;learned a great deal&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001) and found the Agrarian position valuable and &quot;unobjectionable&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001): &quot;They asked that we consider what the good life is or ought to be&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001).

The Fugitive Movement similarly influenced Brooks&#x27; approach to criticism. The Fugitives, a group of Southern poets consisting of such influential writers as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Robert Penn Warren, met Saturday evenings to read and discuss poetry written by members of the group (Singh 1991). The discussion was based on intensive readings and included considerations of a poem&#x27;s form, structure, meter, rhyme scheme, and imagery (Singh 1991). This close reading formed the foundation on which the New Critical movement was based and helped shape Brooks&#x27; approach to criticism (Singh 1991).

===Academic life and work===
While attending the University of Oxford, Brooks continued his friendship with fellow Vanderbilt graduate and Rhodes Scholar, Robert Penn Warren (Leitch 2001). In 1934, Warren joined the English department at Louisiana State, leading Brooks and Warren to collaborate on many works of criticism and pedagogy. In 1935, Brooks and Warren founded &quot;The Southern Review&quot;. Until 1942, they co-edited the journal, publishing works by many influential authors, including Eudora Welty, Kenneth Burke, and Ford Madox Ford. The journal was known for its criticism and creative writing, marking it as one of the leading journals of the time (Leitch 2001).

In addition, Brooks&#x27;s and Warren&#x27;s collaboration led to innovations in the teaching of poetry and literature. At Louisiana State University, prompted by their students&#x27; inability to interpret poetry, the two put together a booklet that modeled close reading through examples (Leitch 2001). The booklet was a success and laid the foundation for a number of best-selling textbooks: &quot;An Approach to Literature&quot; (1936), &quot;Understanding Poetry&quot; (1938), &quot;Understanding Fiction&quot; (1943), &quot;Modern Rhetoric&quot; (1949), and, in collaboration with Robert Heilman, &quot;Understanding Drama&quot; (1945). Brooks&#x27; two most influential works also came out of the success of the booklet: &quot;Modern Poetry and the Tradition&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry&quot; (1947) (Leitch 2001).

From 1941 to 1975, Brooks held many academic positions and received a number of distinguished fellowships and honorary doctorates. In 1941, he worked as a visiting professor at the University of Texas, Austin. From 1947 to 1975, he was an English professor at Yale University, where he held the position of Gray Professor of Rhetoric and Gray Professor of Rhetoric Emeritus from 1960 until his retirement, except 1964 to 1966 (Singh 1991). His tenure at Yale was marked by ongoing research into Southern literature, which resulted in the publication of Brooks&#x27; studies of William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha County (1963, 1978) (Leitch 2001). At Yale, he accepted honorary membership in Manuscript Society. In 1948, he was a fellow of the Kenyon School of English. From 1951 to 1953, he was a fellow of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and was a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. During this time, he received the Guggenheim Fellowship and held it again in 1960. From 1963 to 1972, he was awarded honorary doctorates of literature from Upsala College, the University of Kentucky, the University of Exeter, Washington and Lee University, Saint Louis University, Tulane University, and Centenary College NJ and Oglethorpe University (Singh 1991).

Brooks&#x27; other positions included working as a cultural attaché for the American embassy in London from 1964 to 1966. Further, he held memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Philosophical Society (Singh 1991).

The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Brooks for the 1985 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. He delivered the lecture both in Washington and at Tulane University in New Orleans, and it was subsequently included as &quot;Literature in a Technological Age&quot; in a collection of his essays.

==Brooks and New Criticism==

Brooks was the central figure of New Criticism, a movement that emphasized structural and textual analysis—close reading—over historical or biographical analysis. Brooks advocates close reading because, as he states in &quot;The Well Wrought Urn&quot;, &quot;by making the closest examination of what the poem says as a poem&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001), a critic can effectively interpret and explicate the text. For him, the crux of New Criticism is that literary study be &quot;concerned primarily with the work itself&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001). In &quot;The Formalist Critics,&quot; Brooks offers &quot;some articles of faith&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001) to which he subscribes. These articles exemplify the tenets of New Criticism:

*That the primary concern of criticism is with the problem of unity—the kind of whole which the literary work forms or fails to form, and the relation of the various parts to each other in building up this whole.
*That in a successful work, format and content cannot be separated.
*That form is meaning.
*That literature is ultimately metaphorical and symbolic.
*That the general and the universal are not seized upon by abstraction, but got at through the concrete and the particular.
*That literature is not a surrogate for religion.
*That, as Allen Tate says, &quot;specific moral problems&quot; are the subject matter of literature, but that the purpose of literature is not to point a moral.
*That the principles of criticism define the area relevant to literary criticism; they do not constitute a method for carrying out the criticism (qtd. in Leitch 2001).

New Criticism involves examining a poem&#x27;s &quot;technical elements, textual patterns, and incongruities&quot; (Leitch 2001) with a kind of scientific rigor and precision. From I. A. Richards&#x27; &quot;The Principles of Literary Criticism&quot; and &quot;Practical Criticism&quot;, Brooks formulated guidelines for interpreting poetry (Leitch 2001). Brooks formulated these guidelines in reaction to ornamentalist theories of poetry, to the common practice of critics going outside the poem (to historical or biographical contexts), and his and Warren&#x27;s frustration with trying to teach college students to analyze poetry and literature (Leitch 2001).

Brooks and Warren were teaching using textbooks &quot;full of biographical facts and impressionistic criticism&quot; (Singh 1991). The textbooks failed to show how poetic language differed from the language of an editorial or a work of non-fiction. From this frustration, Brooks and Warren published &quot;Understanding Poetry&quot;. In the book, the authors assert poetry should be taught as poetry, and the critic should resist reducing a poem to a simple paraphrase, explicating it through biographical or historical contexts, and interpreting it didactically (Singh 1991). For Brooks and Warren, paraphrase and biographical and historical background information is useful as a means of clarifying interpretation, but it should be used as means to an end (Singh 1991).

Brooks took this notion of paraphrase and developed it further in his classic &quot;The Well Wrought Urn&quot;. The book is a polemic against the tendency for critics to reduce a poem to a single narrative or didactic message. He describes summative, reductionist reading of poetry with a phrase still popular today: &quot;The Heresy of Paraphrase&quot; (Leitch 2001). In fact, he argued poetry serves no didactic purpose because producing some kind of statement would be counter to a poem&#x27;s purpose. Brooks argues &quot;through irony, paradox, ambiguity and other rhetorical and poetic devices of his or her art, the poet works constantly to resist any reduction of the poem to a paraphrasable core, favoring the presentation of conflicting facets of theme and patterns of resolved stresses&quot; (Leitch 2001).

In addition to arguing against historical, biographical, and didactic readings of a poem, Brooks believed that a poem should not be criticized on the basis of its effect on the reader. In an essay called &quot;The Formalist Critics,&quot; he says that &quot;the formalist critic assumes an ideal reader: that is, instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, he attempts to find a central point of reference from which he can focus upon the structure of the poem or novel&quot; (qtd. in Rivkin, 24). While he admits that it is problematic to assume such a reference point, he sees it as the only viable option. Since the other options would be either to give any reading equal status with any other reading, or to establish a group of &quot;&#x27;qualified&#x27; readers&quot; and use those as a range of standard interpretations. In the first case, a correct or &quot;standard&quot; reading would become impossible; in the second case, an ideal reader has still been assumed under the guise of multiple ideal readers (Rivkin 24). Thus, Brooks does not accept the idea of considering critics&#x27; emotional responses to works of literature as a legitimate approach to criticism. He says that &quot;a detailed description of my emotional state on reading certain works has little to do with indicating to an interested reader what the work is and how the parts of it are related&quot; (Rivkin 24). For Brooks, nearly everything a critic evaluates must come from within the text itself. This opinion is similar to that expressed by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley in their famous essay &quot;The Affective Fallacy,&quot; in which they argue that a critic is &quot;a teacher or explicator of meanings,&quot; not a reporter of &quot;physiological experience&quot; in the reader (qtd. in Adams, 1029, 1027).

==Reaction to New Criticism==

Because New Criticism isolated the text and excluded historical and biographical contexts, critics argued as early as 1942 that Brooks&#x27; approach to criticism was flawed for being overly narrow and for &quot;disabl[ing] any and all attempts to relate literary study to political, social, and cultural issues and debates&quot; (1350). His reputation suffered in the 1970s and 1980s when criticism of New Criticism increased. Brooks rebuffed the accusations that New Criticism has an &quot;antihistorical thrust&quot; (Leitch 2001) and a &quot;neglect of context&quot; (Leitch 2001). He insisted he was not excluding context because a poem possesses organic unity, and it is possible to derive a historical and biographical context from the language the poet uses (Singh 1991). He argues &quot;A poem by Donne or Marvell does not depend for its success on outside knowledge that we bring to it; it is richly ambiguous yet harmoniously orchestrated, coherent in its own special aesthetic terms&quot; (Leitch 2001).

New Criticism was accused by critics of having a contradictory nature. Brooks writes, on the one hand, &quot;the resistance which any good poem sets up against all attempts to paraphrase it&quot; (qtd. in Leitch 2001) is the result of the poet manipulating and warping language to create new meaning. On the other hand, he admonishes the unity and harmony in a poem&#x27;s aesthetics. These seemingly contradictory forces in a poem create tension and paradoxical irony according to Brooks, but critics questioned whether irony leads to a poem&#x27;s unity or undermines it (Leitch 2001). Poststructuralists in particular saw a poem&#x27;s resistance and warped language as competing with its harmony and balance that Brooks celebrates (Leitch 2001).

Ronald Crane was particularly hostile to the views of Brooks and the other New Critics. In &quot;The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks,&quot; Crane writes that under Brooks&#x27;s view of a poem&#x27;s unity being achieved through the irony and paradox of the opposing forces it contains, the world&#x27;s most perfect example of such an ironic poem would be Albert Einstein&#x27;s equation E=mc2, which equates matter and energy at a constant rate (Searle).

In his later years, Brooks criticized the poststructuralists for inviting subjectivity and relativism into their analysis, asserting &quot;each critic played with the text&#x27;s language unmindful of aesthetic relevance and formal design&quot; (Leitch 2001). This approach to criticism, Brooks argued, &quot;denied the authority of the work&quot; (Leitch 2001).

==Influence==

&quot;Understanding Poetry&quot; was an unparalleled success and remains &quot;a classic manual for the intellectual and imaginative skills required for the understanding of poetry&quot; (Singh 1991). Further, critics praise Brooks and Warren for &quot;introducing New Criticism with commendable clarity&quot; (Singh 1991) and for teaching students how to read and interpret poetry. Arthur Mizener commended Brooks and Warren for offering a new way of teaching poetry:

For us the real revolution in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of &quot;Understanding Poetry&quot;...for many of us who were preparing ourselves to teach English in those years...this book...came as a kind of revelation. It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).

In an obituary for Brooks, John W. Stevenson of Converse College notes Brooks &quot;redirect[ed] and revolutionize[d] the teaching of literature in American colleges and universities&quot; (1994). Further, Stevenson admits Brooks was &quot;the person who brought excitement and passion to the study of literature&quot; (1994) and &quot;whose work...became the model for a whole profession&quot; (1994).

Along with New Criticism, Brooks&#x27; studies of Faulkner, Southern literature, and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (appearing in &quot;Modern Poetry and the Tradition&quot;) remain classic texts. Mark Royden Winchell calls Brooks&#x27; text on Faulkner &quot;the best book yet on the works of William Faulkner&quot; (1996). Eliot himself commended Brooks in a letter for Brooks&#x27; critique of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (Singh 1991). Further, Winchell praises Brooks for &quot;help[ing] invent the modern literary quarterly&quot; (1996) through the success of &quot;The Southern Review&quot;.

As testament to Brooks&#x27; influence, fellow critic and former teacher John Crowe Ransom calls Brooks &quot;the most forceful and influential critic of poetry that we have&quot; (qtd. in Singh 1991). Elsewhere, Ransom has even gone so far as to describe Brooks as a &quot;spell binder&quot; (qtd. in Singh 1991).

<doc id="444639" wikidata="Q6942315" url="?curid=444639" title="Music of the Valencian Community">
<text>The music of the [[Valencian Community]] in eastern Spain is rich and diverse due to external influences. It can be broadly divided into two categories: traditional and contemporary music.

==Traditional music==
Little is known about Valencian music in ancient times, with some prehistoric pictorial remains of Valencia and Alicante as only testimonies of musical activity. With the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, and since the 9th century, the Córdoba musical tradition spread to Valencia and Xàtiva. The oldest musical documents preserved in the Land of Valencia are Christian ones, such as the filled epistles and the Song of the Sibyl, a liturgical drama of Catalan origin. Another medieval liturgical drama, the Mystery of Elx, stands out.

The Land of Valencia is known for its own variety of Jota and a rich &quot;dolçaina&quot; (shawm) tradition. Brass bands are found in almost every village in the region, originating in the 19th century. The Muixeranga, a street festival, is an important tradition that originated in Valencia.

Religious and work songs are common in Valencia, many are performed with accompaniment. &quot;El Misteri d&#x27;Elx&quot; is an old, religious musical play that dates back to mediaeval times. Havaneres are popular all along the Valencian coast. 

Valencian dances include:
*Fandango of Albaida
*El Ball del Danzants
*El Ball dels Oficis
*Los Alcides
*Els Bastonets
*Els Porrots
*Paloteo of Requena
*Valencian Jota

==Contemporary music==
In the 1980s &quot;bakalao&quot; was the dominant dance music form that appeared in the club scene of the city and the surrounding community. While pop and rock are forms enjoyed and played by local musicians there is a strong tendency towards electronica in the region. In the 1990s techno music continued to be a string favourite in the area with the heavier influence from northern Europe emerging in the early 2000s. Today minimal techno is popular and more recently the trip-tek style as a young knights living to outfits such as Electrika-MixTek.

Valencian/Catalan rock and ska music is also common all throughout the Land of Valencia.

Valencia has a sleight of bands and singers that have popped up in the last 3-5 years that are creating their own brand of urban, jazzy, and funky music like Ay Trick, Vincen Garcia, Xixa Mora, Astral Voyage, Adrian Black, The Willards, Think Mogul, Barbara Gramage, and more.

<text>Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller novels, including the Robert Langdon novels &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; (2000), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2003), &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; (2009), &quot;Inferno&quot; (2013), &quot;Origin&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Secret of Secrets&quot; (2025). His novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a period of 24 hours. They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, and &quot;Inferno&quot;, have been adapted into films, while one of them, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;, was adapted into a television series.

The Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes and historical fiction, and have generated controversy as a result. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian and he is on a &quot;constant spiritual journey&quot; himself. He states that his book &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is &quot;an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate&quot; and suggests that the book may be used &quot;as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.&quot;

==Early life==
Daniel Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974). Brown attended Exeter&#x27;s public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. His mother, Constance (née Gerhard), descended from Pennsylvania Dutch Schwenkfelders, and trained as a church organist and student of sacred music. Brown was raised an Episcopalian, and described his religious evolution in a 2009 interview:

I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, &quot;I don&#x27;t get it. I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?&quot; Unfortunately, the response I got was, &quot;Nice boys don&#x27;t ask that question.&quot; A light went off, and I said, &quot;The Bible doesn&#x27;t make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.&quot; And I just gravitated away from religion.

When asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown replied:

The irony is that I&#x27;ve really come full circle. The more science I studied, the more I saw that physics becomes metaphysics and numbers become imaginary numbers. The further you go into science, the mushier the ground gets. You start to say, &quot;Oh, there is an order and a spiritual aspect to science.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts. Brown&#x27;s relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.

After graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College where he double majored in English and Spanish. At Amherst, he was initiated into the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville. Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.

==Career==
===Composer and singer===
After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children&#x27;s cassette entitled &quot;SynthAnimals&quot;, which included a collection of tracks such as &quot;Happy Frogs&quot; and &quot;Suzuki Elephants&quot;; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled &quot;Perspective&quot;, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.

Brown joined the National Academy of Songwriters and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met his wife, Blythe Newlon, who was the academy&#x27;s Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown&#x27;s projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire. In 1994, Brown released a CD titled &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her &quot;for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist&quot;. The CD included songs such as &quot;Here in These Fields&quot; and the religious ballad, &quot;All I Believe&quot;.

Brown and his wife Blythe moved to Rye, New Hampshire, in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls. Brown has written a symphonic work titled &quot;Wild Symphony&quot; which is supplemented by a book of the same name. The book is illustrated by Hungarian artist Susan Batori which feature simple ambigrams for children, while the visuals trigger the corresponding music in an accompanying app. The music was recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra and will receive its world concert premiere by the Portsmouth Symphony Orchestra in 2020. On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Weed Road Pictures will turn &quot;Wild Symphony&quot; into an animated musical feature film in the vein of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, with Brown writing the screenplay and songs, and Akiva Goldsman producing.

===Writing===

While on vacation in Tahiti, France in 1993, Brown read Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Doomsday Conspiracy&quot;, and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers. He started work on &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, &quot;187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Danielle Brown&quot;. The book&#x27;s author profile reads, &quot;Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men.&quot; The copyright to the book is attributed to Brown.

In 1996, Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; was published in 1998. His wife Blythe did much of the book&#x27;s promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released &quot;The Bald Book&quot;, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and &quot;Deception Point&quot;, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon.

Brown&#x27;s first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, became a bestseller, going to the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009. Its success has helped push sales of Brown&#x27;s earlier books. In 2004, all four of his novels were on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list in the same week, and in 2005 he made &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Influential People of the Year. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 &quot;Celebrity 100&quot; list, and estimated his annual income at US$76.5 million. According to the article published in &quot;The Times&quot;, the estimated income of Brown after &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; sales is $250 million.

Brown&#x27;s third novel featuring Robert Langdon, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;, was released on September 15, 2009. According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing. The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of twelve hours, and features the Freemasons. The book also includes many elements that made &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; a number one best seller. Brown&#x27;s promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, including two references to the &quot;Kryptos&quot; sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, give hints about the sequel. Brown has adopted a relevant theme in some of his earlier work.

Brown&#x27;s fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, &quot;Inferno&quot; is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday. It ranked No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for the first 11 weeks of its release, has sold more than 1.4 million copies in the US alone. In a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon. Characters in Brown&#x27;s books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after &quot;On a Claire Day&quot; cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon&#x27;s editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown&#x27;s real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.

In interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book. In one article, she was described as &quot;chief researcher&quot;. Doubleday published his seventh book, &quot;Origin&quot;, on October 3, 2017. It is the fifth book in his &quot;Robert Langdon&quot; series.

====Reception====

Brown&#x27;s prose style has been criticized as clumsy, with &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; being described as &quot;committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph&quot;. In his 2005 documentary for Channel 4, &quot;The Real Da Vinci Code&quot;, author and presenter Tony Robinson criticised both the accuracy of the author&#x27;s historic research and the writing itself, considering the book to be not particularly well written. Much of the criticism was centered on Brown&#x27;s claim in his preface that the novel is based on fact in relation to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, and that &quot;all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in [the] novel are accurate&quot;.

====Influences and habits====
In addition to Sidney Sheldon, Brown has been quite vocal about a number of other literary influences who have inspired his writing. Recurring elements that Brown prefers to incorporate into his novels include a simple hero pulled out of their familiar setting and thrust into a new one with which they are unfamiliar, an attractive female sidekick/ love interest, foreign travel, imminent danger from a pursuing villain, antagonists who have a disability or genetic disorder, and a 24-hour time frame in which the story takes place.

Brown&#x27;s work is heavily influenced by academic Joseph Campbell, who wrote extensively on mythology and religion and was highly influential in the field of screenwriting. Brown also states he based the character of Robert Langdon on Campbell. Director Alfred Hitchcock appears to be another key influence on Brown. Like Hitchcock, the writer favors suspense-laden plots involving an innocent middle-aged man pursued by deadly foes, glamorous foreign settings, key scenes set in tourist destinations, a cast of wealthy and eccentric characters, young and curvaceous female sidekicks, Catholicism and MacGuffins. Brown does his writing in his loft. He told fans that he uses inversion therapy to help with writer&#x27;s block. He uses gravity boots and says, &quot;hanging upside down seems to help me solve plot challenges by shifting my entire perspective&quot;.

====Copyright infringement cases====
In August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and his novels, &quot;The Da Vinci Legacy&quot; (1983) and &quot;Daughter of God&quot; (2000). Judge George B. Daniels said, in part: &quot;A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is substantially similar to &quot;Daughter of God&quot;.&quot; In April 2006 Brown&#x27;s publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot; for his 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. It was in the book &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot; that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors&#x27; names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh&#x27;s name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent&#x27;s. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown&#x27;s favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment.

On March 28, 2007, Brown&#x27;s publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million. Brown has been sued twice in U.S. federal courts by the author Jack Dunn, who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book &quot;The Vatican Boys&quot; to write &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006–07) and &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; (2011–12). Both lawsuits were not allowed to go to a jury trial and Jack Dunn claims the judge in both cases benefited from his decisions by becoming an author published and supported by people associated with Random House, Dan Brown&#x27;s publisher. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.

==Charity work==
In October 2004, Brown and his siblings donated US$2.2 million to Phillips Exeter Academy in honor of their father, to set up the Richard G. Brown Technology Endowment to help &quot;provide computers and high-tech equipment for students in need&quot;. On April 14, 2011, Dan and his wife, Blythe Newlon Brown, created an eponymous scholarship fund to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his graduation from Amherst College. It is a permanently endowed scholarship fund that provides financial aid to students at Amherst, with preference given to incoming students with an interest in writing. On June 16, 2016, Brown donated US$337,000 to the Ritman Library in Amsterdam to digitize a collection of ancient books.

==Personal life==
Brown and his wife, Blythe Newlon, were supporters of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. In 2019, after 21 years of marriage, Brown and his wife acrimoniously divorced, with the financial settlement still to be concluded due to Brown&#x27;s alleged infidelities during the latter part of their marriage. In December 2021, the couple agreed to settle the lawsuit.

==Adaptations==
In 2006, Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; was released as a film by Columbia Pictures, with director Ron Howard. It was widely anticipated and launched the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, though it received overall poor reviews. It currently has a 26% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, derived from 165 negative reviews of the 214 counted. It was later listed as one of the worst films of 2006 on &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, but also the second highest-grossing film of the year, pulling in US$750 million worldwide.

Brown was listed as one of the executive producers of the film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, and also created additional codes for the film. One of his songs, &quot;Phiano&quot;, which Brown wrote and performed, was listed as part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In the film, Brown and his wife can be seen in the background of one of the early book signing scenes. The next film, &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, was released on May 15, 2009, with Howard and Hanks returning. It, too, garnered mostly negative reviews, though critics were kinder to it than to its predecessor; it has a 37% meta-rating at Rotten Tomatoes.

Filmmakers expressed interest in adapting &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; into a film as well. The screenplay was written by Danny Strong, with pre-production expected to begin in 2013. According to a January 2013 article in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February. In July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt &quot;Inferno&quot; for a release date of October 14, 2016, with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon. &quot;Inferno&quot; was released on October 28, 2016.

Imagine Entertainment was announced in 2014 to produce a television series based on &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, written by Josh Goldin and Rachel Abramowitz. In 2021, Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; was adapted into a television series repositioned as an origin story for Brown&#x27;s Robert Langdon character with Ashley Zukerman playing Langdon. It ran on the streaming service Peacock for one season.

<doc id="444649" wikidata="Q214833" url="?curid=444649" title="Four-wheel drive">
<text>A four-wheel drive, also called 4×4 (&quot;four by four&quot;) or 4WD, is a two-axled vehicle drivetrain capable of providing torque to all of its wheels simultaneously. It may be full-time or on-demand, and is typically linked via a transfer case providing an additional output drive shaft and, in many instances, additional gear ranges.

A four-wheel drive vehicle with torque supplied to both axles is described as &quot;all-wheel drive&quot; (AWD). However, &quot;four-wheel drive&quot; typically refers to a set of specific components and functions, and intended off-road application, which generally complies with modern use of the terminology.

==Definitions==
Four-wheel-drive systems were developed in many different markets and used in many different vehicle platforms. There is no universally accepted set of terminology that describes the various architectures and functions. The terms used by various manufacturers often reflect marketing rather than engineering considerations or significant technical differences between systems. SAE International&#x27;s standard J1952 recommends only the term &quot;all-wheel drive&quot; with additional subclassifications that cover all types of AWD/4WD/4x4 systems found on production vehicles.

===4×4===
&quot;Four-by-four&quot; or &quot;4×4&quot; is frequently used to refer to a class of vehicles in general. Syntactically, the first figure indicates the total number of axle ends and the second indicates the number of axle ends that are powered. Accordingly, 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine torque to only two axle ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. Similarly, a 6×4 vehicle has three axles, two of which provide torque to two axle ends each. If this vehicle were a truck with dual rear wheels on two rear axles, so actually having ten wheels, its configuration would still be formulated as 6x4. During World War II, the U.S. military would typically use spaces and a capital &#x27;X&#x27; – as &quot;4 X 2&quot; or &quot;6 X 4&quot;.

===4WD===
Four-wheel drive (4WD) refers to vehicles with two axles providing torque to four axle ends. In the North American market, the term generally refers to a system optimized for off-road driving conditions. The term &quot;4WD&quot; is typically designated for vehicles equipped with a transfer case that switches between 2WD and 4WD operating modes, either manually or automatically.

All-wheel drive (AWD) was historically synonymous with &quot;four-wheel drive&quot; on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6×6s, and so on, being used in that fashion at least as early as the 1920s. Today in North America, the term is applied to both heavy vehicles and light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles, the term is increasingly applied to mean &quot;permanent multiple-wheel drive&quot; on 2×2, 4×4, 6×6, or 8×8 drive-train systems that include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts. This is often coupled with some sort of antislip technology, increasingly hydraulics-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds, but still be capable of transferring the torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use. When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on-demand) or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.

Some all-wheel drive electric vehicles use one motor for each axle, thereby eliminating a mechanical differential between the front and rear axles. An example of this is the dual-motor variant of the Tesla Model S, which controls the torque distribution between its two motors electronically.

===SAE recommended practices===
According to the SAE International standard J1952, AWD is the preferred term for all the systems described above. The standard subdivides AWD systems into three categories.

Part-time AWD systems require driver intervention to couple and decouple the secondary axle from the primarily driven axle, and these systems do not have a center differential (or similar device). The definition notes that part-time systems may have a low range.

Full-time AWD systems drive both front and rear axles at all times via a center (interaxle) differential. The torque split of that differential may be fixed or variable depending on the type of center differential. This system can be used on any surface at any speed. The definition does not address the inclusion or exclusion of a low-range gear.

On-demand AWD systems drive the secondary axle via an active or passive coupling device or &quot;by an independently powered drive system&quot;. The standard notes that in some cases, the secondary drive system may also provide the primary vehicle propulsion. An example is a hybrid AWD vehicle where the primary axle is driven by an internal combustion engine and the secondary axle is driven by an electric motor. When the internal combustion engine is shut off, the secondary, electrically driven axle is the only driven axle. On-demand systems function primarily with only one powered axle until torque is required by the second axle. At that point, either a passive or active coupling sends torque to the secondary axle.

In addition to the above primary classifications, the J1952 standard notes secondary classifications resulting in a total of eight systems, designated as:
*Part-time nonsynchro 
*Part-time synchro
*Full-time fixed torque
*Full-time variable-torque passive 
*Full-time variable-torque active
*On-demand synchro variable-torque passive 
*On-demand synchro variable-torque active 
*On-demand independently powered variable-torque active

===Differentials===


Two wheels fixed to the same axle (but on the opposite axle ends) need to turn at different speeds as a vehicle goes around a curve. The reason is that the wheel that is located on the inner side of the curve needs to travel less distance than the opposite wheel for the same duration of time. However, if both wheels are connected to the same axle driveshaft, they always have to spin at the same speed relative to each other. When going around a curve, this either forces one of the wheels to slip, if possible, to balance the apparent distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop. To prevent this, the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic differential. This allows one driveshaft to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential to the wheel, at different speeds.

The differential does this by distributing angular force (in the form of torque) evenly, while distributing angular velocity (turning speed) such that the average for the two output shafts is equal to that of the differential ring gear. When powered, each axle requires a differential to distribute power between the left and right sides. When power is distributed to all four wheels, a third or &#x27;center&#x27; differential can be used to distribute power between the front and rear axles.

The described system handles extremely well, as it is able to accommodate various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel spins faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided between four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives roughly half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.

===Limiting slippage===

Many differentials have no way of limiting the amount of engine power that gets sent to their attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low-traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, several designs of differentials can either limit the amount of slip (these are called &#x27;limited-slip&#x27; differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.

Locking differentials work by temporarily locking together a differential&#x27;s output shafts, causing all wheels to turn at the same rate, providing torque in case of slippage. This is generally used for the center differential, which distributes power between the front and the rear axles. While a drivetrain that turns all wheels equally would normally fight the driver and cause handling problems, this is not a concern when wheels are slipping.

Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.

A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high-traction side before traction is exceeded at the low-traction side.

A fairly recent innovation in automobiles is electronic traction control. It typically uses a vehicle&#x27;s braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates the function of a limited-slip differential, and by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. This technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel is slipping, and only activates when wheel slip is detected. Therefore, typically no mechanism exists to actively prevent wheel slip (i.e., locking the differential in advance of wheel slip is not possible); rather, the system is designed to expressly permit wheel slip to occur, and then to attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.


===Operating modes===
The architecture of an AWD/4WD system can be described by showing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may have the ability to operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. The different modes are:
*Two-wheel drive mode – In this mode, only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. 
*Four-wheel drive mode – Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, three submodes (below) can be defined.
*Part-time mode – The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for part-time use in off-road or loose-surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle, depending on the road conditions and the weight over the axles. 
*Full-time mode – Both axles are driven at all times, but an interaxle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven full-time in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel-gear differentials, the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called all-the-time 4WD, all-wheel drive, or AWD. If the interaxle differential is locked out, then the mode reverts to a part-time mode. 
*On-demand mode – In this mode, the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from open to a rigidly coupled state, while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.
In addition to these basic modes, some implementations can combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode.

==History==

===Late 1800s===
In 1893, before the establishment of the modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a four-wheel drive system for a steam-powered traction engine, including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah&#x27;s Pedrail wheel system in what was one of the first four-wheel drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh&#x27;s previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.

Ferdinand Porsche designed and built a four-wheel-driven electric vehicle for the &quot;k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner &amp; Co.&quot; in Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The vehicle was a series hybrid car that used an electric hub motor at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator. It was clumsily heavy, and due to its unusual status, the so-called &quot;Lohner–Porsche&quot; is not frequently given its credit as the first four-wheel driven automobile.

===1900s–1920s===
The world&#x27;s first four-wheel-drive car directly powered by an internal-combustion engine, and the first with a front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout, was the Dutch &quot;Spyker&quot; 60 H.P., Commissioned for the Paris to Madrid race of 1903, it was presented that year by brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of Amsterdam. The two-seat sports car featured permanent four-wheel drive and was also the first car equipped with a six-cylinder engine, as well as four-wheel braking. Later used as a hill-climb racer, it is now an exhibit in the Louwman Museum (the former Nationaal Automobiel Museum) in the Hague, the Netherlands.

Designs for four-wheel drive in America first came from the Twyford Motor Car Company.

The Reynolds-Alberta Museum has a four-wheel-drive vehicle, named &quot;Michigan&quot;, from 1905 in unrestored storage.

The first four-wheel-drive vehicles to go into mass production were built by (what became) the American Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD) of Wisconsin, founded in 1908. (not to be confused with the term &quot;FWD&quot; as an initialism for &quot;front-wheel-drive&quot;)
Along with the 1- and 2-ton Nash Quad (see below), the 3-ton FWD Model B became a standard military four-wheel-drive truck for the U.S. Army in World War I. Some 16,000 FWD Model B trucks were built for the British and American armies during World War I – about half by FWD and the rest by other licensed manufacturers. Only about 20% of the trucks built were four-wheel drives, but the 4x4s were more often on the front lines.

About 11,500 of the Jeffery / Nash Quad trucks were built for similar use between 1913 and 1919. The Quad not only came with four-wheel-drive and four-wheel brakes, but also featured four-wheel steering. The Quad was one of the first successful four-wheel drive vehicles ever to be made, and its production continued for 15 years with a total of 41,674 units made by 1928.

Daimler-Benz also has a history in four-wheel drive. After the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called &quot;Dernburg-Wagen&quot;, also equipped with four-wheel steering, in 1907, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia; Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced some rather sophisticated four-wheel drives, the G1, the G4, and G4 following. Mercedes and BMW developed this further in 1937.

===1930s===

The American Marmon-Herrington Company was founded in 1931 to serve a growing market for moderately priced four-wheel-drive vehicles. Marmon-Herrington specialized in converting Ford trucks to four-wheel drive and got off to a successful start by procuring contracts for military and commercial aircraft refueling trucks, 4×4 chassis for towing light weaponry, and an order from the Iraqi Pipeline Company for what were the largest trucks built at the time.

The early Marmon-Herringtons proved to be the exception to the rule — 4WD cars and trucks developed in the 1930s were mainly built for governments, with (future) warfare applications in mind.

Dodge developed its first four-wheel-drive truck in 1934 — a military ton designated K-39-X-4(USA), of which 796 units were built for the U.S. Army in several configurations. Timken supplied front axles and transfer cases, added to militarized a civilian truck. The Timken transfer case was the first &quot;part-time&quot; design, that allowed the driver to engage or disengage four-wheel drive using a lever inside the cab. In spite of the limited 1930s U.S. military budgets, the &#x27;34 truck was liked well-enough that a more modern ton truck was developed, and 1,700 RF-40-X-4(USA) trucks were produced in 1938, and 292 TF-40-X-4(USA) in 1939.

Starting in 1936, Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built roughly 4,700 four-wheel-drive roadsters, called the Kurogane Type 95 reconnaissance car, used by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured – a two-door roadster, a two-door pickup truck, and a four-door phaeton, all equipped with a transfer case that engaged the front wheels, powered by a 1.3-litre, two-cylinder, air-cooled OHV V-twin engine.

The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern Geländewagen such as the Mercedes-Benz G-Class still feature some of the attributes, with the exception of fully independent suspension, since it can compromise ground clearance. The Unimog is also a result of Mercedes 4x4 technology.

The first Russian-produced four-wheel-drive vehicle, also in part for civilian use, was the GAZ-61, developed in the Soviet Union in 1938. &quot;Civilian use&quot; may be a bit of a misnomer, as most, if not all, were used by the Soviet government and military (as command cars), but the GAZ-61-73 version is the first four-wheel-drive vehicle with a normal closed sedan body. Elements of the chassis were used in subsequent military vehicles such as the 1940 GAZ-64 and the 1943 GAZ-67, as well as the postwar GAZ-69, and the properly civilian GAZ-M-72, based on the rear-wheel drive GAZ-20 &quot;Victory&quot; and built from 1955 to 1958. Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the Jeep in North America, but through the 1960s, the technology of Soviet 4×4 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced, and used.

===World War II – a leap in AWD proliferation===

Until &quot;go-anywhere&quot; vehicles were needed for the military on a large scale, four-wheel drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles had not found their place. The World War II Jeep, originally developed by American Bantam, but mass-produced by Willys and Ford, became the best-known four-wheel-drive vehicle in the world during the war. The American Dodge WC series and Chevrolet G506 4x4 variants were also produced by the hundreds of thousands, as well as the Canadian Military Pattern trucks, of which 4x4s were by far the most prevalent of their various driveline configurations. All told, North America built about million 4x4 driven vehicles during the war,

Availability of certain critical components, such transfer cases and especially constant-velocity joints affected development. Though not used much on commercial vehicles, all-wheel drive vehicles all needed these; and they would use two or three times the number of driven axles, meaning more gears to cut for all the differentials. Produced up to the war by a few specialized firms with limited capacity, from spring 1942, Ford, Dodge, and Chevrolet joined in fabricating these in a quantity more than a 100-fold greater than in 1939.

Although Russia had their own jeep-like vehicle (the GAZ-64) up and running in 1940, a year earlier than the American jeep, in the early years of the war, they relied significantly on Lend-Lease vehicles, provided by the western allies. In 1943, they launched a further-developed version: the GAZ-67.

By contrast, the Axis powers&#x27; closest equivalent to the jeep, the VW Kübelwagen, of which only some 50,000 were built, though being equipped with portal gear hubs, only had rear-wheel drive.

===1945–1960s===
Willys introduced the model CJ-2A in 1945, the first full-production four-wheel-drive vehicle for sale in the general marketplace. Due to the ubiquitous World War II Jeep&#x27;s success, its rugged utilitarianism set the pattern for many four-wheel-drive vehicles to come. Dodge also started production of the civilian 4WD Power Wagon trucks, for the 1946 model year. Both the Willys and the Dodge were developed directly from their WW II predecessors.

Equally boxy to the Jeep, and also inline-four powered, the Land Rover appeared at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948. Originally conceived as a stop-gap product for the struggling Rover car company, despite chronic underinvestment, it succeeded far better than their passenger cars. Inspired by a Willys MB – the ubiquitous WWII &quot;jeep&quot; – that was frequently run off-road on the farm belonging to chief engineer Maurice Wilks, Land Rover developed the more refined yet still off-road capable luxury 4WD Range Rover in the 1970s.

With the acquisition of the &quot;Jeep&quot; name in 1950, Willys had cornered the brand. Its successor, Kaiser Jeep, introduced a revolutionary 4WD wagon called the Wagoneer in 1963. Not only was it technically innovative, with independent front suspension and the first automatic transmission coupled to 4WD, but also it was equipped and finished as a regular passenger automobile. In effect, it was the ancestor of the modern SUV. The luxury AMC or Buick V8-powered Super Wagoneer produced from 1966 to 1969 raised the bar even higher.

Jensen applied the Formula Ferguson (FF) full-time all-wheel-drive system to 318 units of their Jensen FF built from 1966 to 1971, marking the first time 4WD was used in a production GT sports car. While most 4WD systems split torque evenly, the Jensen split torque roughly 40% front, 60% rear by gearing the front and rear at different ratios.

===1970s–1990s===
American Motors Corporation (AMC) acquired Kaiser&#x27;s Jeep Division in 1970 and quickly upgraded and expanded the entire line of off-road 4WD vehicles. With its added roadworthiness, the top-range full-sized Grand Wagoneer continued to compete with traditional luxury cars. Partially hand-built, it was relatively unchanged during its production through 1991, even after Chrysler&#x27;s buyout of AMC.

Subaru introduced the category-expanding Leone in 1972, an inexpensive compact station wagon with a light-duty, part-time four-wheel-drive system that could not be engaged on dry pavement. In September, AMC introduced Quadra Trac full-time AWD for the 1973 model year Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer. Due to full-time AWD, which relieved the driver of getting out to lock hubs and having to manually select between 2WD and 4WD modes, it dominated all other makes in FIA rally competition. Gene Henderson and Ken Pogue won the Press-on-Regardless Rally FIA championship with a Quadra Trac-equipped Jeep in 1972.

American Motors introduced the innovative Eagle for the 1980 model year. These were the first American mass-production cars to use the complete front-engine, four-wheel-drive system. The AMC Eagle was offered as a sedan, coupe, and station wagon with permanent automatic all-wheel drive passenger models. The new Eagles combined Jeep technology with an existing and proven AMC passenger automobile platform. They ushered a whole new product category of &quot;sport-utility&quot; or crossover SUV. AMC&#x27;s Eagles came with the comfort and high-level appointments expected of regular passenger models and used the off-road technology for an extra margin of safety and traction.

The Eagle&#x27;s thick viscous fluid center differential provided a quiet and smooth transfer of power that was directed proportionally to the axle with the greatest traction. This was a true full-time system operating only in four-wheel drive without undue wear on suspension or driveline components. No low range was used in the transfer case. This became the forerunner of the designs that followed from other manufacturers. The automobile press at the time tested the traction of the Eagles and described it as far superior to the Subaru&#x27;s and that it could beat many so-called off-road vehicles. &quot;Four Wheeler&quot; magazine concluded that the AMC Eagle was &quot;The beginning of a new generation of cars.&quot;

The Eagles were popular (particularly in the snowbelt), had towing capacity, and came in several equipment levels including sport and luxury trims. Two additional models were added in 1981, the subcompact SX/4 and Kammback. A manual transmission and a front axle-disconnect feature were also made available for greater fuel economy. During 1981 and 1982, a unique convertible was added to the line. The Eagle&#x27;s monocoque body was reinforced for the conversion and had a steel targa bar with a removable fiberglass roof section. The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987. Total AMC Eagle production was almost 200,000 vehicles.

Audi also introduced a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the Audi Quattro, in 1980. Audi&#x27;s chassis engineer, Jörg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Finland that a vehicle used by the West German Army, the Volkswagen Iltis, could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a four-wheel-drive car that would also be used for rallying to improve Audi&#x27;s conservative image. The Audi quattro system became a feature on production cars.

In 1987, Toyota also developed a car built for competition in rally campaigns. A limited number of road-going FIA Homologation Special Vehicle Celica GT-Four (known as Toyota Celica All-Trac Turbo in North America) were produced. The All-Trac system was later available on serial production Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, and Toyota Previa models.

Some of the earliest mid-engined four-wheel-drive cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for Group B homologation, such as the Ford RS200 made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker Panther Westwinds created a mid-engined four-wheel drive, the Panther Solo 2.

===2000–present===
In the United States, as of late 2013, AWD vehicles comprised 32% of new light vehicle sales, up 5% since 2008. This is in large part due to the popularity of the crossover. Most crossovers offer the popular technology, in spite of it increasing vehicle price and fuel consumption. Car manufacturers have inundated consumers with marketing proclaiming AWD as a safety feature, although the advantage of AWD over FWD occurs in accelerating, not braking or steering. Tests have shown that though AWD gives improved acceleration in wintery conditions, it does not help with braking.

In 2008, Nissan introduced the GT-R featuring a rear-mounted transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft from the engine to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.

==Uses==

===Road racing===
Spyker is credited with building and racing the first four-wheel-drive racing car, the Spyker 60 HP in 1903.

Bugatti created a total of three four-wheel-drive racers, the Type 53, in 1932, but the cars were notorious for having poor handling.

Miller produced the first 4WD car to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, the 1938 Miller Gulf Special.

Ferguson Research Ltd. built the front-engined P99 Formula One car that actually won a non-World Championship race with Stirling Moss in 1961. In 1968, Team Lotus raced cars in the Indy 500 and three years later in Formula 1 with the Lotus 56, that had both turbine engines and 4WD, as well as the 1969 4WD-Lotus 63 that had the standard 3-litre V8 Ford Cosworth engine. Matra also raced a similar MS84, and McLaren entered their M9A in the British Grand Prix, while engine manufacturers Cosworth produced their own version, which was tested but never raced. All these F1 cars were considered inferior to their RWD counterparts, as the advent of aerodynamic downforce meant that adequate traction could be obtained in a lighter and more mechanically efficient manner, and the idea was discontinued, though Lotus tried repeatedly.

Nissan and Audi had success with all-wheel drive in road racing with the former&#x27;s advent of the Nissan Skyline GT-R in 1989. So successful was the car that it dominated the Japanese circuit for the first years of production, going on to bigger and more impressive wins in Australia before weight penalties eventually levied a&quot; de facto &quot;ban on the car. Most controversial was the win pulled off at the 1990 Macau Grand Prix, where the car led from start to finish. Audi&#x27;s dominance in the Trans-Am Series in 1988 was equally controversial, as it led to a weight penalty midseason and to a rule revision banning all AWD cars; its dominance in Super Touring eventually led to a FIA ban on AWD system in 1998.

New 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations may revive AWD/4WD in road racing, though such systems are only allowed in new hybrid-powered Le Mans prototypes. One example is the Audi R18 e-tron quattro (winner of race, the first hybrid/4WD to win Le Mans), using an electric motor in the front axle with the gasoline engine in the rear.

===In heavy trucks===
Medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks have recently adopted 4×4 drivetrains; 4×4 medium-duty trucks became common after Ford began selling Ford Super Duty trucks. These trucks shared many parts between the light-duty and medium-duty, reducing production costs. The Dana 60 front axle is used on both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the Big Three share/shared parts between the companies, reducing costs. The Dana S 110 is currently being used for the rear drive, under Ford and Ram&#x27;s medium-duty trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the General Motors 4×4s. Ram Trucks began selling medium-duty trucks, 4×4 and 4×2, in 2008. General Motors sold a 4×4 for model years 2005–2009.


===In construction equipment===

Volvo introduced the Model 646 four-wheel-drive backhoe loader in 1977.

==Terminology==
In engineering terms, &quot;four-wheel drive&quot; designates a vehicle with power delivered to four wheel ends spread over at least two axles. The term &quot;4×4&quot; (pronounced &quot;four by four&quot;) was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles as early as the 1940s, with the first number indicating the number of wheel ends on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.

Trucks with dual tires on the rear axle and two driven axles are designated as 4×4s despite having six wheels, because the paired rear wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes. True 6×6 vehicles, which have three powered axles, are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the six-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.

Four-wheeler is a related term applying to all-terrain vehicles, and not to be confused with four-wheel drive. The &quot;four&quot; in the instance referring to the vehicle having four wheels, not necessarily all driven.

==Unusual systems==
Prompted by a perceived need for a simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, French motor manufacturer Citroën developed the 2CV Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4×4 vehicles, which use a conventional transfer case to drive the front and rear axles, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches, and gear-change mechanisms could be linked, so the two engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.

BMC experimented with a twin-engined Mini Moke (dubbed the &quot;Twini Moke&quot;) in the mid-1960s, but never put it into production. This made advantage of the Mini&#x27;s &#x27;power pack&#x27; layout, with a transverse engine and the gearbox in the engine sump. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4×4 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and clutch systems for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the British Army had more user-friendly linked systems.

In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick patented a 4WD system, GB 1113068, that used hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick&#x27;s design that did not use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with the provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer, and as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system&#x27;s integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.

Volkswagen Motorsport, with the help of Austrian company Kaimann Racing for the development, used a twin engine Golf Mk2 for the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

Suzuki Motors introduced the Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Edition in 1996. Earlier Suzuki versions were twin-engined; from 1996 on, the engine is a twin-turbocharged 2.0-L V6, mated to a sequential six-speed manual transmission.

Nissan Motors has developed a system called E-4WD, designed for cars that are normally front-wheel drive; however, the rear wheels are powered by electric motors. This system was introduced in some variants of the Nissan Cube and Tiida. (This is similar to the system used on the Ford Escape Hybrid AWD.)

Chrysler&#x27;s Jeep Division debuted the twin-engined, Jeep Hurricane concept at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This vehicle has a unique &quot;crab crawl&quot; capability, which allows it to rotate 360° in place. This is accomplished by driving the left wheels as a pair and the right wheels as a pair, as opposed to driving the front and rear pairs. A central gearbox allows one side to drive in the opposite direction from the other. It also has dual Hemi V8s.

Some hybrid vehicles such as the Lexus RX400h provide power to an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In the case of the AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), the front wheels can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle&#x27;s gasoline engine, as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system.

The 4RM system used in the Ferrari FF and Purosangue is unique in that it has a rear transaxle with a secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear-wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely variable clutch packs that are allowed to &#x27;slip&#x27; to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent Haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios, the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine&#x27;s torque.

Note: the above all function like 2WD when the multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD high-range in a part-time 4WD system when the clutch is engaged (usually by computer although some allow manual control). Some in this category have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system.
Note: the Haldex Traction-based car list was created from the list on Haldex Traction corporate website: Haldex Cars. A version of the BorgWarner ITM3e system is used on 2006 and up Porsche 911TT&#x27;s. The Borg-Warner ITM 3e is also used in the 2006-now Hyundai Santa Fe and the Hyundai Tucson. In the Hyundais, the ITM 3e acts like a full-time AWD with 95:5 normal torque split. In extreme conditions, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split via the 4WD LOCK button.

===Part-time===
These are vehicles that have no center differential. Since there is no center differential to allow for speed differences between the front and rear wheels when turning, a small amount of tire slippage must occur during turns. When used on slick surfaces, this is not a problem, but when turning on dry pavement, the tires grip, then are forced to slip, then grip again, and so on, until the turn is completed. This causes the vehicle to exhibit a &#x27;hopping&#x27; or &#x27;binding&#x27; sensation. Using an engaged part-time 4WD system on a hard surface is not recommended, as damage to the drive-line eventually occurs. Part-time transfer cases are the industry standard transfer case for the 4x4 truck market. Any other transfer case can be considered more robust, however more moving parts and complexity can, sometimes, make other transfer cases less durable.

<doc id="444650" wikidata="Q3808055" url="?curid=444650" title="Music of Catalonia">
<text>The music of [[Catalonia]] comprises one of the oldest documented musical traditions in Europe. In tandem with the rest of Western Europe, it has a long musical tradition, incorporating a number of different styles and genres over the past two thousand years.

==History==
Among the earliest references to music from Catalonia date to the Middle Ages, when Barcelona and the surrounding area were relatively prosperous, allowing both music and arts to be cultivated actively. Catalonia and adjacent areas were the home for several troubadours, the itinerant composer-musicians whose influence and aesthetics was decisive on the formation of late medieval secular music, and who traveled into Italy and Northern France after the destruction of Occitan culture by the Albigensian Crusade in the early 13th century. The so-called Llibre Vermell de Montserrat (&quot;Red Book of Montserrat&quot;) stands as an important source for 14th-century music.

Renaissance polyphony flourished in Catalonia, though local composers never attained the fame of either the Spanish composers to the South and West or the French composers to the North. Joan Pau Pujol wrote four books of polyphonic masses and motets in honor of the patron saint of Barcelona, St. George.

Performances of opera, mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including three by Isaac Albéniz and seven by Enrique Granados. The Barcelona opera house, Gran Teatre del Liceu, which opened in 1847, remains one of the most important in Spain; in addition, in the mid-19th century the first Barcelona Philharmonic Society was founded for the performance of orchestral music. Several symphonic orchestras exist in Catalonia today, including the Barcelona Orchestra.

===20th century===
Around the beginning of the 20th century, two Catalan composers—Enric Granados and Isaac Albéniz—became the most famous composers in Spain. Francisco Tárrega and Miquel Llobet expanded the technical possibilities of guitar. Their music remains in the standard classical repertory today. Cellist Pau Casals is admired as an outstanding player. Frederic Mompou (1893–1987) is known for his delicate piano works, which often have a Catalan flavor. He spent most of his life in Paris, returning to his native Barcelona only during and after World War II.

A tradition of Catalan art songs also developed, following a similar popularity in the rest of Spain. These have been performed and promoted by Catalan artists, including an album of Catalan folk-songs by Victoria de los Angeles (1991) and an album of more classical songs by José Carreras (1991).

==Folk and popular music==
Originally from northern areas of Catalonia, Sardanes are popular dances, and were especially widespread at the end of the 19th century. Currently, two main types, the original &quot;sardana curta&quot; (short sardana) style and more modern &quot;sardana llarga&quot; (long sardana), are generally performed. While music is performed by a &quot;cobla&quot; musical group, sardanes are danced in a circle dance. Other less common sardanes include the &quot;sardana de lluïment&quot; and the &quot;sardana revessa&quot;.

The cobla itself is an 11-piece band, that includes genuine folk instruments such as the flabiol (tabor pipe) and tambori, tenora, tible which are also used in other regions of Spain. Coblas also frequently play as concert bands without the dance.

Other popular music are the ball de bastons (stick dances), galops, espunyolets, ball de panderetes, ball de gitanes and the music of gralla (music) (a kind of Catalan shawm)and drums used in cercaviles or by colles diableres, etc.

Catalan music incorporates a number of unique instruments, including the flabiol, a type of pipe woodwind, tambori, a small drum, and the guitarra de canya, a xylophone-like instrument made of bones or reeds that is suspended from the musician&#x27;s neck. 

In areas around the river Ebre, like in nearby Aragon and Valencia, the jota is a popular dance.

Sung in both Catalan and Spanish, Havaneres have been very popular at parties since the end of the 19th century when sailors returned from the War of the Cuban Independence.

In the last half century, the rumba catalana genre has spread in Catalonia, played mostly by Gypsies, including popular performers like Peret and Gato Pérez.

During the end of the Franco period, a movement known as Nova Cançó emerged. Nova Cançó singers sang in Catalan, denouncing the official oppression of the language. The pioneering group of singer-songwriters, Els Setze Jutges, was founded in 1961 in Barcelona and came to include several singers from Catalonia, including Joan Manuel Serrat and Lluís Llach, as well as members from the Balearic Islands and Valencian Community. Grup de Folk and &quot;Esquirols&quot; were other notable &quot;cançó&quot; groups.

In the last 20 years, rock and roll has become popular, and a Catalan scene called rock català has appeared. Some very popular groups are Lax&#x27;n&#x27;Busto, Sau, Els Pets or Sopa de Cabra. and more recently, groups such as Doctor Prats and Buhos

In the wake of Mano Negra and Manu Chao&#x27;s success, Catalonia has also produced a number of popular fusion and world music bands, such as Dusminguet or Cheb Balowski. Ojos de Brujo, a band from Barcelona merging traditional flamenco with hip-hop, has also become popular.

Contemporary music sung in Catalan has been relatively successful, and includes music in genres such as pop (Antònia Font, Manel, Els Amics de les Arts, Mishima, Sanjosex) and hip-hop (At Versaris, Guillamino).

<doc id="444656" wikidata="Q875995" url="?curid=444656" title="Stacy's Mom">
<text>&quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; is a song by American rock band Fountains of Wayne. It is the third track on their third studio album, &quot;Welcome Interstate Managers&quot;, and was released to radio as the album&#x27;s first single on May 19, 2003, through S-Curve Records and Virgin Records. &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; was written by bassist Adam Schlesinger and vocalist Chris Collingwood, both of whom produced the song alongside Mike Denneen. Its subject matter was inspired by a friend of Schlesinger&#x27;s when he was young who was attracted to Schlesinger&#x27;s grandmother. It is a power pop song with which the group hoped to emulate the sound of American rock band the Cars.

&quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; reached number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting hit in the United States. Additionally, the song peaked within the top 10 in Ireland and the top 20 in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 500,000 copies, and it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals. The song was accompanied with a music video in which model Rachel Hunter plays the title role. &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; was the only mainstream hit by Fountains of Wayne.

==Background and composition==
Authorship of &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; is credited to Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger; in practice, the two songwriters wrote independently, and agreed to credit both writers on all Fountains of Wayne songs regardless of the actual author. In interviews, Schlesinger took responsibility for the song.

&quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; is a power pop, pop-punk, and new wave song. Part of the song&#x27;s inspiration was a friend with whom Schlesinger had grown up who thought Schlesinger&#x27;s grandmother was attractive. &quot;One of my best friends, when we were maybe 11 or 12, came to me and announced that he thought my grandmother was hot. And I said, &#x27;Hey, you&#x27;re stepping over the line,&#x27; but at that point in life, I wouldn&#x27;t put it past anyone,&quot; he recalled. He hoped to strike a balance &quot;between humor and personality&quot; with the song. In writing the song, he was hoping to take influence from new wave and power pop music: &quot;I was thinking a little bit about &#x27;Mrs. Robinson&#x27; and sonically I was thinking about the Cars, a Rick Springfield sort of thing.&quot; He acknowledged that stylistically, the song &quot;owes a debt&quot; to the Cars&#x27; &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;; its opening guitar riff is similar. Cars frontman Ric Ocasek thought that the intro was a sample from &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; but the band says they performed it in the studio and just &quot;got it right.&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 the week of October 11, 2003, at number 59, making this their first song to appear on that chart. It entered the top 40 the week after by moving 21 spots to number 38 and moved seven spots to number 31 on the week of October 25, 2003. It peaked at number 21 the week of November 21, 2003, and stayed there for two weeks. It stayed on the chart for 17 weeks.

It was one of the first songs to reach the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Most Downloaded Songs&quot; list of the iTunes Music Store. It reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Vocal Pop Performance at the 2004 awards. The single&#x27;s sales were last estimated at 888,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan, in 2011.

==Reception==
Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dubbed it &quot;nicely naughty.&quot; Ben Greenman, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, considered it the &quot;second-catchiest song ever written about a girlfriend&#x27;s parent,&quot; after &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;. The song ranks No. 350 on &quot;Blender&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot; and No. 88 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;00s&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, features several comedic scenes illustrating the boy&#x27;s attempts to get closer to Stacy&#x27;s mother (Rachel Hunter). Its premise is around Stacy (Gianna Dispenza), whose best friend and love interest (Shane Haboucha) is attracted to her mother, mentioning times she caught his attention: by the pool, receiving a massage on the lawn and during an imaginary strip tease in the dining room. It features several sexual innuendos such as wet dreams and adolescent gratification. By the end of the video, Stacy walks in on her unnamed friend in the bathroom as he watches Stacy&#x27;s mother in the backyard pool (a direct reference to Fast Times at Ridgemont High). It closes on the door with an &quot;Ocupado&quot; sign hanging from the doorknob and Stacy laughing, possibly flattered by the event believing the friend in question reciprocated her romantic and sexual interests.

&quot;We looked at a lot of treatments and some directors were trying to be kind of arty and subtle with it, but Chris Applebaum went completely for the jugular,&quot; said Schlesinger. Model Rachel Hunter plays the title role, which she accepted because she was a fan of the band and the song. The group had previously hoped to get Paulina Porizkova (Ocasek&#x27;s then-wife) for the role. The clip was shot in Los Angeles in late May 2003. &quot;It was 7 a.m., and there was Rachel Hunter doing a striptease on the kitchen counter,&quot; remembered Schlesinger. The video was first sent to television in July 2003.

Fountains of Wayne had asked Ocasek to be in the video for the song. Schlesinger explains that while Ocasek claimed that he &quot;politely declined&quot;, he actually just never responded to the request. There are several references to the Cars in the video: a license plate reads &quot;I ♥ RIC&quot;, a reference to Ocasek; one of the boys in the opening scene has dark hair, sunglasses, and clothes such that he looks like an adolescent version of Ocasek; the trademark Elliot Easton &quot;bouncing&quot; (at approximately 1:15 into the video) and hairdo as he plays his guitar for the Cars; and the re-creation of a scene from the movie &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, which featured the Cars&#x27; &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot;. Further links to the Cars and new wave music are given by the magazine &quot;Nu Wave&quot; that is featured in the video, the Roland Juno-6 keyboard (a synthesizer of the 1980s), and the record sleeve showing &#x27;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&#x27; in a car. The video reached No. 1 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;VSpot Top 20 Countdown&quot;.

==Release history==
==Bowling for Soup cover==

In 2011, pop punk band Bowling for Soup released a cover version of &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; as a B-side to their single &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Done Anything Like This&quot;.

The cover version came about because the original Fountains of Wayne song was often misattributed to Bowling for Soup. The song was misidentified as a Bowling for Soup song on YouTube and other video sites. In multiple interviews, Bowling for Soup bandleader Jaret Reddick has said that he regularly encountered fans at their concerts who mistakenly thought &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; was a Bowling for Soup song. In 2011, they recorded and released a cover version of the song. Reddick said that by finally releasing their own version of the song, &quot;I’ve basically just taken care of a large part of the population that&#x27;s been wrong for years, and I&#x27;ve made them right.&quot; Alluding to the mistaken identity issue, the cover art for the song release reads: &quot;Everyone thought they did it anyway ... so they freakin did it! Finally you can say this is your favorite song by BFS and not look like an idiot!&quot;

Bowling for Soup has since made the song part of their live setlist.
==In popular culture==
The song was included on the setlist for &quot;Guitar Hero: Van Halen&quot; as a guest act, and was included as DLC for &quot;Rock Band 4&quot;. It also appeared in the 4th episode of the television series &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Woman Seeking Dead Husband: Smokers Okay, No Pets&quot;. The song was parodied on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; to mock Wack Pack character Hanzi (Imran Kahn). It has also been performed by Postmodern Jukebox ft. Casey Abrams. It has appeared in &quot;Me Him Her&quot; and &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;.

A cover of the song by the Northeastern University pep band has become an unofficial theme song for the Northeastern Huskies men&#x27;s ice hockey team, and has frequent performances at the annual Beanpot. At each game, the pep band plays the song during a stoppage of play with the fan sections continuing to sing through the chorus without accompaniment once gameplay begins again.

Washington, D.C., indie-pop band Sub-Radio released a parody titled &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Dad&quot; on TikTok in 2022 that recorded 10.2 million views before the end of that year.

<text>The Music of Andalusia encompasses a range of traditional and modern musical genres which originate in the region of Andalusia in southern Spain. The most famous are copla and flamenco, the latter being sometimes used as a portmanteau term for various regional musical traditions within Andalusia. Today, Andalusia has a rich and thriving musical scene, which draws from its own musical traditions as well as from external influences such as salsa, jazz or pop music.

==Historical influences on Andalusian music==
Andalusia was probably the main route of transmission of a number of Near-Eastern musical instruments used in classical music; the rebec (ancestor of violin) from the &quot;Maghreb rebab&quot;, the guitar from &quot;qitara&quot; and naker from &quot;naqareh&quot;. Further terms fell into disuse in Europe; adufe from &quot;al-duff&quot;, alboka from &quot;al-buq&quot;, &quot;anafil&quot; from &quot;al-nafir&quot;, exabeba from &quot;al-shabbaba&quot; (flute), atabal (bass drum) from &quot;al-tabl&quot;, atambal from &quot;al-tinbal&quot;,
the balaban, sonajas de azófar from , the conical bore wind instruments, the from the &quot;sulami&quot; or &quot;fistula&quot; (flute or musical pipe),
the shawm and dulzaina from the reed instruments and &quot;al-zurna&quot;,
the gaita from the &quot;Rhaita&quot;, rackett from or , geige (German for a violin) from &quot;ghichak&quot; and the theorbo from the &quot;tarab&quot;.

According to historical sources, William VIII, the father of William, brought to Poitiers hundreds of Muslim prisoners. Trend acknowledges that the troubadors derived their sense of form and the subject matter of their poetry from Andalusia. The hypothesis that the troubador tradition was created, more or less, by William after his experience of Moorish arts while fighting with the Reconquista in Spain was also championed by Ramón Menéndez Pidal in the early twentieth-century, but its origins go back to the &quot;Cinquecento&quot; and Giammaria Barbieri (died 1575) and Juan Andrés (died 1822). Meg Bogin, English translator of the female troubadors, also held this hypothesis. Certainly &quot;a body of song of comparable intensity, profanity and eroticism [existed] in Arabic from the second half of the 9th century onwards.&quot; &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, edited 
Andalusia is a modern autonomous community of Spain that is best known for flamenco, a form of music and dance, mostly performed by artists and ordinary people from Andalusia.

Improvised flamenco songs of ancient Andalusian origin are called &quot;cante jondo&quot;, and are characterized by a reduced tonal ambiance, a strict rhythm, baroque ornamentation and repetition of notes. &quot;Cante jondo&quot; is sung by a single singer (&quot;cantaor&quot;).

==Structure==
There are two forms of flamenco songs: &quot;cante jondo&quot; and &quot;cante chico&quot;. &quot;Cante jondo&quot; are slower and usually feature sad lyrics about disappointed love or death, while cante chico are much quicker, more popular and dance-oriented. The concept of &quot;duende&quot; is very important in flamenco. Loosely defined, &quot;duende&quot; is a spiritual or emotional bond between the performer and audience, created by the performer&#x27;s intense concentration and passion.

There are multiple styles (&quot;palos&quot;) of flamenco, including:
*fandango
*fandangos de Huelva
*granadínos - from Granada
*malagueñas - from Málaga
*saeta
*sevillana
*siguiriyas
*soleares
*Tangos

The guitar is a vital instrument to flamenco; it marks the measure of a song, and is frequently used in expressive solos during which the guitarist will improvise short variations called &quot;falsetas&quot;. Ramón Montoya was the most influential early guitarist, known for having solidified the guitar as a solo instrument. His successors included Manolo Sanlúcar and Paco de Lucía.

==History==
The golden age of flamenco is said to be 1869 to 1910, later becoming more and more popularized internationally and influenced by South American music, especially the tango. Musicians from the golden age performed at bars called café cantantes, such as &quot;Café de Chinitas&quot; in Málaga, which was made famous by the poetry of García Lorca. Other musicians of the early 20th century include Manolo Caracol, who walked from Jerez to participate in a cante jondo competition, which he won.

Though the golden age had long since passed, the 1950s saw flamenco achieving increased respectability in Spain. Hispavox, a Spanish record label, released &quot;Antología del Cante Flamenco&quot; in 1956; the recording&#x27;s collection of most all of the greatest flamenco singers was very popular. In 1956, the first national cante jondo competition was held in Cordoba, followed by a Chair of Flamencology being established at Jerez in 1958.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Antonio Mairena and similar artists kelped kickstart a flamenco revival as American and British rock began dominating the Spanish music scene. Emerging from this, Camarón de la Isla became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed performers of the century. His 1969 debut &quot;Con la Colaboracion Especial de Paco de Lucia&quot; inspired a new generation of performers that invented Nuevo Flamenco.

In the 1970s and 80s, salsa, blues, rumba and other influences were added to flamenco, along with music from India. Ketama&#x27;s 1988 debut, &quot;Ketama&quot;, was especially influential. At the beginning of the 1990s, the Madrid label Nuevos Medios became closely associated with the new flamenco fusion music, which came to be called nuevo flamenco.

In the modern era Andalusian music continues to thrive, there have been efforts to preserve the tradition, as well as the traditional melodies, rhythms, and instruments, ensuring that this cultural heritage is passed down to future generations. Not only has this music been preserved in it original form, this music has been transformed into elements of Jazz, Fusion, and world music where it will be preserved forever in the music world.

<text>The Festival International De Louisiane is an annual music and arts festival held in Lafayette, Louisiana celebrating the French heritage of the region and its connection to the Francophone world. The festival was first held in 1987 and has become very popular, attracting musicians, artists, and craftsmen from around the world. The festival is held outdoors in Downtown Lafayette on the last full weekend of April and is free to the public. Estimates for attendance include 400,000 in 2016. The festival was voted the &quot;Best World Music Festival&quot; by About.com readers in their 2012 and 2013 Readers&#x27; Choice Awards. 2020 saw a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The stated mission of the festival is to:
French speakers live in the south central area of Louisiana known as Acadiana, and much of the local traditional music by Cajun and Creole musicians use French lyrics. Bi-lingual radio and television announcers underscore the prevalence of French speakers in older, rural areas among both Cajun and Creole residents. The French Immersion programs in the area promote the language in charter schools while increasing connections to the rest of the French-speaking world. Festival International underscores Acadiana&#x27;s connection to the Francophone world.

Organizations such as Radio Canada, TV5Monde, Radio France, and Afropop Worldwide have reached out to Festival International officials to cover the event. In addition, the 2016 lineup of Francophone artists has attracted several government officials from the French-speaking world.

<text>USS &quot;Bonita&quot; (SF-6/SS-165), a &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class submarine and one of the &quot;V-boats,&quot; was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bonito. Her keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 9 June 1925 as V-3 (SF-6), sponsored by Mrs. L.R. DeSteiguer, wife of Rear Admiral DeSteiguer, and commissioned on 22 May 1926, Lieutenant Commander Charles A. Lockwood, Jr. in command. Like her sisters, &quot;Bonita&quot; was designed to meet the fleet submarine requirement of surface speed for operating with contemporary battleships.

==Engineering==

&quot;V-3&quot; was completed with two Busch-Sulzer direct-drive 6-cylinder 2-cycle main diesel engines of each, along with two Busch-Sulzer auxiliary diesel engines of each, driving electrical generators. The latter were primarily for charging batteries, but to reach maximum surfaced speed, they could augment the mechanically coupled main-propulsion engines by supplying supplemental power to the 1,200 hp (890 kW) electric motors that were intended for submerged propulsion. Although it wasn&#x27;t until about 1939 that its problems were fully solved, electric transmission in a pure diesel-electric arrangement became the propulsion system for the successful fleet submarines of World War II, the &quot;Porpoise-class&quot;, and the &quot;Tambor&quot;-class through the &quot;Tench&quot;-class. Prior to recommissioning in 1940, the auxiliary diesels were replaced with two BuEng Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg AG (MAN-designed) 6-cylinder 4-cycle diesel engines of each. In 1942-43 &quot;Bonita&quot; was converted to a cargo submarine, with the main engines removed to provide cargo space, significantly reducing her speed on the remaining auxiliary diesels.

==Service history==

===Interwar period===
Assigned to Submarine Division 20 (SubDiv 20), &quot;V-3&quot; cruised along the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea until November 1927. With her division, she then transferred to the Pacific Fleet, arriving at San Diego, California, on 17 December 1927. After service with SubDivs 12 and 20 along the Pacific coast and off Hawaii, she joined SubDiv 15 of the Rotating Reserve at Mare Island Navy Yard on 1 June 1932. During this period her 5 inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun was replaced by a 3 inch (76 mm)/50 caliber weapon. She was renamed Bonita on 9 March 1931 and given hull classification symbol SS-165 on 1 July 1931.

&quot;Bonita&quot; rejoined SubDiv 12 in September 1933 and cruised in Caribbean Sea, West Coast, and Hawaiian waters through 1936. She departed San Diego, California on 20 January 1937 and arrived at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 18 February. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 4 June 1937.

===World War II===
Recommissioned on 5 September 1940, she departed New London, Connecticut on 17 November for Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone. &quot;Bonita&quot; patrolled in the Pacific, off Panama, until she returned to Philadelphia for overhaul in October 1942. At this time she was converted to a cargo submarine with the removal of her main engines, severely restricting her speed on the auxiliary engines.

Patrolling off the Maine coast until mid-1943, she then joined Submarine Squadron 1 (SubRon 1), SubDiv 13, on training duty out of New London. She remained on that duty until February 1945. Arriving at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 February, she was decommissioned 3 March and sold 28 October 1945.

<doc id="444665" wikidata="Q198399" url="?curid=444665" title="Zikhron Ya'akov">
<text>Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov () often shortened to just Zikhron, is a town in northern Israel, south of Haifa, and part of the Haifa District. It is located at the southern end of the Carmel mountain range overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, near the coastal highway (Highway 2). It was one of the first Moshavot of Halutzim in the country, founded in 1882 by Romanian Jews, who in 1883 received support from Baron Edmond James de Rothschild and renamed their town in honor of his father, James Mayer de Rothschild (&quot;James&quot; being derived from the Hebrew name Ya&#x27;akov, Jacob). In it had a population of .

==History==

Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov was founded in December 1882 when 100 Jewish pioneers from Romania, members of the Hibbat Zion movement, purchased two plots of land 5 km apart: 6000 dunam in Zammarin and 500 dunam in Tantura. The land was acquired for 46000 francs from Frances Germain, a French citizen, probably of Christian Arab origin. Deeming the name of the place to derive from &quot;Samaria&quot;, for a number of years the place was called &quot;Shomron&quot; in the Hebrew and Yiddish press. The families came from Moineşti in Moldavia and a central merit in organising the move belongs to Moses Gaster, scholar and early Zionist. 

The difficulty of working the rocky soil and an outbreak of malaria led many of the people to leave before the year was up.

In 1883, Baron Edmond James de Rothschild became the patron of the Moshava and drew up plans for its residential layout and agricultural economy. Zikhron was one of the first Jewish agricultural towns to come under the wing of the Baron (along with Rishon LeZion and Rosh Pinna), who renamed it in memory of his father, James (Ya&#x27;akov) Mayer de Rothschild.

To accomplish his first objective, Baron de Rothschild brought in planners who designed and allotted housing lots along the main road for the use of Moshava farmers. Each lot included a house facing the street, a long interior courtyard and a rear building for storing agricultural implements. The French-inspired architecture included tiled roofs and painted wooden windows. Each farmer was given a salary and placed under the direction of Elijah Shaid, the Baron&#x27;s clerk. The Baron also commissioned the construction of the Ohel Ya&#x27;akov Synagogue, named after his father, to serve the town. Sparing no expense to build the edifice, the synagogue features a majestic ark made of white marble. The synagogue opened in 1886 and has conducted daily prayer services continuously to this day.

Following a number of economic failures, in 1885 Rothschild helped to establish the first winery in Israel, Carmel Winery, together with a bottling factory, in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. This was more successful economically although it was initially short-lived as in 1892 the grapevines succumbed to phylloxera, a type of parasite. After a brief set-back, American seedlings which were resistant to phylloxera were grown and the winery began to flourish. Today, the winery remains in action, as do the huge wine cellars that were carved into the mountain over a century ago.

In 1894, Jewish and Arab workers earned a wage of six piastres working in the plantations, but Jewish workers also received a supplement of four piastres from a charity fund. When Rothschild withdrew his financial support from plantations in Palestine in 1900, the subsidy was discontinued. Jewish workers were quickly replaced by Arab ones, used to being paid the lower wage.
In August 1903, the First Eretz Yisraeli Congress was assembled by Menachem Ussishkin in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. Complementing the World Zionist Congress, it was originally intended as an annual gathering of the leaders of the Yishuv; but it didn&#x27;t get traction, so the First Congress was also the last one. The effort to coordinate the development of the Yishuv did however bear fruit in establishing the trade union of teachers, which joined Histadrut in 1950 and stays active to this day.

Between 1907 and 1919, Hillel Yaffe&#x27;s hospital, the only Jewish hospital north of Jaffa, was located in Zichron Ya&#x27;akov; according to Hillel Yaffe&#x27;s wishes, he was buried in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov in 1936.

In 1910 David Ben Gurion worked as a farm labourer in Zichron Ya&#x27;akov for several months. At that time he found several Arab families living in the yards of almost every farmer.

In 1954, the remains of Baron Edmond de Rothschild were reinterred in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov.

==Nili spy ring==
Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov came to fame during World War I for the establishment of the Nili spy ring by Sarah Aaronsohn, together with her brothers, Aaron (a noted botanist) and Alex, and their friend Avshalom Feinberg. The group volunteered to spy on Ottoman positions and report them to British agents offshore. In September 1917, the Ottomans caught one of Sarah&#x27;s carrier pigeons and cracked the Nili code. In October, they surrounded Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov and arrested Sarah and several others. After four days of torture, they planned on transporting Sarah elsewhere, she requested to be taken home to change her clothes. Once home she shot herself with a pistol hidden in her bathroom and died after several days. Sarah shot herself in the throat, leaving her unable to speak, in order to avoid releasing classified information. Sarah is buried in the Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov cemetery. The Aaronsohn House–Nili Museum recreates the history of this period - there is an excellent interactive section in the museum.

==Demographics==


In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Zikhron-Yaakov had a population of 1,302 inhabitants; 1,013 Jews, 7 Christians and 282 Muslims, where the Christians were 2 Orthodox, 3 Roman Catholics, 1 Anglican and 1 Protestant.

The population increased dramatically in the early 1950s, after the establishment of the State of Israel. Between the 1960s and 1990s, the population remained constant with about 5,000 inhabitants. At the end of 2009, Zikhron Yaakov had a population of 18,719. Many residents continue to engage in agriculture, although upscale private homes have been built by families attracted to the scenic landscape. Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov has a high number of English speaking residents, olim and others.

==Education and religious institutions==
While the majority of citizens of the town would define themselves as secular, there is a sizable religious Jewish community in the town, including Haredi members of the Ohr Yaakov Yeshiva and members of a Chabad-Lubavitch community. In addition there are several religious zionist synagogues. It is unique in that there are Progressive/Reform and Conservative Jewish communities and synagogues in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. The former, &quot;Kehillat Sulam Yaakov&quot; (in Hebrew &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder Community&quot;) is a synagogue that practices Progressive Judaism and is a part of the Israeli Movement for Progressive Judaism. The latter, &quot;VeAhavta&quot;, is a synagogue that practices Conservative Judaism.

==Landmarks==

The original Carmel-Mizrahi Winery continues to make wine in Zikhron Yaakov. The town draws many tourists attracted to its picturesque setting and historic city center whose restored main street of landmark buildings, called &quot;Derekh HaYayin&quot; (&quot;Path of the Wine&quot;), houses coffeehouses and boutique shops selling locally-made crafts, jewellery, and antiques, especially on the town&#x27;s famous &quot;Midrachov&quot; (Rechov haMeyasdim — Founders Street). It was announced in early 2008 that a wine park would be created on the slope between Zikhron and neighboring town Binyamina.

<doc id="444673" wikidata="Q215486" url="?curid=444673" title="Vitruvian Man">
<text>The Vitruvian Man (; ) is a drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist and scientist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to . Inspired by the writings of the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, the drawing depicts a nude man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in both a circle and square. It was described by the art historian Carmen C. Bambach as &quot;justly ranked among the all-time iconic images of Western civilization&quot;. Although not the only known drawing of a man inspired by the writings of Vitruvius, the work is a unique synthesis of artistic and scientific ideals and often considered an archetypal representation of the High Renaissance.

The drawing represents Leonardo&#x27;s conception of ideal body proportions, originally derived from Vitruvius but influenced by his own measurements, the drawings of his contemporaries, and the &quot;De pictura&quot; treatise by Leon Battista Alberti. Leonardo produced the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; in Milan and the work was probably passed to his student Francesco Melzi. It later came into the possession of Venanzio de Pagave, who convinced the engraver Carlo Giuseppe Gerli to include it in a book of Leonardo&#x27;s drawings, which widely disseminated the previously little-known image. It was later owned by Giuseppe Bossi, who wrote early scholarship on it, and eventually sold to the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia of Venice in 1822, where it has remained since. Due to its sensitivity to light, the drawing rarely goes on public display, but it was borrowed by the Louvre in 2019 for their exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of Leonardo&#x27;s death.

==Name==
The drawing is described by Leonardo&#x27;s notes as , variously translated as &quot;The Proportions of the Human Figure after Vitruvius&quot;, or &quot;Proportional Study of a Man in the Manner of Vitruvius&quot;. It is much better known as the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;. The art historian Carlo Pedretti lists it as &quot;Homo Vitruvius, study of proportions with the human figure inscribed in a circle and a square&quot;, and later as simply &quot;Homo Vitruvius&quot;.

==Description==
===Composition===
The drawing was executed primarily with pen and light-brown ink, while there are traces of brown wash (watercolor). The paper measures , larger than most of Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;folio&quot; manuscript sheets, while the paper itself was originally made somewhat unevenly, given its irregular edges. Close examination of the drawing reveals that it was meticulously prepared, and is devoid of &quot;sketchy and tentative&quot; lines. Leonardo used metalpoint with a calipers and compass to make precise lines, and small tick marks were used for measurements. These compass marks demonstrate an inner structure of &quot;measured intervals&quot; which is displayed in tandem with the general structure created by the geometric figures.

The &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; depicts a nude man facing forward and surrounded by a square, while superimposed on a circle. The man is portrayed in different stances simultaneously: His arms are stretched above his shoulders and then perpendicular to them, while his legs are together and also spread out along the circle&#x27;s base. The scholar Carlo Vecce notes that this approach displays multiple phases of movement at once, akin to a photograph. The man&#x27;s fingers and toes are arranged carefully as to not breach the surrounding shapes. Commentators often note that Leonardo went out of his way to create an artistic depiction of the man, rather than a simple portrayal. According to the biographer Walter Isaacson, the use of delicate lines, an intimate stare, and intricate hair curls, &quot;weaves together the human and the divine&quot;. Pedretti notes close similarities between the man and the angel of Leonardo&#x27;s earlier &quot;Annunciation&quot; painting.

==Background==
===Historical context===
The moderately successful architect and engineer Vitruvius lived from BCE, primarily in the Roman Republic. He is best known for authoring (&quot;On Architecture&quot;), later called the &quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;, which is the only substantial architecture treatise that survives from antiquity. The work&#x27;s third volume includes a discussion concerning body proportions, where the figures of a man in a circle and a square are respectively referred to as &quot;homo ad circulum&quot;, &quot;homo ad quadratum&quot;. Vitruvius explained that:

19th-century historians often postulated that Leonardo had no substantial inspiration from the ancient world, propagating his stance as a &#x27;modern genius&#x27; who rejected all of classicism. This has been heavily disproven by many documented accounts from Leonardo&#x27;s colleagues or records of him either owning, reading, and being influenced by writings from antiquity. The treatise of Vitruvius was long lost, but rediscovered in the 15th century by Poggio Bracciolini among works such as &quot;De Rerum natura&quot;. Many artists attempted to design figures which would satisfy Vitruvius&#x27; claims, with the earliest being three such images by Francesco di Giorgio Martini around the 1470s. Leonardo may have been influenced by the architect Giacomo Andrea, with whom he records as having dined within 1490. Andrea created his own Vitruvian Man drawing that year, which was unknown to scholars until the 1980s.

===Creation===
Leonardo&#x27;s version of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; corrected inaccuracies in Vitruvius&#x27;s account, particularly related to the head, due to use of book two of the &quot;De pictura&quot; by Leon Battista Alberti. Earlier drawings of the same subject &quot;assumed that the circle and square should be centered around the navel&quot;, akin to Vitruvius&#x27;s account, while Leonardo made the scheme work by using the man&#x27;s genitals as the center of the square, and the navel as the center of the circle. It is likely that Leonardo&#x27;s drawings dated to 1487–1490, and entitled &quot;The proportions of the arm&quot;, were related to the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, possibly serving as preparatory sketches.

Some commentators have speculated that Leonardo incorporated the golden ratio in the drawing, possibly due to his illustrations of Luca Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, largely plagiarized from Piero della Francesca, concerning the ratio. However, the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; is likely to have been drawn before Leonardo met Pacioli, and there has been doubt over the accuracy of such an observation. As architectural scholar Vitor Murtinho explains, a circle tangent to the base of a square, with the radius and square sides related by the golden ratio, would pass exactly through the top two corners of the square, unlike Leonardo&#x27;s drawing. He suggests instead constructions based on a regular octagon or on the vesica piscis.

Leonardo&#x27;s drawing is almost always dated to around 1490 during his First Milanese period. The exact dating is not completely agreed upon and earlier generations of art historians, including Arthur E. Popham, frequently dated the work anywhere from 1485 to 1490. Two leading art historians differ in this respect; Martin Kemp gives , while Carmen C. Bambach contends that the earliest possible date—which &quot;one may not entirely discount&quot;—is 1488. Bambach, in addition to Pedretti, Giovanna Nepi Scirè and Annalisa Perissa Torrini give a slightly broader range of . Bambach explains that this range fits &quot;best with the manner of exact, engraving-like parallel hatching contained within robust pen-and-ink outlines, over traces of lead paint, stylus-ruling, and compass composition&quot;.

===Provenance===
After Leonardo&#x27;s death, the drawing most likely passed to his student Francesco Melzi (1491–1570), who was bequeathed most of Leonardo&#x27;s possessions. From then on, the drawing&#x27;s provenance history is almost certain: it found its way to Cesare Monti (1594–1650), was passed to his heir Anna Luisa Monti, then to the De Page family, first (in 1777) and then his son Gaudenzio de Page. While owned by the elder De Page, he convinced the engraver Carlo Giuseppe Gerli to publish a book of Leonardo&#x27;s drawings, which would be the first widespread dissemination of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; and many other Leonardo drawings. The younger de Page sold the drawing to Giuseppe Bossi, who described, discussed, and illustrated it in the fourth chapter of his 1810 monograph on Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, (&quot;On The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci&quot;). This chapter was published as a stand-alone study the next year (&quot;On the opinions of Leonardo da Vinci regarding the symmetry of human bodies&quot;). After Bossi&#x27;s death in 1815, the drawing was sold to the abbot Luigi Celotti in 1818, and entered into the Venetian Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia&#x27;s collection in 1822, where it has since remained. Because of its high artistic quality and its well-recorded history of provenance, Leonardo&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; has never been doubted.

The &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; is rarely displayed as extended exposure to light would cause fading; it is kept on the fourth floor of the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia, in a locked room. In 2019, the Louvre requested to borrow the drawing for their monumental &quot;Léonard de Vinci&quot; exhibition, which celebrated the 500th anniversary of the artist’s death. They faced substantial resistance from the heritage group Italia Nostra, who contended that the drawing was too fragile to be transported, and filed a lawsuit. At a hearing on 16 October 2019, a judge ruled that the group had not proven their claim, but set a maximum amount of light for the drawing to be exposed to as well as a subsequent rest period to offset its overall exposure to light. The Louvre promised to lend paintings by Raphael to Italy for his own 500th death anniversary; Italy&#x27;s Minister for Cultural Affairs Dario Franceschini stated that &quot;Now a great cultural operation can start between Italy and France on the two exhibitions about Leonardo in France and Raphael in Rome.&quot;

===Legal dispute===
In 2022, the Gallerie dell’Accademia, which owns the drawing, sued German jigsaw puzzle manufacturer Ravensburger for reproducing the artwork in one of the company&#x27;s jigsaw puzzles. Ravensburger started selling the 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle in Italy in 2009 and in 2019 the museum sent the company a cease-and-desist letter and demanded 10% of the revenue. Ravensburger refused to comply and subsequently was sued by the museum under Italy&#x27;s 2004 which governs reproductions of works deemed to be under Italy&#x27;s cultural heritage. In its objections, the German company claimed that it had the right to reproduce the artwork because it was already in the public domain for centuries and that the reproduction occurred outside Italy and thus not subject to Italy&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Code. An Italian court rejected Ravensburger&#x27;s arguments and decided in favor of the museum. In a ruling dated 17 November 2022, the court ordered the puzzle company to cease producing the product for commercial purposes and levied a fine of 1,500 euros for every day that the company failed to comply. In March 2024, a German court ruled in favor of the company, stating that the Cultural Heritage Code is not applicable outside Italy, and therefore a violation of the sovereignty of the individual states. In response, an Italian government official argues they will challenge this &quot;abnormal&quot; German ruling even before the European and international courts.

Licensing fees for famous artworks are an important source of income for Italian museums, and Italian law says that museums owning famous public domain works hold the copyright on those works forever and can control who is allowed to make copies and derivative works of them.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; is often considered an archetypal representative of the High Renaissance, just as Leonardo himself came to represent the archetypal &#x27;Renaissance man&#x27;. It holds a unique distinction in aligning art, mathematics, science, classicism, and naturalism. The art historian Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich, writing for &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, states, &quot;Leonardo envisaged the great picture chart of the human body he had produced through his anatomical drawings and &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; as a (&#x27;cosmography of the microcosm&#x27;). He believed the workings of the human body to be an analogy, in microcosm, for the workings of the universe.&quot;

Kemp calls the drawing &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous drawing&quot;, while Bambach describes it as &quot;justly rank[ing] among the all-time iconic images of Western civilization&quot;. Reflecting on its fame, Bambach further stated in 2019 that &quot;the endless recent fetishizing of the image by modern commerce through ubiquitous reproductions (in popular books, advertising, and the Euro coin) has kidnapped it from the realm of Renaissance drawing, making it difficult for the viewer to appreciate it as a work of nuanced, creative expression.&quot;

<doc id="444683" wikidata="Q7019367" url="?curid=444683" title="News From Indian Country">
<text>News From Indian Country was a privately owned newspaper, published once a month in the United States, founded by the journalist Paul DeMain (Ojibwe/Oneida) in 1986, who served as a managing editor and an owner. It was the oldest continuing, nationally distributed publication that was not owned by a tribal government. It offered national, cultural and regional sections, and &quot;the most up-to-date pow-wow directory in the United States and Canada,&quot; according to its website. The newspaper was offered both in print and electronic form and has subscribers throughout the United States, Canada and 17 other countries.

Due to the independence and persistence of DeMain and the paper in covering controversial topics in Indian Country since 2002, including investigations of the murders of Anna Mae Aquash and others at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation from 1973 to 1975, he and the paper were honored with major awards from the Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) and the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism from the University of Oregon.

In August 2019, after 33 years, &quot;News From Indian Country&quot; published its last issue. 

==Background==
DeMain founded the newspaper in 1986 after returning to the &quot;Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation&quot; (LCO) from the capital Madison, Wisconsin. He had worked as Indian Affairs Advisor for Wisconsin governor Tony Earl, serving as a liaison in his outreach with Native Americans.

DeMain had previously worked for the &quot;Lac Courte Oreille&quot; tribe as its public information officer from 1978 to 1982; he published the tribe&#x27;s newspaper, then the &quot;LCO Journal&quot;. He is the managing editor and chief executive officer of Indian Country Communications Inc. (ICC), a Wisconsin registered stock corporation, which has published the newspaper since 1987. As of 2007, seven Native Americans are registered as stock holders of the privately owned company. The offices of ICC are located on Highway K, near the tribe&#x27;s business district, on the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Reservation near Hayward, Wisconsin.

Nationwide attention to jurisdictional conflicts over tribal treaty rights in Wisconsin and Minnesota helped the new publication spread its reach, while a rapidly spreading Indian gaming industry provided a source of advertising revenue in its early years. Owners have capitalized on emerging desk-top publishing and information management technology to keep up with an expanding market.

For 20 years, Pat Calliotte, one of the founding members, was the associate editor, until her death on November 17, 2006. Kimberlie R. Acosta (aka Kimberlie R. Hall) has worked with the paper since 1991; she is the associate editor and advertising director. She is best known for her photography of native musicians throughout Indian Country from 1997 to present.

&quot;News From Indian Country&quot; is the oldest nationally distributed Native publication which is independent and not owned by a tribal government. Columnists for &quot;NFIC&quot; include George-Kanentiio (Mohawk) from Akwesasne, New York, and Richard Wagamese (Ojibwe), a Canadian award-winning writer now residing in Kamloops, British Columbia. The newspaper has broken new ground online with IndianCountryTV, which began in 2008. IndianCountryTV brings the Native community to the world on a grassroots level, showing interviews, news stories and music videos. IndianCountryTV is the creator of &quot;RezStyle&quot;, with host Kimberlie R. Acosta, and the &quot;Native News Update&quot;, with anchor Kimberlie Acosta.

==Independent journalism==
Since 2002, &quot;News From Indian Country&quot; has broken stories related to the investigation of murders during the 1970s at the Oglala Sioux Tribe Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. These include the American Indian Movement activist Anna Mae Aquash, whose maiden and legal name at the time of her death was Annie Mae Pictou, in December 1975; the FBI special agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack Coler earlier in 1975; and the Black civil rights activist Perry Ray Robinson, who had disappeared during the Wounded Knee Incident in 1973 and who was believed to have been murdered by AIM activists.

The paper&#x27;s coverage contributed to federal investigations and attracted controversy for its implication of AIM leadership in the murder of Aquash, the highest-ranking woman in AIM. In January 2003, the US government began a grand jury hearing in Rapid City on the murder of Aquash. Based on the information DeMain had learned from people in the tribes, in March 2003 he wrote editorials in which he withdrew his previous support of clemency for Leonard Peltier. Soon after, a former AIM member, &quot;Ka-Mook&quot; Nichols, told DeMain that she had witnessed Peltier bragging about shooting the FBI agents. In March 2003, the US government indicted two men for the murder of Aquash.

Peltier sued DeMain and &quot;News From Indian Country&quot; sued for libel by Peltier in May 2003. Some considered this an attempt to expose Nichols (on whom DeMain had relied in 2002 as one of three confidential sources of information) prior to her public testimony during the trial of Arlo Looking Cloud in 2004 for the murder of Aquash. Peltier dropped the lawsuit against &quot;News From Indian Country&quot; shortly after Looking Cloud&#x27;s trial, with a settlement out of court.

Looking Cloud was tried and convicted in 2004. Witnesses in the trial testified to believing that AIM leaders had ordered the murder of Aquash because of fear that she was an FBI informer (she was interrogated at gunpoint) and would tell about having heard Peltier confess to the murders of the FBI agents Williams and Coler. John Graham was tried by the state of South Dakota in 2010 after extradition from Canada and convicted in 2010 of the felony murder of Aquash. Tracy Rios, a Lakota activist, was indicted with Graham; she made a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to charges as an accessory to the kidnapping of Aquash. A third man, Vine Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Marshall, bodyguard to the AIM leader Russell Means in 1975, was indicted in 2008 for aiding and abetting the murder by providing the murder weapon, but he was acquitted at trial in 2010.

==Honors==
*2002, DeMain was given the Wassaja Award, for courage by journalists covering Indian country. It was awarded by the Native American Journalists Association Board of Directors for his reporting on the imprisoned activist Leonard Peltier and the murder of Pictou-Aquash. 
*2003, DeMain was honored with the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism by the University of Oregon for his editorials in &quot;News From Indian Country&quot; that expressed his withdrawal of previous support of clemency for Leonard Peltier.

<doc id="444688" wikidata="Q69513" url="?curid=444688" title="Pena Palace">
<text>The Pena Palace () is a Romanticist castle in São Pedro de Penaferrim, in the municipality of Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera. The castle stands on the top of a hill in the Sintra Mountains above the town of Sintra, and on a clear day it can be easily seen from Lisbon and much of its metropolitan area. It is a national monument and constitutes one of the major expressions of 19th-century Romanticism in the world. The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal. It is also used for state occasions by the President of the Portuguese Republic and other government officials.

==History==

The castle&#x27;s history started in the Middle Ages when a chapel dedicated to &quot;Our Lady of Pena&quot; was built on the top of the hill above Sintra. According to tradition, construction occurred after an apparition of the Virgin Mary. 

In 1493, John II, accompanied by his wife Leonor of Viseu, made a pilgrimage to the site to fulfill a vow. His successor, Manuel I, was also very fond of this sanctuary, and ordered the construction of a monastery on this site which was donated to the Order of Saint Jerome. For centuries Pena was a small, quiet place for meditation, housing a maximum of eighteen monks.

In the 18th century the monastery was severely damaged by lightning. However, it was the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, occurring shortly afterwards, that took the heaviest toll on the monastery, reducing it to ruins. Nonetheless, the chapel (and its works of marble and alabaster attributed to Nicolau Chanterene) escaped without significant damage.

For many decades the ruins remained untouched, but they still astonished young Prince Ferdinand. In 1838, as King consort Ferdinand II, he decided to acquire the old monastery, all of the surrounding lands, the nearby Castle of the Moors and a few other estates in the area. King Ferdinand then set out to transform the remains of the monastery into a palace that would serve as a summer residence for the Portuguese royal family. The commission for the Romantic style rebuilding was given to Lieutenant-General and mining engineer Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege. Eschwege, a German amateur architect, was much traveled and likely had knowledge of several castles along the Rhine river. The construction took place between 1842 and 1854, although it was almost completed in 1847: King Ferdinand and Queen Maria II intervened decisively on matters of decoration and symbolism. Among others, the King suggested vault arches, Medieval and Islamic elements be included, and he also designed an ornate window for the main façade (inspired by the chapter house window of the Convent of the Order of Christ in Tomar).

After the death of Ferdinand the palace passed into the possession of his second wife Elisa Hensler, Countess of Edla. The latter then sold the palace to King Luís, who wanted to retrieve it for the royal family, and thereafter the palace was frequently used by the family. In 1889 it was purchased by the Portuguese State, and after the Republican Revolution of 1910 it was classified as a national monument and transformed into a museum. The last queen of Portugal, Queen Amélia, spent her last night at the palace before leaving the country in exile.

The palace quickly drew visitors and became one of Portugal&#x27;s most visited monuments. Over time the colors of the red and yellow façades faded, and for many years the palace was visually identified as being entirely gray. By the end of the 20th century the palace was repainted and the original colors restored.

In 1995, the palace and the rest of the Cultural Landscape of Sintra were classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==Architecture==
The Pena Palace has a profusion of styles much in accordance with the exotic taste of the Romanticism. The intentional mixture of eclectic styles includes the Neo-Gothic, Neo-Manueline, Neo-Islamic and Neo-Renaissance. Much of this has been evident since major renovations in the 1840s. References to other prominent Portuguese buildings, such as the Belém Tower, are also present.
Almost the entire palace stands on rock in the Sintra Mountains. Structurally, it can be divided in four sections:

*the foundations and its enveloping walls, with two gateways (one of which is protected by a drawbridge)
*the restored structure of the old convent, and the clock tower
*the Arches Yard in front of the chapel, with its wall of Moorish arches
*the palatial zone and its cylindric bastion, with interiors decorated in the &quot;cathédrale&quot; style.

===Convent section and clock tower===
As many elements as possible were preserved of the remains of the Hieronymite convent including the cloister, the dining room, the sacristy, and the Manueline-Renaissance chapel. All were embedded in a new section that featured a wide terrace and a clock tower. The Queen&#x27;s Terrace is perhaps the best spot for obtaining an overall picture of the architecture of the palace. The terrace features a sundial cannon that used to fire every day at noon. The clock tower was completed in 1843.

==Interior==
The interiors of the Pena Palace were adapted to serve as the Summer residence of the royal family. It has amazing stuccos, painted walls in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; and various revetments in tile from the 19th century, forming part of the numerous royal collections.
== Park ==

The Pena Park is a vast forested area completely surrounding the Pena Palace, spreading for over 200 hectares of uneven terrain. The park was created at the same time as the palace by King Ferdinand II, who was assisted in the task by the Baron von Eschwege and the Baron von Kessler. The exotic taste of the Romanticism was applied to the park as it was to the palace. The King ordered trees from diverse, distant lands to be planted there. Those included North American sequoia, Lawson&#x27;s cypress, magnolia and Western redcedar, Chinese ginkgo, Japanese Cryptomeria, and a wide variety of ferns and tree ferns from Australia and New Zealand, concentrated in the Queen&#x27;s Fern Garden (&quot;Feteira da Rainha&quot;). The park has a labyrinthic system of paths and narrow roads, connecting the palace to the many points of interest throughout the park, as well as to its two gated exits.

<doc id="444690" wikidata="Q819543" url="?curid=444690" title="Silver Arrows">
<text>Silver Arrows () is a nickname typically given to silver racing cars with a significant connection to a German car manufacturer. Although the term was coined in 1932, it came into popular usage regarding Germany&#x27;s dominant Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union Grand Prix motor racing cars between 1934 and 1939. The name was later applied to the Mercedes-Benz Formula One and sports cars in 1954 and 1955, then to the Sauber Group C prototype racing sports cars that raced at Le Mans in the late 1980s as well as the McLaren-Mercedes Formula One cars of the late 1990s and 2000s, and is currently applied to the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 cars from 2010 to present.

For decades until the introduction of sponsorship liveries, each country had its traditional colour in automobile racing. German race cars for their &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; silver, Italian for their &quot;Rosso corsa&quot; red, British ones were &quot;British racing green&quot; green, French &quot;Bleu de France&quot; blue, etc.

German cars like the Blitzen Benz were white, as were the three Mercedes that won the 1914 French Grand Prix 1–2–3. On the other hand, Mercedes won the Italian Targa Florio with cars painted red in 1922 (Giulio Masetti) and 1924 (Christian Werner), blending in with the local competitors. The big supercharged 200 hp Mercedes-Benz SSKL with which Rudolf Caracciola won the 1931 Mille Miglia was called the &quot;White Elephant&quot;.

==Origin of the name==
In 1958, Alfred Neubauer described the origin of the &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; as being accidental. In 1934 the international governing body of motor sport prescribed a maximum weight limit of for Grand Prix racing cars, excluding tyres and fuel. Neubauer said that when in spring 1934, the Mercedes-Benz team placed its new Mercedes-Benz W25 on the scrutineering scales prior to the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, it allegedly recorded . Racing manager Alfred Neubauer and his driver Manfred von Brauchitsch, who both later published their memoirs, claimed that they had the idea of removing all the white lead-based paint from the bodywork. The story continues that the next day the shining silver aluminium beneath was exposed and scrutineering was passed. After the car of Von Brauchitsch won the race, the nickname &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; was born, according to this version.

There is however, controversy and doubt regarding this story. It did not appear until 1958, and no reference to it has been found in contemporary sources. It has since been established that von Brauchitsch had raced a streamlined silver SSKL on the AVUS in 1932, which was called a &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; in live radio coverage. Also, in 1934, both Mercedes and Auto Union had entered the Avusrennen with silver cars. The next big event was the 1934 Eifelrennen, but as few cars complying to the new rules were ready, it was held for Formule Libre, so weight was still not a race-critical issue at that time. By the 1930s, modern stressed-skin aircraft fuselage construction was already using polished and unpainted aluminium panels for streamlining and to save weight. Neubauer&#x27;s 1958 autobiography has been shown to include several embellished stories and dubious claims, including a fabricated hoax surrounding the 1933 Tripoli Grand Prix, where he falsely accused several drivers of &quot;fixing&quot; the race.

A historical connection to the Neubauer&#x27;s story appeared in 2023 with the introduction of the Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E Performance Formula One car. At the launch, held on 15 February 2023, the W14 was revealed to have a black livery, much like its predecessors, the Mercedes F1 W11 of 2020 and the W12 of 2021, but unlike those aforementioned cars, the black livery on the car is not being primarily used to promote diversity, but to save weight after the team admitted to struggling with excess weight with its 2022 car, the W13, which had a traditional silver-painted livery. The black colour was created by leaving most of the parts as unpainted raw carbon whilst some others (mainly the top of the nose and the engine cover) are painted with matte black paint.

==Performance==
By 1937, the supercharged engine of a Mercedes-Benz W125 attained an output of 646 hp (475 kW), a figure not greatly exceeded in Grand Prix Racing until the early 1980s, when turbo-charged engines were common in Formula One – although it was at least matched as early as the late 1940s by conventionally fuelled Grand Prix engines like the BRM V16, despite the rules restricting later engines to half the cylinder capacity.

The Silver Arrows of Mercedes and Auto Union cars reached speeds of well over in 1937, and well over during land speed record runs.

The superiority of these vehicles in international motor racing established the term &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; as a legend, for example by usually winning the first race in which they were entered. The names Rudolf Caracciola, Bernd Rosemeyer, Hermann Lang, and later Stirling Moss and Juan Manuel Fangio, will always be associated with the eras of these racing cars.

Mercedes-Benz recalled its great past in the 1970s with rally cars, and in the 1980s with the Sauber sportscars and DTM touring cars. As well as the 2010 return to F1 racing of AMG-Petronas cars, dominant there since 2014.

==Other car companies==
Now a traditional colour for road-cars in reference to the &quot;Silver Arrows&quot;, most German car companies have a shade of silver in their catalogues conforming to Silberpfeil-Grau, or &quot;Silver Arrow Grey&quot;.

However, Audi and Mercedes-Benz are not the only German car companies who paint their cars in a silver colour. Porsche has also inherited the tradition of silver arrows. However, BMW still paints its cars in the traditional white colour.

At the 1999 Le Mans 24 Hours, a total of seven &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; were entered in the Le Mans Prototype class:
*three Mercedes-Benz CLR
*two British-built LM-GT1 Audi R8C
*two Joest Racing LMP Audi R8R that scored third and fourth.

==Formula One since the 1990s==

Mercedes-Benz returned to Formula One Grand Prix racing in as an engine manufacturer, initially partnering the Sauber team before switching to McLaren in 1995. After Marlboro&#x27;s sponsorship of McLaren ended at the conclusion of 1996, the team began using a silver livery and thus the McLaren-Mercedes cars were often referred to as &quot;Silver Arrows&quot;.

In , after purchasing the Brawn GP outfit and rebranding it as Mercedes GP Petronas F1 Team, Mercedes-Benz became a constructor again. Mercedes&#x27; cars have been nicknamed &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; by the press and by the team itself. The modern cars race with the majority of their bodies painted in a traditional silver shade, trimmed in Petronas green.

For the 2019 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim the cars raced in a special livery honouring the origins of their silver colour and to also celebrate the team&#x27;s 200th start in F1. The cars were painted in such a way to pay homage to the story of the white paint being peeled away, exposing the shiny silver underneath.

For the season, while originally going to use a silver livery as usual with a new Ineos sponsored engine intake, Mercedes decided to switch to an all-black livery, following the growing worldwide support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the postponement of the season. Hamilton prompted the livery change, saying he wanted the team to show its support for the cause through more than just social media posts, which led to the idea to adopt a new livery and launch a drive to improve diversity within the team. The team would continue to use a black livery going into , reverting to a silver livery in .
The car, the Mercedes W14, sported a black livery once again, this time to save weight after struggling with excess weight on the W13. The car, the Mercedes W15, sported a livery with the famous silver returning to complement the iconic black of recent seasons. The car, the Mercedes W16, sported a livery similar with the Mercedes W15 except with a silver engine intake instead of the usual Ineos coloured engine intake featured since the Mercedes W11.

==Other Sports since the 1990s==

Mercedes&#x27; official debut in Formula E under the name of Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team in the 2019–20 season. Mercedes&#x27; first contender, dubbed the &quot;Mercedes-Benz EQ Silver Arrow 01&quot;, was unveiled in March 2019. It featured a &#x27;teaser&#x27; black livery, resembling the HWA car already in competition. The car went on to appear at various events, in promotion of Mercedes&#x27; Formula E entry, including the 89th Geneva International Motor Show. In September 2019, the team announced it had signed Danish wind power company Vestas as a principal partner. On 11 September, Mercedes revealed the definitive look of their car (now incorporating metallic silver), along with their new team principal and drivers.

In July 2020, prior the season resuming after the COVID-19 pandemic, Mercedes brought back and updated the pre-season black livery to unify it with the design used on the F1 W11 EQ Performance car. The drivers also wore black racing overalls.

On 29 October 2020, Mercedes revealed the new &quot;Silver Arrow 02&quot; car, which returned to the traditional silver livery. In 2021, the team underwent a slight rebrand, now going by the name Mercedes-EQ Formula E Team. The livery would remain Silver until team was taken over by McLaren and returning under new ownership from the 2022–23 season.

<text>USS &quot;Bonita&quot; (SSK-3/SS-552), a &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class submarine, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bonito, a name applied to several types of fish, including the skipjack tuna, (&quot;Katsuwonus pelamis&quot;), the Atlantic bonito (&quot;Sarda sarda&quot;), the lesser amberjack (&quot;Seriola fasciata&quot;), or the cobia (&quot;Rachycentron canadum&quot;). She was originally named USS &quot;K-3&quot; (SSK-3).

The original contract for construction of &quot;K-3&quot; (SSK-3) was awarded to New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, but later transferred to Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California, where her keel was laid down on 19 May 1950. She was launched as &quot;K-3&quot; on 21 June 1951, sponsored by Mrs. J.S. Clark, widow of Commander James S. Clark (who died while commanding ), and commissioned on 11 January 1952.

The three SSK boats, , , and &quot;K-3&quot; (SSK-3), were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo, which experimented with the use of passive acoustics with low-frequency, bow-mounted sonar arrays. When the boat was rigged for silent running, these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines. The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare (ASW) abilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically to recharge their batteries, but the advances in sonar technology they pioneered were invaluable to the development of nuclear-powered submarines. The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear.

==Service history==

&quot;K-3&quot; joined Submarine Squadron 7 at Pearl Harbor on 15 May 1952 and performed experimental submarine duties, notably development of ASW tactics. In February 1955 she entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for overhaul, emerging in September. She was renamed &quot;Bonita&quot; 15 December 1955. She made a cruise to Alaskan waters in August and September 1956.

In June 1957 she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 5 at San Diego, California, for ASW training duties. In October she reported to San Francisco Naval Shipyard for overhaul and the installation of new electronics, returning to San Diego in January 1958.

In 1958, the Soviet threat changed from conventional to nuclear-powered submarines, and the SSK force was withdrawn from the SSK role. In April–June 1958 &quot;Bonita&quot; was used as a nuclear weapons testing target at Eniwetok in the South Pacific, part of Operation Hardtack I. Fortunately, this was designed as shock testing rather than destructive testing, and damage was light except to electronics.

==Fate==

She was decommissioned on 7 November 1958, and given hull classification symbol SS-552 on 15 August 1959.
She was struck from the Naval Register on 1 April 1965, and sold for scrap on 17 November 1966.

<text>&quot;Xeremiers&quot; or c&quot;olla de xeremiers&quot; is a traditional ensemble that consists of flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe) and xeremies (bagpipes). Majorca has produced popular singer-songwriters like Maria del Mar Bonet. British DJs like Paul Oakenfold made the vacationing island of Ibiza a capital of house music, leading to the creation of Balearic beat. Francesc Guerau and Antoni Literes are among the best known classical composers of the islands.

<doc id="444704" wikidata="Q176042" url="?curid=444704" title="DIAC">
<text>The DIAC (diode for alternating current) is a diode that conducts electrical current only after its breakover voltage, VBO, has been reached momentarily. Three, four, and five layer structures may be used. Behavior is similar to the voltage breakdown of a triac without a gate terminal.

When breakdown occurs, internal positive feedback (impact ionization or two transistor feedback) ensures that the diode enters a region of negative dynamic resistance, leading to a sharp increase in current through the diode and a decrease in the voltage drop across it (typically full switch-on takes a few hundred nanoseconds to microseconds). The diode remains in conduction until the current through it drops below a value characteristic for the device, called the &quot;holding current&quot;, IH. Below this threshold, the diode switches back to its high-resistance, non-conducting state. This behavior is bi-directional, meaning typically the same for both directions of current.

Most DIACs have a three-layer structure with breakover voltage of approximately 30 V and an on voltage of less than 3 V. Their behavior is analogous to the striking and extinction voltages of a neon lamp, but it can be more repeatable and takes place at lower voltages.

DIACs have no gate or trigger electrode, unlike some other thyristors that they are commonly used to trigger, such as TRIACs. Some TRIACs, like Quadrac, contain a built-in DIAC in series with the TRIAC&#x27;s gate terminal for this purpose.

DIACs are also called &quot;symmetrical trigger diodes&quot; due to the symmetry of their characteristic curve. Because DIACs are bidirectional devices, their terminals are not labeled as anode and cathode but as A1 and A2 or main terminal MT1 and MT2.
==SIDAC==
A silicon diode for alternating current (SIDAC) is a less commonly used device, electrically similar to the DIAC, but having, in general, a higher breakover voltage and greater current handling capacity.

The SIDAC is another member of the thyristor family. Also referred to as a SYDAC (silicon thyristor for alternating current), bi-directional thyristor breakover diode, or more simply a bi-directional thyristor diode, it is technically specified as a bilateral voltage triggered switch. Its operation is similar to that of the DIAC, but a SIDAC is always a five-layer device with low-voltage drop in latched conducting state, more like a voltage triggered TRIAC without a gate. In general, SIDACs have higher breakover voltages and current handling capacities than DIACs, so they can be directly used for switching and not just for triggering of another switching device.

The operation of the SIDAC is functionally similar to that of a spark gap, but is unable to reach its higher temperature ratings. The SIDAC remains nonconducting until the applied voltage meets or exceeds its rated breakover voltage. Once entering this conductive state going through the negative dynamic resistance region, the SIDAC continues to conduct, regardless of voltage, until the applied current falls below its rated holding current. At this point, the SIDAC returns to its initial nonconductive state to begin the cycle once again.

Somewhat uncommon in most electronics, the SIDAC is relegated to the status of a special purpose device. However, where part-counts are to be kept low, simple relaxation oscillators are needed, and when the voltages are too low for practical operation of a spark gap, the SIDAC is an indispensable component.

Similar devices, though usually not functionally interchangeable with SIDACs, are the thyristor surge protection device (TSPD) sold under trademarks like Trisil by STMicroelectronics and SIDACtor and its predecessor Surgector by Littelfuse. These are designed to tolerate large surge currents for the suppression of overvoltage transients. In many applications this function is now served by metal oxide varistors (MOVs), particularly for trapping voltage transients on the power mains.

==Applications==
DIACs and SIDACs are often used to deliver a pulse once a capacitor has charged to the breakdown voltage, giving both controlled delay set by the charging resistor and a fixed pulse energy set by the capacitor and breakdown voltage.
This is common in simple phase angle controls for AC lamp dimmers and motor speed controls. They may also be used to sense over-voltage fault conditions to provide a &#x27;crowbar&#x27; function to operate a fuse or a latching alarm that can only be reset by removing the supply.

<text>Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky (;  – September 27, 1944) was a Russian chemist and photographer. He is best known for his pioneering work in colour photography and his effort to document the Russian Empire.

Using a railway-car darkroom provided by Emperor Nicholas II, Prokudin-Gorsky travelled the Russian Empire from around 1909 to 1915 using his three-image colour photography to record its many aspects. While some of his negatives were lost, the majority ended up in the US Library of Congress after his death. Starting in 2000, the negatives were digitized and the color triples for each subject digitally combined to produce hundreds of high-quality color images of Russia and its neighbors from over a century ago.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Prokudin-Gorsky was born in the ancestral estate of Funikova Gora, in the Pokrovsky Uyezd of the Vladimir Governorate (now Kirzhachsky District, Vladimir Oblast). His parents were of the Russian nobility, and the family had a long military history. They moved to Saint Petersburg, where Prokudin-Gorsky enrolled in Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology to study chemistry under Dmitri Mendeleev. He also studied music and painting at the Imperial Academy of Arts.

===Marriage and career in photography===
In 1890, Prokudin-Gorsky married Anna Aleksandrovna Lavrova, and later the couple had two sons, Mikhail and Dmitri, and a daughter, Ekaterina. Anna was the daughter of the Russian industrialist Aleksandr Stepanovich Lavrov, an active member in the Imperial Russian Technical Society (IRTS). Prokudin-Gorsky subsequently became the director of the executive board of Lavrov&#x27;s metal works near Saint Petersburg and remained so until the October Revolution. He also joined Russia&#x27;s oldest photographic society, the photography section of the IRTS, presenting papers and lecturing on the science of photography.

In 1901, Prokudin-Gorsky established a photographic studio and laboratory in Saint Petersburg. The following year, he travelled to Berlin and spent 6 weeks studying colour sensitization and three-colour photography with photochemistry professor Adolf Miethe, the most advanced practitioner in Germany at that time. Throughout the years, Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s photographic work, publications and slide shows to other scientists and photographers in Russia, Germany and France earned him praise, and in 1906 he was elected the president of the IRTS photography section and editor of Russia&#x27;s main photography journal, the &quot;Fotograf-Liubitel&quot;. Gorsky was a member of the Royal Photographic Society between 1920 and 1932.
Perhaps Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s best-known work during his lifetime was his color portrait of Leo Tolstoy, which was reproduced in various publications, on postcards, and as larger prints for framing. The fame from this photo and his earlier photos of Russia&#x27;s nature and monuments earned him invitations to show his work to the Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1908, and to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909. The Tsar enjoyed the demonstration, and, with his blessing, Prokudin-Gorsky got the permission and funding to document Russia in color. In the course of ten years, he was to make a collection of 10,000 photos. Prokudin-Gorsky considered the project his life&#x27;s work and continued his photographic journeys through Russia until after the October Revolution. Under the new regime he was forced to accept a professorship and in August 1918 was ordered by the Education Ministry to procure projection equipment in Norway. He still pursued scientific work in color photography, published papers in English photography journals and, together with his colleague , obtained patents in Germany, England, France and Italy.

===Later life and death===
In 1920, Prokudin-Gorsky remarried and had a daughter with his assistant Maria Fedorovna née Schedrina. The family finally settled in Paris in 1922, reuniting with his first wife and children. Prokudin-Gorsky set up a photo studio there together with his three adult children, naming it after his fourth child, Elka. In the 1930s, the elderly Prokudin-Gorsky continued with lectures showing his photographs of Russia to young Russians in France, but stopped commercial work and left the studio to his children, who named it Gorsky Frères. He died in Paris on September 27, 1944, a month after the Liberation of Paris. He is buried in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.

==Photography technique==

===Three-color principle===

The method of color photography used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not possible with the photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it in the form of three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; or viewed as an additive color image by one person at a time through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.

===Early practitioners===
Louis Ducos du Hauron conducted early experiments with the three-color principle in the late 1860s. During the period from the 1870s to the 1890s, he created several color prints and photographs.

In 1877, Edward Bierstadt showcased the first successful three-color prints in the United States. His work gained attention in the 1890s when he exhibited color prints of various subjects such as oil and watercolor paintings, floral studies, and portraits from life.

The first person to widely demonstrate good results by this method was Frederic E. Ives, whose &quot;Kromskop&quot; system of viewers, projectors and camera equipment was commercially available from 1897 until about 1907. Only the viewers and ready-made triple photographs for use in them sold in any significant quantity. Still life arrangements, unpopulated landscapes and oil paintings were the typical subject matter, but a few examples of color portraiture from life were also offered.

Another very notable practitioner was Adolf Miethe, with whom Prokudin-Gorsky studied in Germany in 1902. Miethe was a photochemist who greatly improved the panchromatic characteristics of the black-and-white photographic materials suitable for use with this method of color photography. He presented projected color photographs to the German Imperial Family in 1902 and was exhibiting them to the general public in 1903, when they also began to appear in periodicals and books. Miethe took the first known aerial color photographs, from a hot air balloon, in 1906.

In England in 1899 Ives&#x27;s former assistant, Edward Sanger-Shepherd, commercialized the application of the three-colour process in the &quot;Sanger Shepherd process of natural colour photography&quot;. With his process in 1903 and 1904 Sarah Angelina Acland produced the first substantial body of work in colour photography by an amateur photographer. By 1905 seventeen different photographers had shown three-colour slides by the Sanger-Shepherd process at exhibitions of the Royal Photographic Society in England.

In 1905, the Neue Photographische Gesellschaft established a color photography studio in Berlin. The studio utilized the three-color principle and employed a printing process developed by Robert Krayn. Some of the resulting images were published as postcards, featuring notable individuals including Kaiser Wilhelm II and Pope Pius X.

===Equipment===

Photographic plates, which had the light-sensitive emulsion coated on a thin sheet of glass, were normally used instead of flexible film, both because a general transition from glass plates to plastic film was still in progress and because glass provided the best dimensional stability for three images intended to match up perfectly when they were later combined.

An ordinary camera could be used to take the three pictures, by reloading it and changing filters between exposures, but pioneering color photographers usually built or bought special cameras that made the procedure less awkward and time-consuming. One of the two main types used beam splitters to produce three separate images in the camera, making all three exposures at the same time and from the same viewpoint. Although a camera of this type was ideal in theory, such cameras were optically complicated and delicate, and liable to get out of adjustment. Some designs were also subject to optical phenomena that could cause noticeably uneven color or other defects in the results. The other, more robust type was an essentially ordinary camera with a special sliding holder for the plates and filters that allowed each in turn to be efficiently shifted into position for exposure—an operation sometimes partly or even entirely automated with a pneumatic mechanism or spring-powered motor.

When the three color-filtered photographs were not taken at the same time, anything in the scene that did not hold steady during the entire operation would exhibit colored &quot;fringes&quot; around its edges in the resulting color image. If it moved continuously across the scene, three separate strongly-colored &quot;ghost&quot; images could result. Such color artifacts are plainly visible in ordinary color composites of many of Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s photographs, but special digital image processing software was used to artificially remove them, whenever possible, from the composites of all 1,902 of the images commissioned by the Library of Congress in 2004. The altered versions have proliferated online and older or third-party versions showing these tell-tale peculiarities are increasingly scarce.

Adolf Miethe designed a high-quality, sequential-exposure color camera, which was manufactured by Bermpohl and became available commercially in 1903. Prokudin-Gorsky published an illustration of it in &quot;Fotograf-Liubitel&quot; in 1906. The most common model used a single oblong plate 9 cm wide by 24 cm high, the same format as Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s surviving negatives, and it photographed the images in unconventional blue-green-red sequence, which is also a characteristic of Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s negatives if the usual upside-down image in a camera and gravity-compliant downward shiftings of his plates are assumed. An inventor as well as a photographer, Prokudin-Gorsky patented an optical system for cameras of the simultaneous-exposure type, and it is often claimed or implied that he invented, or at least built, the camera used for his Russian Empire project. No definite written or photographic documentation of his field equipment is known to exist, only the evidence inherent in the photographs themselves, and no rationale has been suggested for going to the trouble and expense of building a functionally identical copy of a Miethe-Bermpohl camera instead of simply buying one.

Miethe and Bermpohl also produced a matching three-color projector and a chromoscope. The Goerz optical company made a differently configured and more powerful three-color projector for Miethe. It, too, was commercially available.

===Exposures===
The required exposure time depended on the lighting conditions, the sensitivity of the photographic plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon&#x27;s movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera&#x27;s plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a -inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.

===Other processes===
Prokudin-Gorsky was also acquainted with the use of Autochrome color plates, which did not require a special camera or projector. He was one of the favored few the Lumière Brothers introduced to their new product in 1906, the year before it went into commercial production. Autochrome plates were expensive and not sensitive enough for casual &quot;snapshots&quot; with a hand-held camera, but their use was simple and in expert hands they were capable of producing excellent results. They made color photography truly practical for advanced amateurs and led some pioneering users of color separation cameras to abandon their methods as outmoded, but Prokudin-Gorsky was not won over. No Autochromes by Prokudin-Gorsky are known to survive.

Although photographic color prints of the images were difficult to make at the time and slide show lectures consumed much of the time Prokudin-Gorsky used to demonstrate his work, photomechanical color prints of some were published in journals and books, and his studio issued some, most notably the Tolstoy portrait, as postcards and large photogravures. Many of the original prints published by his studio still survive.

Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s own inventions, some of them collaborative, led to the granting of numerous patents, most issued during the years of his voluntary exile and not directly related to the body of work on which his fame now rests. Some concern processes for making subtractive color transparencies, which do not require any special projection or viewing equipment. Examples of these were preserved by Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s family and have recently appeared online. Most of his patents relate to the production of natural-color motion pictures, a potentially lucrative application that attracted the attention of many inventors in the field of color photography during the 1910s and 1920s.

==Documentary of the Russian Empire==
Around 1905, Prokudin-Gorsky envisioned and formulated a plan to use the emerging technological advances that had been made in color photography to document the Russian Empire systematically. Through such an ambitious project, his ultimate goal was to educate the schoolchildren of Russia with his &quot;optical color projections&quot; of the vast and diverse history, culture, and modernization of the empire.

Outfitted with a specially equipped railroad-car darkroom provided by Tsar Nicholas II and in possession of two permits that granted him access to restricted areas and cooperation from the empire&#x27;s bureaucracy, Prokudin-Gorsky documented the Russian Empire between around 1909 and 1915. He conducted many illustrated lectures of his work. His photographs offer a vivid portrait of a lost world—the Russian Empire on the eve of World War I and the coming Russian Civil War. His subjects ranged from the medieval churches and monasteries of old Russia, to the railroads and factories of an emerging industrial power, to the daily life and work of Russia&#x27;s diverse population.

It has been estimated from Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s personal inventory that before leaving Russia, he had about 3,500 negatives. Upon leaving the country and exporting all his photographic material, about half of the photos were confiscated by Russian authorities for containing material they deemed strategically sensitive for war-time Russia. According to Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s notes, the photos left behind were not of interest to the general public. Some of Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s negatives were given away, and some he hid on his departure. Outside the Library of Congress collection, none has yet been found.

By the time of Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s death, the Tsar and his family had long since been executed during the Russian civil war, and most of the former empire was now the Soviet Union. The surviving boxes of photo albums and fragile glass plates the negatives were recorded on were finally stored in the basement of a Parisian apartment building, and the family was worried about them getting damaged. The United States Library of Congress purchased the material from Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s heirs in 1948 for $3,500–$5,000 on the initiative of a researcher inquiring into their whereabouts. The library counted 1,902 negatives and 710 album prints without corresponding negatives in the collection.

==Digital color rendering==

Due to the very specialized and labor-intensive processes required to make photographic color prints from the negatives, only about a hundred of the images were used in exhibits, books and scholarly articles during the half-century after the Library of Congress acquired them. Their widest exposure was in the 1980 coffee table book &quot;Photographs for the Tsar: The Pioneering Color Photography of Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii Commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II&quot;, in which the color images are combined yellow, magenta and cyan ink-on-paper halftones mass-produced with a multicolor printing press in the usual way.

It was only with the advent of digital image processing that multiple images could be quickly and easily combined into one. The Library of Congress undertook a project in 2000 to make digital scans of all the photographic material received from Prokudin-Gorsky&#x27;s heirs and contracted with the photographer Walter Frankhauser to combine the monochrome negatives into color images. He created 122 color renderings using a method he called &quot;digichromatography&quot; and commented that each image took him around six to seven hours to align, clean and color-correct. In 2001, the Library of Congress produced an exhibition from these, &quot;The Empire That Was Russia: The Prokudin-Gorskii Photographic Record Recreated&quot;. The photographs have since been the subject of many other exhibitions in the area where Prokudin-Gorsky took his photos.

In 2004, the Library of Congress contracted with computer scientist Blaise Agüera y Arcas to produce an automated color composite of each of the 1,902 negatives from the high-resolution digital images of the glass-plate negatives. He applied algorithms to compensate for the differences between the exposures and prepared color composites of all the negatives in the collection. As the library offers the high-resolution images of the negatives freely on the Internet, many others have since created their own color representations of the photos, and they have become a favorite testbed for computer scientists.

<text>Edward William May Jr. (November 10, 1916 – January 22, 2004) was an American composer, arranger and trumpeter. He composed film and television music for &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1966), &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1968), &quot;Batman&quot; (with &quot;Batgirl&quot; theme, 1967), and &quot;Naked City&quot; (1960). He collaborated on films such as &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981), and orchestrated &quot;Cocoon&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, among others.

May wrote arrangements for many top singers, including Frank Sinatra, Yma Sumac, Nat King Cole, Anita O&#x27;Day, Peggy Lee, Vic Damone, Bobby Darin, Johnny Mercer, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Prima, Keely Smith, Jack Jones, Bing Crosby, Sandler and Young, Nancy Wilson, Rosemary Clooney, The Andrews Sisters and Ella Mae Morse. He also collaborated with satirist Stan Freberg on several classic 1950s and 1960s comedy music albums.

As a trumpet player in the 1940s Big Band era, May recorded such songs as &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Mama&quot;, and &quot;Boom Shot&quot;, with Glenn Miller and His Orchestra, and &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot;, &quot;Lumby&quot;, and &quot;Wings Over Manhattan&quot; with Charlie Barnet and His Orchestra. With his own band, he had a hit single, &quot;Charmaine&quot;. In the 1950s he released several successful albums of his unique orchestral arrangements and compositions, including &quot;Sorta-May&quot; and &quot;Sorta-Dixie.&quot;

==Early life and music==
May was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He started out playing the tuba in the high school band. &quot;I sat in the rear of the [band]stand&quot;, he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but I was intrigued with becoming an arranger and an orchestrator.&quot; At the age of 17, he began playing with Gene Olsen&#x27;s Polish-American Orchestra.

==Swing era and big bands==
May moved to New York City at age 22 to become chief arranger for the Charlie Barnet Orchestra. He held this position from February 1939 until October 1940, and joined its trumpet section in June 1939. May&#x27;s contract with Barnet called for writing at extraordinary speed: four new arrangements per week, about 70 of which were recorded and commercially released by RCA Victor on the Bluebird label. May arranged some of Barnet&#x27;s best-selling records, including &quot;Pompton Turnpike&quot; and &quot;Leapin&#x27; at the Lincoln&quot;, but it was May&#x27;s now-classic arrangement of Ray Noble&#x27;s &quot;Cherokee&quot; that launched Barnet and his band to national stardom.

At Barnet&#x27;s request, May closely studied the musical language of Barnet&#x27;s idol, Duke Ellington. May soon developed a harmonic and sonic palette rich with Ellingtonian colors. The Ellington influence is apparent in some of May&#x27;s arrangements of new pop songs including &quot;Danger in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Strange Enchantment&quot;. They are on full display in May&#x27;s arrangements of Ellington&#x27;s own compositions, particularly &quot;The Sergeant Was Shy&quot;, &quot;Ring Dem Bells&quot;, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; in Rhythm&quot;. Ellington even reciprocated the musical respect by recording his own arrangement of &quot;In a Mizz&quot;, a Charlie Barnet original arranged by May in June 1939.

May&#x27;s first recorded serious composition for jazz orchestra was &quot;Wings Over Manhattan&quot;, a three-part suite celebrating the &quot;aviation&quot; theme of the 1939-1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair for which it was written. It is also a musical salute to Ellington, showing the influence of Ellington&#x27;s longer-form works like &quot;Reminiscing in Tempo&quot; and &quot;Symphony in Black&quot;. Composer/historian Gunther Schuller felt that by age 23, Billy May&#x27;s command of Ellington&#x27;s compositional language had become so convincing that &quot;the &#x27;disciple&#x27; could hardly be distinguished from the &#x27;master&#x27;.&quot;

May&#x27;s sense of musical humor—which later became one of the hallmarks of his sound—began to take shape with the Charlie Barnet Orchestra, as evident in his arrangements of novelty numbers like &quot;Six Lessons From Madame La Zonga&quot;. May&#x27;s earliest recorded musical parody—a comedic skill he would later master with comedian Stan Freberg—was &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot;, an original song by May and Barnet, with syrupy vocal and comically bad trumpet soloing by May (whom Barnet introduces as &quot;Slappy Habits&quot;). Barnet called &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot; a &quot;flagrant burlesque&quot; of the best-selling &quot;sweet&quot; bands of the day led by Kay Kyser and Sammy Kaye, whose motto &quot;Swing and Sway with Sammy Kaye&quot; becomes &quot;Swing and Sweat with Charlie Barnet&quot; when May sings it.

May and Barnet remained close throughout their lives, and May arranged another 36 titles for the Barnet Orchestra between 1954 and 1970.

The original manuscript scores, and some of the original band parts, for about 80 of May&#x27;s arrangements for Barnet are now housed at the Music Division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where they are open to the public for research. Many others were destroyed in the 1939 fire at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles.

Bandleader Glenn Miller hired May away from Barnet in 1940. &quot;May points out that he was not responsible for any of the [Glenn Miller] band&#x27;s signature hits, but he did write the beautiful left-field introduction to [Bill] Finegan&#x27;s [arrangement of] &#x27;Serenade In Blue&#x27;&quot;.

Miller and May had a wary relationship. According to Will Friedwald, by 1942 May was ready to resign from the Miller band. Miller refused to record half of May&#x27;s arrangements, and May objected to Miller&#x27;s regimented style. But since Miller was joining the military, he convinced May to stay on until the band broke up. May said around 1995 (after a life of heavy drinking and rehabilitation for alcoholism) that working with Miller &quot;helped me immensely. I learned a lot from Glenn. He was a good musician and an excellent arranger.&quot;

==Later career==

When the Big Bands ended in the late 1940s, May relocated to Los Angeles, where he became a much-coveted arranger and studio orchestra leader, working for top recording stars of the day including Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, Anita O&#x27;Day and Bing Crosby.

=== With Capitol Records ===

At Capitol, May wrote arrangements for many top artists. These included Frank Sinatra on the albums &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; (1958), &quot;Come Dance with Me!&quot; (1959) and &quot;Come Swing with Me!&quot; (1961); Nat King Cole on the albums &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music!&quot;, as well as numerous singles (all his work with Cole being packaged later on the 2-CD set &quot;The Billy May Sessions&quot;); Peggy Lee on the albums &quot;Pretty Eyes&quot; and &quot;Christmas Carousel&quot;; Sue Raney on her second album &quot;Songs for a Raney Day&quot;; Vic Damone on the albums &quot;The Lively Ones&quot; and &quot;Strange Enchantment&quot;; Jeri Southern on the album &quot;Jeri Southern Meets Cole Porter&quot;; Keely Smith on the album &quot;Politely&quot; and on a duet single, &quot;Nothing In Common&quot;/&quot;How Are Ya Fixed For Love?&quot;, with Sinatra; Bobby Darin on the album &quot;Oh! Look at Me Now&quot;; Nancy Wilson on the albums &quot;Like In Love&quot;, &quot;Something Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Tender Loving Care&quot;, &quot;Nancy - Naturally!&quot; and various tracks from the albums &quot;Just For Now&quot; and &quot;Lush Life&quot;; Matt Monro on several tracks from the albums &quot;Invitation to the Movies&quot;, &quot;Invitation to Broadway&quot;, and &quot;These Years&quot;; Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney on the albums &quot;That Travelin&#x27; Two-Beat&quot; and &quot;Fancy Meeting You Here&quot;; and Sir George Shearing on the albums &quot;Satin Affair&quot; and &quot;Burnished Brass&quot;, co-arranged with Shearing (May also conducted Shearing&#x27;s album &quot;Concerto for My Love&quot;, on which Shearing had sole credit for the arrangements).

May&#x27;s orchestra was featured on many Capitol Records children&#x27;s projects, including cowboy star, Hopalong Cassidy. He worked closely with early 1950s satirist Stan Freberg, using his arranging skills to help Freberg create his spoofs of current hits by creating musical backing often stunningly close to the original hit single.

On Freberg&#x27;s &quot;Wun&#x27;erful, Wun&#x27;erful!&quot; a lacerating spoof of bandleader Lawrence Welk, May hired some of Hollywood&#x27;s best jazz musicians, who relished the idea of mocking the financially successful but musically medocre Welk sound, which they considered the epitome of &quot;square&quot;. The result was a note-perfect recreation of Welk&#x27;s sound as Freberg and a group of vocalists performed parodies of Welk&#x27;s &quot;musical family&quot;. Freberg recounted that Welk was less than amused by the recording.

May also composed and conducted the music for Freberg&#x27;s short-lived comedy radio series on CBS, which ran for 15 episodes in 1957. His sendup of trashy horror-film music (&quot;Gray Flannel Hat Full of Teenage Werewolves&quot;) is notable.

May won two Grammy Awards, including Best Performance by an Orchestra in 1958 and Best Arrangement in 1959. Much of his work for Capitol has been reissued on the Ultra-Lounge CD series.

In the late 1960s into the early 1970s, May conducted many recreations of big band era classics, recorded by Capitol. May transcribed note for note from the original recordings of big band legends such as Charlie Barnet, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman and others and then conducted a group of all-star veteran musicians on the sessions, including some of the original performers such as singers Helen Forrest, Helen Ward and Tex Beneke. The Time-Life label released these as boxed sets titled as &quot;The Swing Era,&quot; whose marketing was focused on the fact that these high-fidelity stereo recordings allowed listeners to enjoy the music with a depth and realism that the 78 rpm recordings of that era had never been able to fully capture.

=== Other record labels ===
The Crosby-Clooney collaboration was a sequel to their earlier, more successful album on RCA Victor, &quot;Fancy Meeting You Here&quot;, also arranged by May, whose other non-Capitol work included another Bing Crosby duet album, this time with Louis Armstrong, entitled &quot;Bing &amp; Satchmo&quot;; a further duet album twinning Bobby Darin with Johnny Mercer (&quot;Two of a Kind&quot;); the sixth in Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s acclaimed series of &quot;Song Books&quot; for Verve Records, &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook&quot;; similar dips into Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart with Anita O&#x27;Day (&quot;Anita O&#x27;Day Swings Cole Porter with Billy May&quot; and &quot;Anita O&#x27;Day and Billy May Swing Rodgers and Hart&quot;; both on Verve); Mel Tormé&#x27;s Latin-flavoured album (&quot;¡Olé Tormé!: Mel Tormé Goes South of the Border with Billy May&quot;); Jane Russell&#x27;s self-titled album on MGM Records in 1958; early albums by Jack Jones (&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;) and Petula Clark (&quot;In Hollywood&quot;); one solitary session with Sarah Vaughan for Roulette Records in 1960, to record the single &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot; and three other tracks. May arranged and conducted &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot;, a 1960 studio album by singer Billy Eckstine on Roulette.

May also arranged and recorded one album in Cleveland with Cosmic Records; &quot;Guess Who&quot; for artist Jerry Lee (Jerry Principe) at the Golden Key Club; and two more albums with Keely Smith, recorded nearly 40 years apart: &quot;CheroKeely Swings&quot; from 1962; and &quot;Keely Sings Sinatra&quot;, one of May&#x27;s last projects, from 2001.

After Sinatra left Capitol to start his own label, Reprise Records, May continued to provide arrangements for him, off and on, for nearly thirty more years, working on the albums &quot;Sinatra Swings&quot;, &quot;Francis A. &amp; Edward K.&quot; (with Duke Ellington) and &quot;&quot;, as well as the chart for one of Sinatra&#x27;s last ever solo recordings, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; (1988).

May arranged Sinatra&#x27;s knockabout duet with Sammy Davis Jr., &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;, which was a hit single on both sides of the Atlantic in 1962, while he contributed to Sinatra&#x27;s ambitious &quot;Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre&quot; project, providing a few arrangements for three of its four albums, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, May&#x27;s charts being variously performed by Sinatra, Davis, Crosby, Dean Martin, Jo Stafford and Lou Monte and yielding a perennial Sinatra concert favourite, &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot; from &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

In 1958, May arranged a Christmas album on Warner Bros. Records featuring The Jimmy Joyce Singers, titled &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot;. In 1983, May arranged the song &quot;He Came Here For Me&quot; for the Carpenters&#x27; &quot;An Old-Fashioned Christmas&quot; album on A&amp;M Records.

== Musical style ==
May&#x27;s charts often featured brisk tempos and intricate brass parts. One distinctive feature is his frequent use of trumpet mute devices. Another was a saxophone glissando, widely known as his &quot;slurping saxes&quot;. In slower tempos, he sometimes utilized string sections; good examples of this aspect of his work include his brass chart for &quot;These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)&quot; on the Cole album &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;; his string arrangement of &quot;April in Paris&quot; on Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; album; and his arrangement of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; on Keely Smith&#x27;s &quot;Politely&quot;, which includes a nod to May in the lyrics (&quot;Billy May arranged this for me&quot;).

== Film and television ==

May can be seen on trumpet with the Glenn Miller Orchestra in &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; (1941), including a solo in &quot;In the Mood&quot;, and in &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; (1942).

In 1957, May made his debut as a film composer with Jane Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown&quot;; the soundtrack was released on Imperial Records. His film scores include the Rat Pack film &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; (1962), &quot;Johnny Cool&quot; (1963), &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967), &quot;The Secret Life of an American Wife&quot; (1968), &quot;The Ballad of Andy Crocker&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974), and several big band arrangements used in the 1991 Disney film &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, including Melora Hardin performing Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;.

His compositions for television include &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot;, the theme for &quot;Naked City&quot; (1960), and his jazzy arrangement of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; for &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1966) with trumpet by Al Hirt. He composed the Batgirl theme for &quot;Batman&quot; (1966). He and Nelson Riddle wrote music for episodes of &quot;Naked City&quot; (1960), &quot;Batman&quot; (1966), &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1966), &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1972), and &quot;CHiPs&quot; (1977).

May also arranged and produced the song &quot;River of No Return&quot; for Tennessee Ernie Ford to sing in the 1954 film of the same name starring Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum. Billy May and His Orchestra are also credited as playing themselves in the film &quot;Nightmare&quot; (1956), starring Edward G. Robinson, and May as music and vocal arranger of music by Herschel Burke Gilbert, who was the musical director.

== Compositions ==
May&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Long Tall Mama&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, recorded with the Glenn Miller Orchestra, &quot;Boom Shot&quot;, written with Miller (May&#x27;s wife Arletta originally received credit as co-author in his place) for the soundtrack of the 1942 movie &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot;, &quot;Harlem Chapel Bells&quot;, which was performed with Glenn Miller and his Orchestra on April 2, 1941, and broadcast on the Chesterfield &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; radio program, &quot;Lean Baby&quot;, &quot;Fat Man Boogie&quot;, &quot;Ping Pong&quot;, &quot;Jooms Jones&quot;, &quot;Gabby Goose&quot;, &quot;Lumby&quot;, &quot;Daisy Mae&quot; and &quot;Friday Afternoon&quot; with Hal McIntyre, &quot;Miles Behind&quot;, &quot;The Wrong Idea&quot; with Charlie Barnet, &quot;Wings Over Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Filet of Soul&quot;, &quot;Mayhem&quot;, &quot;Gin and Tonic&quot;, and &quot;Solving the Riddle&quot;.

But his biggest hit as a composer was the children&#x27;s song &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot;, which he recorded with Mel Blanc in 1950.

Another of May&#x27;s arrangements, &quot;Be My Host&quot;, served as the fanfare on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; when host Bob Eubanks announced the winning couple.

<text>Encopresis () is voluntary or involuntary passage of feces outside of toilet-trained contexts (fecal soiling) in children who are four years or older and after an organic cause has been excluded. Children with encopresis often leak stool into their undergarments.

This term is usually applied to children, and where the symptom is present in adults, it is more commonly known as &quot;fecal incontinence&quot; (including fecal soiling, fecal leakage or fecal seepage).

==Signs and symptoms==
(In)voluntary soiling of undergarments. There are two types: with or without constipation. Those with constipation may experience decreased appetite, abdominal pain, have pain on defecation, have fewer bowel movements, and have hard or soft stools. Those without constipation do not have these symptoms.

==Causes==

Encopresis is commonly caused by constipation in children, by reflexive withholding of stool, by various physiological, psychological, or neurological disorders, or from surgery (a somewhat rare occurrence).

The colon normally removes excess water from feces. If the feces or stool remains in the colon too long due to conditioned withholding or incidental constipation, so much water is removed that the stool becomes hard, and becomes painful for the child to expel in an ordinary bowel movement. A vicious cycle can develop, where the child may avoid moving his/her bowels in order to avoid the &quot;expected&quot; painful toilet episode. This cycle can result in so deeply conditioning the holding response that the rectal anal inhibitory response (RAIR) or anismus results. The RAIR has been shown to occur even under anesthesia and when voluntary control is lost. The hardened stool continues to build up and stretches the colon or rectum to the point where the normal sensations associated with impending bowel movements do not occur. Eventually, softer stool leaks around the blockage and cannot be withheld by the anus, resulting in soiling. The child typically has no control over these leakage accidents, and may not be able to feel that they have occurred or are about to occur due to the loss of sensation in the rectum and the RAIR. Strong emotional reactions typically result from failed and repeated attempts to control this highly aversive bodily product. These reactions then in turn may complicate conventional treatments using stool softeners, sitting demands, and behavioral strategies.

The onset of encopresis is most often benign. The usual onset is associated with toilet training, demands that the child sit for long periods of time, and intense negative parental reactions to feces. Beginning school or preschool is another major environmental trigger with shared bathrooms. Feuding parents, siblings, moving, and divorce can also inhibit toileting behaviors and promote constipation. An initiating cause may become less relevant as chronic stimuli predominate.

==Diagnosis==
The psychiatric (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for encopresis are:
# Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., underwear or floor) whether voluntary or unintentional
# At least one such event a month for at least 3 months
# Chronological age of at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental level)
# The behavior is not exclusively due to a physiological effect of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or a general medical condition, except through a mechanism involving constipation.

The DSM-5 recognizes two subtypes: with constipation and overflow incontinence, and without constipation and overflow incontinence. In the subtype with constipation, the feces are usually poorly formed and leakage is continuous, and this occurs both during sleep and waking hours. In the type without constipation, the feces are usually well-formed, soiling is intermittent, and feces are usually deposited in a prominent location. This form may be associated with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, or may be the consequence of large anal insertions, or more likely due to chronic encopresis that has radically desensitized the colon and anus.

==Treatment==
Many pediatricians will recommend the following three-pronged approach to the treatment of encopresis associated with constipation:
# Cleaning out
# Using stool-softening agents
# Scheduled sitting times, typically after meals

The initial clean-out is achieved with enemas, laxatives, or both. The predominant approach today is the use of oral stool softeners like Movicol, Miralax, lactulose, mineral oil, etc. Following that, enemas and laxatives are used daily to keep the stools soft and allow the stretched bowel to return to its normal size.

The child must be taught to use the toilet regularly to retrain his/her body. It is usually recommended that a child be required to sit on the toilet at a regular time each day and &quot;try to go&quot; for 10–15 minutes (timed toileting), usually soon (or immediately) after eating. Children are more likely to be able to expel a bowel movement right after eating (due to the gastrocolic reflex). It is thought that creating a regular schedule of bathroom time will allow the child to achieve a proper elimination pattern. Repeated voiding success on the toilet itself helps it become a releasor stimulus for successful bowel movements.

Alternatively, when this method fails for six months or longer, a more aggressive approach may be undertaken using suppositories and enemas in a carefully programmed way to overcome the reflexive holding response and to allow the proper voiding reflex to take over. Failure to establish a normal bowel habit can result in permanent stretching of the colon. Certainly, allowing this problem to continue for years with constant assurances that the child &quot;will grow out of it&quot; should be avoided.

Dietary changes are an important management element. Recommended changes to the diet in the case of constipation-caused encopresis include:
# Reduction in the intake of constipating foods such as dairy, peanuts, cooked carrots, and bananas
# Increase in high-fiber foods such as bran, whole wheat products, fruits, and vegetables
# Higher intake of water and liquids, such as juices, although an increased risk of tooth decay has been attributed to excess intake of sweetened juices
# Limit drinks with caffeine, including cola drinks and tea
# Provide well-balanced meals and snacks, and limit fast foods/junk foods that are high in fats and sugars
# Limit whole milk to a day for the child over two years of age, but do not eliminate milk because children need calcium for bone growth and strength.

The standard behavioral treatment for functional encopresis, which has been shown to be highly effective, is a motivational system such as a contingency management system. In addition to this basic component, seven or eight other behavioral treatment components can be added to increase effectiveness.

==Epidemiology ==

The estimated prevalence of encopresis in four-year-olds is between one and three percent. The disorder is thought to be more common in males than females, by a factor of 6 to 1.

<doc id="444733" wikidata="Q52253" url="?curid=444733" title="Alexei Stakhanov">
<text>Alexei Grigoryevich Stakhanov (, &quot;Alekséy Grigór&#x27;yevich Stakhánov&quot;; 3 January 1906 – 5 November 1977) was a Soviet miner, Hero of Socialist Labour (1970), and a member of the CPSU (1936).

He became a celebrity in 1935 as part of what became known as the Stakhanovite movement—a campaign intended to increase worker productivity and to demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system.

== Biography ==
Alexei Stakhanov was born in Lugovaya (now in Izmalkovsky District), a village in the Livensky Uezd of the Orel Governorate of the Russian Empire in 1906. In his early 20s, he began working in a mine called &quot;Tsentralnaia-Irmino&quot; (literally Central Irmino) in Kadiivka (Donbas). In 1933, Stakhanov became a jackhammer operator. In 1935, he took a local course in mining. On 31 August 1935, it was reported that he had mined a record 102 tonnes of coal in 5 hours and 45 minutes (14 times his quota).

On 19 September, Stakhanov was reported to have set a new record by mining 227 tonnes of coal in a single shift. His example was held up in newspapers and posters as a model for others to follow, and he appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the United States.

In 1936–1941, Stakhanov was a student of the Industrial Academy in Moscow. In 1941–1942, he was appointed director of mine No. 31 in Karaganda. Between 1943 and 1957, Stakhanov worked in the Ministry of Coal Industry of the USSR. In 1957–1959, he was deputy director of the &quot;Chistiakovantratsit&quot; trust, and after that, assistant chief engineer at the mine management office No. 2/43 of the &quot;Torezantratsit&quot; trust until his retirement in 1974.

Stakhanov&#x27;s records set an example throughout the country and gave birth to the Stakhanovite movement, where workers who exceeded production targets could become &quot;Stakhanovites&quot;.

Stakhanov was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union of the first convocation. He was awarded two Orders of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner of Labour, and numerous medals. The last Sunday of August was designated &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Day&quot;, also apparently in his honor.

At some point Stakhanov developed problems with alcohol and came to lose his Order of Lenin and party card during a drunken brawl.

He died in 1977 at the age of 71. The town of Kadiivka in eastern Ukraine where he started his work was renamed Stakhanov in his honour in 1978.

== Record disputed ==
The validity of Stakhanov&#x27;s record has been called into question. In 1985, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed a story alleging that though Stakhanov had indeed succeeded in his feat, it was only because the Communist Party had arranged the event as a way of boosting public morale, with many other miners working to help Stakhanov beat the mining record.

The &quot;Times&quot; quoted the chief of the Tsentralnaia-Irmino mine branch of the Party, Konstantin G. Petrov, as saying that &quot;I suppose Stakhanov need not have been the first... It could have been anybody else. In the final analysis, it was not the individual face-worker who determined whether the attempt to break the record would succeed, but the new system of coal extraction.&quot;

In 1988, the Soviet newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; claimed that the widely cited achievements of Stakhanov were puffery. The paper insisted that Stakhanov had used a number of helpers on support works, while the throughput was tallied for him alone. Still, according to the newspaper, Stakhanov&#x27;s approach had eventually led to increased productivity by means of better work organization, including specialization and task sequencing.

It has also been claimed that his record was beaten by Alija Sirotanović of Yugoslavia and Sergej Scemuk of Ukraine.

== Personal life ==
According to a widespread story, Stakhanov was given the name Andrei at birth, but the telegram reporting his record only contained his initial, and the editors of &quot;Pravda&quot; reported his name as Alexei. Rather than admit such a high-profile mistake, authorities decided to replace his passport and other official documents, changing his name to Alexei. However, his daughter dismissed this as false in a 2012 interview, stating that she had never heard any family members ever call her father Andrei, nor did the name run in the family.

Stakhanov had two partners and six children:
== Legacy ==
* From 1938 to 1947, the city of Zhukovsky, Russia was named Stakhanovo.
* From 15 February 1978 to 12 May 2016, the Ukrainian city of Kadiivka was named Stakhanov. 
* George Orwell&#x27;s novel, &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, represents him as the character of Boxer.

<doc id="444734" wikidata="Q4838815" url="?curid=444734" title="Bachelor of Music">
<text>A Bachelor of Music (BMus or BM; also conferred as Bachelor of Musical Arts) is an academic degree awarded by a college, university, or conservatory upon completion of a program of study in music. The degree may be awarded for performance, music education, composition, music theory, musicology / music history (musicology degrees may be a Bachelor of Arts rather than a Bachelor of Music), music technology, music therapy, sacred music, music business/music industry, entertainment, music production, or jazz studies. Since the 2010s, some universities have begun offering degrees in music composition with technology, which include traditional theory and musicology courses and sound recording and composition courses using digital technologies.

In the United States, the Bachelor of Music is a professional degree, and the majority of work consists of prescribed music courses and study in applied music, usually requiring proficiency in an instrument, voice, or conducting. One of the most renowned is Juilliard School in New York, a professional educational arm of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Juilliard offers bachelor’s degrees in music, dance, and drama. Berklee College of Music also offers a variety of such degrees, including a four-year professional degree, as well as instrumental and online undergraduate courses.

In Canada, the B.M. is often considered an undergraduate degree. Programs typically last from three to four and a half years.

In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Music is generally a first degree lasting three years or four years and consisting of a wide range of areas of study (normally including performance, composition, music theory, musicology/music history), but at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge it was a one-year postgraduate degree which could only be taken if a student were to have been a graduate in music with honors at those universities; the undergraduate course is in the Faculty of Arts and leads to the Bachelor of Arts (and subsequently the Master of Arts (Oxbridge)). In Scotland, as part of its undergraduate Bachelor’s degree programme, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland offers a BMus in Jazz, while Edinburgh University through its Edinburgh College of Art offers a three year BMus degree, with the option for a fourth ‘Honours’ year, styled ‘BMus(Hons)’.

In Australia, Music Bachelor Degree study programs are available at, among others, the University of Sydney, Monash University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Adelaide, Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University, and the University of Tasmania. The University of Canberra offers a &#x27;Bachelor of Creative Industries (Contemporary Music Practice)&#x27;.

==Abbreviations==
After a degree holder&#x27;s name, as on a business card or a CV, the degree is abbreviated in various ways, including: B.M., BM, B.Mus., BMus, Mus.B., or Mus.Bac. Some recipients add an abbreviation for the name of the institution which granted the degree as well, e.g., &quot;Susan Bhattara, BMus(Oxon)&quot;; &quot;Oxon&quot; is the Latin abbreviation for the University of Oxford.

==Post-graduation options==
Graduates may apply for jobs in performance, teaching, or arts administration. As well, graduates can apply for jobs that require a bachelor&#x27;s degree in any subject, such as some entry-level jobs in banking, insurance, sales, and administration. Graduates with an interest in teaching in the school system may go on to complete a teaching degree or diploma. Graduates who have achieved a high standard on their instrument, voice, or another specialisation such as composition or conducting may be eligible to apply for a Master of Music (MMus) if their grades are high enough (a B+ or A− average is typically required). BMus graduates can also apply to a range of graduate programs outside of music, such as library science, business administration or public administration; a B+ or A− average is typically required. Some programs may require BMus graduates to complete preparatory or make-up courses in the field of the master&#x27;s. As well, some programs require the GRE or GMAT (standardized tests). BMus graduates in some fields, such as composition, music theory, or musicology may be able to apply directly to PhD programs if they have a high average and strong recommendation letters.

<text>The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) divides the territories of its members into geographic numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each NPA is identified by one or more numbering plan area codes (&quot;NPA codes&quot;, or &quot;area codes&quot;), consisting of three digits that are prefixed to each local telephone number having seven digits. A numbering plan area with multiple area codes is called an overlay. Area codes are also assigned for non-geographic purposes. The rules for numbering NPAs do not permit the digits &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; in the leading position.

<text>Color photography (also spelled as colour photography in Commonwealth English) is photography that uses media capable of capturing and reproducing colors. By contrast, black-and-white or gray-monochrome photography records only a single channel of luminance (brightness) and uses media capable only of showing shades of gray.

In color photography, electronic sensors or light-sensitive chemicals record color information at the time of exposure. This is usually done by analyzing the spectrum of colors into three channels of information, one dominated by red, another by green and the third by blue, in imitation of the way the normal human eye senses color. The recorded information is then used to reproduce the original colors by mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light (RGB color, used by video displays, digital projectors and some historical photographic processes), or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of the red, green and blue which are present in white light (CMY color, used for prints on paper and transparencies on film).

Monochrome images which have been &quot;colorized&quot; by tinting selected areas by hand or mechanically or with the aid of a computer are &quot;colored photographs&quot;, not &quot;color photographs&quot;. Their colors are not dependent on the actual colors of the objects photographed and may be inaccurate.

The foundation of all practical color processes, the three-color method was first suggested in an 1855 paper by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, with the first color photograph produced by Thomas Sutton for a Maxwell lecture in 1861. Color photography has been the dominant form of photography since the 1970s, with monochrome photography mostly relegated to niche markets such as fine art photography.

==History==

===Early experiments===

Color photography was attempted beginning in the 1840s. Early experiments were directed at finding a &quot;chameleon substance&quot; which would assume the color of the light falling on it. Some early results, typically obtained by projecting a solar spectrum directly onto the sensitive surface, seemed to promise eventual success, but the comparatively dim image formed in a camera required exposures lasting for hours or even days. The quality and range of the color was sometimes limited mainly to primary colors, as in the chemically complicated &quot;Hillotype&quot; process invented by American daguerreotypist Levi Hill around 1850. Other experimenters, such as Edmond Becquerel, achieved better results but could find no way to prevent the colors from quickly fading when the images were exposed to light for viewing. Over the following decades experimentation continued without practical results.

===Three-color processes===
The three-color method, the foundation of most color processes, chemical or electronic, was first suggested in an 1855 paper on color vision by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.

The method is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory, which states that the human eye sees color using millions of intermingled cone cells of three types on its inner surface. According to the theory, one type of cone is most sensitive to the end of the spectrum called &quot;red&quot;, another is sensitive to the middle or &quot;green&quot; region, and the third is sensitive to the &quot;blue&quot; region. The named colors are arbitrary divisions imposed on the continuous spectrum of visible light and the theory is not an entirely accurate description of cone sensitivity. The simple description of these three colors coincides enough with the sensations experienced by the eye that when these three colors are used the three cones types are adequately and unequally stimulated to form the illusion of various intermediate wavelengths of light.

In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a rotating disk with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light – red, green and blue – in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions. To emphasize that each type of cell by itself did not actually see color but was simply more or less stimulated, he drew an analogy to black-and-white photography: if three colorless photographs of the same scene were taken through red, green and blue filters, and transparencies (&quot;slides&quot;) made from them were projected through the same filters and superimposed on a screen, the result would be an image reproducing not only red, green and blue, but all of the colors in the original scene.

The first color photograph made according to Maxwell&#x27;s prescription, a set of three monochrome &quot;color separations&quot;, was taken by Thomas Sutton in 1861 for use in illustrating a lecture on color by Maxwell, where it was shown in color by the triple projection method. The test subject was a bow made of ribbon with stripes of various colors, apparently including red and green. During the lecture, which was about physics and physiology, not photography, Maxwell commented on the inadequacy of the results and the need for a photographic material more sensitive to red and green light. A century later, historians were mystified by the reproduction of any red at all, because the photographic process used by Sutton was for all practical purposes totally insensitive to red light and only marginally sensitive to green. In 1961, researchers found that many red dyes also reflect ultraviolet light, coincidentally transmitted by Sutton&#x27;s red filter, and surmised that the three images were probably due to ultra-violet, blue-green and blue wavelengths, rather than to red, green and blue.

===Additive color===
Creating colors by mixing colored lights (usually red, green and blue) in various proportions is the additive method of color reproduction. LCD, LED, plasma and CRT (picture tube) color video displays all use this method. If one of these displays is examined with a sufficiently strong magnifier, it will be seen that each pixel is actually composed of red, green and blue sub-pixels which blend at normal viewing distances, reproducing a wide range of colors as well as white and shades of gray. This is also known as the RGB color model.

===Subtractive color===
The same three images taken through red, green and blue filters which are used for additive color synthesis may also be used to produce color prints and transparencies by the subtractive method, in which colors are subtracted from white light by dyes or pigments. In photography, the dye colors are normally cyan, a greenish-blue which absorbs red; magenta, a purplish-pink which absorbs green; and yellow, which absorbs blue. The red-filtered image is used to create a cyan dye image, the green-filtered image to create a magenta dye image, and the blue-filtered image to create a yellow dye image. When the three dye images are superimposed they form a complete color image.

This is also known as the CMYK color model. The &quot;K&quot; is a black component normally added in ink-jet and other mechanical printing processes to compensate for the imperfections of the colored inks used, which ideally should absorb or transmit various parts of the spectrum but not reflect any color, and to improve image definition.

At first it may seem that each image ought to be printed in the color of the filter used in making it, but by following any given color through the process the reason for printing in complementary colors should become apparent. A red object, for example, will be very pale in the red-filtered image but very dark in the other two images, so the result will be an area with just a trace of cyan, absorbing just a bit of red light, but a large amount of magenta and yellow, which together absorb most of the green and blue light, leaving mainly red light to be reflected back from the white paper in the case of a print, or transmitted through a clear support in the case of a transparency.

Before the technical innovations of the years 1935 to 1942, the only way to create a subtractive full-color print or transparency was by means of one of several labor-intensive and time-consuming procedures. Most commonly, three pigment images were first created separately by the so-called carbon process and then carefully combined in register. Sometimes, related processes were used to make three gelatin matrices which were dyed and assembled or used to transfer the three dye images into a single layer of gelatin coated on a final support. Chemical toning could be used to convert three black-and-white silver images into cyan, magenta and yellow images which were then assembled. In a few processes, the three images were created one on top of another by repeated coating or re-sensitizing, negative registration, exposure and development operations. A number of variations were devised and marketed during the first half of the 20th century, some of them short-lived, others, such as the Trichrome Carbro process, enduring for several decades. Because some of these processes allow very stable and light-fast coloring matter to be used, yielding images which can remain virtually unchanged for centuries, they are still not quite completely extinct.

The production of photographic three-color prints on paper was pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron, whose comprehensive 1868 French patent also included the basic concepts of most of the color photographic processes which were subsequently developed. For making the three color-filtered negatives required, he was able to develop materials and methods which were not as completely blind to red and green light as those used by Thomas Sutton in 1861, but they were still very insensitive to those colors. Exposure times were impractically long, the red or orange-filtered negative requiring hours of exposure in the camera. His earliest surviving color prints are &quot;sun prints&quot; of pressed flowers and leaves, each of the three negatives having been made without a camera by exposing the light-sensitive surface to direct sunlight passing first through a color filter and then through the vegetation. His first attempts were based on the red-yellow-blue colors then used for pigments, with no color reversal. Later he used the primary colors of light with color reversal.

===Color sensitization===

As long as photographic materials were usefully sensitive only to blue-green, blue, violet and ultraviolet, three-color photography could never be practical. In 1873 German chemist Hermann Wilhelm Vogel discovered that the addition of small amounts of certain aniline dyes to a photographic emulsion could add sensitivity to colors which the dyes absorbed. He identified dyes which variously sensitized for all the previously ineffective colors except true red, to which only a marginal trace of sensitivity could be added. In the following year, Edmond Becquerel discovered that chlorophyll was a good sensitizer for red. Although it would be many more years before these sensitizers (and better ones developed later) found much use beyond scientific applications such as spectrography, they were quickly and eagerly adopted by Louis Ducos du Hauron, Charles Cros and other color photography pioneers. Exposure times for the &quot;problem&quot; colors could now be reduced from hours to minutes. As ever-more-sensitive gelatin emulsions replaced the old wet and dry collodion processes, the minutes became seconds. New sensitizing dyes introduced early in the 20th century eventually made so-called &quot;instantaneous&quot; color exposures possible.

===Color cameras===

Making color separations by reloading the camera and changing the filter between exposures was inconvenient, added delays to the already long exposure times and could result in the camera being accidentally shifted out of position. To improve the actual picture-taking, a number of experimenters designed one or more special cameras for color photography. They were usually of two main types.

The first type used a system of partially reflecting surfaces to divide the light coming through the lens into three parts, each part passing through a different color filter and forming a separate image, so that the three images could be photographed at the same time on three plates (flexible film had not yet replaced glass plates as the support for the emulsion) or different areas of one plate. Later known as &quot;one-shot&quot; cameras, refined versions continued to be used as late as the 1950s for special purposes such as commercial photography for publication, in which a set of color separations was ultimately required in order to prepare printing plates.

The second type, known variously as a multiple back, repeating back or drop back camera, still exposed the images one at a time but used a sliding holder for the filters and plates which allowed each filter and the corresponding unexposed area of emulsion to be quickly shifted into place. German photochemistry professor Adolf Miethe designed a high-quality camera of this type which was commercially introduced by Bermpohl in 1903. It was probably this Miethe-Bermpohl camera which was used by Miethe&#x27;s pupil Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii to make his now-celebrated color photographic surveys of Russia before the 1917 revolution. One sophisticated variant, patented by Frederic Eugene Ives in 1897, was driven by clockwork and could be adjusted to automatically make each of the exposures for a different length of time according to the particular color sensitivities of the emulsion being used.

Otherwise, simple cameras with multiple color-filtered lenses were sometimes tried, but unless everything in the scene was at a great distance, or all in a plane at the same distance, the difference in the viewpoints of the lenses (parallax) made it impossible to completely register all parts of the resulting images at the same time.

===Color photography introduced to the public===
Prior to the late 1890s color photography was strictly the domain of a very few experimenters willing to build their own equipment, do their own color-sensitizing of photographic emulsions, make and test their own color filters and otherwise devote a large amount of time and effort to their pursuits. There were many opportunities for something to go wrong during the series of operations required and problem-free results were rare. Most photographers still regarded the idea of color photography as unrealistic. 

In 1898, however, it was possible to buy the required equipment and supplies ready-made. Two adequately red-sensitive photographic plates were already on the market, and two different systems of color photography with which to use them, described in photographic magazines for several years prior, were finally available to the public.

The most extensive and expensive of the two was the &quot;Kromskop&quot; (pronounced &quot;chrome-scope&quot;) system developed by Frederic Eugene Ives. This was a straightforward additive system and its essential elements had been described by James Clerk Maxwell, Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros much earlier, but Ives invested years of work and ingenuity in refining the methods and materials to optimize color quality, in overcoming problems inherent in the optical systems involved, and in simplifying the apparatus to bring down the cost of producing it commercially. The color images, dubbed &quot;Kromograms&quot;, were in the form of sets of three black-and-white transparencies on glass, mounted onto special cloth-tape-hinged triple cardboard frames. To see a Kromogram in color it had to be inserted into a &quot;Kromskop&quot; (generic name &quot;chromoscope&quot; or &quot;photochromoscope&quot;), a viewing device which used an arrangement of colored glass filters to illuminate each slide with the correct color of light and transparent reflectors to visually combine them into a single full-color image. The most popular model was stereoscopic. By looking through its pair of lenses, an image in full natural color and 3-D was seen, a startling novelty in the late Victorian age.

The results won near-universal praise for excellence and realism. At demonstrations, Ives sometimes placed a viewer displaying a still-life subject next to the actual objects photographed, inviting direct comparison. A Kromskop triple &quot;lantern&quot; could be used to project the three images, mounted in a special metal or wooden frame for this purpose, through filters as Maxwell had done in 1861. Prepared Kromograms of still-life subjects, landscapes, famous buildings and works of art were sold and these were the Kromskop viewer&#x27;s usual fodder, but a &quot;multiple back&quot; camera attachment and a set of three specially adjusted color filters could be bought by &quot;Kromskopists&quot; wishing to make their own Kromograms.

Kromskops and ready-made Kromograms were bought by educational institutions for their value in teaching about color and color vision, as well as by wealthy individuals. A few people made their own Kromograms. These were not enough to sustain Ives’ businesses, which had been set up to exploit the system; they soon failed, but the viewers, projectors, Kromograms and several varieties of Kromskop cameras and camera attachments continued to be available through the Scientific Shop in Chicago as late as 1907.

===Screen-plate era===

The simpler and somewhat more economical alternative was the Joly screen process. This required no special camera or viewer, just a special color-compensating filter for the camera lens and a special holder for the photographic plates. The holder contained the heart of the system: a clear glass plate on which very fine lines of three colors had been ruled in a regular repeating pattern, completely covering its surface. The idea was that instead of taking three separate complete photographs through three colored filters, the filters could be in the form of a large number of very narrow strips (the colored lines) allowing the necessary color information to be recorded in a single compound image. After the negative was developed, a positive transparency was printed from it and a viewing screen with red, green and blue lines in the same pattern as the lines of the taking screen was applied and carefully aligned. The colors then appeared as if by magic. The transparency and screen were very like the layer of monochrome liquid crystal elements and overlay of hair-thin red, green and blue color filter stripes which create the color image in a typical LCD display. This was the invention of Irish scientist John Joly, although he, like so many other inventors, eventually discovered that his basic concept had been anticipated in Louis Ducos du Hauron&#x27;s long-since-expired 1868 patent.

The Joly screen process had some problems. First and foremost, although the colored lines were reasonably fine (about 75 sets of three colored lines to the inch) they were still disturbingly visible at normal viewing distances and nearly intolerable when enlarged by projection. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that each screen was individually ruled on a machine which used three pens to apply the transparent colored inks, resulting in irregularities, high reject rates and high cost. The glass used for photographic plates at the time was not perfectly flat, and lack of uniform good contact between the screen and the image gave rise to areas of degraded color. Poor contact also caused false colors to appear if the sandwich was viewed at an angle. Although much simpler than the Kromskop system, the Joly system was not inexpensive. The starter kit of plate holder, compensating filter, one taking screen and one viewing screen cost US$30 (the equivalent of at least $750 in 2010 dollars) and additional viewing screens were $1 each (the equivalent of at least $25 in 2010 dollars). This system, too, soon died of neglect, although in fact it pointed the way to the future.

Surviving examples of the Joly process usually show extremely poor color now. The colors in the viewing screens have badly faded and shifted, making it impossible to judge their original appearance. In some specimens the viewing screen is also misaligned.

Lippmann photography is a way of making a color photograph that relies on Bragg reflection planes in the emulsion to make the colors. It is similar to using the colors of soap bubbles to make an image. Gabriel Jonas Lippmann won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1908 for the creation of the first color photographic process using a single emulsion. The method is based on the interference phenomenon. The color fidelity is extremely high but the images can not be reproduced and viewing requires very specific lighting conditions. The development of the Autochrome process quickly rendered the Lippmann method redundant. The method is still utilized to make singular images that cannot be copied for security purposes.

The first commercially successful color process, the Lumière Autochrome, invented by the French Lumière brothers, reached the market in 1907. Instead of colored strips, it was based on an irregular screen plate filter made of three colors of dyed grains of potato starch which were too small to be individually visible. The light sensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen plate, eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image. Reversal processing was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image by removing the exposed silver metal, and re-exposing the remaining silver halide, so no printing or screen registration was required. The shortcomings of the Autochrome process were the expense (one plate cost about as much as a dozen black-and-white plates of the same size), the relatively long exposure times which made hand-held &quot;snapshots&quot; and photographs of moving subjects impractical, and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the light-absorbing color screen.

Viewed under optimum conditions and by daylight as intended, a well-made and well-preserved Autochrome can look startlingly fresh and vivid. Unfortunately, modern film and digital copies are usually made with a highly diffused light source, which causes loss of color saturation and other ill effects due to light scatter within the structure of the screen and emulsion, and by fluorescent or other artificial light which alters the color balance. The capabilities of the process should not be judged by the dull, washed-out, odd-colored reproductions commonly seen.

Millions of Autochrome plates were manufactured and used during the quarter century before the plates were replaced by film-based versions in the 1930s. The very last film version, named alticolor, brought the Autochrome process into the 1950s but was discontinued in 1955. Many additive color screen products were available between the 1890s and the 1950s, but none, with the possible exception of Dufaycolor, introduced as film for still photography in 1935, was as popular or successful as the Lumière Autochrome. The most recent use of the additive screen process for non-digital photography was in Polachrome, an &quot;instant&quot; 35mm slide film introduced in 1983 and discontinued about twenty years later.

===Tripacks===

Louis Ducos du Hauron had suggested using a sandwich of three differently color-recording emulsions on transparent supports which could be exposed together in an ordinary camera, then taken apart and used like any other set of three-color separations. The problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact face-to-face, the third would have to be separated by the thickness of one transparent support layer. Because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue, the blue-recording layer ought to be on top and have a blue-blocking yellow filter layer behind it. This blue-recording layer, used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be &quot;soft&quot;, would end up producing the sharpest image. The two layers behind it, one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red, would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion, and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it.

Despite these limitations, some &quot;tripacks&quot; were commercially produced, such as the Hess-Ives &quot;Hiblock&quot; which sandwiched an emulsion on film between emulsions coated on glass plates. For a brief period in the early 1930s, the American Agfa-Ansco company produced Colorol, a roll-film tripack for snapshot cameras. The three emulsions were on unusually thin film bases. After exposure, the roll was sent to Agfa-Ansco for processing and the triple negatives were returned to the customer with a set of color prints. The images were not sharp and the color was not very good, but they were genuine &quot;natural color&quot; snapshots.

&quot;Bipacks&quot; using only two emulsions face-to-face were the subject of some development. Although the range of colors which could be reproduced by only two components was limited, skin tones and most hair and eye colors could be rendered with surprising fidelity, making bipack processes a viable option for color portraiture. In commercial practice, however, the use of bipacks was almost entirely confined to two-color motion picture systems.

If the three layers of emulsion in a tripack did not have to be taken apart in order to produce the cyan, magenta and yellow dye images from them, they could be coated directly on top of each other, eliminating the most serious problems. In fact, some chemical magic was under development which would make that possible.

===Color film since the 1930s===
In 1935, American Eastman Kodak introduced the first modern &quot;integral tripack&quot; color film and called it Kodachrome, a name recycled from an earlier and completely different two-color process. Its development was led by the improbable team of Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky Jr. (nicknamed &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;God&quot;), two highly regarded classical musicians who had started tinkering with color photographic processes and ended up working with the Kodak Research Laboratories. Kodachrome had three layers of emulsion coated on a single base, each layer recording one of the three additive primaries, red, green, and blue. In keeping with Kodak&#x27;s old &quot;you press the button, we do the rest&quot; slogan, the film was simply loaded into the camera, exposed in the ordinary way, then mailed to Kodak for processing. Aside from manufacturing the film, processing was the most complex step. This involved the controlled penetration of chemicals into the three layers of emulsion. A simplified description of the process is as follows: as each layer was developed into a black-and-white silver image, a &quot;dye coupler&quot; added during that stage of development caused a cyan, magenta or yellow dye image to be created along with it. The silver was chemically removed, leaving only the three layers of dye images in the finished film.

Initially, Kodachrome was available only as 16mm film for home movies, but in 1936 it was also introduced as 8mm home movie film and short lengths of 35mm film for still photography. In 1938, sheet film in various sizes for professional photographers was introduced, some changes were made to cure early problems with unstable colors, and a somewhat simplified processing method was instituted.

In 1936, the German Agfa followed with their own integral tripack film, Agfacolor Neu, which was generally similar to Kodachrome but had one important advantage: Agfa had found a way to incorporate the dye couplers into the emulsion layers during manufacture, allowing all three layers to be developed at the same time and greatly simplifying the processing. Most modern color films, excepting the now-discontinued Kodachrome, use the incorporated dye coupler technique, but since the 1970s nearly all have used a modification developed by Kodak rather than the original Agfa version.

In 1941, Kodak made it possible to order prints from Kodachrome slides. The print &quot;paper&quot; was actually a white plastic coated with a multilayer emulsion similar to that on the film. These were the first commercially available color prints created by the chromogenic dye coupler method. In the following year, Kodacolor film was introduced. Unlike Kodachrome, it was designed to be processed into a negative image which showed not only light and dark reversed but also complementary colors. The use of such a negative for making prints on paper simplified the processing of the prints, reducing their cost.

The expense of color film as compared to black-and-white and the difficulty of using it with indoor lighting combined to delay its widespread adoption by amateurs. In 1950, black-and-white snapshots were still the norm. By 1960, color was much more common but still tended to be reserved for travel photos and special occasions. Color film and color prints cost several times as much as black-and-white, and taking color snapshots in deep shade or indoors required flashbulbs—an inconvenience and an additional expense. By 1970, prices were dropping, film sensitivity had improved, electronic flash units were replacing flashbulbs, and color had become the norm for snapshot-taking in most families. Black-and-white film continued to be used by some photographers who preferred it for aesthetic reasons or who wanted to take pictures by existing light in low-light conditions, which was still difficult to do with color film. They usually did their own developing and printing. By 1980, black-and-white film in the formats used by typical snapshot cameras, as well as commercial developing and printing service for it, had nearly disappeared.

Instant color film was introduced by Polaroid in 1963. Like Polaroid&#x27;s contemporary instant black-and-white film, their first color product was a negative-positive peel-apart process which produced a unique print on paper. The negative could not be reused and was discarded. The blight created by carelessly discarded caustic-chemical-laden Polaroid negatives, which tended to accumulate most heavily at the most picturesque locations, which Polaroid founder Edwin Land did not like and prompted him to develop the later SX-70 system, which produced no separate negative to discard.

Some currently available color films are designed to produce positive transparencies for use in a slide projector or magnifying viewer, although paper prints can also be made from them. Transparencies are preferred by some professional photographers who use film because they can be judged without having to print them first. Transparencies are also capable of a wider dynamic range and, therefore, of a greater degree of realism than the more convenient medium of prints on paper. The early popularity of color &quot;slides&quot; among amateurs went into decline after automated printing equipment began improving print quality and lowering prices.

Other currently available films are designed to produce color negatives for use in creating enlarged positive prints on color photographic paper. Color negatives may also be digitally scanned and then printed by photographic or non-photographic means, or viewed as positives electronically. Unlike reversal-film transparency processes, negative-positive processes are, within limits, forgiving of incorrect exposure and poor color lighting, because printing allows considerable correction. Negative film is therefore more suitable for casual use by amateurs. Virtually all single-use cameras employ negative film. Photographic transparencies can be made from negatives by printing them on special &quot;positive film&quot;, but this has always been unusual outside of the motion picture industry and commercial service to do it for still images may no longer be available. Negative films and paper prints are by far the most common form of color film photography today.


===Digital photography===

After a transition period centered around 1994–2006, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras that can shoot both in monochrome as well as color. Some photographers continue to prefer film for its distinctive &quot;look&quot; for artistic purposes or out of fondness.

The most commonly used method of obtaining color information in digital photography is the use of a Bayer filter, invented by Bryce Bayer of Eastman Kodak in 1976. In this approach, a sensor that is sensitive to multiple wavelengths of light is placed behind a color filter. Traditionally, each pixel, or &quot;sensel&quot;, is thereby assigned an additional light response curve beyond its inherent differential response to different wavelengths - typically the filters applied respond to red, blue and green, the latter being used twice as often based on an argument that the human eye is more sensitive to variation in green than any other color. Thus, the color image produced would preserve color in a way resembling human perception, and not appear unduly deteriorated in any particular color range.

However, alternative approaches do exist. The Foveon sensor uses the fact that light penetrates silicon to a depth that depends on the wavelength of the light. Thus, reading light at a lower layer in a silicon stack would yield a different value than reading it at the top, and the difference can be used to compute the color of the light in addition to its intensity.

Another option is the use of a prism to separate the colors onto three separate capturing devices, as in a three-CCD camera.

The Bayer pattern itself has had various modifications proposed. One class of these uses the same pattern, but changes the colors of the glass, for instance using cyan, yellow, green and magenta for increased sensitivity to the intensity of light (luminance) or replacing one green cell with an &quot;emerald&quot; or cyan one.

Fujifilm in particular has proposed some of the more unusual variations of the Bayer pattern, such as the EXR and X-Trans patterns.

==Artists&#x27; perspectives==
Photographers differed in opinion about color photography when it was introduced. Some fully embraced it when it was available to the public in the late 1930s, while others remained skeptical of its relevance in the art of photography.

===Proponents===
Paul Outerbridge was an American photographer prominent for his early use and experiments in color photography. He began writing a monthly column on color photography for the U.S. Camera Magazine around 1930. Outerbridge became known for the high quality of his color illustrations, made by an extremely complex tri-color carbro process. In 1940 he published his seminal book &quot;Photographing in Color&quot;, using high quality illustrations to explain his techniques.

Ferenc Berko, a classic photographer who lived during the rise of color film, was one of the photographers who immediately recognized the potential of color film. He saw it as a new way to frame the world; a way to experiment with the subjects he photographed and how he conveyed emotion in the photograph.

John Hedgecoe, another photographer who lived during this time period, was another example of those who preferred color. He published a book entitled &quot;The Art of Color Photography&quot;, in which he explained the importance of understanding the &quot;special and often subtle relationships between different colors&quot;. He also described the psychological and emotional power that color can have on the viewer, since certain colors, he argues, can make people feel a certain way.

William Eggleston is widely credited with increasing recognition for color photography as a legitimate artistic medium.

Jan Groover, a postmodernist noted for her work during the 1970s used color extensively in her work.

===Skeptics===
Though color photography had its followers, black-and-white still remained the more popular and respected film when color first came out.

According to Eggleston, his former idol, Henri Cartier-Bresson, said to him at a party, “William, color is bullshit”, and then not another word.

Harold Baquet, for instance—a relatively current photographer known best for documenting New Orleans civil rights—was not keen on color. He preferred to take pictures mainly using black-and-white film. When asked about his reasoning for this preference during an interview, he replied “The less is more thing. Sometimes the color distracts from the essential subject. Sometimes, just light, line and form is enough, and it allows you to explore the sculptural qualities of that third dimension, that illusional dimension of depth. And it’s fun”. This aversion to color was due mainly to a fear of losing simplicity in his pictures. He worried that color gave the eye too much to take in.

This worry was not uncommon. Photographer Ansel Adams, known best for his dramatic black-and-white landscapes, also felt that color could be distracting, and could therefore divert the artist&#x27;s attention away from creating a photograph to his full potential, according to some experts. Adams actually claimed that he could get &quot;a far greater sense of &#x27;color&#x27; through a well-planned and executed black-and-white image than [he had] ever achieved with color photography&quot;. Another expert source mentioned that Adams was a &quot;master of control&quot;. He wrote books about technique, developed the Zone System—which helped determine the optimal exposure and development time for a given photograph—and introduced the idea of &quot;previsualization&quot;, which involved the photographer imagining what he wanted his final print to look like before he even took the shot. These concepts and methods allowed for nearly total control of all the potential variables that factor into a final print. Because of this love for control, Adams disliked color because it lacked this element that he had mastered with black-and-white.

While Adams initially was far from thrilled with color, he did experiment with it, unknown to many. A few examples of his color work are available in the online archive of the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. The subjects which he shot in color ranged from portraits, to landscape, to architecture; a similar scope to that of his black and white work. In fact, toward the end of his life, Adams admitted his regret of not being able to master the technique of color, according to an expert source.

Though a wide range of film preference still exists among photographers today, color has, with time, gained a much larger following in the field of photography.

==Preservation==
Color photographic materials are impermanent and, by nature, unstable. Chromogenic color photographs, for example, are composed of yellow, magenta, and cyan organic dyes, which fade at different rates. Even in dark storage and archival material enclosures, deterioration is unavoidable. However, proper care can delay fading, color shifting, and discoloration.

===Environment===
Unsuitable environmental conditions will deteriorate or destroy photographs. Examples include:
*High temperature and high relative humidity (RH)
*Air pollution and dirt
*Light exposure
*Biological threats such as fungi and insects
*Residual processing chemicals
*Base and emulsion deterioration
*Handling and usage
*Improper storage and enclosures

Three signs of aging of color images are:
*Dark fading occurs regardless of the procedures taken to preserve a photograph and is unavoidable. It is caused by temperature and humidity. Cyan dyes typically fade more quickly, making the image appear too red.
*Light fading occurs with exposure to light, e.g. while on display. The intensity of the light source and ultraviolet (UV) rays affect the rate of change and fade. Magenta dyes typically fade the quickest.
*Highlight staining of older color photographic papers is yellowing of the border and highlight areas of a photograph.

===Storage===
In general, the colder the storage, the longer the lifetime of color photographs. Frost-free &quot;cold storage&quot; below freezing is one of the most effective ways to halt damage to color images. Cold storage is more costly and requires special training to remove and return items. &quot;Cool storage&quot; above freezing, which is more common and less costly, requires temperatures between with 30–40% relative humidity and above the dew point to eliminate condensation.

&quot;Dark storage&quot; in light tight enclosures and storage boxes is advised for individual items. When materials are exposed to light during handling, usage, or display, light sources should be UV-filtered and intensity kept at minimum. In storage areas, 200–400 lux is recommended.

===Enclosures===
The use of protective enclosures is the easiest method to preserve photographic materials from damage by handling and light exposure. All protective materials should pass the &quot;Photographic Activity Test&quot; (PAT) as described both by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in standard IT9.2–1988, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in standard 18916:2007(E), &quot;Photography – Processed Photographic Materials – Photographic Activity Test for Enclosure Materials&quot;. The PAT is an archival science test that determines what kind of storage enclosures will preserve, prolong, and/or prevent further deterioration.

It is recommended that each item have its own archival enclosure of appropriate size. Archival enclosures may be made of &quot;paper&quot; or &quot;plastic&quot;. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

*Paper enclosures should be non-acidic, lignin-free paper and may come in either buffered or non-buffered stock. Paper enclosures are generally less costly than plastic ones. Paper&#x27;s opacity protects photographs from light. Its porosity may protect them from internal humidity and gaseous pollutants. However, images must be removed from the enclosure to be viewed. This risks mishandling and vandalism.
*Archival quality plastic enclosures are made of uncoated polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene. They are transparent, which enables viewing the photograph without removing the enclosure. Plastic is also more resistant to tears, compared to paper. Disadvantages include being prone to static electricity and risk of ferrotyping (moisture becoming trapped between enclosure and item, causing the materials to stick to one another).

After photographic materials are individually enclosed, housing or storage containers provide another protective barrier, such as folders and boxes made from archival paperboard as addressed in ISO Standards 18916:2007 and 18902. Sometimes these containers must be custom-made for oddly sized materials. In general, flat storage in boxes is recommended because it provides more stable support, particularly for materials that are fragile. Boxes and folders should not be over-filled.

<doc id="444767" wikidata="Q179018" url="?curid=444767" title="Seabiscuit (film)">
<text>Seabiscuit is a 2003 American historical sports drama film co-produced, written and directed by Gary Ross and based on the best-selling 1999 non-fiction book &quot;&quot; by Laura Hillenbrand. The film is loosely based on the life and racing career of Seabiscuit, an undersized and overlooked Thoroughbred race horse, whose unexpected successes made him a hugely popular media sensation in the United States during the Great Depression. At the 76th Academy Awards, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; received seven nominations, including Best Picture, but ultimately lost all seven, including six to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

==Plot==

In the early 20th century, as America enters the automobile age, Charles S. Howard opens a bicycle shop in San Francisco. He is soon selling automobiles, becoming the largest car dealer in California and one of the Bay Area&#x27;s richest men. In the wake of the Great Depression, Canadian John &quot;Red&quot; Pollard&#x27;s family is financially ruined, and he is sent to live with a horse trainer. Years pass and Pollard becomes a jockey, but amateur boxing leaves him blind in one eye.
After their young son is killed in an automobile accident, Howard&#x27;s wife leaves him. He obtains a divorce in Mexico, where Pollard is struggling to make his mark as a jockey. Howard meets and marries Marcela Zabala. When he acquires a stable of racehorses, he hires itinerant horseman Tom Smith as his trainer. Smith convinces him to buy a colt called Seabiscuit. Though a grandson of the great Man o&#x27; War and trained by the renowned James E. Fitzsimmons, Seabiscuit is viewed as small, lazy, and unmanageable. Smith witnesses Pollard&#x27;s similarly temperamental spirit, and hires him as Seabiscuit&#x27;s jockey.

Under Smith&#x27;s innovative training, Seabiscuit becomes the most successful racehorse on the West Coast and an underdog hero to the public. Howard issues a challenge to Samuel D. Riddle, owner of the East Coast champion and Triple Crown-winning racehorse War Admiral, but Riddle dismisses California racing as inferior. In the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap, Seabiscuit takes the lead, but Pollard&#x27;s impaired vision prevents him from noticing another horse surging up on the outside. Losing by a nose, Pollard admits his partial blindness to Smith.

Howard declares that Pollard will remain Seabiscuit&#x27;s jockey, and rallies public support for a match race with War Admiral. Riddle agrees, on the condition that they race with a rope and bell instead of a starting gate. With Seabiscuit at a disadvantage, Smith trains the horse to break fast at the sound of the bell. As the race approaches, Pollard severely fractures his leg in a riding accident. Informed he may never walk again, let alone ride, he recommends that his friend and skilled jockey George Woolf ride Seabiscuit, advising him on the horse&#x27;s handling and behavior from his hospital bed.

The highly anticipated &quot;race of the century&quot; draws a sellout crowd, with 40 million more people listening on the radio. Seabiscuit takes an early lead until nearing the far turn; following Pollard&#x27;s advice, Woolf slows Seabiscuit, allowing War Admiral to match Seabicuit&#x27;s stride. Seabiscuit looks War Admiral in the eye before surging ahead and winning by four lengths, enthralling the nation. A few months later, Seabiscuit injures his leg. Pollard, still recovering from his own injury, tends to the horse as they both heal. When Seabiscuit is fit enough to race again, Howard brings him back to the Santa Anita Handicap; he is reluctant to allow Pollard to ride and risk crippling himself for life. At the urging of Woolf and Marcela, Howard relents.

Pollard, using a self-made leg brace, discovers Woolf is also in the race on a new mount. Seabiscuit drops far behind the field; Pollard pulls alongside Woolf, allowing Seabiscuit a good look at Pollard&#x27;s mount. With Woolf&#x27;s encouragement, Seabiscuit surges ahead. Heading for the finish line several lengths ahead, Pollard&#x27;s voiceover explains that Seabiscuit was not merely a broken-down horse that three men fixed, but that Seabiscuit fixed them and, in a way, they fixed one another.

==Cast==
==Release==
The film was released on July 25, 2003, by Universal Pictures.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 208 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A life-affirming, if saccharine, epic treatment of a spirit-lifting figure in sports history&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, and wrote: &quot;The movie&#x27;s races are thrilling because they must be thrilling; there&#x27;s no way for the movie to miss on those, but writer-director Gary Ross and his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, get amazingly close to the action.&quot;

<text>Dennis Gerrard Stephen Doherty (November 29, 1940 – January 19, 2007) was a Canadian singer and songwriter. A tenor, he was a founding member of the 1960s musical group the Mamas &amp; the Papas for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life and career==
Denny Doherty was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia on November 29, 1940, the youngest of five children.
 He grew up in Halifax&#x27;s North End in a devout Catholic household. His father was a dockworker and Doherty has described his mother as &quot;a housewife and mystic&quot;.

=== Early musical career ===
Doherty and three friends, Richard Sheehan, Eddie Thibodeau, and Mike O&#x27;Connell, began their musical career in 1956 with a band called the Hepsters. Two years later they disbanded. In 1960, still in Halifax, Doherty, aged 19, along with Pat LaCroix and Richard Byrne, began a folk group, called the Colonials.

Columbia Records signed the group several months later, at which time they changed their name to the Halifax III. The band recorded two LPs and had a minor hit, entitled &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Sing Along With Mitch&quot;, but broke up in 1965.

==The Mamas and the Papas==
In 1963, Doherty established a friendship with Cass Elliot when she was with a band called the Big 3. While on tour with the Halifax III, Doherty met John Phillips and his wife, model Michelle Gilliam.

A few months later, the Halifax III dissolved, and Doherty and their accompanist, Zal Yanovsky, were left broke in Hollywood. Elliot convinced her manager to hire them. Thus, Doherty and Yanovsky joined the Big 3 (increasing the number of members to four). Soon, after adding even more band members, they changed their name to the Mugwumps, which soon broke up due to insolvency. Yanovsky went on to form the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful with John Sebastian.

About this time, Phillips&#x27;s new band, the New Journeymen, needed a replacement for tenor Marshall Brickman, who had left the group to pursue a career in television writing. Doherty, then unemployed, filled the opening. After the New Journeymen called it quits as a band in early 1965, Elliot was invited into the formation of a new band, which became the Magic Cyrcle. Six months later in September 1965, the group signed a recording contract with Dunhill Records. Changing their name to the Mamas and the Papas, the band soon began to record their debut album, &quot;If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears&quot;. The Mamas and the Papas song &quot;Creeque Alley&quot; briefly outlines this history. Doherty sang lead on &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; released in December 1965 prior to the release of the debut album early in 1966.

===Relationship with Michelle Phillips===

In late 1965, Doherty and Michelle Phillips started an affair. They were able to keep it secret during the early days of the band&#x27;s success. When the affair was discovered, John and Michelle moved to their own residence (they had been sharing a house with Doherty), and the band continued recording together. Eventually the group signed a statement in June 1966 with their record label&#x27;s full support, firing Michelle from the band. She was quickly replaced by Jill Gibson, girlfriend of the band&#x27;s producer Lou Adler. Gibson&#x27;s stint as a &quot;Mama&quot; lasted two and a half months.

Due to fan demand, Michelle was allowed to rejoin in August 1966, while Gibson was given a lump sum for her efforts. The band completed their second album (titled simply &quot;The Mamas and the Papas&quot;) by re-recording, replacing, or overlaying new vocal parts by Michelle Phillips over Jill Gibson&#x27;s studio vocals.

After a string of hit singles, many television appearances, a successful third studio album (&quot;The Mamas and the Papas Deliver&quot; in March 1967), and the group&#x27;s appearance at the Monterey International Pop Festival (which had been organized by John Phillips and Lou Adler) in June 1967, an ill-fated trip to England in October 1967 fragmented the already damaged group dynamic. Elliot quit after a stinging insult from John Phillips (although she returned to complete her parts for the group&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The Papas and the Mamas&quot;, which was finally released in May 1968). By then, Michelle had given birth to Chynna Phillips (in February 1968) and a formal statement had been released announcing the group&#x27;s demise.

==Solo career==

Elliot and Doherty remained friends after the band&#x27;s break-up, while Elliot had a hit solo show. She eventually asked Doherty to marry her, but he declined. He released a few solo LPs and singles during this period, two of note being 1971&#x27;s &quot;Watcha Gonna Do?&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for a Song&quot;, the latter of which went unreleased in the United States. Featuring both Michelle Phillips and Cass Elliot on background vocals, the recordings would be Elliot&#x27;s last, as she died of heart failure in her sleep on July 29, 1974, after a sold-out run in London a few months after the record was finished. Doherty was stunned and saddened and attended the funeral several days later in early August, along with John and Michelle Phillips.

In 1982, he joined a reconstituted Mamas &amp; Papas, consisting of John, his daughter Mackenzie Phillips, and Elaine &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarlane, which toured and performed old standards and new tunes written by John. Doherty later produced an off-Broadway show called &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;, which was a narrative of his perspective of the story of the Mamas &amp; the Papas. It was well received and garnered favourable reviews. The show was in part a response to John&#x27;s PBS documentary &quot;Straight Shooter: The True Story of John Phillips and The Mamas and the Papas&quot;. It featured music from the group and focused on his relationship with Cass Elliot.

From 1993 to 2001, he played the part of the Harbour Master, as well as the voice-overs of the characters, in &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot;, a CBC Television children&#x27;s show chronicling the &quot;lives&quot; of vessels in a busy harbour loosely based upon Halifax Harbour.

In 1999, he played Charley McGinnis in 22 episodes of the CBC Television series &quot;Pit Pony&quot;.

In 2004, Doherty appeared on Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Concert special, &quot;25 Years of Skinnamarink&quot;, that aired on CBC on January 1, 2004. He sang two songs with the trio: &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Who Put the Bomp?&quot; 
One of his last appearances was in the Canadian TV series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, Season 7 Episode 10 (season finale) as FBI Special Agent Ryan Shockneck. Filming was completed just shortly before his death in early 2007 and the end credits dedicate the episode to him.

==Personal life==

Doherty had three children: A daughter, Jessica Woods, from a brief first marriage, and a daughter, Emberly, and son, John, by his 20-year marriage to his second wife, Jeannette, who died in 1998 from ovarian cancer. John Doherty was in the Canadian ska punk band illScarlett.

==Death and burial ==
Doherty died on January 19, 2007, at his home in Mississauga, Ontario. The cause was not immediately known, but he had suffered from kidney failure following surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His funeral service was held at St Stephen&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Halifax. He was interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia.

== Life documentary ==
Shortly after his death, a documentary about his life was released titled &quot;Here I Am&quot;. The title song was written with blues guitarist James Anthony.

<text>Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne is a title in the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The earl is also Chief of Clan Lyon.

==History== 
The established history of Clan Lyon states that the family is of French origin, with the original name &quot;de Leonne&quot;, but James Balfour Paul, in his &quot;Scots Peerage&quot;, states that the family is likely of Celtic origin. The family&#x27;s earliest recorded possessions, the thanages of Glamis, Glamis, Tannadyce and Belhelvies, were in a Celtic stronghold, while government positions held by family chiefs would have required fluency in Gaelic.

The first recorded family member, John Lyon, Lord of Glamis, was a courtier and diplomat, who was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1371 on the accession of Robert II. He acquired significant lands, and on 18 March 1372, Robert II granted him &quot;the free barony of Glamuyss in the sheriffdom of Forfar.&quot; Glamis has remained the seat of the family ever since. His descendant Patrick Lyon, 1st Lord Glamis was created the first Lord Glamis in the Peerage of Scotland in 1445.

In 1606, the earldom was first created as Earl of Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland for Patrick Lyon, the ninth Lord Glamis, who was also created Lord Lyon and Glamis at the same time. In 1677, the designation of the earldom was changed to &quot;Strathmore and Kinghorne&quot; for Patrick Lyon, the third Earl. He was also granted the subsidiary titles of Viscount Lyon and Lord of Glamis, Tannadyce, Sidlaw and Strathdichtie. The 10th Earl sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1796 to 1806, and again from 1807 to 1812. In 1815, he was created Baron Bowes in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, but upon his death five years later without legitimate issue, the peerage became extinct. The Scottish peerages were inherited by his younger brother, the 11th Earl. 

The 11th Earl was succeeded by his grandson, the 12th Earl, who also sat in the House of Lords as a representative peer from 1852 to 1865. He married but left no children, and the peerages were inherited by his brother, the 13th Earl, who sat in the Lords as a representative peer from 1870 until 1892. In 1887, he was created Baron Bowes of Streatlam Castle, in the County of Durham, and of Lunedale, in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This gave him and his successors an automatic seat in the House of Lords, which the earldom did not entitle them to until the Peerage Act 1963 extended that right to all holders of Scottish peerages. The 13th Earl was succeeded by his son, the 14th Earl, who in 1937 was created Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, leading to his 
becoming the &quot;14th and 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne&quot;.

The eldest son of the earl uses &quot;Lord Glamis&quot; as a courtesy title. Normally, the highest subsidiary title (in this case &quot;Viscount Lyon&quot;) would be used, but Lord Glamis is used instead to prevent confusion with the officer of arms, Lord Lyon King of Arms. 
Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (1900–2002) was the daughter of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and the sister of the 15th Earl.

The family seat is Glamis Castle, in Angus, Scotland. Other family seats were Gibside, near Burnopfield, County Durham and Streatlam Castle, near Barnard Castle in County Durham. The traditional burial place of the Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne is in an aisle of Glamis parish church.

<text>USS &quot;Bass&quot; (SSK-2/SS-551), a &quot;Barracuda&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bass, an edible, spiny-finned fish. She was originally named USS &quot;K-2&quot; (SSK-2).

&quot;Bass&quot; was laid down by Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 2 May 1951 as &quot;K-2&quot; sponsored by Mrs. John J. Crane, widow of Commander Crane, and commissioned on 16 November 1951.

The three SSK boats, , &quot;Bass&quot; (SSK-2), and , were equipped with the large BQR-4 bow-mounted sonar array as part of Project Kayo, which experimented in the use of passive acoustics with low-frequency bow-mounted sonar arrays. When the boat was rigged for silent running, these arrays gave greatly improved convergence zone detection ranges against snorkeling submarines. The SSKs themselves were limited in their anti-submarine warfare (ASW) abilities by their low speed and their need to snorkel periodically to recharge their batteries, but the advances they pioneered in sonar technology were invaluable to the development of nuclear-powered submarines. The class was developed as mobilization prototypes should large numbers of Soviet submarines based on the Type XXI U-boat appear.

&quot;K-2&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 May 1952 to join Submarine Division 72. Since she was a new type of submarine, she engaged in special evaluation operations to determine her capabilities and limitations. In January 1953 she underwent restricted availability at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for the installation of additional equipment. In June 1953 she resumed operations and engaged in developing tactics and coordinated operations with other fleet units.

In January 1955, &quot;K-2&quot; returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After this she cruised to Mazatlán, Mexico, before returning to Pearl Harbor. She was renamed &quot;Bass&quot; on 15 December 1955. &quot;Bass&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor until June 1957. On 26 June 1957 she returned to the United States and operated along the West Coast until going out of commission in reserve 1 October 1957. In 1958, the Soviet threat changed from conventional to nuclear-powered submarines, and the SSK force was withdrawn from the SSK role and redesignated. Her hull classification symbol was changed to SS-551 on 15 August 1959.

==Fate==
USS &quot;Bass&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1965, and was sold for scrap on 17 November 1966.

<doc id="444789" wikidata="Q7205530" url="?curid=444789" title="Plural quantification">
<text>In mathematics and logic, plural quantification is the theory that an individual variable x may take on &quot;plural&quot;, as well as singular, values. As well as substituting individual objects such as Alice, the number 1, the tallest building in London etc. for x, we may substitute both Alice and Bob, or all the numbers between 0 and 10, or all the buildings in London over 20 stories.

The point of the theory is to give first-order logic the power of set theory, but without any &quot;existential commitment&quot; to such objects as sets. The classic expositions are Boolos 1984 and Lewis 1991.

== History ==
The view is commonly associated with George Boolos, though it is older (see notably Simons 1982), and is related to the view of classes defended by John Stuart Mill and other nominalist philosophers. Mill argued that universals or &quot;classes&quot; are not a peculiar kind of thing, having an objective existence distinct from the individual objects that fall under them, but &quot;is neither more nor less than the individual things in the class&quot;. (Mill 1904, II. ii. 2, also I. iv. 3).

A similar position was also discussed by Bertrand Russell in chapter VI of Russell (1903), but later dropped in favour of a &quot;no-classes&quot; theory. See also Gottlob Frege 1895 for a critique of an earlier view defended by Ernst Schroeder.

The general idea can be traced back to Leibniz. (Levey 2011, pp. 129–133)

Interest revived in plurals with work in linguistics in the 1970s by Remko Scha, Godehard Link, Fred Landman, Friederike Moltmann, Roger Schwarzschild, Peter Lasersohn and others, who developed ideas for a semantics of plurals.

==Background and motivation==

=== Multigrade (variably polyadic) predicates and relations ===
Sentences like
: Alice and Bob cooperate.
: Alice, Bob and Carol cooperate.
are said to involve a &quot;multigrade&quot; (also known as &quot;variably polyadic&quot;, also &quot;anadic&quot;) predicate or relation (&quot;cooperate&quot; in this example), meaning that they stand for the same concept even though they don&#x27;t have a fixed arity (cf. Linnebo &amp; Nicolas 2008). The notion of multigrade relation/predicate has appeared as early as the 1940s and has been notably used by Quine (cf. Morton 1975). Plural quantification deals with formalizing the quantification over the variable-length arguments of such predicates, e.g. &quot;&quot;xx&quot; cooperate&quot; where &quot;xx&quot; is a plural variable. Note that in this example it makes no sense, semantically, to instantiate &quot;xx&quot; with the name of a single person.

===Nominalism===

Broadly speaking, nominalism denies the existence of universals (abstract entities), like sets, classes, relations, properties, etc. Thus the plural logics were developed as an attempt to formalize reasoning about plurals, such as those involved in multigrade predicates, apparently without resorting to notions that nominalists deny, e.g. sets.

Standard first-order logic has difficulties in representing some sentences with plurals. Most well-known is the Geach–Kaplan sentence &quot;some critics admire only one another&quot;. Kaplan proved that it is nonfirstorderizable (the proof can be found in that article). Hence its paraphrase into a formal language commits us to quantification over (i.e. the existence of) sets.

Boolos argued that second-order monadic quantification may be systematically interpreted in terms of plural quantification, and that, therefore, second-order monadic quantification is &quot;ontologically innocent&quot;.

Later, Oliver &amp; Smiley (2001), Rayo (2002), Yi (2005) and McKay (2006) argued that sentences such as

:They are shipmates
:They are meeting together
:They lifted a piano
:They are surrounding a building
:They admire only one another

also cannot be interpreted in monadic second-order logic. This is because predicates such as &quot;are shipmates&quot;, &quot;are meeting together&quot;, &quot;are surrounding a building&quot; are not &quot;distributive&quot;. A predicate F is distributive if, whenever some things are F, each one of them is F. But in standard logic, &quot;every monadic predicate is distributive&quot;. Yet such sentences also seem innocent of any existential assumptions, and do not involve quantification.

So one can propose a unified account of plural terms that allows for both distributive and non-distributive satisfaction of predicates, while defending this position against the &quot;singularist&quot; assumption that such predicates are predicates of sets of individuals (or of mereological sums).

Several writers have suggested that plural logic opens the prospect of simplifying the foundations of mathematics, avoiding the paradoxes of set theory, and simplifying the complex and unintuitive axiom sets needed in order to avoid them.

Recently, Linnebo &amp; Nicolas (2008) have suggested that natural languages often contain superplural variables (and associated quantifiers) such as &quot;these people, those people, and these other people compete against each other&quot; (e.g. as teams in an online game), while Nicolas (2008) has argued that plural logic should be used to account for the semantics of mass nouns, like &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;furniture&quot;.

== Formal definition ==

This section presents a simple formulation of plural logic/quantification approximately the same as given by Boolos in &quot;Nominalist Platonism&quot; (Boolos 1985).

=== Syntax ===

Sub-sentential units are defined as

* Predicate symbols formula_1, formula_2, etc. (with appropriate arities, which are left implicit)
* Singular variable symbols formula_3, formula_4, etc.
* Plural variable symbols formula_5, formula_6, etc.

Full sentences are defined as

* If formula_1 is an &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate symbol, and formula_8 are singular variable symbols, then formula_9 is a sentence.
* If formula_10 is a sentence, then so is formula_11
* If formula_10 and formula_13 are sentences, then so is formula_14
* If formula_10 is a sentence and formula_3 is a singular variable symbol, then formula_17 is a sentence
* If formula_3 is a singular variable symbol and formula_6 is a plural variable symbol, then formula_20 is a sentence (where ≺ is usually interpreted as the relation &quot;is one of&quot;)
* If formula_10 is a sentence and formula_5 is a plural variable symbol, then formula_23 is a sentence

The last two lines are the only essentially new component to the syntax for plural logic. Other logical symbols definable in terms of these can be used freely as notational shorthands.

This logic turns out to be equi-interpretable with monadic second-order logic.

=== Model theory ===

Plural logic&#x27;s model theory/semantics is where the logic&#x27;s lack of sets is cashed out. A model is defined as a tuple formula_24 where formula_25 is the domain, formula_26 is a collection of valuations formula_27 for each predicate name formula_1 in the usual sense, and formula_29 is a Tarskian sequence (assignment of values to variables) in the usual sense (i.e. a map from singular variable symbols to elements of formula_25). The new component formula_31 is a binary relation relating values in the domain to plural variable symbols.

Satisfaction is given as

* formula_32 iff formula_33
* formula_34 iff formula_35
* formula_36 iff formula_37 and formula_38
* formula_39 iff there is an formula_40 such that formula_41
* formula_42 iff formula_43
* formula_44 iff there is an formula_45 such that formula_46

Where for singular variable symbols, formula_47 means that for all singular variable symbols formula_4 other than formula_3, it holds that formula_50, and for plural variable symbols, formula_51 means that for all plural variable symbols formula_6 other than formula_5, and for all objects of the domain formula_54, it holds that formula_55.

As in the syntax, only the last two are truly new in plural logic. Boolos observes that by using assignment &quot;relations&quot; formula_31, the domain does not have to include sets, and therefore plural logic achieves ontological innocence while still retaining the ability to talk about the extensions of a predicate. Thus, the plural logic comprehension schema formula_57 does not yield Russell&#x27;s paradox because the quantification of plural variables does not quantify over the domain. Another aspect of the logic as Boolos defines it, crucial to this bypassing of Russell&#x27;s paradox, is the fact that sentences of the form formula_58 are not well-formed: predicate names can only combine with singular variable symbols, not plural variable symbols.

This can be taken as the simplest, and most obvious argument that plural logic as Boolos defined it is ontologically innocent.

<text>Air raid shelters are structures for the protection of non-combatants as well as combatants against enemy attacks from the air. They are similar to bunkers in many regards, although they are not designed to defend against ground attack (but many have been used as defensive structures in such situations).

== History ==
=== Pre-WWII ===
Prior to World War II, in 1924, an Air Raid Precautions Committee was set up in the United Kingdom. For years, little progress was made with shelters because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the need to send the public underground for shelter and the need to keep them above ground for protection against gas attacks. In 1935, every city in the country was given a document to prepare air raid shelters. In February 1936 the Home Secretary appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack.

By November 1937, there had only been slow progress, because of a serious lack of data on which to base any design recommendations and the Committee proposed that the Home Office should have its own department for research into structural precautions, rather than relying on research work done by the Bombing Test Committee to support the development of bomb design and strategy. This proposal was eventually implemented in January 1939.

During the Munich crisis, local authorities dug trenches to provide shelter. After the crisis, the British Government decided to make these a permanent feature, with a standard design of precast concrete trench lining. Unfortunately these turned out to perform very poorly. They also decided to issue free to poorer households the Anderson shelter, and to provide steel props to create shelters in suitable basements.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, many types of structures were used as air raid shelters, such as cellars, (in Germany), basements, and underpasses. Bombing raids during World War I led the UK to build 80 specially adapted London Underground stations as shelters. However, during World War II, the government initially ruled out using these as shelters. After Londoners flooded into underground stations during The Blitz, the government reversed its policy. The UK began building street communal shelters as air raid shelters in 1940. Anderson shelters, designed in 1938 and built to hold up to six people, were in common use in the UK. Indoor shelters known as Morrison shelters were introduced as well.

Air raid shelters are still in use to some extent in various nations such as Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Singapore and Taiwan.

Air raid shelters were built to serve as protection against enemy air raids. Existing edifices designed for other functions, such as underground stations (tube or subway stations), tunnels, cellars in houses or basements in larger establishments and railway arches, above ground, were suitable for safeguarding people during air raids. A commonly used home shelter known as the Anderson shelter would be built in a garden and equipped with beds as a refuge from air raids.

== Types ==
=== Cellars ===
Cellars have always been much more important in Continental Europe than in the United Kingdom and especially in Germany almost all houses and apartment blocks have been and still are built with cellars. Air-raid precautions during World War II in Germany could be much more readily implemented by the authorities than was possible in the UK. All that was necessary was to ascertain that cellars were being prepared to accommodate all the residents of a building; that all the cellar hatch and window protections were in place; that access to the cellars was safe in the event of an air raid; that once inside, the occupants were secure for any incidents other than direct hits during the air raid and that means of escape was available.

The inadequacies of cellars and basements became apparent in the firestorms during the incendiary attacks on the larger German inner cities, especially Hamburg and Dresden. When burning buildings and apartment blocks above them collapsed in the raging winds (which could reach well over ), the occupants often became trapped in these basement shelters, which had also become overcrowded after the arrival of inhabitants from other buildings rendered unsafe in earlier attacks. Some occupants perished from heat stroke or carbon monoxide poisoning.

=== Hochbunker ===

 ( or blockhouses), were a type of construction designed to relieve the pressure Nazi German authorities were facing to accommodate additional numbers of the population in high-density housing areas, as well as pedestrians on the streets during air raids. In contrast to other shelters, these buildings were considered completely bomb-proof. They had the advantage of being built upward, which was much cheaper than downward excavation. usually consisted of large concrete blocks above ground with walls between thick and with huge lintels above doorways and openings. They often had a constant interior temperature of , which made them perfectly suitable for laboratories, both during and after the war. They were used to protect people, administrative centres, important archives and works of art.

Their structures took many forms: usually consisting of square blocks or of low, long rectangular or triangular shapes; straight towers of a square plan rising to great heights, or round tower-like edifices, even pyramidal constructions. Some of the circular towers contained helical floors that gradually curved their way upward within the circular walls. Many of these structures may still be seen. They have been converted into offices, storage space; some have even been adapted for hotels, hospitals and schools, as well as many other peacetime purposes. In Schöneberg, a block of flats was built over the Pallasstrasse air-raid shelter after World War II. During the Cold War, NATO used the shelter for food storage.

The cost of demolishing these edifices after the war would have been enormous, as the attempts at breaking up one of the six so-called Flak towers of Vienna proved. The attempted demolition caused no more than a crack in one of the walls of the tower, after which efforts were abandoned. Only the Zoo Tower in Berlin was successfully demolished.

One particular variant of the was the , named after its designer, Leo Winkel of Duisburg. Winkel patented his design in 1934, and from 1936 onward, Germany built 98 of five different types. The towers had a conical shape with walls that curved downward to a reinforced base. The dimensions of the towers varied. Diameters ranged between and the height between . The walls of the towers had a minimum thickness for reinforced concrete of and for ordinary concrete. The towers were able to shelter between 164 and 500 people, depending on the type. The intent with the and the other was to protect workers in rail yards and industrial areas. Because of their shape, the towers became known colloquially as &quot;cigar stubs&quot; or &quot;sugar beets&quot;.

The theory behind the was that the curved walls would deflect any bomb hitting the tower, directing it down towards the base. The towers had a small footprint, which was probably a greater protection. A US bomb did hit one tower in Bremen in October 1944; the bomb exploded through the roof, killing five people inside.

=== Israel ===
Miklat (, ) Is a type of air raid shelters found in Israel inside homes, near residential areas and in other places across the country.

These places are also called Merkhav Mugan (, ). They are reinforced security rooms required in all new buildings by Israeli law.

==== Types ====
* &quot;Miklat Tzibury&quot; (מקלט ציבורי) – , a partly underground facility, installed in residential areas. They are commonly used for community needs (clubs, education etc.). Maintained by the local governance and Home Front. They are located in streets and near public facilities.
* &quot;Miklat BeBayit Meshutaf&quot; (מקלט בבית משותף) – in a condominium, a facility built into a building which has been declared as a condominium (commonly in a low-rise building) it includes all the facilities that a public shelter has, but is maintained by the building residents.
* &quot;Merkhav Mugan Dirati&quot; (מרחב מוגן דירתי or ממ״ד) – installed in residential apartments and private houses.
* &quot;Merkhav Mugan Komati&quot; (מרחב מוגן קומתי or ממ״ק) – common floor space in apartment buildings in which there is no &quot;Merkhav Mugan Dirati&quot; in every apartment and in other multi-storey buildings (mostly offices and industry).
* &quot;Merkhav Mugan Mosadi&quot; (מרחב מוגן מוסדי or ממ״מ) – installed in every public structure.

===United Kingdom===
====Cellars====

Cellars in the UK, were mainly included only in larger houses, and in houses built up to the period of World War I, after which detached and semi-detached properties were constructed without cellars, usually to avoid the higher building costs entailed. Since house building had increased vastly between the wars, the lack of cellars in more recent housing became a major problem in the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) programmes in the UK during World War II.

Alternatives had to be found speedily once it became clear that Germany was contemplating air raids as a means of demoralising the population and disrupting supply lines in the UK. Initial recommendations were that householders should shelter under the stairs. Later, authorities supplied materials to households to construct communal street shelters and Morrison and Anderson shelters.

====Basements====
Basements also became available for the use of air raid shelters. Basements under factory premises, schools, hospitals, department stores and other businesses were utilised. However, these &quot;ad hoc&quot; shelters could bring additional dangers, as heavy machinery and materials or water storage facilities above the shelter, and insufficient support structures threatened to cause the collapse of basements.

When the Wilkinson&#x27;s Lemonade factory in North Shields received a direct hit on Saturday, 3 May 1941 during a German attack on the north-east coast of England, 107 occupants lost their lives when heavy machinery fell through the ceiling of the basement in which they were sheltering.

====Railway arches and subways (underpasses)====
British cities, prepared for use of railway arches and underpasses in 1935. And railway arches and subways were operationalized in the UK for air raid protection during World War II.

Railway arches were deep, curved structures of brick or concrete, set into the vertical sidewalls of railway lines, which had been intended originally for commercial depots, etc. The arches were covered usually with wooden or brick screen- or curtain walls, thus giving a considerable amount of protection against air raidsprovided, of course, that railway lines were not the prime target of the attack at the particular time and so being more likely to suffer from direct hits. Each arch could accommodate anything from around 60 to 150 people. However, fewer people could find shelter at night as sleeping areas for the occupants took up more of the space availablea limitation applying to any other type of shelter as well. Subways were actual thoroughfares also in the shape of arches, normally allowing passage underneath railway lines.

====London Underground stations====
Prior to the beginning of the war, shelter policy had been determined by John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal and, on the declaration of war, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. Anderson announced the policy to Parliament on 20 April 1939, based on a report from a committee chaired by Lord Hailey. This reaffirmed a policy of dispersal and eschewed the use of deep shelters, including the use of tube stations and underground tunnels as public shelters. Reasons given were the spread of disease due to the lack of toilet facilities at many stations, the inherent danger of people falling onto the lines, and that people sheltering in the stations and tunnels might be tempted to stay in them day and night because they would feel safer there than outside the stations.

None of these concerns had been borne out by experience during the bombing raids of the First World War, when eighty specially adapted tube stations had been pressed into use, but in a highly controversial decision in January 1924, Anderson, then chairman of the Air Raid Precautions Committee of Imperial Defence, had ruled out the tube station shelter option in any future conflict.

Following the intensive bombing of London on 7 September 1940 and the overnight raids of 7/8 September, there was considerable pressure to change the policy but, even following a review on 17 September, the government stood firm. On 19 September, William Mabane, parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Home Security, urged the public not to leave their Anderson shelters for public shelters, saying it deprived others of shelter. &quot;We&#x27;re going to improve the amenities in existing shelters&quot;, he promised. &quot;We&#x27;re setting about providing better lighting and better accommodation for sleeping and better sanitary arrangements.&quot; The Ministries of Home Security and Transport jointly issued an &quot;urgent appeal&quot;, telling the public &quot;to refrain from using Tube stations as air-raid shelters except in the case of urgent necessity&quot;.

Over the night of 19/20 September, thousands of Londoners took matters in their own hands. They had flocked to the Tubes for shelter, at some stations, they began to arrive as early as with bedding and bags of food to sustain them for the night. By the time the evening rush hour was in progress, they had already staked their &quot;pitches&quot; on the platforms. The Police did not intervene and some station managers, on their own initiative, provided additional toilet facilities. Transport Minister John Reith, and the chairman of London Transport, Lord Ashfield, inspected Holborn tube station to see for themselves.

The government realised that it could not contain this popular revolt. On 21 September, it abruptly changed policy, removing its objections to the use of tube stations. In what it called part of its &quot;deep shelter extension policy&quot;, it decided to close the short section of Piccadilly line from Holborn to Aldwych, and convert different sections for specific wartime use, including a public air raid shelter at Aldwych. Floodgates were installed at various points to protect the network should bombs breach the tunnels under the Thames, or large water mains in the vicinity of stations. Seventy-nine stations were fitted with bunks for 22,000 people, supplied with first aid facilities and equipped with chemical toilets. 124 canteens opened in all parts of the tube system. Shelter marshals were appointed, whose function it was to keep order, give first aid and assist in case of the flooding of the tunnels.
Businesses (for example Plessey Ltd) were allowed to use the Underground stations and unopened tunnels; government offices were installed in others and the anti-aircraft centre for London used a station as its headquarters. Tube stations and tunnels were still vulnerable to a direct hit and on 14 October 1940, a bomb penetrated the road and tunnel at Balham tube station, blew up the water mains and sewage pipes, and killed 66 people. At Bank station, a direct hit caused a crater of on 11 January 1941; the road above the station collapsed and killed 56 occupants. The highest death toll was caused by an incident at the unfinished Bethnal Green tube station on 8 March 1943, when 1,500 people entered the station. The crowd suddenly surged forward upon hearing the unfamiliar sound of a new type of anti-aircraft rocket being launched nearby. Someone stumbled on the stairs, and the crowd pushing on, were falling on top of one another, and 173 people were crushed to death in the disaster.

The London Underground system was considered one of the safest means of protecting relatively many people in a high-density area of the capital. An estimated 170,000 people sheltered in the tunnels and stations during the war. Although not a great number in comparison to the population of the capital, it almost certainly saved the lives of the people who probably would have had to find alternative, less secure means of protection. Artists and photographers such as Henry Moore and Bill Brandt were employed as war artists to document life in London&#x27;s shelters during the war.

====Other tunnels====
 
Many other types of tunnels were adapted for shelters to protect the civil population, and the military and administrative establishment in the UK during the war. Some had been built many years before, some had been part of an ancient defence system, and some had belonged to commercial enterprises, such as coal mining.

The Victoria tunnels at Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, completed as long ago as 1842, and used for transporting coal from the collieries to the river Tyne, had been closed in 1860 and remained so until 1939. In places the tunnels were deep, the tunnels, stretching in parts beneath the city of Newcastle, were converted to air raid shelters with a capacity for 9,000 people. Tunnels linked to landing stages built on the River Irwell in Manchester at the end of the nineteenth century were also used as air-raid shelters.

The medieval labyrinth of tunnels beneath Dover Castle had been built originally as part of the defensive system of the approaches to England, extended over the centuries and further excavated and reinforced during the world wars, until it was capable of accommodating large parts of the secret defence systems protecting the British Isles. On 26 May 1940, it became the headquarters under Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay of Operation Dynamo, from which the rescue and evacuation of up to 338,000 troops from France was directed.

In Stockport, south of Manchester, four sets of underground air raid shelter tunnels for civilian use were dug into the red sandstone on which the town centre stands. Preparation started in September 1938 and the first set of shelters was opened on 28 October 1939. (Stockport was not bombed until 11 October 1940.) The smallest of the tunnel shelters could accommodate 2,000 people and the largest 3,850 (subsequently expanded to take up to 6,500 people.) The largest of the Stockport Air Raid Shelters are open to the public as part of the town&#x27;s museum service.

In southeast London, residents made use of the Chislehurst Caves beneath Chislehurst, a network of caves which have existed since the Middle Ages for the mining of chalk and flint.

====Street communal shelter====

In the United Kingdom, it was being recognised early that public shelters in open spaces, especially near streets, were urgently needed for pedestrians, drivers and passengers in passing vehicles, etc. The programme of building street communal shelters commenced in March 1940, the government supplying the materials, and being the moving force behind the scheme, and private builders executing the work under the supervision of surveyors. These shelters consisted of brick walls and reinforced concrete roofs, similarly to, but much larger than, the private shelters in backyards and gardens being introduced slightly later. The communal shelters were usually intended to accommodate about fifty persons, and were divided into various sections by interior walls with openings connecting the different sections. Sections were normally furnished with six bunks.

The construction work then went on rapidly, until the resources of concrete and bricks began to be depleted due to the excessive demand placed on them so suddenly. Also, the performance of the early street shelters was a serious blow to public confidence. Their walls were shaken down either by earth shock or blast, and the concrete roofs then fell onto the helpless occupants, and this was there for all to see. At around the same time rumours of accidents started to circulate, such as on one occasion people being drowned due to a burst main filling up the shelter with water. Although much improved designs were being introduced whose performance had been demonstrated in explosion trials, communal shelters became highly unpopular, and shortly afterwards householders were being encouraged to build or have built private shelters on their properties, or within their houses, with materials being supplied by the government.

====Anderson shelter====
 
The Anderson shelter was designed in 1938 by William Paterson and Oscar Carl (Karl) Kerrison in response to a request from the Home Office. It was named after Sir John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal with special responsibility for preparing air-raid precautions immediately prior to the outbreak of World War II, and it was he who then initiated the development of the shelter. After evaluation by David Anderson, Bertram Lawrence Hurst, and Sir Henry Jupp, of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the design was released for production.

Anderson shelters were designed to accommodate up to six people. The main principle of protection was based on curved and straight galvanised corrugated steel panels. Six curved panels were bolted together at the top, so forming the main body of the shelter, three straight sheets on either side, and two more straight panels were fixed to each end, one containing the door—a total of fourteen panels. A small drainage sump was often incorporated in the floor to collect rainwater seeping into the shelter.

The shelters were high, wide, and long. When installed underground, they were buried deep in the soil and then covered with a minimum of of soil above the roof. When they were buried outside, the earth banks could be planted with vegetables and flowers, that at times could be quite an appealing sight and in this way would become the subject of competitions of the best-planted shelter among householders in the neighbourhood. The internal fitting out of the shelter was left to the owner and so there were wide variations in comfort.

Anderson shelters were issued free to all householders who earned less than £5 a week (equivalent to £ in , when adjusted for inflation). Those with a higher income were charged £7 (£ in ) for their shelter. One and a half million shelters of this type were distributed between February 1939 and the outbreak of war. During the war a further 2.1million were erected. Large numbers were manufactured at John Summers &amp; Sons ironworks at Shotton on Deeside with production peaking at 50,000 units per week.

The Anderson shelters performed well under blast and ground shock, because they had good connectivity and ductility, which meant that they could absorb a great deal of energy through plastic deformation without falling apart. (This was in marked contrast to other trench shelters which used concrete for the sides and roof, which were inherently unstable when disturbed by the effects of an explosionif the roof slab lifted, the walls fell in under the static earth pressure; if the walls were pushed in, the roof would be unsupported at one edge and would fall.) However, when the pattern of all-night alerts became established, it was realised that in winter Anderson shelters installed outside were cold damp holes in the ground and often flooded in wet weather, and so their occupancy factor would be poor. This led to the development of the indoor Morrison shelter.

At the end of the war in Europe, households who had received an Anderson shelter were expected to remove their shelters and local authorities began the task of reclaiming the corrugated iron. Householders who wished to keep their Anderson shelter (or more likely the valuable metal) could pay a nominal fee.

Because of the large number made and their robustness, many Anderson shelters still survive. Many were dug up after the war and converted into storage sheds for use in gardens and allotments.

==== Morrison shelter ====
The Morrison shelter, officially termed &quot;Table (Morrison) Indoor Shelter&quot;, had a cage-like construction beneath it. It was designed by John Baker and named after Herbert Morrison, the Minister of Home Security at the time. It was the result of the realisation that due to the lack of house cellars it was necessary to develop an effective type of indoor shelter.
The shelters came in assembly kits, to be bolted together inside the home. They were approximately long, wide and high, had a solid steel plate &quot;table&quot; top, welded wire mesh sides, and a metal lath &quot;mattress&quot;-type floor. Altogether it had 359 parts and had three tools supplied with the pack.

The shelter was provided free to households whose combined income was less than £400 per year (equivalent to £ in ).

Head of the Engineering Department at Cambridge University, Professor John Baker (later Lord Baker) presented an undergraduate lecture on the principles of design of the shelter as an introduction to his theory of plastic design of structures, which can be summarised as follows:
Half a million Morrison shelters had been distributed by the end of 1941, with a further 100,000 being added in 1943 to prepare the population for the expected German V-1 flying bomb (doodlebug) attacks.

In one examination of 44 severely damaged houses it was found that 3 people had been killed, 13 seriously injured, and 16 slightly injured out of a total of 136 people who had occupied Morrison shelters; thus 120 out of 136 escaped from severely bomb-damaged houses without serious injury. Furthermore, it was discovered that the fatalities had occurred in a house which had suffered a direct hit, and some of the severely injured were in shelters sited incorrectly within the houses.

In July 1950, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors made an award of £3,000 (£) to Baker for his design of the Morrison shelter.

====Scallywag bunkers====
Scallywag bunkers or Operational Base/OB were underground bunkers used by Auxiliary Units of the British Resistance against axis invasion of the United Kingdom. They were provided with elaborately-concealed underground Operational Bases (OB), usually built by the Royal Engineers in a local woodland, with a camouflaged entrance and emergency escape tunnel.

====Stanton shelters==== 


A segment shelter manufactured by the Stanton Ironworks, Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The shop producing spun-concrete lighting columns ceased production and turned over to concrete air-raid shelters, of which were manufactured, principally for the air ministry. Reinforced concrete proved an ideal material for air-raid shelters, being strong and resistant to shock with no deterioration with the passing of time. This type of segment shelter was of simple design and of low cost—any length of shelter could be built up from the pre-cast steel reinforced concrete segments.

The segments were wide; a pair of them formed an arch high and transverse struts were provided to ensure rigidity. These fitted into longitudinal bearers which were grooved to receive the foot of each segment. Each pair of segments was bolted together at the apex of the arch and each segment was also bolted to its neighbour, the joints being sealed with a bituminous compound. The convenient handling of these segments enabled them to be transported onto sites where close access by motor lorry was not possible. Partly buried in the ground, with a suitably screened entrance, this bolted shelter afforded safe protection against blast and splinters.

=== Other construction ===

Some air-raid shelters were constructed in residential building schemes in anticipation of the Second World War. There is a surviving example at St Leonard&#x27;s Court in East Sheen, southwest London.

Military air-raid shelters included blast pens at airfields for the security of aircrews and aircraft maintenance personnel away from the main airbase buildings.

Few shelters could survive a direct bomb-hit. The German authorities claimed that were totally bomb-proof, but none were targeted by any of the 41 Grand Slam earthquake bombs dropped by the RAF by the end of World War II. Two of these bombs were dropped on the Valentin submarine pens near Bremen and these barely penetrated of reinforced concrete, bringing down the roof.

More recently, the penetration by laser-guided &quot;smart bombs&quot; of the Amiriyah shelter during the 1991 Gulf War showed how vulnerable even reinforced concrete shelters are to direct hits from bunker-buster bombs. However, the air-raid shelters are built to protect the civilian population, so protection against a direct hit is of secondary value. The most important dangers are the blast and shrapnel.

== Air-raid shelters in modern times ==
Old air-raid shelters, such as the Anderson, can still be found in back gardens, in which they are commonly used as sheds, or (on a roof covered with earth) as vegetable patches.

Countries which have kept air-raid shelters intact and in ready condition include Switzerland, Spain and Finland.

===Switzerland===

Many Swiss houses and apartment blocks still have structurally reinforced, underground basements, often featuring a concrete door around thick. In more modern, post-war times, these shelters are often used as storage, with the footprint of the reinforced basement divided up into individual storage units according to the number of apartments in the house. The basement shelters are built to more stringent building codes, as the ceiling especially should protect shelter-seeking people from the house collapsing. Although most Swiss houses provide their own shelters, those that don&#x27;t are required by law to post directions to the nearest shelter.

===Spain===
Barcelona was severely bombed by Italian and German Air Forces during Spanish Civil War, particularly in 1937 and 1938. Tunnels were used as shelters at the same time that the population undertook the building of bomb shelters under the coordination of a committee for civil defense () providing planning and technical assistance. Hundreds of bomb shelters were built. Most of them are recorded, but only a few are well preserved. Among these stand out the refuge as well as air-shelter 307 (), today one of the Barcelona City History Museum heritage sites.

Other cities with extant bomb shelters from the Spanish Civil War include Madrid, Guadalajara, Alcalá de Henares, Santander, Jaén, Alcañiz, Alcoy, Valencia and Cartagena. During the war, Cartagena, an important naval base, was one of the main targets for Franco&#x27;s bombers. Cartagena suffered between 40 and 117 bombings (sources are mixed about the number of attacks). The most dramatic was one carried out by the German Condor Legion on 25 November 1936. The largest air raid shelter in Cartagena, which could accommodate up to 5,500 people, has been a museum since 2004.
===Israel===

The State of Israel required all buildings to have access to air-raid shelters from 1951, and all new flats possess access to Merkhav Mugan. All medical and educational facilities are prepared for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CRBN) attacks for example, each surgery room is built to withstand a direct missile hitsome are built with closed-cycle air systems and are capable of being resistant to chemical agents for short periods of time; in addition all must include chemical air filtering systems. The public air-raid shelters are commonly employed as game rooms in peacetime so that the children will be comfortable to enter them at a time of need, and will not be frightened.

===Finland===

The Ministry of Interior, responsible for civil defence in Finland, maintains hard shelters, capable of accommodating 3.6million persons, in cities and in other densely populated areas where two-thirds of the country&#x27;s population live. They are built to withstand the detonation of a 100-kilotonne-of-TNT (420 TJ) nuclear bomb at ground zero. In total Finland has over 45,000 civil defence shelters which can house 3.6million people (65% of the population). A shelter is designed to protect the population in the event of a threat of a possible gas or poison leak, armed attack such as war, radioactive fallout, or the like. Private homes rarely have them, but houses over are obliged to build them. Fire inspectors check the shelters every ten years and flaws have to be repaired or corrected as soon as possible. Shelters are often used as storage spaces but the law requires that inhabitants of apartment blocks must be able to clear the shelters and put them into action in less than 72 hours. Half of the air-raid shelter has to be ready to use in two hours. The types of shelters are:
* K, a small shelter for a small apartment house.
* S1, a usual shelter for apartment house.
* S3, lightweight shelter in solid rock or heavyweight shelter of ferroconcrete.
* S6, large shelters in solid rock that must be able to withstand a pressure wave.

All shelters must have:
* an electric and hand-operated air-conditioning system, which can protect from biological and chemical weapons and radioactive particles.
* a radiometer
* dry toilets
* a fixed-line telephone interface
* a spare exit
* water tanks
* a first aid kit

===Singapore===
Since 1998, Singapore has required all new houses and flats to have a shelter built to certain specifications. The Singapore Civil Defence Force rationalizes building such shelters in high-rise buildings by noting that weapon effects tend to be localized, and are unlikely to cause an entire building to collapse.

===Taiwan===
There are currently 117,669 air raid shelters in Taiwan. The first air raid shelters were constructed in the Japanese colonial period and construction expanded during WWII as allied bombers began hitting Taiwan.

===Greece===
During the pre-WW2 period the Metaxas regime initiated an extensive Civil Defence system designed to protect civilians in the event of enemy bombing. The system included extensive training of civilians as well as the construction of more than 12,000 air raid shelters in Attica, equipped with German made blast doors and air filtering systems. From 1939 forward virtually all new apartment buildings contained built-in hardened basements and cellars that functioned as (unofficial) bunkers, although these lacked the more sophisticated equipment of the state built shelters.

After the war, most of these shelters were either abandoned or demolished along with the apartment buildings they were built in. Public shelters were covered to make way for the modern street network. The last public inspection of the remaining shelters was performed in the 70s. Nowadays very few state built shelters remain intact, although hardened cellars still remain in the basements of most buildings in the older districts of Thessaloniki and Athens.

Notable surviving shelters include the Likavitos shelter, built inside the mountain of the same name, the Ministry of Finance bunker and the Piraeus bunkers in Athens, and the nuclear bunker under the Military Hospital no 414 in Thessaloniki.

===Ukraine===
The Kyiv Metro was built in the wake of World War II. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the metro stations doubled as bomb shelters, as residents took shelter from Russian bombs. Like other former Soviet metro systems, the Kyiv metro was designed with this purpose in mind, and 47 of the city&#x27;s 52 stations were designated for this purpose. During the invasion, on 24 February 2022, regular service on the metro was suspended.
A reduced schedule was adopted with limited services running between 8am and 7pm. All underground stations remain open 24 hours a day to provide shelter. According to Kyiv&#x27;s mayor Vitali Klitschko, on 2 March 2022, as many as 150,000 residents of Kyiv sought shelter in the Metro. Stations in the Kharkiv Metro were also used as shelters.

<text>Camille d&#x27;Hostun de la Baume, duc de Tallard (14 February 1652 – 20 March 1728) was a French nobleman, diplomat and military commander, who became a Marshal of France.

==Military career==
Tallard was granted a commission in the French army at the age of 15. He later served under the prince de Condé in the Netherlands, and from 1674, under Turenne in Alsace. He was promoted &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1678, and served in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697).

His friendship with King Louis XIV ensured a position of authority. After the war he served for two years as ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, where his exceptional knowledge of European political affairs proved highly valuable. When King James II died in September 1701, King Louis recognised James&#x27;s son as his successor to the throne of England. Consequently, King William III expelled Tallard from London in 1702.

Tallard&#x27;s military career reached its height during the War of the Spanish Succession. On 7 September 1703 the Duke of Burgundy and Tallard took the town of Breisach. Tallard proceeded to attack Landau in mid October. A relief force under the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) was roundly defeated by Tallard&#x27;s force at the Battle of Speyerbach on 15 November. As a result, Landau fell two days later. Shortly after, Tallard was created Marshal of France.

In 1704, Tallard was sent to reinforce Maximilian II Emanuel&#x27;s and Marshal Marsin&#x27;s Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube, which was under threat from the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s and Prince Eugene&#x27;s allied army. Tallard set out on 1 July from Strasbourg, but although the six day siege of Villingen proved abortive, (abandoned on 22 July), the French Marshal was able to bring 34,000 men through the Black Forest, reaching Ulm on 5 August.
Tallard was placed in overall command of the combined Franco-Bavarian army, but the subsequent Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704 resulted in complete destruction of his forces. Decisively beaten, he was captured and taken back to England and housed on parole in Chatsworth, Derbyshire and Newdigate House Nottingham. 
The writer Daniel Defoe reported that his &quot;small, but beautiful parterre, after the French fashion&quot; was one of the beauties of Nottingham.

During his stay in Britain, he is credited with introducing celery to English cuisine.

==Later life==
On his release in 1711 he returned to France. Despite the calamity of Blenheim, Louis appeared to bear the Marshal no ill will. Tallard was made a duke in 1712 and became a Peer of France in 1715. In King Louis XIV&#x27;s testament, Tallard was appointed to the Council of Regency but the duc d&#x27;Orléans had the testament nullified. He was elected president of the Académie des Sciences in 1724 and, in 1726, he became a French minister of state. He died in 1728.

==Family==
He married Marie-Catherine de Grolée de Viriville-La Tivolière and had one son;

# Marie &quot;Joseph&quot; d&#x27;Hostun de La Baume-Tallard, Duke of Hostun, Duke of Tallart, (b.1683 - ?) he married Marie Isabelle de Rohan, daughter of Hercule Mériadec, Duke of Rohan-Rohan and Anne Geneviève de Lévis, daughter of Madame de Ventadour. The couple had no children; Marie Isabelle was the Governess to the children of Louis XV from 1735-1754.

<text>The Olympic Oval in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, is North America&#x27;s first covered speed skating oval; it was built for the 1988 Winter Olympics and opened on September 27, 1987. Located on the University of Calgary campus, it is the official designated training centre for Speed Skating Canada and the Elite Athlete Pathway. This oval includes a hockey rink, a short track speed skating rink, a 400m long track rink and a 450 m running track.

==History==
The precursor for construction of a speed skating oval came with Calgary&#x27;s successful bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics in September 1980. Calgary&#x27;s bid originally envisioned a temporary outdoor speed skating oval constructed on the Calgary Stampede grounds for a mere million. After Calgary was awarded the Games, the University of Calgary commissioned a study to evaluate whether a covered speed skating facility would fit into the university&#x27;s expansion plan, the study was completed in June 1982 and found value in the proposal. The University of Calgary agreed to host the facility on the condition that the university would own the facility, no aspect of the construction would be paid for by the university, the design and construction was delegated to the university, and the facility would be designed to maximize public use.

In December 1983, the organizing committee, Olympiques Calgary Olympics &#x27;88 (OCO&#x27;88) was able to secure million in funding from the Government of Canada for the games which included million (indexed to inflation) for a covered speed skating facility, along with an additional million in project funding on the university campus. The University of Calgary competitive bid awarded Graham McCourt Architects the contract as prime consultant for the design of the Oval, with a contract that provided a fixed budget, with no cost overruns, and a completion date of April 1987.

The Olympic Oval was designed as the first covered speed skating oval in North America, and was the first at a Winter Olympics. This provided the unique challenge of designing a unique facility that had never been used in competition before. A competitive bid amongst 6 pre-qualified general contractors was run for the construction contract, and when tenders closed in February 1985 W. A. Stephenson Construction (Western) Ltd. was selected as the general contractor with a bid of million. Construction was controversial as labour unions expected the facility to be deemed a federally funded project under the &quot;Fair Wages Act&quot;, requiring wages for workers to be paid in accordance with the Act, while the university argued that the Oval was a university project and not subject to the Act.

Like the Olympic Saddledome, most of the Oval&#x27;s structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. Twenty eight beams were laid along the outside of the perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to hoist these 84 beams had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams.

Substantial completion of construction occurred in April 1987, officially opening on September 27, 1987, five months before the Olympics. The official opening included demonstrations of figure skating, short track speed skating, and a ribbon cutting ceremony by the Canadian National Speed Skating Teams. The Olympic Oval&#x27;s opening was witnessed by over 3,000 people, with Otto Jelinek, the Minister for Fitness and Amateur Sport hosting the ceremony, along with University President Norman Wagner, Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, and other speakers.

It was during the speed skating events of the Olympic Winter Games in 1988 that The Oval became known as &quot;The Fastest Ice in the World&quot; as world records were set in seven events (Men&#x27;s 500 m, 1500 m, 10,000 m, and Women&#x27;s 500 m, 1000 m, 3000 m, 5000 m), and Olympic records were set in the other three events (Men&#x27;s 1500 m, 5000 m, and Women&#x27;s 1500 m). The combination of the climate-controlled facility and the effects of high altitude have been credited for the fast ice surface.

In 1991, the Oval hosted Speed Skating for the 1991 Winter Deaflympics held in Banff.

Throughout the last 32 years, over 300 world records have been set at the Oval. By 2019, the Olympic Oval has produced (as a world class training facility) 32 Canadian Olympic medalists, including Ted-Jan Bloemen, who won a silver in the men&#x27;s 5000m and a gold in the men&#x27;s 10,000m at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in 2018.

==Training facility==
Along with the 400m long-track ice, the Olympic Oval also includes two international-sized ice rinks for short track speed skating and ice hockey, a 450m running track surrounding the main oval, and an eight-lane 110m sprint track for year-round athletics training. At present, hundreds of Canadian athletes are training at the Oval year round.

Saskatoon-native Catriona Le May Doan, who won the gold medal in speed skating at the 1998 Winter Olympics and in the 2002 Winter Olympics, began training at the Oval soon after its construction.
The Oval continues to be regarded as a premier speed skating venue, and a preferred training facility for speed skating teams across the globe.

==Other activities==
When not hosting hockey games and speed skating competitions, the Olympic Oval is Calgary&#x27;s premier public skating facility. During the ice-out months of April and May, the Oval hosts the Judo and Taekwondo Canadian National Championships, and major volleyball, gymnastics, floor hockey, running, and billiards events. In addition, the Oval hosts major car shows, science fairs, expos, robotics shows, science and engineering events, major film and television shoots, fundraisers, the RBC training ground and University of Calgary events.

<doc id="444821" wikidata="Q5326286" url="?curid=444821" title="Earl of Haddington">
<text>Earl of Haddington is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1627 for the noted Scottish lawyer and judge Thomas Hamilton, 1st Earl of Melrose. He was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1616 to 1625. Hamilton had already been created Lord Binning in 1613 and Lord Binning and Byres, in the County of Haddington, and Earl of Melrose, in the County of Roxburgh, in 1619. These titles were also in the Peerage of Scotland. The title of the earldom derived from the fact that he was in possession of much of the lands of the former Melrose Abbey. However, Hamilton was unhappy with this title and wished to replace it with &quot;Haddington&quot; (a title which was then held by John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness and 1st Viscount of Haddington, but on whose death in 1626 both peerages became extinct). In 1627 he relinquished the earldom of Melrose and was instead created Earl of Haddington, with the precedence of 1619 and with limitation to his heirs male bearing the surname of Hamilton. This derived from the fact that he considered it a greater honour to take his title from a county rather than from an abbey. Hamilton was a member of the prominent Scottish family of that name and descended from John de Hamilton, younger son of Walter de Hamilton (or Walter Fitzgilbert), who was granted the feudal barony of Cadzow and who is also the ancestor of the Dukes of Hamilton and Dukes of Abercorn.

Lord Haddington was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a staunch Covenanter. Haddington served as Governor of the Castle of Dunglass, and was killed by a massive explosion there in 1640. His eldest son, the third Earl, died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fifth Earl. He married Margaret Leslie, 8th Countess of Rothes (died 1700), daughter of the noted statesman John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes, who had received a re-grant of the earldom of Rothes in 1663 which allowed it to be passed on to his daughter (see the Earl of Rothes for earlier history of this title). According to the regrant of 1663, the earldom of Rothes was not allowed to be united with the earldom of Haddington. The couple were therefore in 1689 granted a patent of the marriage contract, which stated that the earldom of Rothes should descend to their eldest son, John, while the earldom of Haddington should be inherited by their second son, Thomas. According to this patent Lady Rothes was succeeded by her eldest son John, the ninth Earl (who assumed the surname of Leslie; see the Earl of Rothes for further history of this branch of the family).

Lord Haddington was succeeded accordingly by his second son Thomas, the sixth Earl. He obtained a new charter of the earldom. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1716 to 1735 and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1716 to 1735. He was also appointed Hereditary Keeper of Holyrood Palace. His eldest son Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning, married Rachel (died 1773), daughter of George Baillie, of Mellerstain House and Jerviswood. Through this marriage Mellerstein House and the Jerviswood estate came into the Hamilton family. Lord Binning predeceased his father. Lord Haddington was therefore succeeded by his grandson, Thomas the seventh Earl (the eldest son of Lord Binning), who married Mary Lloyd, née Holt (great-niece of Sir John Holt, Lord Chief Justice 1689-1709). On his death the titles passed to his son Charles, the eighth Earl. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1807 to 1812 and Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1804 to 1823. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl. He was a Tory politician and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1834 to 1835 and as First Lord of the Admiralty (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1841 to 1846. In 1827, one year before he succeeded his father in the earldom, he was created Baron Melros, of Tyninghame in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Lord Haddington resigned the office of Hereditary Keeper of Holyrood Park in 1843 for a compensation fee of £40,000. He was childless and on his death in 1859 the barony of Melros became extinct.

The ninth Earl was succeeded in the Scottish titles by his second cousin, the tenth Earl. He was the son of George Baillie of Jerviswood (who had assumed the surname of Baillie in lieu of Hamilton), son of George Hamilton, younger brother of the seventh Earl. He assumed in 1859 by Royal licence the additional surname of Hamilton to that of Baillie. Lord Haddington was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1859 to 1870 and served as a government whip in the 1866–1868 Conservative administration. On his death the titles passed to his son, the eleventh Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1876 to 1917. In 1858 Haddington assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Arden after that of Baillie-Hamilton. His eldest son George Baillie-Hamilton, Lord Binning (1856–1917), was a brigadier-general in the army. However, he predeceased his father. Lord Haddington was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the twelfth Earl. He was the son of Lord Binning. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1922 to 1963 (when all Scottish peers were granted the right to sit in the House of Lords) and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Berwickshire from 1952 to 1969. He was succeeded by his only son, the thirteenth Earl (1941–2016), in 1986. the titles are held by his only son, the fourteenth Earl, who succeeded in 2016.

Several other members of the Baillie-Hamilton family have also gained distinction. George Baillie, son of George Hamilton, younger brother of the seventh Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Berwickshire. He was the father of (apart from the tenth Earl) 1) the politician and judge Charles Baillie, Lord Jerviswoode, and 2) Reverend John Baillie (1810–1888), Canon Residentiary of York, who the great-grandfather of John Robert Edward Baillie, a Brigadier in the Royal Engineers. The Venerable Charles Baillie-Hamilton (1764–1820), son of George Hamilton, younger brother of the seventh Earl, was Archdeacon of Cleveland. He was the father of Charles John Baillie-Hamilton (1800–1865), a Member of Parliament, and William Alexander Baillie-Hamilton (1803–1881), an admiral in the Royal Navy.

The family seat now is Mellerstain House, near Kelso, Berwickshire. The former family seat was Tyninghame House, near Tyninghame, East Lothian.

<doc id="444835" wikidata="Q184172" url="?curid=444835" title="French franc">
<text>The franc (; , ; sign: F or Fr), also commonly distinguished as the (FF), was a currency of France. Between 1360 and 1641, it was the name of coins worth 1 livre tournois and it remained in common parlance as a term for this amount of money. It was reintroduced (in decimal form) in 1795. After two centuries of inflation, it was redenominated in 1960, with each (NF) being worth 100 old francs. The NF designation was continued for a few years before the currency returned to being simply the franc. Many French residents, though, continued to quote prices of especially expensive items in terms of the old franc (equivalent to the new centime), up to and even after the introduction of the euro (for coins and banknotes) in 2002. The French franc was a commonly held international reserve currency of reference in the 19th and 20th centuries. Between 1998 and 2002, the conversion of francs to euros was carried out at a rate of 6.55957 francs to 1 euro.

==History==
The French Franc traces its origins to the Carolingian monetary system of the 8th century AD, and more specifically to the Livre Tournois, an offshoot of the same system which emerged in the 13th century. Here is a table of changes to the value of the Livre Parisis and the Livre Tournois in terms of silver or gold until the French Franc was introduced in 1795.

=== Carolingian, 781 ===

Emperor Charlemagne&#x27;s monetary system was introduced in 781 AD to the Frankish Carolingian Empire and spread over the centuries to much of Western Europe, with a Livre (pound) of silver divided into 20 Sols or Sous (shillings) and the Sol divided into 12 Deniers (penny). Only the denier existed as a coin for the next 500 years, with the sou and livre functioning as accounting multiples of the denier. The first livre and denier weighed 407.92 g and 1.7 g, respectively, of the finest silver available.

=== Capetian, c. 1000 ===
Livres and deniers issued under the Capetian dynasty contained 305.94 g and 1.27475 g fine silver, respectively. The French Mark of 8 ounces was a unit of weight equal to 244.752 grams, and equal in weight to 192 deniers or 16 sols of this period.

In subsequent centuries the French kings would struggle to implement fixed standards for the livre over a decentralized realm of Frankish feudal rulers, many of whom claimed the right to issue currency within their own domains, and often resorting to currency debasements in moments of stringency. While monetary values as proclaimed by French kings would eventually be identified as the Livre Parisis, other regions almost always got by with currencies of lower standard. One such currency, the Livre Tournois, would eventually become the preferred accounting system under a more centralized French kingdom.

===Louis IX, 1266===

The emergence of the Livre Tournois as France&#x27;s preferred accounting system occurred during the reign of King Louis IX with the issuance of the silver Gros tournois with 58 issued to a French Mark of silver of fineness (hence 4.044 g fine silver in a gros), and valued at 1 sol (12 deniers) in France&#x27;s Touraine region though valued less than 1 sol Parisis. The new coin&#x27;s reputation and handling convenience versus those of debased deniers assured the adoption of the gros tournois to the rest of Western Europe.

===Late Capetian, 1317===
Towards the reign of King Philip IV le Bel came pressures to further debase the denier, which occurred in 1317 when the Gros Tournois was raised to 15 deniers &quot;Tournois&quot; or 12 deniers (1 sol) &quot;Parisis&quot;, thus commencing the fixed parity of 4 &quot;deniers Parisis&quot; to 5 &quot;deniers Tournois&quot;. While French kings would continue to prescribe coin values in multiples of 4 and 12 deniers Parisis until the end of the 15th century, the rest of France would gradually choose to recognize their increased values in multiples of 5 and 15 deniers Tournois.

===Hundred Years&#x27; War, 1361===
The start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War against England in 1337 would increase the pressure to further debase the French livre. An attempt in 1343 to reverse earlier depreciations of circulating deniers and reinstate the old 1317-era gros tournois (forte monnaie, or strong money) caused financial havoc especially with borrowers who received depreciated coins and who then had to repay debts in forte monnaie. Lower valuations for the livre had to be accepted subsequently as the war raged on.

In 1361 the gros tournois of 15 deniers Tournois (1 sol Parisis) was minted at 84 to a French Mark of silver, 23/24 fine (hence, 2.79 g fine silver in a gros). At the same time gold flowing from Southern Europe started to become an important medium of exchange in the North, so gold francs worth 1 livre Tournois (16 sols Parisis) were minted at 63 to a French Mark of fine gold (hence, 3.885 g in a franc). Gold as circulating currency would henceforth continue in the form of Écu d&#x27;ors of varying gold content.

The gold franc worth one livre tournois was introduced in 1360 to pay the ransom of King John II of France. This coin secured the king&#x27;s freedom and showed him on a richly decorated horse earning it the name &quot;franc à cheval&quot; (meaning &quot;free on horse&quot; in French). The obverse legend, like other French coins, gives the king&#x27;s title as &quot;Francorum Rex&quot; (&quot;King of the Franks&quot; in Latin) and provides another reason to call the coin a franc. John&#x27;s son, Charles V, continued this type. It was copied exactly at Brabant and Cambrai and, with the arms on the horse cloth changed, at Flanders. Conquests led by Joan of Arc allowed Charles VII to return to sound coinage and he revived the &quot;franc à cheval&quot;. John II, however, was not able to strike enough francs to pay his ransom and he voluntarily returned to English captivity.

John II died as a prisoner in England and his son Charles V was left to pick up the pieces. Charles V pursued a policy of reform, including stable coinage. An edict dated 20 April 1365 established the centrepiece of this policy, a gold coin officially called the &quot;denier d&#x27;or aux fleurs de lis&quot; which had a standing figure of the king on its obverse, pictured under a canopy. Its value in money of account was one livre tournois, just like the &quot;franc à cheval&quot;, and this coin is universally known as a &quot;franc à pied&quot;. In accordance with the theories of the mathematician, economist and royal advisor Nicole Oresme, Charles struck fewer coins of better quality gold than his ancestors. In the accompanying deflation, both prices and wages fell, but wages fell faster and debtors had to settle up in better money than they had borrowed. The Mayor of Paris, Étienne Marcel, exploited their discontent to lead the Jacquerie revolt which forced Charles V out of the city. The franc fared better. It became associated with money stable at one livre tournois.

===Lancastrian War, 1425===
A certain degree of peace achieved at the start of the 15th century helped settle the value of French currency. After 1422 the gros of 1 sol Parisis was minted at 96 to a French Mark, fine (hence 1.912 g per gros), while the Écu of 20 sols Parisis was minted at 64 to a French Mark, karats or fine (hence 3.585 g per écu). The gros and the écu compared favourably with England&#x27;s 2-pence coin of 1.8 g silver and 40-pence (th of a pound) half-noble coin of 3.48 g gold, resulting in an approximate exchange rate of 1 pound sterling to six Livres Parisis.
Peace in the Burgundian Netherlands after the 1420s also resulted in the 1434 realignment of the Flemish monetary system with the French livre. The new Flemish Guilder (Pound) of 20 Stuiver (shilling) contained 32.6 g fine silver and was approximately par with the Livre Parisis of 20 sols (38.24 g). Such parities between the French livres to the Flemish and English currencies would persist up to the 1560s and would facilitate the issue of identical coin denominations across these countries.

===Louis XI, 1475===

The Great Bullion Famine of the mid-15th century resulted in yet another debasement during the reign of King Louis XI, with the &quot;Livre Parisis&quot; reduced to 1 French ounce (30.594 g) fine silver or 2.620 g fine gold. The silver gros was minted at 69 to the French Mark, fine (3.4 g fine silver) and was valued at th the Livre Parisis (or sols). The gold écu au soleil was minted at 72 to the Mark, karats fine (3.2754 g fine gold), and was valued at 25 Sols Parisis. The close of the 15th century saw the beginnings of a more centralized French currency system and the discontinuation of competing currency systems within France.

The Livre Parisis of 1 French ounce approximately matched the silver content of th pound sterling (1 troy ounce of sterling silver). It would also become the model for Germany when it started issuing the 1-ounce silver Guldengroschen divided into 21 Groschen (gros, shillings) or 252 Pfennige (pence).

===Valois-Angoulême, 1549===
A considerable acceleration in the debasement of the French, English and Dutch currencies occurred during the reign of the Valois-Angoulême kings in the 16th century amidst the huge influx of precious metals from the American continent arriving through the Habsburg Netherlands. The loose enforcement of monetary standards in the Dutch provinces resulted in a significant rd reduction in the value of the French livre by 1549, with debasements continuing into the 17th century.

The French ounce (30.594 g) of fine silver was raised in value from 1 to Livre Parisis (or from 25 to sols Tournois). The écu au soleil of 3.2754 g fine gold was raised in value from 25 to sols Parisis (or to approximately 47 sols Tournois). This 50% advance was also seen in England in 1551 when it raised its troy ounce of sterling silver from 40 to 60 pence, and in the 17th century when Germany raised its one-ounce silver Thaler from 1 to silver gulden.

The 16th century saw the issuance of larger silver coins, first in testoons (9 g fine silver, valued at 11 sols Tournois in 1549), and later on in silver francs (12.3 g fine silver, valued at 1 Livre Tournois in 1577). These French coins, however, were much less popular than the 1-ounce silver coins coming out of Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, leading to the 1641 currency reform under King Louis XIII.

Henry III exploited the association of the franc as sound money worth one livre tournois when he sought to stabilize French currency in 1577. By this time, inflows of gold and silver from Spanish America had caused inflation throughout the world economy and the kings of France, who weren&#x27;t getting much of this wealth, only made things worse by manipulating the values assigned to their coins. The States General which met at Blois in 1577 added to the public pressure to stop currency manipulation. Henry III agreed to do this and he revived the franc, now as a silver coin valued at one livre tournois. This coin and its fractions circulated until 1641 when Louis XIII of France replaced it with the silver écu. Nevertheless, the name &quot;franc&quot; continued in accounting as a synonym for the &quot;livre tournois&quot;.

===Louis XIII, 1641===
In the 17th century King Louis XIII abolished its unpopular coinage of francs and ecus in favour of Spanish-modelled coins. It also abolished the Livre Parisis system in favour of exclusive use of the Livre Tournois. The Spanish dollar was the model for the Louis d&#x27;Argent – 9 to a French Mark (244.752 g) of silver, fine (hence 24.93 g fine silver), and valued at 3 livres tournois. The Spanish doubloon or two-escudo coin was the model for the Louis d&#x27;Or – to a French Mark of gold, fine (hence 6.189 g fine gold), and valued at 10 livres.

===Louis XV, 1726===
France entered another turbulent period during the War of the Spanish Succession from 1701 to 1714, resulting in another debasement of the livre tournois. Under King Louis XV&#x27;s reign in 1726 the silver Écu d&#x27;Argent was issued at 8.3 to a Mark of silver, 11/12 fine (hence 27.03 g fine silver), and valued at 6 livres. A new gold Louis d&#x27;Or was also issued at 30 to a Mark of gold, 11/12 fine (hence 7.4785 g fine gold), and valued at 24 livres.

===Louis XVI, 1785===
The rise in the value of gold at the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and elsewhere as well as King Louis XVI&#x27;s reign led to the rise in the Gold-Silver Ratio to 15.5, resulting in the reduction in the gold content of the 24-livre Louis d&#x27;Or from 1/30th to 1/32nd of a Mark, 11/12 fine. While the silver standard remained unchanged, assays of the period indicate that coins contained approximately 1.5% less bullion than officially specified. The 1795 swapping of livres to francs at the rate of 1.0125 livres = 1 franc suggest that the 6-livre ecu contained 26.67 g fine silver while the reduced 24-livre Louis contained 6.88 g fine gold.

The livre tournois was swapped in 1795 for the French Franc (or franc germinal), worth 4.5 g silver or g = 0.29032 g gold (ratio 15.5), at a rate of 1 franc = livres or 1 livre, 3 deniers.

=== French Revolution ===


The decimal &quot;franc&quot; was established as the national currency by the National Convention of Revolutionary France in 1795 as a decimal unit (1 franc = 10 décimes = 100 centimes) of 4.5 g of fine silver. This was slightly less than the livre of 4.505 g, but the franc was set in 1796 at 1.0125 livres (1 livre, 3 deniers), reflecting in part the past minting of sub-standard coins. Silver coins now had their denomination clearly marked as &quot;5 FRANCS&quot; and it was made obligatory to quote prices in francs. This ended the ancien régime&#x27;s practice of striking coins with no stated denomination, such as the Louis d&#x27;or, and periodically issuing royal edicts to manipulate their value in terms of money of account, i.e. the Livre tournois. The franc became the official currency of France in 1799.

Coinage with explicit denominations in decimal fractions of the franc also began in 1795. Decimalization of the franc was mandated by an act of 7 April 1795, which also dealt with the decimalization of weights and measures. France led the world in adopting the metric system and it was the second country to convert from a non-decimal to a decimal currency, following Russia&#x27;s conversion in 1704, and the third country to adopt a decimal coinage, also following the United States in 1787. France&#x27;s first decimal coinage used allegorical figures symbolizing revolutionary principles, like the coinage designs the United States had adopted in 1793.

The circulation of this metallic currency declined during the Republic: the old gold and silver coins were taken out of circulation and exchanged for printed assignats, initially issued as bonds backed by the value of the confiscated goods of churches, but later declared as legal tender currency. The withdrawn gold and silver coins were used to finance the French Revolutionary Wars and to import food, which was in short supply.

As during the &quot;Mississippi Bubble&quot; in 1715–1720, too many assignats were put in circulation, exceeding the value of the &quot;national properties&quot;, and the coins, due also to military requisitioning and hoarding, rarefied to pay foreign suppliers. With national government debt remaining unpaid, and a shortage of silver and brass to mint coins, confidence in the new currency declined, leading to hyperinflation, more food riots, severe political instability and termination of the First French Republic and the political fall of the French Convention. Then followed the economic failure of the Directoire: coins were still very rare. After a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that led to the Consulate, the First Consul progressively acquired sole legislative power at the expense of the other unstable and discredited consultative and legislative institutions.

=== French Empire and Restoration ===

In 1800 the Banque de France, a federal establishment with a private board of executives, was created and commissioned to produce the national currency. In 1803, the &quot;Franc germinal&quot; (named after the month Germinal in the revolutionary calendar) was established, creating a gold franc containing 290.034 mg of fine gold. From this point, gold and silver-based units circulated interchangeably on the basis of a 1:15.5 ratio between the values of the two metals (bimetallism) until 1864, when all silver coins except the 5-franc piece were debased from 90% to 83.5% silver without the weights changing.
This coinage included the first modern gold coins with denominations in francs. It abandoned the revolutionary symbols of the coinage 1795, now showing Napoleon in the manner of Roman emperors, first described as &quot;Bonaparte Premier Consul&quot; and with the country named as &quot;République Française&quot;. After his coronation in 1804 coins changed the obverse legend to &quot;Napoleon Empereur&quot;, dropping his family name in the manner of regnal names. In 1807, the reverse legend changed to name France as &quot;Empire Français&quot;. In analogy with the old Louis d&#x27;or these coins were called Gold Napoleons. Economically, this sound money was a great success and Napoleon&#x27;s fall did not change that. Succeeding governments maintained Napoleon&#x27;s weight standard, with changes in design which traced the political history of France. In particular, this currency system was retained during the Bourbon Restoration and perpetuated until 1914.

===Latin Monetary Union===
France was a founding member of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), a single currency employed primarily by the Romance-speaking and other Mediterranean states between 1865 and the First World War. The common currency was based on the franc germinal, with the name franc already being used in Switzerland and Belgium, whilst other countries minted local denominations, redeemable across the bloc with 1-to-1 parity, though with local names: e.g., the peseta. In 1873, the LMU went over to a purely gold standard of 1 franc = 0.290322581 grams of gold.

===World War I===
The outbreak of World War I caused France to leave the gold standard of the LMU. The war severely undermined the franc&#x27;s strength: war expenditure, inflation and postwar reconstruction, financed partly by printing ever more money, reduced the franc&#x27;s purchasing power by 70% between 1915 and 1920. After a brief appreciation of the franc during the Depression of 1920–1921, it depreciated a further 43% between 1922 and a balancing of the budget in 1926. This devaluation was aggravated by the insistence of the Republican U.S. federal government and World War Foreign Debts Commission that France&#x27;s war debts be repaid within 25 years at a minimal 4.25 percent interest per year. The currency devaluation contributed to French demands for high reparations payments from Germany. After a brief return to the gold standard between 1928 and 1936, the currency was allowed to resume its slide, until in 1959 it was worth less than 2.5% of its 1934 value.

=== World War II ===

During the Nazi occupation of France (1940–44), the franc was a satellite currency of the German Reichsmark. The exchange rate was 20 francs for 1 RM. The coins were changed, with the words &quot;Travail, famille, patrie&quot; (Work, Family, Fatherland) replacing the Republican triad &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot; (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity), with the emblem of the Vichy regime added.

After the Liberation, the US attempted to impose the use of the US occupation franc, which was averted by General De Gaulle.

===Post-War period===
After World War II, France devalued its currency within the Bretton Woods system on several occasions. Beginning in 1945 at a rate of 480 francs to the British Pound (119.1 to the U.S. dollar), by 1949 the rate was 980 to the Pound (350 to the Dollar). This was reduced further in 1957 and 1958, reaching 1382.3 to the Pound (493.7 to the Dollar, equivalent to 1 franc = 1.8 mg pure gold).
===New franc=== 

In January 1960 the French franc was revalued, with 100 existing francs making one &quot;nouveau franc&quot;. 
The abbreviation &quot;NF&quot; was used on the 1958 design banknotes until 1963. Old one- and two-franc coins continued to circulate as new centimes (no new centimes were minted for the first two years). The one-centime coin never circulated widely. 
Inflation continued to erode the franc&#x27;s value: between 1950 and 1960, price levels increased 72 per cent (5.7% per year on average); between 1960 and 1970, it increased 51 per cent (4.2%). 
Only one further major devaluation occurred (11% in August 1969) before the Bretton Woods system was replaced by free-floating exchange rates. When the Euro replaced the franc on 1 January 1999, the franc was worth less than an eighth of its original 1960 purchasing power.

After revaluation and the introduction of the new franc, many French people continued to use the term &quot;old francs&quot; (&quot;anciens francs&quot;) for large sums, for example for the prices of houses, apartments, and cars. This was common until the introduction of the euro and even later. Many people, old and young – even those who had never used the old franc – still quoted prices in old francs, confusing tourists and people abroad. For example, lottery prizes were most often advertised in amounts of centimes, equivalent to the old franc, to inflate the perceived value of the prizes at stake. Multiples of 10NF were occasionally referred to as &quot;mille francs&quot; (thousand francs) or &quot;mille balles&quot; (&quot;balle&quot; being a slang word for franc) in contexts where it was clear that the speaker did not mean 1,000 new francs. 
The expression &quot;heavy franc&quot; (&quot;franc lourd&quot;) was also commonly used to designate the new franc.

All franc coins and banknotes ceased to be legal tender in January 2002, upon the official adoption of the Euro.

===Economic and Monetary Union===
From 1 January 1999, the value exchange rate of the French franc against the Euro was set at a fixed parity of €1 = 6.55957 F. Euro coins and notes replaced the franc entirely between 1 January and 1 March 2002.

==Coins==

===Before World War I===
In August 1795, the Monetary Law replaced the &quot;livre&quot; (&quot;pound&quot;) with the &quot;franc&quot;, which was divided into 10 &quot;décimes&quot; (&quot;tenths&quot;) and 100 &quot;centimes&quot; (&quot;hundredths&quot;). Copper coins were issued in the denominations of 1 centime, 5 centimes, 1 décime, and 2 décimes, designed by Augustin Dupré. After 1801, French copper coins became rare.

The 5-centime copper coin was called a &quot;sou&quot;, referring to &quot;sole&quot; (fr. Latin: &quot;solidus&quot;), until the 1920s.

An Imperial 10-décime coin was produced in billon from 1807 to 1810.

During the Consulship period (1799–1804) silver francs were struck in decimal coinage. A five-franc coin was first introduced in 1801–02 (L&#x27;AN 10), half-franc, one-franc, and gold 40-franc coins were introduced in 1802–03 (L&#x27;AN 11), and quarter-franc and two-franc coins in 1803–04 (L&#x27;AN 12).

The 5-franc silver coin was called an &quot;écu&quot;, after the six-livre silver coin of the &quot;ancien regime&quot;, until the 1880s.

Copper coins were rarely issued between 1801 and 1848, so the quarter franc was the lowest current denomination in circulation. But during this period, copper coins from earlier periods circulated. A Napoleon 5-centime coin (in bell metal) and Napoleon and Restoration 1-décime coins were minted.

Most pre-decimal silver was removed from circulation by 1834. Until they were also demonetized in 1845, 15- and 30-sou coins from 1791-1793 continued to circulate with a value of 0.75 and 1.50 francs, and 18th-century billon coins that had come to be known as “pièces de 6 liards” (originally issued with various values) were valued at 7.5 centimes.

A new bronze coinage was introduced from 1848. The Second Republic Monetary Authority minted a 1-centime copper coin with a 1795 design. 2, 5 and 10-centime coins were issued from 1853. The quarter franc was discontinued, with silver 20-centime coins issued between 1849 and 1868 as the smallest silver coin produced in France.

The gold coinage also changed. 40-franc coins were last struck in 1839 (with just 23 coins minted). Several new denomination were introduced as gold coinage: 5 gold francs (1856), 10 gold francs (1850), 50 gold francs (1855), and 100 gold francs (1855). A second design for the 100 gold franc coin was released in 1878 depicting standing genius writing the constitution. The pictured example (1889) was issued as a proof and only 100 coins were struck.
The last gold 5-franc pieces were minted in 1869, and silver 5-franc coins were last minted in 1878. After 1815, the 20-franc gold coin was called a &quot;napoléon&quot; (royalists still called this coin a &quot;louis&quot;), and so that is the colloquial term for this coin until the present. During the Belle Époque, the 100-franc gold coin was called a &quot;monaco&quot;, referring to the flourishing casino business in Monte Carlo.

Nickel 25-centime coins were introduced in 1903.

===World War I===
World War I and the aftermath brought substantial changes to the coinage. Gold coinage was suspended and the franc was debased. Smaller, holed 5, 10, and 25-centime coins minted in nickel or cupro-nickel were introduced in 1914, finally replacing copper in 1921. In 1920, 1 and 2-centime coins were discontinued and production of silver coinage ceased, with aluminium-bronze 50-centime, 1-franc, and 2-franc coins introduced. Until 1929, these coins were issued by the chambers of commerce, bearing the phrase &quot;bon pour&quot; on it (meaning: &quot;good for&quot;). At the beginning of the 1920s, chambers of commerce also issued small change coins in aluminium. In 1929, the original &quot;franc germinal&quot; of 1795 was replaced by the &quot;franc Poincaré&quot;, which was valued at 20% of the 1803 gold standard.

In 1929, silver coins were reintroduced in 10-franc and 20-franc denominations. A very rare gold 100-franc coin was minted between 1929 and 1936.

In 1933, a nickel 5-franc coin was minted, but was soon replaced by a large aluminium-bronze 5-franc coin.

===From World War II to the currency reform===
The events of the Second World War also affected the coinage substantially. In 1941, aluminium replaced aluminium-bronze in the 50 centimes, and 1, 2, and 5 francs as copper and nickel were diverted into the War Effort. In 1942, following German occupation and the installation of the French Vichy State, a new, short lived series of coins was released which included holed 10 and 20 centimes in zinc. 50 centimes, and 1 and 2 francs were aluminium. In 1944 this series was discontinued and withdrawn and the previous issue was resumed.

Following the war, rapid inflation caused denominations below 1 franc to be withdrawn from circulation while 10 francs in copper nickel were introduced, followed by reduced size 10-franc coins in aluminium-bronze in 1950, along with 20 and 50-franc coins of the same composition. In 1954, copper-nickel 100 francs were introduced.

In the 1960s, 1 and 2 (old) franc aluminium coins were still circulating, used as &quot;centimes&quot;.


===New franc===
In 1960, the new franc (&quot;&quot;) was introduced, worth 100 old francs. Stainless steel 1 and 5 centimes, aluminium-bronze 10, 20, and 50 centimes, nickel 1 franc and silver 5 francs were introduced. Silver 10-franc coins were introduced in 1965, followed by a new, smaller aluminium-bronze 5-centime and a smaller nickel -franc coin in 1966.

A first attempt to introduce a nickel 2-franc coin in 1960 failed.

Nickel-clad copper-nickel 5-franc and nickel-brass 10-franc coins replaced their silver counterparts in 1970 and 1974, respectively. Nickel 2 francs were finally introduced in 1979, followed by bimetallic 10 francs in 1988 and trimetallic 20 francs in 1992. The 20-franc coin was composed of two rings and a centre plug.


A nickel 10-franc piece was issued on 22 October 1986, in an attempt to increase usability, reduce counterfeiting, and make it easier for vending machines to recognise. While 120 million were released into circulation, circulation was halted on 26 November due to confusion with the half-franc and an unpopular design. The coin was subsequently withdrawn on 19 December and became demonetized at the end of June the next year. This led to the conception of the later bimetallic model. The aluminium-bronze pieces continued to circulate until the bimetallic pieces were developed and additional aluminium-bronze coins were minted to replace those initially withdrawn. Once the bimetallic coins were circulating and produced in necessary quantities, the aluminium-bronze pieces were gradually withdrawn and demonetized.

A .900 silver 50-franc piece was issued from 1974 to 1980, known as the largest silver coin ever minted in France, (due to its face value in accordance to its size) but was withdrawn and demonetized after the price of silver spiked in 1980. Then, in 1982, a 100-franc piece, also in .900 silver, was issued, and circulated to a small extent, until the introduction of the euro.

All French franc coins were demonetized in 2005 and are no longer redeemable at the .

At the time of the complete changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002, coins in circulation (some produced as recently as 2000) were:

* 1 centime (~ 0.15 euro cents) stainless steel, rarely circulated (last production stopped first in 1982, then in 1987 due to high production cost, and lack of demand due to its very low value).
* 5 centimes (~ 0.76 cents) aluminium-bronze
* 10 centimes (~ 1.52 cents) aluminium-bronze
* 20 centimes (~ 3.05 cents) aluminium-bronze
* franc (~ 7.6 cents) nickel
* 1 franc (~ 15.2 cents) nickel
* 2 francs (~ 30.5 cents) nickel
* 5 francs (~ 76 cents) nickel-clad copper-nickel
* 10 francs (~ €1.52) bimetallic
* 20 francs (~ €3.05) trimetallic, rarer (produced for a short period before the euro, the banknote equivalent was much more frequently used)
* 100 francs (~ €15.24) silver, rarely circulated (most often bought and offered as personal gifts, but rare in commercial transactions, now worth more than its face value).

===Euro exchange===
Coins were freely exchangeable until 17 February 2005 at Banque de France only (commercial banks were not required to accept the old coins after the transition period in 2002, but some did), by converting their total value in francs to euros (rounded to the nearest cent) at the fixed rate of 6.55957 francs for 1 euro. Banknotes remained convertible up until 17 February 2012. By that date, franc notes worth some €550 million remained unexchanged, allowing the French state to register the corresponding sum as revenue.

==Banknotes==
The first franc paper money issues were made in 1795. They were assignats in denominations between 100 and 10,000 francs. These followed in 1796 by &quot;territorial mandate promises&quot; for 25 up to 500 francs. The treasury also issued notes that year for 25 up to 1000 francs.

In 1800, the Bank of France began issuing notes, first in denominations of 500 and 1000 francs. In the late 1840s, 100 and 200-franc notes were added, while 5, 20 and 50 francs were added in the 1860s and 70s, although the 200-franc note was discontinued.

The First World War saw the introduction of 10 and 1000-franc notes. The chambers of commerce&#x27;s notgeld (&quot;money of necessity&quot;), from 1918 to 1926, produced 25c, 50c, 1 F, 2 F, 5 F, and 10 F notes.

Despite base-metal 5, 10 and 20 F coins being introduced between 1929 and 1933, the banknotes were not removed. In 1938, the first 5000-franc notes were added.

In 1944, the liberating Allies introduced dollar-like paper money in denominations between 2 and 1000 francs, as well as a brass 2-franc coin.

After the Second World War, 5, 10 and 20-franc notes were replaced by coins in 1950, as were the 50- and 100-franc notes in the mid-1950s. In 1954, the 10,000-franc notes were introduced.

In 1959, banknotes in circulation when the old franc was replaced by the new franc were:
*500 francs: Victor Hugo
*1000 francs: Cardinal de Richelieu
*5000 francs: Henri IV
*10,000 francs: Bonaparte 1st consul

The first issue of the new franc consisted of 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000-franc notes overprinted with their new denominations of 5, 10, 50 and 100 new francs. This issue was followed by notes of the same design but with only the new denomination shown. A 500-new franc note was also introduced in 1960 representing Molière, replaced in 1969 by the yellow Pascal type (colloquially called a &quot;pascal&quot;). A 5-franc note was issued until 1970 and a 10-franc note (showing Hector Berlioz) was issued until 1979. 

From 1992 until 1998, a series of redesigned banknotes by Roger Pfund was issued, to be the last notes before the introduction of the euro. Banknotes in circulation when the franc was replaced were:

* 20 francs (€3.05): Claude Achille Debussy – brown-purple (introduced 1983)
* 50 francs (€7.62): Antoine de Saint-Exupéry— blue (introduced 20 October 1993, replacing Maurice Quentin de la Tour)
* 100 francs (€15.24): Paul Cézanne — orange (introduced 15 December 1997, replacing Eugène Delacroix)
* 200 francs (€30.49): Gustave Eiffel — red (introduced 29 October 1996, replacing Montesquieu)
* 500 francs (€76.22): Pierre and Marie Curie — green (introduced 22 March 1995, replacing Blaise Pascal)

Banknotes current at changeover to the Euro could be exchanged at the French central bank or other services until 17 February 2012.

Most older series banknotes were exchangeable for 10 years from date of withdrawal. As the last banknote from the previous series was withdrawn on 1 February 1999 (100 francs, Delacroix), the deadline for its exchange was 31 January 2009.

==&quot;De facto&quot; currency==
Along with the Spanish peseta, the French franc was also a &quot;de facto&quot; currency used in Andorra (which had no national currency with legal tender). It circulated alongside the Monegasque franc in Monaco, with which it had equal value. These currencies were all replaced by the euro in 2002.

<doc id="444838" wikidata="Q182749" url="?curid=444838" title="Sargon I">
<text>Sargon I (also transcribed as Šarru-kīn I and Sharru-ken I) was the king (Išši’ak Aššur, &quot;Steward of Assur&quot;) during the Old Assyrian period from 1920 BC to 1881 BC. On the Assyrian King List, Sargon appears as the son and successor of Ikunum, and the father and predecessor of Puzur-Ashur II.

The name “Sargon” means “the king is legitimate” in the Akkadian language. Sargon I might have been named after Sargon of Akkad, perhaps reflecting the extent to which Sargon I identified with the prestigious Dynasty of Akkad.

Sargon I is known for his work refortifying Assur. Very little is otherwise known about Sargon I. The following is a list of the 41 annually-elected limmu officials from the year of accession of Sargon I until the year of his death.

<doc id="444839" wikidata="Q5326277" url="?curid=444839" title="Earl of Galloway">
<text>Earl of Galloway is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1623 for Alexander Stewart, 1st Lord Garlies, with remainder to his heirs male bearing the name and arms of Stewart. He had already been created Lord Garlies in the Peerage of Scotland in 1607, with remainder to the heirs male of his body succeeding to the estates of Garlies. This branch of the Stewart family were distant relatives of the Stewart Kings of Scotland.

Lord Galloway was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He had already been created a Baronet, of Corsewell in the county of Wigtown, in 1627. This title is in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. His grandson, the fifth Earl (who had succeeded his elder brother, who in his turn had succeeded his father), was a politician. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He was a Lord of Police. In 1704 Lord Galloway succeeded his kinsman Sir Archibald Stewart, 2nd Baronet, of Burray, as third Baronet of Burray (see below). On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was a Member of Parliament and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Wigtownshire. From 1774 to 1796 he sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. In 1796 Lord Galloway was created Baron Stewart of Garlies in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the Peerage Act 1963 extended that right to all holders of Scottish peerages. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Earl. He was an admiral in the Royal Navy, a Member of Parliament and Lord-Lieutenant of Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire. When he died the titles passed to his eldest son, the ninth Earl. He represented Cockermouth in the House of Commons and was Lord-Lieutenant of Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the tenth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Wigtownshire. On his death, the titles passed to his younger brother, the eleventh Earl. He was a soldier and fought in the Crimean War and in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He was succeeded by his only son, the twelfth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Kirkcudbrightshire. His only son, the thirteenth Earl, succeeded in 1978. The thirteenth Earl, who suffered from mental illness after being lobotomised at the age of 23, married, but died childless in 2020, upon which the line of descent from the eleventh earl failed. the present holder of the titles is the thirteenth earl&#x27;s second cousin once removed. He is the great-grandson of Major-General Hon. Alexander Stewart (1838–1896), the third son of the ninth Earl.

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Hon. John Stewart, third son of the third Earl, was a brigadier-general in the army and also sat as Member of Parliament for Wigtownshire. The Hon. Keith Stewart, third son of the sixth Earl, was an Admiral and Member of Parliament. His son James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie was Governor of Ceylon. His grandson was James Stewart-Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth. The Hon. Montgomery Granville John Stewart, sixth son of the seventh Earl, represented Kirkcudbrightshire in the House of Commons. The Hon. James Henry Keith Stewart, eighth son of the seventh Earl, was Member of Parliament for Wigtown Burghs. The Hon. Keith Stewart (1814–1859), younger son of the eighth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. 

The Stewart Baronetcy, of Burray in the County of Orkney, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 4 November 1687 for Archibald Stewart. In 1704 the title was inherited by the aforementioned sixth Earl.

The Earls of Galloway are now considered to be the senior branch of Clan Stewart, although their exact descent is debated.

The family seat is Cumloden House, near Newton Stewart, Dumfries and Galloway. The former family seat was Galloway House, near Garlieston, Wigtownshire.

<text>Albizia is a genus of more than 160 species of mostly fast-growing subtropical and tropical trees and shrubs in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae. The genus is pantropical, occurring in Asia, Africa, Madagascar, America and Australia, but mostly in the Old World tropics. In some locations, some species are considered weeds.

They are commonly called silk plants, silk trees, or sirises. The obsolete spelling of the generic name – with double &#x27;z&#x27; – is still common, so the plants may be called albizzias. The generic name honors the Italian nobleman Filippo degli Albizzi, who introduced &quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot; to Europe in the mid-18th century. Some species are commonly called mimosa, which more accurately refers to plants of genus &quot;Mimosa&quot;. Species from southeast Asia used for timber are sometime termed East Indian walnut.

==Description==
They are usually small trees or shrubs with a short lifespan, though the famous &quot;Samán del Guère&quot; near Maracay in Venezuela is a huge &quot;Albizia saman&quot; specimen several hundred years old. The leaves are pinnately or bipinnately compound. The small flowers are in bundles, with stamens much longer than the petals. The stamens are usually showy, although in some species such as &quot;A. canescens&quot; the flowers are inconspicuous.

Unlike those of &quot;Mimosa&quot;, &quot;Albizia&quot; flowers have many more than 10 stamens. &quot;Albizia&quot; can also be told apart from another large related genus, &quot;Acacia&quot;, by its stamens, which are joined at the bases instead of separate.

==Taxonomy==
Numerous species placed in &quot;Albizia&quot; by early authors were eventually moved to other genera, most notably &quot;Archidendron&quot;. Other genera of Ingeae (&quot;Abarema&quot;, &quot;Archidendropsis&quot;, &quot;Blanchetiodendron&quot;, &quot;Calliandra&quot;, &quot;Cathormion&quot;, &quot;Enterolobium&quot;, &quot;Havardia&quot;, &quot;Hesperalbizia&quot;, &quot;Hydrochorea&quot;, &quot;Pararchidendron&quot;, &quot;Paraserianthes&quot;, &quot;Pseudosamanea&quot; and &quot;Serianthes&quot;) have also received their share of former &quot;Albizia&quot; species, as have the Mimoseae &quot;Newtonia&quot; and &quot;Schleinitzia&quot;. Some presumed &quot;silk trees&quot; are in fact misidentified members of the not very closely related genus &quot;Erythrophleum&quot; from the Caesalpinioideae and &quot;Lebeckia&quot; from the Faboideae.

The delimitation of &quot;Falcataria&quot; and &quot;Pithecellobium&quot;, close relatives of &quot;Albizia&quot;, is notoriously complex, with species having been moved between the genera time and again, and this will likely continue. These include &quot;Falcataria falcata&quot; (the Moluccan albizia, formerly named &quot;Albizia moluccana&quot;), a common shade tree on tea plantations. Other closely related genera like &quot;Chloroleucon&quot; and &quot;Samanea&quot; are often merged with &quot;Albizia&quot; entirely.

==Uses==
Albizias are important forage, timber, and medicinal plants, and many are cultivated as ornamentals for their attractive flowers – notably &quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot;.

Some species are used as food plants by the larvae of moths in the genus &quot;Endoclita&quot;, including &quot;E. damor&quot;, &quot;E. malabaricus&quot;, and &quot;E. sericeus&quot;.

<doc id="444841" wikidata="Q2032151" url="?curid=444841" title="Thomas Clarkson">
<text>Thomas Clarkson (28 March 1760 – 26 September 1846) was an English abolitionist, and a leading campaigner against the slave trade in the British Empire. He helped found the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade (also known as the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade) and helped achieve passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807, which ended British trade in slaves.

He became a pacifist in 1816 and, with his brother John, was among the twelve founders of the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace.

In his later years, Clarkson campaigned for the abolition of slavery worldwide. In 1840, he was the key speaker at the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society&#x27;s first convention in London which campaigned to end slavery in other countries.

==Early life and education==
Clarkson was the eldest son of the Reverend John Clarkson (1710–1766), a Church of England priest and headmaster of Wisbech Grammar School, and his wife Anne née Ward (died 1799). He was baptised on 26 May 1760 at St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Wisbech.
His siblings were John (born 1764) and Anne. Both boys attended Wisbech Grammar School, Hill Street, where the family lived. After the death of his father, the family moved into a house on Bridge Street, which is now marked by a blue plaque. In 1775, Thomas went on to St Paul&#x27;s School in London, where he obtained an exhibition.

He entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1779. An excellent student, he appears to have enjoyed his time at the University of Cambridge, although he was a serious, devout man. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1783 and was set to continue at Cambridge to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and enter the Anglican ministry. He was ordained a deacon in 1783 but never proceeded to priest&#x27;s orders.

==Revelation of the horrors of slavery==
In 1785, Clarkson entered a Latin essay competition at the university that was to set him on the course for most of the remainder of his life. The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor Peter Peckard, was &quot;Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare&quot; (&quot;is it lawful to make slaves of others against their will?&quot;), and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the slave trade. He read everything he could on the subject, including the works of Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist, as well as first-hand accounts of the African slave trade such as Francis Moore&#x27;s &quot;Travels Into the Inland Parts of Africa&quot; (1738). He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.

After winning the prize, Clarkson had what he called a spiritual revelation from God, as he travelled by horse between Cambridge and London. He broke his journey at Wadesmill, near Ware, Hertfordshire. He later wrote:

As it is usual to read these essays publicly in the senate-house soon after the prize is adjudged, I was called to Cambridge for this purpose. I went and performed my office. On returning however to London, the subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts. I became at times very seriously affected while upon the road. I stopped my horse occasionally, and dismounted and walked. I frequently tried to persuade myself in these intervals that the contents of my Essay could not be true. The more however I reflected upon them, or rather upon the authorities on which they were founded, the more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wades Mill in Hertfordshire, I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse. Here a thought came into my mind, that if the contents of the Essay were true, it was time some person should see these calamities to their end. Agitated in this manner I reached home. This was in the summer of 1785.

This experience and sense of calling ultimately led him to devote his life to abolishing the slave trade.

Having translated the essay into English so that it could gain a wider audience, Clarkson published it in pamphlet form in 1786 as &quot;An essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species, particularly the African, translated from a Latin Dissertation&quot;.

The essay was influential, resulting in Clarkson&#x27;s being introduced to many others who were sympathetic to abolition, some of whom had already published and campaigned against slavery. These included influential men such as James Ramsay and Granville Sharp, many Quakers, and other nonconformists. The movement had been gathering strength for some years, having been founded by Quakers both in Britain and in the United States, with support from other nonconformists, primarily Methodists and Baptists, on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented Parliament with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade.

Following this step, a small offshoot group formed the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, a small non-denominational group that could lobby more successfully by incorporating Anglicans. Under the Test Act, only those prepared to receive the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper according to the rites of the Church of England were permitted to serve as MPs, thus Quakers were generally barred from the House of Commons until the early nineteenth century. The twelve founding members included nine Quakers, and three pioneering Anglicans: Clarkson, Granville Sharp, and Philip Sansom. They were sympathetic to the religious revival that had predominantly nonconformist origins, but which sought wider non-denominational support for a &quot;Great Awakening&quot; amongst believers.

==Anti-slavery campaign==
Encouraged by publication of Clarkson&#x27;s essay, an informal committee was set up between small groups from the petitioning Quakers, Clarkson and others, with the goal of lobbying members of parliament (MPs). In May 1787, they formed the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The Committee included Granville Sharp as chairman and Josiah Wedgwood, as well as Clarkson. Clarkson also approached the young William Wilberforce, who as an Anglican and an MP was connected within the British Parliament. Wilberforce was one of few parliamentarians to have had sympathy with the Quaker petition; he had already put a question about the slave trade before the House of Commons, and became known as one of the earliest Anglican abolitionists.

Clarkson took a leading part in the affairs of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and was tasked to collect evidence to support the abolition of the slave trade. He faced strong opposition from supporters of the trade in some of the cities he visited. The slave traders were an influential group because the trade was a legitimate and highly lucrative business, generating prosperity for many of the ports.

Liverpool was a major base of slave-trading syndicates and home port for their ships. In 1787, Clarkson was attacked and nearly killed when visiting the city, as a gang of sailors was paid to assassinate him. He barely escaped with his life. Elsewhere, however, he gathered support. Clarkson&#x27;s speech at the collegiate church in Manchester (now Manchester Cathedral) on 28 October 1787 galvanised the anti-slavery campaign in the city. That same year, Clarkson published the pamphlet &quot;A Summary View of the Slave Trade and of the Probable Consequences of Its Abolition&quot;.

Clarkson was very effective at giving the committee a high public profile: he spent the next two years travelling around England, promoting the cause and gathering evidence. He interviewed 20,000 sailors during his research. He obtained equipment used on slave-ships, such as iron handcuffs, leg-shackles, and thumbscrews; instruments for forcing open slaves&#x27; jaws; and branding irons. He published engravings of the tools in pamphlets and displayed the instruments at public meetings.

Clarkson&#x27;s research took him to English ports such as Bristol, where he received information from the landlord of the Seven Stars pub. (The building still stands in Thomas Lane.) He also travelled repeatedly to Liverpool and London, collecting evidence to support the abolitionist case.

Clarkson visited &quot;The Lively,&quot; an African trading ship. Although not a slave ship, it carried cargo of high-quality goods: carved ivory and woven textiles, beeswax, and produce such as palm oil and peppers. Impressed by the high quality of craftsmanship and skill expressed in these items, Clarkson was horrified to think that the people who could create such items were being enslaved. He bought samples from the ship and started a collection to which he added over the years. It included crops, spices and raw materials, along with refined trade goods.

Clarkson noticed that pictures and artefacts could influence public opinion more than words alone. He began to display items from his collection of fine goods to reinforce his anti-slavery lectures. Demonstrating that Africans were highly skilled artisans, he argued for an alternative humane trading system based on goods rather than labourers. He carried a &quot;box&quot; featuring his collection, which became an important part of his public meetings.

He rode some 35,000 miles for evidence and visited local anti-slave-trade societies founded across the country. He enlisted the help of Alexander Falconbridge and James Arnold, two ship&#x27;s surgeons he had met in Liverpool. They had been on many voyages aboard slave ships, and were able to recount their experiences in detail for publication.

Clarkson also continued to write against the slave trade. He filled his works with vivid firsthand descriptions from sailors, surgeons and others who had been involved in the slave traffic. In 1788 Clarkson published large numbers of his &quot;Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade&quot; (1788). Another example was his &quot;An Essay on the Slave Trade&quot; (1789), the account of a sailor who had served aboard a slave ship. These works provided a grounding for William Wilberforce&#x27;s first abolitionist speech in the House of Commons on 12 May 1789, and his twelve propositions.

Olaudah Equiano (Gustavus Vassa) a member of the Sons of Africa published his memoir, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot;, one of the genre of what became known as slave narratives – accounts by slaves who achieved freedom. As an African with direct experience of the slave trade and slavery, Equiano was pleased that his book became highly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Clarkson wrote to the Reverend Thomas Jones (1756–1807) at Trinity College, Cambridge, to introduce Equiano to him and the community. He asked for aid from the Rev. Jones in selling copies of the memoir and arranging for Equiano to visit Cambridge to lecture.

In 1791, Wilberforce introduced the first Bill to abolish the slave trade; it was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88. As Wilberforce continued to bring the issue of the slave trade before Parliament, Clarkson travelled and wrote anti-slavery works. Based on a plan of a slave ship he acquired in Portsmouth, he had an image drawn of slaves loaded on the slave ship &quot;Brookes&quot;; he published this in London in 1791, took the image with him on lectures, and provided it to Wilberforce with other anti-slave trade materials for use in parliament.

This was the beginning of their protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Clarkson, Wilberforce and the other members of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and their supporters, were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement that mobilised public opinion as never before. Parliament, however, refused to pass the bill. The outbreak of War with France effectively prevented further debate for many years. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was the Secretary of State for War for prime minister William Pitt the Younger, instructed Sir Adam Williamson, the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, to sign an agreement with representatives of the French colonists of Saint Domingue, later Haiti, that promised to restore the ancien regime, slavery and discrimination against mixed-race colonists, a move that drew criticism from abolitionists Wilberforce and Clarkson.

By 1794, Clarkson&#x27;s health was failing, as he suffered from exhaustion. He retired from the campaign and spent some time in the Lake District, where he bought an estate, Eusemere, by Ullswater. There he became a friend of the poet William Wordsworth and Dorothy Wordsworth, his sister.
On 19 January 1796 he married Catherine Buck of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; their only child Thomas was born in 1796. They moved to the south of England for the sake of Catherine&#x27;s health, and settled at Bury St Edmunds from 1806 to 1816. They then lived at Playford Hall, between Ipswich and Woodbridge in Suffolk.

When the war with France appeared to be almost over, in 1804 Clarkson and his allies revived the anti-slave trade campaign. After his ten years&#x27; retreat, he mounted his horse to travel again all over Great Britain and canvass support for the measure. He appeared to have returned with all his old enthusiasm and vigour. He was especially active in persuading MPs to back the parliamentary campaign.

Passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807 ended the trade and provided for British naval support to enforce the law. Clarkson directed his efforts toward enforcement and extending the campaign to the rest of Europe, as Spain and France continued a trade in their American colonies. The United States also prohibited the international trade in 1807, and operated chiefly in the Caribbean to interdict illegal slave ships. In 1808 Clarkson published a book about the progress in abolition of the slave trade. He travelled to Paris in 1814 and Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, trying to reach international agreement on a timetable for abolition of the trade. He contributed the article on the &quot;Slave Trade&quot; for &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia,&quot; Vol. 33, 1816.

==Later career==
In 1823 the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later known as the Anti-Slavery Society) was formed. Clarkson travelled the country to build support for its goal. He covered 10,000 miles, and activated the network of sympathetic anti-slavery societies which had been formed. This resulted in 777 petitions being delivered to parliament demanding the total emancipation of slaves. When the society adopted a policy of immediate emancipation, Clarkson and Wilberforce appeared together for the last time to lend their support. In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed, with emancipation completed on 1 August 1838 in the British colonies.

Clarkson lived an additional 13 years. Although his eyesight was failing, he continued to campaign for abolition, focusing on the United States, where slavery had expanded in the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River. He was the principal speaker in 1840 at the opening of the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, chaired by Thomas Binney. The conference was intended to build support for abolishing slavery worldwide and included delegates from France, the US, Haiti (established in 1804 as the first black republic in the Western Hemisphere) and Jamaica. The scene at Clarkson&#x27;s opening address was painted in a commemorative work by Benjamin Haydon, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London; Clarkson is shown, finishing his speech with arm raised.

In 1846, Clarkson was host to Frederick Douglass, an American former slave who had escaped to freedom in the North and became a prominent abolitionist, on his first visit to England. Douglass spoke at numerous meetings and attracted considerable attention and support. At risk even prior to passage in the US of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Douglass was grateful when British friends raised the money and negotiated purchase of his freedom from his former master in December 1846.

==Later life==

Throughout his life Clarkson was a frequent guest of Joseph Hardcastle (the first treasurer of the London Missionary Society) at Hatcham House in Deptford, then a Surrey village. In the early 1790s he met his wife, a niece of Mrs Hardcastle here. Clarkson wrote much of his &quot;History of the Abolition of the Slave Trade&quot; (1808) at Hatcham House.

His younger brother John Clarkson (1764–1828) took a major part in organising the relocation of approximately 1200 Black Loyalists to Africa in early 1792. They were among the 3000 former United States slaves given their freedom by the British and granted land in Nova Scotia, Canada, after the American Revolutionary War. This group chose to go to the new colony of Sierra Leone established by the British in West Africa, founding Freetown. John Clarkson was appointed its first Governor.
Thomas Clarkson died on 26 September 1846 in Playford, Suffolk, aged 86. He was buried in the village on 2 October at St Mary&#x27;s Church.

The Clarkson chest and Clarkson Collection are now on display in Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum.

==Legacy==

* In 1833, the inhabitants of Wisbech requested Clarkson sit for his portrait by Samuel Lane; it hangs in the council chamber of Wisbech Town Hall.
*In 1834, after the abolition of slavery in Jamaica, Free Villages were founded for the settlement of freedmen. The town of Clarksonville, named in his honour, was established in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica.
* In 1839, the Court of the Common Council gave Clarkson the Freedom of the City of London.
*In 1839, a mission station in South Africa was named Clarkson by Moravian missionary Hans Peter Hallbeck in honour of Clarkson and his abolition work. 
* Opened in 1847, Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum has a permanent display of anti-slavery artefacts collected by Thomas Clarkson and his brother John, and organises events linked to anti-slavery.
*In 1857, an obelisk commemorating Clarkson was erected in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard in Playford to a design by George Biddell Airy.
*In 1879, a monument to Clarkson was erected in Wadesmill; it reads: &quot;On this spot where stands this monument in the month of June 1785 Thomas Clarkson resolved to devote his life to bringing about the abolition of the slave trade.&quot;
*The Clarkson Memorial was erected in Wisbech to commemorate his life and work. Work started in October 1880 and it was unveiled by Sir Henry Brand, Speaker of the House of Commons on 11 November 1881. The Thomas Clarkson Academy, Wisbech, is named after him. A tree-lined road in Wisbech is named Clarkson Avenue in his honour (a side street is Wilberforce Road), and a pub opposite was called the Clarkson Arms (closed in 2018). Nearby is Clarkson Court.
* A blue plaque to Thomas Clarkson has been erected in his memory by the Wisbech Society and is part of the town trail.
*In 1996, a tablet was dedicated to Clarkson&#x27;s memory in Westminster Abbey, near the tomb of William Wilberforce.
*Several roads in the United Kingdom are named after him, for example in Hull, Cambridge and Ipswich.
*In 2007, Clarkson appeared on a United Kingdom commemorative stamp, marking the abolition of the slave trade
*A descendant, Canon John Clarkson, continues in his footsteps as one of the leaders of the Anti-Slavery Society.
*In July 2010, the Church of England Synod added Clarkson with Equiano and Wilberforce to the list of people to be honoured with a Lesser Festival on 30 July in the Church&#x27;s calendar of saints. An initial celebration was held in Playford Church on 30 July 2010.

*The poet William Wordsworth wrote a sonnet to Clarkson:

Sonnet, To Thomas Clarkson,
On the final passing of the Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, March 1807.
:&quot; Clarkson! it was an obstinate Hill to climb:&quot;
:&quot;How toilsome, nay how dire it was, by Thee&quot;
:&quot;Is known,—by none, perhaps, so feelingly;&quot;
:&quot;But Thou, who, starting in thy fervent prime,&quot;
:&quot;Didst first lead forth this pilgrimage sublime,&quot;
:&quot;Hast heard the constant Voice its charge repeat,&quot;
:&quot;Which, out of thy young heart&#x27;s oracular seat,&quot;
:&quot;First roused thee.—O true yoke-fellow of Time&quot;
:&quot;With unabating effort, see, the palm&quot;
:&quot;Is won, and by all Nations shall be worn!&quot;
:&quot;The bloody Writing is for ever torn,&quot;
:&quot;And Thou henceforth wilt have a good Man&#x27;s calm,&quot;
:&quot;A great Man&#x27;s happiness; thy zeal shall find&quot;
:&quot;Repose at length, firm Friend of human kind!&quot;
:::::William Wordsworth

*A posthumous poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon on an engraving of a painting of Clarkson by Samuel Lane dwells on his achievements.

*In the 2006 film about the abolition of the slave trade, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, Clarkson was played by the British actor Rufus Sewell.

<text>Otto Ernst Lindemann (28 March 1894 – 27 May 1941) was a German &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (naval captain). He was the only commander of the battleship during its eight months of service in World War II.

Lindemann joined the German Imperial Navy () in 1913, and after his basic military training, served on a number of warships during World War I as a wireless telegraphy officer. On board , he participated in Operation Albion in 1917. After World War I, he served in various staff and naval gunnery training positions. One year after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed commander of the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, at the time the largest warship in commission anywhere in the world and the pride of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (Nazi Germany&#x27;s navy).

In May 1941, Lindemann commanded &quot;Bismarck&quot; during &quot;Operation Rheinübung&quot;. &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser formed a task force under the command of Admiral Günther Lütjens on board Bismarck. Orders were to break out of their base in German-occupied Poland and attack British merchant shipping lanes in the Atlantic Ocean. The task force&#x27;s first major engagement was the Battle of the Denmark Strait, which resulted in the sinking of . Less than a week later, on 27 May, Lindemann and most of his crew died in &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s last battle.

He was posthumously awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross (), at the time the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany. The medal was presented to his widow, Hildegard, on 6 January 1942.

==Early life==
Otto Ernst Lindemann was born on 28 March 1894 in Altenkirchen in the Westerwald, Rhine Province. He was the first of three children of Dr. jur. Georg Heinrich Ernst Lindemann and Maria Lindemann, née Lieber. Known as Ernst, Georg Lindemann was a probationary judge (Gerichtsassessor) and later president of the Prussian Central Land Credit Company, a Prussian credit bank.

Otto Ernst Lindemann was baptised into the Protestant Church on 26 April 1894. The family moved to the Charlottenburg quarter of Berlin, where they lived at 6 Carmer Street, in 1895. His younger brother—Kurt—was born in 1896, followed by a second brother, Hans-Wolfgang, in 1900. The family relocated again in 1903, this time to their own house in the Dahlem quarter of Berlin, near the Grunewald forest.

In 1910, when Lindemann was 16, his uncle &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; Friedrich Tiesmeyer was in command of the light cruiser (October 1909 – January 1910) of the Imperial Navy, at that time holding the rank of (commander). At a family reunion in Hamelin, Lindemann talked with his uncle and heard of his seafaring adventures in the Far East. These conversations attracted Lindemann to a naval career.

Lindemann graduated from the Bismarck-Gymnasium (secondary school) in Berlin-Wilmersdorf with his &quot;Abitur&quot; (diploma) late in 1912 with an average-to-good overall rating. For the next six months, he attended the Royal Polytechnic Institution in Richmond, London.

==Personal life==
Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil (née Fritsche; 1899–1979), a Berlin singer, in the spring of 1920. The couple married on 1 February 1921, and they had a daughter, Helga Maria, born on 26 February 1924. Lindemann&#x27;s job as a naval officer demanded that he be away from his family for long periods of time. This proved to be too demanding on the marriage, and they were divorced in 1932. Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother&#x27;s sister-in-law, Hildegard Burchard. Hildegard was 14 years younger than Lindemann. They married on 27 October 1934 in the St. Annen Church in Berlin–Dahlem. The ceremony was performed by Martin Niemöller, a founder of the Confessing Church, later imprisoned as an anti-Nazi. They had a daughter, Heidi Maria, born on 6 July 1939.

==Naval career==

===Imperial Navy===
On 26 March 1913, Lindemann traveled with his parents to Flensburg for his medical examination at the Naval Academy at Mürwik. The strong financial background of his parents made him a suitable applicant for the Imperial Navy, as the costs associated with a naval education in 1909 were 800–1,000 Marks per year for eight years. By comparison, a metal worker earned 1,366 Marks annually and a teacher 3,294 Marks. Only 5 percent of the German population at the time earned more than 3,000 Marks annually. However, the doctor certified him as fit only for limited duties (), as pneumonia in childhood had left him unfit for service in U-boats. After a second examination, he was accepted on probation, and Lindemann became one of the 290 young men of &quot;Crew 1913&quot; (the incoming class of 1913). He was officially enlisted in the Imperial Navy as a (sea cadet) on 1 April 1913.
In early May 1913, the cadets of Crew 1913 were sent to the training ships , , and . Lindemann was assigned to &quot;Hertha&quot; with 71 of his comrades. At that time, &quot;Hertha&quot; was under the command of Captain Heinrich Rohardt, a friend of his uncle Friedrich. Arriving on board on 9 May, they were divided into watches consisting of roughly 18 men each. &quot;Hertha&quot; left Mürwik and stayed in Kiel until the end of the month. On 29 May 1913, &quot;Hertha&quot; headed for Swinemünde, where she stayed until 15 June. The next stop, via Sassnitz and Visby, was Stockholm, Sweden, arriving on 24 June. The ship remained in Stockholm until 1 July, before leaving for Bergen in Norway. After a few days, the voyage continued to the Lönne Fjord. Here, Lindemann met his commander-in-chief—Kaiser Wilhelm II—for the first time. &quot;Hertha&quot; then returned to Germany, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 8 August 1913.

One week later, &quot;Hertha&quot; began a seven-month training cruise (15 August 1913 – 12 March 1914). The voyage took Lindemann to Dartmouth in England, Vilagarcía de Arousa in Spain, Faial Island in the Azores and as far as Halifax in Nova Scotia. The return trip then went via Vera Cruz in Mexico, Havana in Cuba, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Kingston in Jamaica, Port of Spain in Trinidad and then to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Spanish mainland, arriving back in Germany in the middle of March 1914, first in Brunsbüttel and two days later in Kiel. Lindemann was promoted to &quot;Fähnrich zur See&quot; (Ensign) on 3 April 1914.

===World War I===
With the German declaration of war in August 1914, all further training at the naval academy was terminated and the normal compulsory officer examination was skipped. The entire Crew 1913 was assigned to various units in the Imperial Navy. Lindemann was assigned to , a battleship which belonged to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet under the command of &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (vice admiral) Reinhard Scheer, taking on the position of 3rd wireless telegraphy officer. &quot;Lothringen&quot; was mostly tasked with patrolling the North Sea, sailing back and forth between Altenbruch (now part of Cuxhaven) and Brunsbüttel without engaging in combat. Lindemann left &quot;Lothringen&quot; on 1 June 1915 to attend the wireless telegraphy school at Mürwik. He successfully completed the course and returned from it in July 1915. He then took over the position of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer, a position that fellow officers joked suited his abnormally large ears. He was promoted to &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; (Second Lieutenant) on 18 September 1915.
On 19 March 1916, Lindemann was transferred to the newly commissioned battleship (under the command of Captain Max Hahn), with the same rank of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer. &quot;Bayern&quot;, with her eight guns, was the most powerful ship of the fleet. Her crew had been largely assigned from &quot;Lothringen&quot;, which continued to serve as a training ship. Aboard &quot;Bayern&quot;, now under the command of Captain Rohardt, Lindemann participated in Operation Albion in September–October 1917. Operation Albion&#x27;s objective was the invasion and occupation of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa (Ösel), Hiiumaa (Dagö) and Muhu (Moon), then part of the Russian Republic. At 05:07 on 12 October 1917, &quot;Bayern&quot; struck a mine while moving into her bombardment position to secure the landing beaches at Pamerort. Seven sailors were killed. Despite mine damage, &quot;Bayern&quot; engaged the coast defense battery at Cape Toffri on the southern tip of Hiiumaa. &quot;Bayern&quot; was released from her duties at 14:00 that day. Preliminary repairs were made on 13 October in Tagga Bay before she returned to Kiel on 1 November 1917.

After the armistice in 1918, &quot;Bayern&quot;—together with the majority of the German High Seas Fleet—was interned at Scapa Flow, the home of the British Grand Fleet. &quot;Bayern&quot; arrived there on 23 November 1918 with a skeleton crew of only 175 men, including Lindemann, who was then ordered to return to Germany, arriving in Kiel on 12 January. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the fleet, and &quot;Bayern&quot; sank at 14:30.

===Between the wars: Reichsmarine===
When Ernst Lindemann returned to Germany, it was uncertain whether he could remain on active military service. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed on 28 June 1919, the former Imperial German Navy was downsized to 15,000 men, including 1,500 officers, while being renamed the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; in the era of the Weimar Republic. As Lindemann had finished fifth in the Class of 1913, he stood a good chance of being retained. He served temporarily in the Dahlem Protection Company a part of the Protection Regiment of Greater Berlin (June–July 1919), before he became adjutant to the newly created chief of the Naval Command Department (1 August 1919 – 30 September 1922), at the time under the command of William Michaelis. The Naval Command Department was directly subordinated to the Admiralty Staff. At the same time, he held the position of adjutant in the Fleet Department. During this assignment Lindemann was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; (Sub-Lieutenant) on 7 January 1920.

Lindemann&#x27;s next assignment (1 October 1922 – 30 September 1924) was aboard the battleship , where he served as a watch and division officer. During this assignment, he attended an officers&#x27; course at the ships&#x27; gunnery school in Kiel between 5 February and 3 May 1924. From here, Lindemann took command of the 1st Artillery Company of the 3rd Coastal Defense Department in Friedrichsort in Kiel from 1 October 1924 – 26 September 1926. His commanding officer was &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (Lieutenant Commander) Otto Schultze, a former World War I U-boat commander and later &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; (general admiral) of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. In this position, Lindemann was promoted to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; (captain lieutenant) on 1 January 1925.

His next assignment (27 September 1926 – 6 September 1929) placed him on the Admiral&#x27;s staff at the Baltic Naval Station, first as a staff officer and then as assistant to the chief of the station, which at the time was under the command of Vice Admiral Erich Raeder. From here, he was transferred to the serving as the second gunnery officer and &quot;Fähnrichsoffizier&quot; (officer in charge of cadets), responsible for the on-board training of the officer cadets, from 7 September 1929 – 25 February 1930. Holding the same rank and position, Lindemann then transferred to the .

===Between the wars: Kriegsmarine===
On 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany, ushering in a period of naval rearmament. In 1935, the was renamed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Between 22 September 1931 and 22 September 1934, Lindemann was a senior lecturer at the Naval Gunnery School in Kiel. He was then posted to the under the command of Captain Hermann Boehm and served as first gunnery officer from 23 September 1933 to 8 April 1934. Ernst Lindemann was promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; on 1 April 1932. On 9 April 1934, he was ordered to the Wilhelmshaven Shipyard (9 April–11 November 1934) for training in ship construction and familiarisation with the heavy cruiser , under the command of Captain Wilhelm Marschall.
On &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;, he again served as first gunnery officer, and in this position he participated in the Spanish Civil War (24 July–30 August 1936). &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; had to make ready for the mission on short notice; the order came from Admiral Rolf Carls on 23 July 1936 at 13:45. The normal 48 hours required to prepare the ship was reduced to 12 hours, demanding a lot of the crew and especially Lindemann. As the first gunnery officer, Lindemann was responsible for handling and storing all munitions. &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and the cruiser left Germany on 24 July at 08:00. Lindemann&#x27;s main responsibilities included commanding the German landing parties and acting as diplomatic aid and interpreter for Captain Marschall. These landing parties consisted of up to 350 men, which included 11 officers, 15 non-commissioned officers and 266 sailors, or roughly one-third of the crew. On the return voyage to Germany, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; stopped at Gibraltar on the morning of 25 August 1936. Marschall, Lindemann and other officers met with the British Governor and Rear Admiral James Somerville. After Lindemann returned to Germany, he was promoted to &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; on 1 October 1936.

Between 1936 and 1938, he was an adviser and later head of the ship construction department at the Naval High Command, and at the same time a consultant to and later chief of the Naval Training Department. On 1 April 1938, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (captain at sea). On 30 September 1939, one month after the outbreak of World War II, Lindemann succeeded Captain Heinrich Woldag as commander of the Naval Gunnery School in Wik in Kiel, after Woldag took command of the heavy cruiser . Under his command were three training departments, the gunnery training ship and &quot;Hektor&quot;, numerous gunnery training boats, gun carriers, auxiliary vessels, and occasionally Hitler&#x27;s state yacht, the aviso .

===Commander of the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;===
Ernst Lindemann was frustrated by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into direct contact with the enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that he would be able to get &quot;Bismarck&quot; ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding &quot;Bismarck&quot;, Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany&#x27;s leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.
Lindemann arrived at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilding works in Hamburg at the beginning of August 1940. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s keel had been laid on 1 July 1936 and she was launched on 14 February 1939. Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg joined &quot;Bismarck&quot; as fourth gunnery officer in June 1940, and he would become the highest-ranking officer to survive &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s last battle on 27 May 1941. Much of what is currently known about &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s final days is attributed to his account as a witness. Lindemann made Von Müllenheim-Rechberg his personal adjutant and instructed him to refer to the ship as &quot;he&quot; rather than &quot;she&quot;; Lindemann considered the ship too powerful to be referred to as a female. He commissioned the battleship on 24 August 1940. He showed a great deal of attachment to the ship and was respected by his crew.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; left the Kiel Fjord on the morning of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, &quot;Bismarck&quot; reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here &quot;Bismarck&quot; conducted a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, &quot;Bismarck&quot; reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screw propellers, &quot;Bismarck&quot; was almost impossible to steer.
In November 1940, Von Müllenheim-Rechberg was sent to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to complete his heavy gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann&#x27;s personal adjutant. Lindemann&#x27;s new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s heavy guns were first test-fired in the second half of November, and &quot;Bismarck&quot; was shown to be a very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave. First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.

On 28 April 1941, the ship and crew were ready, and stores were on board for a three-month mission. Lindemann notified Naval High Command (&quot;Oberkommando der Marine&quot;), Naval Groups North and West (&quot;Marinegruppen Nord und West&quot;) and Fleet Command that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was ready for action. The Chief of Fleet—Admiral Günther Lütjens—and his fleet staff held drills for the first time on board &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 13 May, testing the communication chain between Fleet Command and &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s officers.

Adolf Hitler—accompanied by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Wilhelm Keitel, his former naval adjutant Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; adjutant &quot;Oberst&quot; Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was taken on a tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of &quot;Bismarck&quot; had lunch in the officers&#x27; mess, where Hitler spoke about America&#x27;s unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.

===Operation Rheinübung===
The goal of Operation Rheinübung (Rhine Exercise) was for &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser —under the command of Lindemann&#x27;s &quot;Crew 1913&quot; classmate Captain Helmuth Brinkmann—to break into the Atlantic and attack Allied shipping. Grand Admiral Raeder&#x27;s orders to the task force commander—Admiral Günther Lütjens—were that &quot;the objective of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; is not to defeat enemies of equal strength, but to tie them down in a delaying action, while preserving combat capacity as much as possible, so as to allow &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to get at the merchant ships in the convoy&quot; and &quot;The primary target in this operation is the enemy&#x27;s merchant shipping; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk.&quot;

At 02:00 on 19 May 1941, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; left Gotenhafen and proceeded through the Baltic Sea and out toward the Atlantic. Unknown to Lütjens, the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might occur in the area. The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane-cruiser on 20 May heading north-west past Gothenburg. The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source. Alerted by this report, British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. A Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord (), near Bergen, at 13:15 on 21 May. On the evening of 23 May at 19:22, the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers and that had been patrolling the Denmark Strait in the expectation of a German breakout. The alarm was sounded and Lindemann announced at 20:30 over the intercom: &quot;&quot;. (Enemy sighted to port. Engage!) &quot;Bismarck&quot; fired five salvos without scoring a direct hit. The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer. However, &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s forward radar had failed as a result of vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish, and Lütjens was obliged to order &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to move ahead of &quot;Bismarck&quot; in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage.

At the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941, was sunk, probably by &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The hydrophones on &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; detected a foreign ship to port at 05:00. The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05:45, which the first gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider initially reported as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them to be battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port was their precise identity revealed. The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05:53. Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting &quot;Bismarck&quot; first, but due to the reversed German battle order, &quot;Hood&quot; opened fire on the &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; instead. The German task force was still waiting for the order to commence firing, which Admiral Lütjens did not give immediately. Two minutes later, after multiple inquiries by Schneider, &quot;? (Permission to open fire?), an impatient Lindemann responded: &quot; (I&#x27;m not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!) At 06:01, the fifth salvo by &quot;Bismarck&quot;, fired at a range of about , was seen to hit &quot;Hood&quot; abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one shell struck somewhere between Hood&#x27;s mainmast and &#x27;X&#x27; turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from &quot;Hood&quot; from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of &quot;Hood&quot;, and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.
Following the explosion, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was targeted by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits, four by &quot;Bismarck&quot; and three by &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, at about 06:09. During this brief engagement, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had also hit &quot;Bismarck&quot; three times, first striking the commander&#x27;s boat and putting the seaplane catapult amidships out of action. The second shell passed right through the bow from one side to the other. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead of an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. The damage caused to &quot;Bismarck&quot; by these two shots allowed of water into the ship.

Lindemann and Lütjens at this point differed on how best to continue the mission. Lindemann, as commander of a battleship, was guided by the tactical situation, and wanted to hunt down the damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. (The Germans did not at that time know the ship to be &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, but knew that it was a battleship.) Lütjens, apparently mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary contact with similar enemy units, rejected this without discussion. Lindemann and Lütjens also differed on where to take the ship for repairs; Lindemann advocated retracing their route through the Denmark Strait and returning to Bergen, Norway. Lütjens overruled him and ordered a course set for Saint-Nazaire, France. In the afternoon, Admiral Lütjens ordered &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to break away from &quot;Bismarck&quot; and operate independently against the enemy&#x27;s merchant shipping. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and &quot;Bismarck&quot; separated at 18:14 that evening. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; arrived safely at Brest, France on 1 June 1941. No direct witnesses to this difference of opinion survived the sinking, but &quot;Matrosengefreiter&quot; (Leading Seaman) Heinz Staat, the helmsman on the bridge, remembered a telephone call between the First Watch Officer, Commander Hans Oels, and a fleet staff officer which suggested that Lindemann had been trying to persuade Lütjens to pursue the enemy. A messenger returning to his comrades below spoke of &quot;dicke Luft&quot; (&quot;thick air&quot; or a &quot;bad atmosphere&quot;) on the bridge.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk three days later, after a concentrated effort by Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. At 23:30 (local time 19:30) on 24 May an attack was made by a small group of nine Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron under the command of Eugene Esmonde from the aircraft carrier . One hit was scored, which killed &quot;Oberbootsmann&quot; Kurt Kirchberg, but caused only superficial damage to the &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s armoured belt. In mid-morning at 10:30 on 26 May, a RAF Coastal Command Catalina reconnaissance aircraft from 209 Squadron RAF spotted &quot;Bismarck&quot; roughly west of Saint-Nazaire. The British battle group Force H, under the command of Admiral James Somerville, whose main units were the aircraft carrier , the First World War era battlecruiser and the cruiser , was ordered to stop &quot;Bismarck&quot;. At 19:15 that evening, 15 Swordfish from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched an attack. The air raid alarm was sounded on &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 20:30. Roughly 15 minutes into the attack &quot;Bismarck&quot; was possibly hit by one torpedo, and at around 21:00 another single torpedo jammed &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s rudder 12° to port. Damage-control parties laboured to regain steering control and uncoupled and centred the starboard rudder, but failed to free the port rudder. With asymmetric power applied, speed reduced to , &quot;Bismarck&quot; was on a converging course with the Royal Navy units on the chase. The alarm sounded again at 23:00 when destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla under the command of Captain Philip Vian attacked &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Throughout the night &quot;Bismarck&quot; was targeted by incessant torpedo attacks by , , , , and , denying Lindemann and the crew much-needed rest.

&quot;Bismarck&quot;″s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. &quot;Norfolk&quot; sighted the &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 08:15, and the battleship opened fire on &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 08:48. &quot;Bismarck&quot; returned fire at 08:49. Further involved in the final battle were the battleship and the cruisers &quot;Norfolk&quot; and . Torpedo bombers did not participate in the final battle. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret &quot;Dora&quot; was disabled at 09:24. &quot;Bismarck&quot; received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret &quot;Caesar&quot; went out of action after a hit at 09:50. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V&quot; had to disengage prior to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sinking. The Germans were preparing to scuttle &quot;Bismarck&quot; when three torpedoes fired by &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; hit the ship&#x27;s side armour. &quot;Bismarck&quot; sank at 10:36 at position , roughly west of Ouessant (Ushant). The cruiser &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; saved 85 men, and the British destroyer &quot;Maori&quot; saved 25. A further five sailors were saved by under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat and the weather observation ship . The &quot;Befehlshaber der U-Boote&quot; (U-boats Commander-in-Chief) Karl Dönitz had ordered under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Herbert Wohlfarth to pick up &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s war diary. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the order be transferred to &quot;U-74&quot;. &quot;U-74&quot; failed to reach &quot;Bismarck&quot; on time and the war diary was never retrieved.

===Death===
Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for the last time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg described the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.
Lindemann&#x27;s body was never recovered, and it is thought that he, Lütjens and other officers were probably killed in action when shellfire from the British warships landed on &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s bridge at 09:02. When Robert Ballard, the oceanographer responsible for finding discovered the wreck of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; in 1989, he found that most of the forward superstructure had been blasted away by shells and there were more than 50 shell holes around the area of the conning tower. This may support the theory.

Alternatively, Lindemann may have left his combat position when the ship&#x27;s controls were rendered inoperable—and prior to the lethal hit on the command position—in order to give the command to abandon the ship. The surviving &quot;Matrose&quot; Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle—stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving &quot;Maschinengefreiter&quot;—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s forward 38 cm turret, &quot;Anton&quot;. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann&#x27;s hand while the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, and then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.

===Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross===

Lindemann&#x27;s comrades of Crew 1913 all contacted the young widow after his death. The former head of Crew 1913, Captain Otto Klüber, contacted Mrs Lindemann in the fall of 1941 and offered her an honorary membership. Shortly after Christmas on 27 December 1941, exactly seven months after the sinking of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the death of its commander, Captain Ernst Lindemann received a posthumous Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. He received this high award because the &quot;Oberkommando der Marine&quot; felt that his skilled leadership significantly contributed to the destruction of the British battlecruiser &quot;Hood&quot; and the damage inflicted on the British battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Lindemann was the 94th recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

Lindemann&#x27;s first gunnery officer—Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider—had been awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941. Traditionally, the commanding officer would have received this award before any other crew member was so honoured. This exception had been criticized by various circles in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann&#x27;s cousin, the former &quot;General der Kavallarie&quot; (General of the Cavalry) Georg Lindemann, intervened. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, with whom Lindemann shared a 20-year comradeship dating to the early days of the , presented the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday, 6 January 1942, in Dahlem. Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann&#x27;s mother and widow.

===Lindemann Battery===
To honour the late Captain Lindemann, the heavy naval battery at Sangatte, between Calais and Boulogne was christened &quot;Batterie Lindemann&quot; (the Lindemann Battery) on 19 September 1942 by the admiral in command of the Channel Coast Friedrich Frisius. The battery consisted of three heavy SK C/34 guns housed in casemates, originally intended for the early H-class battleships. Prior to this, the guns had been referred to as &quot;Batterie Schleswig-Holstein&quot; or &quot;Batterie Groß-Deutschland&quot; and were located in the Hel Peninsula, Poland. The battery was destroyed by Canadian forces on the evening of 26 September 1944. Today the structure is partly covered by excavated material from the Channel Tunnel, and only the command bunker with a number of smaller strong points are still visible.

==In popular culture==
Austrian actor Carl Möhner played Captain Ernst Lindemann in the 1960 black-and-white British war film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot; The film was based on the novel &quot;The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck&quot; by C. S. Forester.
