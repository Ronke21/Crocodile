==History==

=== Formation and early years ===
In 1946, &quot;Compagnie Générale de Transports Aériens (CGTA)&quot; was established. It started operating flights between Algeria and Europe on a charter basis in 1947. However, by the end of the decade, CGTA was operating scheduled flights serving Algiers, Basel, Bône, Geneva, Marseille, Paris, Philippeville, and Toulouse. In 1952, three 34-seater Bretagnes joined a fleet of seven DC-3s. Meanwhile, &quot;Compagnie Air Transport (CAT)&quot;, a subsidiary of Air France and &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique&quot;, had been formed in the late 1940s to connect Basel, Lyon, Marseille, Paris, and Toulouse with Algiers, Constantine, and Oran. Seasonal London–Deauville, and London–Le Touquet flights were also undertaken. Following a drop in traffic after 1951, a merging partner was under consideration.

CGTA, and CAT merged on 23 May 1953 to form the &quot;Compagnie Générale de Transports Aériens Air Algérie&quot;, with a combined fleet that included one Breguet 761, six Bretagnes, five DC-3s, and three DC-4s. Following the merger, Air Algérie commenced seasonal services to Ajaccio, Clermont, Montpellier, and Perpignan. Furthermore, Switzerland was added to the regular schedule, a stop at Palma was performed on a weekly basis in partnership with Aviaco, and most of the trans-Mediterranean routes were operated in a pool agreement with Air France, with the French carrier flying 54% of these services, and the remainder was left for Air Algérie. Flights to the Cote d&#x27;Azur were added in the late 1950s.

Two Noratlas aircraft were acquired in July 1957, with a third entering the fleet in the following year. In addition, it became the first private French carrier to order the Caravelle in early 1958, the first of which was handed over by the manufacturer in January 1960. Following delivery, the aircraft was deployed on the Algiers–Paris route. The type was also used to fly Paris–Bône and Paris–Oran services in the subsequent months. By April 1960, Air Algérie&#x27;s fleet consisted of three Caravelles, three DC-3s, ten DC-4s, two Lockheed L-749 Constellations, and three Noratlases. The Caravelles were gradually deployed on the routes previously flown with the Constellations and the DC-4s, which were used for cargo services or sold.

===Algerian independence===

Two shipping companies, &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,&quot; and &quot;Compagnie de Navigation Mixte&quot;, were the owners of a majority stake (98%) in Air Algérie until Algeria gained its independence in 1962. Following independence, the &quot;Délégation Générale&quot; in Algeria and Air France took over a controlling interest. The financial structure changed in March 1963, when the shipping companies and Air France ceded a 31% interest, and the Algerian government took possession of 51% of the company assets, with the airline gaining flag carrier status. In April 1964, the government increased the participation in the airline to 57%. That month, a contract was signed for the acquisition of two Ilyushin Il-18s aimed at operating the Algiers–Moscow service. Air Algérie took delivery of just one of these aircraft, as the contract was later cancelled. The sole Il-18 in the fleet was used by the government. There were eight DC-4s in the airline&#x27;s fleet by April 1968. That year, four ex-Lufthansa Convair 440s were bought and converted to the 640 version. These aircraft came to replace the ageing DC-4s. Charter operations made up to 20% of the airline activities.

By March 1970, the government was the owner of 83% of the company; at this time, a Boeing 737-200, five Caravelles, four CV-640s, three DC-3s and one DC-4 were part of the fleet. &quot;Société de Travail Aérien&quot;, a domestic carrier that had been founded in 1968, was taken over by Air Algérie in May 1972. In , three Fokker F27-400s were ordered for £2.5 million. In , with a second Boeing 737 pending delivery, two more aircraft of the type —one of them a convertible model— were ordered. That year, the government of Algeria boosted its participation in the carrier to 100% when it acquired the remaining 17.74% stake held by Air France. A new route to Karachi was inaugurated in 1975. In November 1979, four Boeing 727s were ordered in a deal worth  million.

By July 1980, Air Algérie had 5,621 employees and a fleet comprising 57 aircraft, including 14 Ag-Cats, six Boeing 727-200s, ten Boeing 737-200s, three Boeing 737-200Cs, one Boeing 747-200C, one Cherokee Six, two Convair CV-640s, one Douglas DC-8-63CF, one Nord 262 and 18 Queen Airs; at this time, the company offered international scheduled services to Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia, Libya, Romania, Spain, the UK, the USSR and Switzerland, among other countries, as well as an extensive domestic network. In January 1981, the carrier ordered three Lockheed L-100-30s; by late the same year, the first of these aircraft was due to be delivered. In November 1981, a Boeing 727-200 and a Boeing 737-200 were acquired. Three Boeing 737-200s were ordered for  million in 1983. Air Algérie became Airbus&#x27; 48th customer when it placed an order for two Airbus A310s in 1984. That year, a subsidiary called Inter Air Services (IAS) (), an airline that flew domestic and regional services using Fokker F-27 aircraft, was formed. The IAS network was operated on Air Algéries&#x27;s behalf, and at March 1985 included Adrar, Algiers, Bechar, Bordj B. Mokhtar, Djanet, El Golea, Ghardaia, Hassi Messaoud, Illizi, In Amenas, In Salah, Oran, Ouargla, Tamanrasset and Timimoun; by this time, Air Algérie had 6,788 employees. In 1989, the carrier ordered three Boeing 767-300s for  million.

The first Boeing 767-300 was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer in mid-1990. That year, the carrier entered a process of restructuring that would last until 1995, following years of losses that totalled only for 1990, with debts rising to  million after a devaluation of the local currency. Restructuring seemingly bore fruit, as the company made a profit of  million in 1992.
Air Algérie and Sonatrach created Tassili Airlines in 1998; Air Algérie&#x27;s 49% shareholding in this airline was handed over to Sonatrach in 2005.

===Modernization of the company===
Air Algérie became a limited company in 1997. In 2006 its capital amounted to 57 billion dinars (about 560 million euros).

The sales network comprises 150 agencies in Algeria and abroad, linked to the booking system and distributed through GDS to which Air Algérie has subscribed.
Air Algérie is a Joint Stock Company (J.S.C) the registered capital of which is 43.000.000.000,00 DA.

In November 2010, Air Algérie announced an investment of €400 million to renew its fleet, to be launched in 2011.

===Recent developments and future plans===

Ten Next Generation 737s—seven-800s and three-600s—were ordered in 1998 to replace the ageing Boeing 727-200s and Boeing 737-200s; the 737-600 commitment was later increased to include two more aircraft. The first Boeing 737-800 included in this order was handed over by the airframer in August 2000. When the first Boeing 737-600 was delivered to the company in May 2002, Air Algérie became the fifth airline worldwide in operating the type.

Five Airbus A330-200s were ordered in late 2003, along with nine ATR72-500ssix of them taken over from and order previously placed by Khalifa Airways. The former type would act as a replacement for the two Airbus A310s, a Boeing 747-200 and three Boeing 767-300s, while the latter would replace the seven-strong Fokker F27 fleet. Four more ATR72-500s were ordered in 2009 at a cost of approximately  million, with the first of these 66-seater four turboprop machines being phased-in in February 2010. Also in 2009, during the Dubai Airshow, Air Algérie announced the purchase of seven additional Boeing 737-800s. In April 2011, the fourth aircraft from this order became the Boeing jetliner delivered to the company.

In November 2012, the airline announced an investment worth €600 million for the incorporation of eight aircraft, two of them freighters, between 2012 and 2016. Air Algérie had its IOSA certification renewed in December 2012, for a period of two years. In February 2013, unofficial announcements disclosed the airline has ordered three additional Airbus A330-200s, five additional Boeing 737-800s. It was also reported the carrier&#x27;s intention of deploying the new A330s on new routes to Johannesburg, New York, Shanghai and São Paulo.

The airline launched in April 2013 a tender for the acquisition of 14 passenger and two cargo aircraft. Plans for the purchase of new equipment worth  million (€556 million), including three 250-seater airframes to replace the ageing Boeing 767s, were disclosed again in December 2013; already in , Air Algérie signed a letter of intent with Airbus for three Airbus A330-200s at the 2013 Dubair Air Show. In January 2014, three 68-seater ATR 72-600s were ordered, and a commitment for eight Boeing 737-800s, valued at  million at list prices, was signed with Boeing. The ATR order made Air Algérie the largest operator of the type within Africa. In the same year, Boeing 737-700Cs were ordered for  million. Air Algérie first ATR 72-600 was handed over to the company in December 2014.

In June 2023, the company ordered five Airbus A330-900s and two Airbus A350-1000s from Airbus; an order for eight Boeing 737 MAX 9 was placed with Boeing and a commitment for the purchase of two Boeing 737BCFs was also signed. In addition to this, 10 other aircraft will be leased, including four Airbus A330ceo, two Airbus A330-900, two Boeing 737-800 and two Boeing 737 MAX 9.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Fatal===
* On 19 May 1960 at 9:46 UTC, a mid-air collision occurred away from Paris-Orly Airport, involving an Air Algérie Sud Aviation Caravelle jetliner (registered F-OBNI) on a scheduled passenger flight from Algiers, and a privately owned Stampe SV.4 biplane (F-BDEV). The Stampe was completely destroyed upon impact, killing the sole pilot on board. The impact and the propeller blades of the biplane tore open the cabin roof of the Caravelle, and both of its jet engines flamed out due to ingested debris but were restarted almost immediately, allowing for a safe landing. There was one fatality amongst the 32 passengers and 7 crew members of the Air Algérie flight, and the aircraft was later repaired.
* On 11 April 1967, an Air Algérie Douglas DC-4 (registered 7T-VAU), which was on a flight from Dar El Beïda Airport in Algiers to Tamanrasset Airport, crashed into a hill in the Sahara desert near Tamanrasset during landing approach, killing all 33 passengers and 6 crew members on board.
* On 26 July 1969 a fire broke out on board an Air Algérie Sud Aviation Caravelle (registered 7T-VAK), which likely had been caused by an electric malfunction. The aircraft was on a chartered passenger flight from Marseille to Biskra, and the pilots tried for an emergency landing at Oued Irara – Krim Belkacem Airport, but the plane was quickly engulfed by flames and crashed, killing all 30 passengers and 7 crew members.
* On 24 January 1979 at around 19:40 local time, an Air Algérie Aérospatiale N 262 (registered 7T-VSU) crashed 15 kilometres short of the runway of Boudghene Ben Ali Lotfi Airport, resulting in the death of 14 out of the 20 passengers on board. The three crew members survived the accident, which was blamed on the malfunction of an altimeter (as the approach was performed too low), coinciding with pilot error and fatigue.
* On 21 December 1994, a cargo-configured Boeing 737-200 operating Air Algérie Flight 702P from East Midlands Airport to Coventry Airport (both in England) on behalf of Phoenix Aviation crashed 1.7 kilometres short of the runway at the destination airport, killing the five crew members on board.
* On 6 March 2003 at 15:15 local time, Air Algérie Flight 6289, a Boeing 737-200 (registered 7T-VEZ) on a domestic flight from Tamanrasset to Algiers via Ghardaïa, crashed shortly after take-off from Aguenar – Hadj Bey Akhamok Airport because of an engine failure, killing 96 passengers and all 6 crew members on board. There was only one survivor.
* On 13 August 2006 at ca 20:15 local time, Air Algérie Flight 2208 (a Lockheed L-100 Hercules registered 7T-VHG) crashed near Piacenza in Italy, resulting in the death of the three crew members. The aircraft had been on a flight from Algiers to Frankfurt when a problem with the autopilot occurred, resulting in the pilots losing control of the plane.
*On 24 July 2014, ATC controllers lost contact with Air Algérie Flight 5017, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 leased from Swiftair, en route from Ouagadougou Airport in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to Houari Boumediene Airport in Algiers, Algeria, which was reported missing at 01:55 or 02:00 UTC near to Gao, Mali. The flight was carrying 112 passengers and 6 Spanish crew members. 54 of the passengers were French citizens. It was found crashed in northern Mali.

===Non-fatal===
* On 8 June 1949, the right main landing gear of an Air Algérie Douglas C-47 Skytrain (registered F-BCYO) collapsed upon landing at Lyon-Bron Airport, following a cargo flight from Algiers. During the crash landing, the aircraft was destroyed, but the three crew members survived.
* On 30 October 1951, an Air Algérie Sud-Ouest Bretagne (registered F-OAIY) caught fire and was subsequently destroyed at Paris-Orly Airport, following the sudden collapse of the right main landing gear during take-off run. All 30 passengers and 4 crew members on board could be saved.
* On 26 April 1962, shortly after the end of the Algerian War, a parked Air Algérie Lockheed Constellation (registered F-BAZE) was blown up at Maison Blanche Airport by OAS terrorists, a militant French far-right nationalist group strongly opposed to the independence of Algeria.
* On 23 September 1973, an Air Algérie Sud Aviation Caravelle (registered 7T-VAI) was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Algiers-Dar el Beida Airport.
* On 1 August 1989, an Air Algérie Lockheed L-100 Hercules cargo aircraft suffered a ground loop upon landing at Tamanrasset Airport following a flight from Algiers, resulting in the aircraft being damaged beyond repair.
* On 25 July 1991, the nosegear of an Air Algérie Fokker F27 Friendship (registered 7T-VRM) collapsed during a hard landing at In Guezzam Airport, damaging the aircraft beyond repair.
* On 2 August 1996, an Air Algérie Boeing 737-200 (registered 7T-VED) overran the runway at Tlemcen Airport in an attempt to abort the take-off for a scheduled flight to Algiers. There were no fatalities among the 100 passengers and 6 crew members on board, even though the aircraft was substantially damaged.
* Another runway overshot involving an Air Algérie Boeing 737-200 (this time 7T-VEH) occurred on 31 January 1999. Upon landing at Constantine Airfield in unusual snowy conditions following a flight from Paris, the aircraft was severely damaged when it overshot the runway and struck a heap of snow. There were no casualties among the 92 passengers and 7 crew members.
* On 18 March 2006 at 10:30 local time, the right main landing gear of an Air Algérie Boeing 737-600 (registered 7T-VJQ) collapsed upon landing in poor weather conditions at Seville Airport following a flight from Oran. Approximately 45 out of the 101 passengers and 6 crew members on board were injured.
* On 14 March 2008, an Air Algérie Boeing 737-800 (registered 7T-VKA) that was operating Flight 1143 from Paris to Sétif with 120 people on board suffered extensive damage during a hard landing at Ain Arnat Airport.

===Hijackings===
* On 31 August 1970, three passengers armed with pistols and molotov cocktails hijacked an Air Algérie Convair CV-640 on a scheduled domestic flight from Annaba to Algiers and demanded the pilots to head to Albania instead. During a fuel stop in Brindisi, eleven passengers were allowed to leave the aircraft. As the aircraft was denied landing permission by the Albanian authorities, it diverted to Dubrovnik in then Yugoslavia instead, where the perpetrators could be arrested.
* When an Air Algérie Boeing 737-200 landed at Houari Boumedienne Airport on 31 March 1991 (during the Algerian Civil War) following a scheduled passenger flight from Béchar, a passenger threatened to detonate a hand grenade and insisted on being allowed to have a political statement on live national television, concerning the planned national election. The demand was rejected, and the hijacker was persuaded to give up and set free the 53 other persons on board.
* A similar hijacking occurred on 13 November 1994 on board an Air Algérie Fokker F27 Friendship (registered 7T-VRK) during a flight from Algiers to Ouargla. The aircraft with 42 occupants was forced to divert to Palma de Mallorca Airport, where the three perpetrators surrendered.
* On 25 July 1996 at around 9:00 local time, an Air Algérie Boeing 767-300 with 232 persons on board was hijacked at Oran Es Sénia Airport by a man who demanded to be flown to the United States, rather than to Algiers where the aircraft had been scheduled to leave for. After more than four hours of negotiation he surrendered to the local authorities.
* On 19 January 2003, Air Algérie Flight 6025 from Constantine to Algiers was hijacked shortly after take-off by a man who demanded the pilots fly the Boeing 737-800 to North Korea. The flight continued to Algiers, though, where the perpetrator could be restrained by police forces storming the aircraft. None of the 24 other passengers and 6 crew members were injured.
* On 19 August 2003, an Air Algérie Boeing 737-800 was hijacked by a mentally-ill passenger right after take-off from Houari Boumedienne Airport, who threatened to blow up the aircraft when the crew would not divert to Geneva (rather than to Lille as the flight was scheduled to). The crew carried out an allegedly necessary fuel stop at Oran Es Sénia Airport, where the man could be arrested.

<doc id="430462" wikidata="Q5647060" url="?curid=430462" title="Hancock Park, Los Angeles">
<text>Hancock Park is a neighborhood in the Wilshire area of Los Angeles, California. Developed in the 1920s, the neighborhood features architecturally distinctive residences, many of which were constructed in the early 20th century. Hancock Park is covered by a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ).

==History==
The area owes its name to developer-philanthropist George Allan Hancock, who subdivided the property in the 1920s. The Hancock family donated the land for the park proper in 1916 in order to preserve the tar pits; at the time the &quot;Santa Monica electric line&quot; was the major means of access. Hancock, born and raised in a home at what is now the La Brea tar pits, inherited , which his father, Major Henry Hancock had acquired from the Rancho La Brea property owned by the family of Jose Jorge Rocha. Residential development under the &quot;Hancock Park&quot; name began around 1919, allegedly because &quot;his oil derricks were running dry.&quot;
In 1948, Nat King Cole and his family purchased a $65,000 Tudor mansion in Hancock Park, becoming the first African American family to do so. This started a series of protests, where the Hancock Park Property Owners Association tried, but failed, to prevent him from buying the house. The association then tried to buy the house from him. What followed was months of abuse, in which his dog was poisoned and racial insults were burnt into his lawn. An unpublished covenant for the property stated that the home was for whites only and not for &quot;any person whose blood is not entirely that of the Caucasian race&quot;, with the exception that &quot;persons not of the Caucasian race&quot; could reside in &quot;the capacity of servants&quot;. An attorney for property owners in the area said, “We don&#x27;t want undesirable people coming here.&quot; Cole replied, “Neither do I, and if I see anybody undesirable coming into this neighborhood, I&#x27;ll be the first to complain.”

Residents of Hancock Park opposed development efforts in the area through the latter half of the 20th century, particularly public transit projects on Wilshire Boulevard through the neighborhood. Residents had created the Park Mile Plan, a proposal to limit any development on Wilshire in the area to two stories, which, for RTD councilmember George Takei, was about preserving &quot;the character of Hancock Park&quot;. As a result, a proposed Metro Rail extension did not include a station in Hancock Park; this angered residents on Crenshaw Boulevard, who wanted a station at its end on Wilshire in Hancock Park. Residents of Hancock Park strongly opposed the plan on the grounds that it would lead to too much development and an increase in crime, leading to accusations of racism from those on Crenshaw Boulevard, a thoroughfare that passes through a number of majority-black neighborhoods. Those fears were present in Hancock Park resident opposition, although other factors were at play as well. In the end, the RTD chose to include a Wilshire/Crenshaw station in its proposal, making residents of Hancock Park suspicious of the entire extension. Their cause was taken up by Henry Waxman, a longtime congressman representing the area, who vehemently opposed a proposed Metro Rail extension through the area and eventually secured a ban on creating the line at all. The rail extension instead turned north to avoid the areas. Waxman came to soften his opposition to the ban by 2004, looking to commission a study to see if changing circumstances warranted construction of the line.

==Geography==
Hancock Park has about 1,200 homes within the boundaries of Wilshire Boulevard on the south, Melrose Avenue on the north, both sides of Highland Avenue on the west and both sides of Rossmore Avenue on the east.

In 2009, The Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; redefined the area as Wilshire Boulevard on the south, Melrose Avenue on the north, but widened the neighborhood and extended it west to La Brea Avenue, and one block east to Arden Boulevard. The Hancock Park Homeowners Association, which was established in 1948, has tried to get the &quot;Times&quot; to correct its boundaries.

Neighboring communities are Hollywood to the northeast, Melrose to the northwest, Citrus Square and La Brea–Hancock to the west, Brookside to the southwest, Fremont Place to the southeast, and Larchmont and Windsor Square to the east.

The neighborhood surrounds the grounds of the Wilshire Country Club.

==Historic Preservation Overlay Zone==

The Hancock Park HPOZ was adopted by the City Council in 2008. The area is &quot;generally bounded by Melrose Avenue on the north, Highland Avenue on the west, Rossmore Avenue on the east, and the rear property lines of the commercial properties along Wilshire Boulevard on the south&quot;. HPOZ signage is posted in the neighborhood.

It is largely within the Wilshire Community Plan area, though a small portion in the northwest (north of Rosewood Avenue and west of June Street) is in the Hollywood Community Plan area.

==Demographics==

The following data applies to the boundaries set by Mapping L.A.:

===2000===
The 2000 U.S. census counted 9,804 residents in the neighborhood—an average of 6,459 people per , including the expanse of the Wilshire Country Club. That figure gave Hancock Park one of the lowest densities in Los Angeles. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 10,671. The median age for residents was 37, considered old when compared with the city as a whole; the percentages of residents aged 35 and above were among the county&#x27;s highest.

Hancock Park was moderately diverse ethnically. The population was 70.7% non-Hispanic White, 13.1% Asian, 8.5% Hispanic or Latino, 3.8% Black, and 3.9% were of other or mixed race. Korea and the Philippines were the most common places of birth for the 26.3% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered low compared to rest of the city.

===2008===
The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $85,277, a relatively high figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $125,000 or more. The average household size of 2.1 people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 52.7% of the housing units, and house or apartment owners 47.3%.

The percentages of never-married men and women, 41.3% and 34.4%, respectively, were among the county&#x27;s highest. The 2000 census found 203 families headed by single parents, a low rate for both the city and the county. The percentage of military veterans who served during World War II or Korea was among the county&#x27;s highest.

Hancock Park residents were considered highly educated, 56.2% of those aged 25 and older having earned a four-year degree. The percentage of residents with a master&#x27;s degree was high for the county.

===Orthodox Jews===

Hancock Park contains a community of Orthodox Jews. According to Teresa Watanabe of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, there are no clear figures, but in the early 21st century, &quot;The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles&quot; estimated that Orthodox Jews made up 20% of the neighborhood&#x27;s total population. Hancock Park is home to nearly all subsections of Orthodox Judaism; of particular note is the large population of Chasidic Jews. The Chasidic Jewish population is growing at an above-average rate due to high birth rates within the community. Orthodox Jews are required to be within walking distance to their synagogues, and Hancock Park is within walking distance to the La Brea Avenue–area synagogues. Teresa Watanabe stated some Orthodox families cited the large size of houses as a reason for moving there, others cited a better housing value compared to Beverly Hills, and other cited a proximity to the Yavneh Hebrew Academy. , there were six Jews on the 16-member board of directors of the Hancock Park Homeowners Association. , the number of Orthodox Jews in Hancock Park is increasing. As of that year, there had been disputes between Orthodox Jews and their neighbors.

<text>Hyujeong (, 1520–1604), also called Seosan Daesa () was a Korean Seon master. As was common for monks in this time, he travelled from place to place, living in a succession of monasteries. Buddhist monks had been forced to keep a low profile since General Yi Seonggye had been forced to eject Buddhism from its state of total permeation of government in order to gain the support of Neo-Confucian scholar-officials to consolidate his position against his Buddhist political opponents when he overthrew Gongyang of Goryeo in 1392 to become King Taejo of Joseon.

Before ever having tested his hand as a military commander, Hyujeong was a first-rate Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is probably his &quot;Seongagwigam&quot; (), a guide to Seon practice studied by Korean monks even today. Like most monks of the Joseon period, Hyujeong had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, though, he wandered through the mountain monasteries. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Seon school by Myeongjong of Joseon, who was sympathetic towards Buddhism. He soon resigned from this responsibility, though, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Seon studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea.

At the beginning of the 1590s, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, after stabilising Sengoku-era Japan under his rule, made preparations for a large-scale invasion of Joseon. Joseon was unaware and was unprepared for the Japanese invasion. In 1592, after Japan&#x27;s request for aid conquering Ming China was rebuffed, approximately 200,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Joseon, and the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) began.

At the beginning of the first invasion, Seonjo of Joseon fled the capital, leaving a weak, poorly trained army to defend the country. In desperation he called on Hyujeong to organise monks into guerilla units. Even at 73 years of age he managed to recruit and deploy some 5,000 of these warrior monks, who enjoyed some instrumental successes.

At first, the government armies of Joseon suffered repeated defeats, and the Japanese armies marched north up to Pyongyang and Hamgyong Province. At sea, however, the Joseon navy, under the command of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, enjoyed successive victories. Throughout the country, loyal volunteer armies formed and fought against the Japanese together with the warrior monks and the government armies of Joseon.

The presence of Hyujeong&#x27;s monk army, operating out of the Heungguksa deep in the mountain of Yeongchwisan, was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders in 1593 and again in 1598.

The Taekwon-Do pattern Seo-San is named in his honor.

Pegrema () is an abandoned village in Medvezhyegorsky District of the Republic of Karelia, Russia, situated on a bank of Lake Ääninen, about 10 km from Unitsa.

Pegrema is a beautiful example of the region&#x27;s wooden architecture. It consists of several large peasant houses, the fronts of which are faced to the lake.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The site of the village Pegrema is believed to have been an &quot;Innovation Centre&quot; throughout the Mesolithic period. Pollen data as well as macrofossils suggest a continuous, albeit sporadic human presence from approximately 4200BC-3000BC. This data does not suggest any significant natural disasters to have occurred in the area throughout this period. However, a distinct lack of any architectural evidence from either the Iron Age or Bronze Age suggests a potential depopulation of the area.

=== Early History ===
The start of land clearance for a permanent settlement and cultivation site is approximated to the late 13th Century. More intensive field cultivation, however, is approximately dated to the 15th Century, as according to pollen data.

=== Later History ===

In the 1770s, the Varlaam Khutynsky chapel was built on a little cape in front of the houses. The chapel remains almost completely intact, although all icons were removed from it after the Russian Revolution.

=== Abandonment and Modern History ===
Following the Russian Revolution, the village began to depopulate, ultimately being abandoned in 1956 by Soviet authorities. Since, it has been listed alongside the nearby Kizhi Island as a UNESCO World Heritage site. While studying the area, Zuravlev believed the area was depopulated due to an earthquake, however, a study taken by M. Saarnisto in the years 1994 and 1995 suggest this earthquake to have taken place far earlier.

== Geography ==
Pegrema can be found in the large Lake Onega region, in the Medvezhyegorsky District of the Republic of Karelia, Russia. It can be found 65 km North of the city of Petrozavodsk, on the Western shore of Unitskaya Guba (bay). Of the numerous peasant houses that scatter the village, all of them face the lake.

<text>Terminology is a group of specialized words and respective meanings in a particular field, and also the study of such terms and their use; the latter meaning is also known as terminology science. A term is a word, compound word, or multi-word expression that in specific contexts is given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from lexicography, as it involves the study of concepts, conceptual systems and their labels (&quot;terms&quot;), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.

Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the &quot;labelling or designating of concepts&quot; particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, &quot;multilingual terminology&quot; and &quot;bilingual terminology&quot;), or may have an interdisciplinarity focus on the use of terms in different fields.

==Overview==
The terminology discipline consists mainly of the following aspects:

* Analyzing concepts and concept structures utilized in a field or area of activity
* Identifying the terms assigned to concepts
* Creating correspondences between terms in the different languages in the case of multilingual or bilingual term.
* Creating new terms in databases or compiling the terms on paper or in databases managing terminology databases as required

==Types of terminology==
A distinction is made between two types of terminology work:
* Ad hoc work on terminology, which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms
* Systematic collection of terminology, which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured ontology of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships.

Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the translation profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem.

Nomenclature comprises types of terminology especially having to do with general ontology, applied ontology, and taxonomy (categorizations and classifications, such as taxonomy for life forms, taxonomy for search engines, and so on).

==Terminology as a discipline==
A &quot;terminologist&quot; intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and standardization institutes compile their own glossaries. This provides the consistency needed in the various areas—fields and branches, movements and specialties—to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline&#x27;s traditional and doctrinal literature.

Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and social epistemology.
Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. Translators research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a &quot;Terminology&quot; section.

===Science===
Terminology science is a branch of linguistics studying special vocabulary.

The main objects of terminological studies are special lexical units (or special lexemes), first of all terms. They are analysed from the point of view of their origin, formal structure, their meanings and also functional features. Terms are used to denote concepts, therefore terminology science also concerns itself with the formation and development of concepts, as well as with the principles of exposing the existing relations between concepts and classifying concepts; also, with the principles of defining concepts and appraising the existing definitions. Considering the fact that characteristics and functioning of term depend heavily on its lexical surrounding nowadays it is common to view as the main object of terminology science not separate terms, but rather the whole terminology used in some particular field of knowledge (also called subject field).

Terminological research started seventy years ago and was especially fruitful at the last forty years. At that time the main types of special lexical units, such as terms proper, nomens, terminoids, prototerms, preterms and quasiterms were singled out and studied.

A nomen, or a nomenclature unit, is a name of a single notion or a certain unit of mass production, e.g. prefix dis-; Canon 550D; UA-24; etc.

Terminoids, or jargon terms, are special lexical units which are used to name the phenomena that are absolutely new and whose concepts are not interpreted in a monosemantic way. E.g., Salmon Day, mouse potato, etc.

Prototerms are special lexemes that appeared and were used in prescientific times.

Preterms are a special group of lexemes which is represented by special lexical units used as terms to name new scientific notions. They are represented by a vast descriptive pattern, e.g. business process reengineering, management by walking about, etc.

The main principles of terminological work were elaborated, terminologies of the leading European languages belonging to many subject fields were described and analysed. It should be mentioned that at the former USSR terminological studies were conducted on an especially large scale: while in the 1940s only four terminological dissertations were successfully defended, in the 1950s there were 50 such dissertations, in the 1960s their number reached 231, in the 1970s – 463 and in the 1980s – 1110.

As the result of development and specialising of terminological studies, some of the branches of terminology science – such as typological terminology science, semasiological terminology science, terminological derivatology, comparative terminology science, terminography, functional terminology science, cognitive terminology science, historical terminology science and some branch terminology sciences – have gained the status of independent scientific disciplines.

==Terminological theories==
Terminological theories include general theory of terminology, socioterminology, communicative theory of terminology, sociocognitive terminology, and frame-based terminology.

<text>The Yishuv (), HaYishuv Ha&#x27;ivri (), or HaYishuv HaYehudi Be&#x27;Eretz Yisra&#x27;el () was the community of Jews residing in Palestine prior to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. The term came into use in the 1880s, when there were about 25,000 Jews living in that region, and continued to be used until 1948, by which time there were some 630,000 Jews there. The term is still in use to denote the pre-1948 Jewish residents in Palestine, corresponding to the southern part of Ottoman Syria until 1918, OETA South in 1917–1920, and Mandatory Palestine in 1920–1948.

A distinction is sometimes drawn between the &quot;Old Yishuv&quot; and the &quot;New Yishuv&quot;. The Old Yishuv refers to all the Jews living in Palestine before the first Zionist immigration wave (&quot;aliyah&quot;) of 1882, and to their descendants until 1948. The Old Yishuv residents were religious Jews, living mainly in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias, and Hebron. There were smaller communities in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki&#x27;in, Acre, Nablus, Shfaram, and until 1799 in Gaza. In the final centuries before modern Zionism, a large part of the Old Yishuv spent their time studying the Torah and lived off charity (halukka), donated by Jews in the Diaspora.

The term &quot;New Yishuv&quot; refers to those who adopted a new approach, based on economic independence and various national ideologies, rather than strictly religious reasons for settling in the &quot;Holy Land&quot;. The precursors began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s, followed soon after by the founders of the moshava of Petah Tikva, with growth in full swing during the First Aliyah of 1882, followed by the founding of neighbourhoods and villages until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

==Ottoman rule==
===Old Yishuv===
The Old Yishuv were the Jewish communities of southern Ottoman Syria in the Ottoman Empire, up to the onset of Zionist aliyah and the consolidation of the New Yishuv by the end of World War I in 1918 and the establishment of the British Mandate for Palestine. The Old Yishuv had continuously resided in Palestine and was largely made up of ultra-Orthodox Jews dependent on external donations (Halukka) for living, as opposed to the later Zionist aliyah and the New Yishuv, who were more socialist-leaning and secular, emphasizing labor and self-sufficiency.

The Old Yishuv developed after a period of severe decline in Jewish communities of the Southern Levant during the early Middle Ages, and was composed of three clusters. The oldest group consisted of the Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jewish communities in Galilee and the Judeo-Arabic speaking Musta&#x27;arabi Jews who settled in Eretz Yisrael in the Ottoman and late Mamluk period. A second group was composed of Ashkenazi and Hasidic Jews who had emigrated from Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. A third wave was constituted by Yishuv members who arrived in the late 19th century. The Old Yishuv was thus generally divided into two independent communities – the Sephardi Jews (including Musta&#x27;arabim), mainly constituting the remains of Jewish communities of Galilee and the Four Holy Cities of Judaism, which had flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; and the Ashkenazi Jews, whose immigration from Europe was primarily since the 18th century.

The &quot;Old Yishuv&quot; term was coined by members of the &#x27;New Yishuv&#x27; in the late 19th century to distinguish themselves from the economically dependent and generally earlier Jewish communities, who mainly resided in the four holy cities, and unlike the New Yishuv, had not embraced land ownership and agriculture. Apart from the Old Yishuv centres in the four holy cities of Judaism, namely Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed, smaller communities also existed in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki&#x27;in, Acre, Nablus and Shfaram. Petah Tikva, although established in 1878 by the Old Yishuv, nevertheless was also supported by the arriving Zionists. Rishon LeZion, the first settlement founded by the Hovevei Zion in 1882, could be considered the true beginning of the &quot;New Yishuv&quot;.

=== Beginning of modern Aliyah (New Yishuv)===

The Ottoman government was not supportive of the new settlers from the First and Second Aliyah, as the Ottoman government officially restricted Jewish immigration. The Yishuv relied on money from abroad to support their settlements.

In 1908, the Zionist Organization founded the Palestine Office, under Arthur Ruppin, for land acquisition, agricultural settlement and training, and later for urban expansion. The first Hebrew high schools were opened in Palestine as well as the Technion, the first institution for higher learning. Hashomer, a Zionist self-defence group, was created to protect the Jewish settlements. Labor organizations were created along with health and cultural services, all later coordinated by the Jewish National Council. By 1914, the old Yishuv was a minority, and the New Yishuv began to express itself and its Zionist goals.

The First Aliyah was the very beginning of the creation of the New Yishuv. More than 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. The immigrants were inspired by the notion of creating a national home for Jews. Most of the Jewish immigrants came from Russia, escaping the pogroms, while some arrived from Yemen. Many of the immigrants were affiliated with Hovevei Zion. Hovevei Zion purchased land from Arabs and other Ottoman subjects and created various settlements such as Yesud HaMa&#x27;ala, Rosh Pinna, Gedera, Rishon LeZion, Nes Tziona and Rechovot. These agricultural settlements were supported by philanthropists from abroad, chiefly Edmond James de Rothschild. and Alphonse James de Rothschild.

Eliezer Ben-Yehuda also immigrated during the first Aliyah. Ben-Yehuda took it upon himself to revive the Hebrew language, and along with Nissim Bechar started a school for teaching Hebrew, later on founding the first Hebrew newspaper.

During the Second Aliyah, between 1903 and 1914, there were 35,000 new immigrants, primarily from Russia.

During World War I, the conditions for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire worsened. All those Jews who were of an enemy nationality were exiled and others were drafted into the Ottoman army. Many of those exiled fled to Egypt and the United States. Those who remained in the Ottoman ruled Palestine faced hard economic times. There was disagreement whether to support the British or the Turks. A clandestine group, Nili, was established to pass information to the British in the hope of defeating the Ottomans and ending their rule over Palestine. The purpose and members of the Nili were discovered. All involved were executed by the Ottomans except its founder, Aaron Aaronsohn, who escaped to Egypt. During World War I, the Jewish population in Palestine diminished by a third due to deportations, immigration, economic trouble and disease. During World War I, there were two British battalions of Jews, called the Zion Mule Corps, who were to fight on the front of Palestine. They helped in the British capture of Ottoman Syria (including Palestine), leading to the Turkish surrender. The members of the Zion Mule Corps later made up the Yishuv&#x27;s defence groups that would fight against the British.

==During the British Mandate==
World War I ended, along with the Ottoman Empire. Britain gained control of Palestine through the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which partitioned Ottoman Syria into French-ruled Syria and Lebanon and British-controlled Palestine and Transjordan. There was a hope that British control would allow the creation of a Jewish national homeland as promised in the Balfour Declaration. The British Mandate was formalized in 1922 based on the Balfour Declaration. The British were supposed to help the Jews build a national home and promote the creation of self-governing institutions. The mandate provided for an agency in which the Jews could represent Jewish interests and promote Jewish immigration. It was called the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and was only created ten years later, serving as the de facto government of the Yishuv.

Along with a Jewish agency there was to be a general self-governing institution created in Palestine including Jews and Arabs. The Yishuv feared such an institution due to the Arab majority, but none was created in the end due to the Arabs&#x27; refusal to cooperate with the Jews or the British. The optimism that existed in the beginning of the British mandate soon diminished due to continued hardships in the Yishuv. Most of the European funds that supported the Jewish settlements before World War I ended. The Arabs, opposed to the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate, instigated riots against the Jews. The British limited immigration through yearly quotas; only those who received &quot;certificates&quot; could make Aliyah.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Many women who immigrated to Israel came out of national Zionist motives; they wanted the same rights as men and wanted to rebuild their land. In 1919 the first nationwide women&#x27;s party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. The constituent assembly was voted upon in 1920, and 14 women were elected out of the three hundred and fourteen delegates. As well as the increase in the number of women filling public positions, the rate of women participating in the labor force increased steadily during the British mandate period in the Yishuv. With that being said, the employment opportunities at the beginning of the mandate period were very limited and women were mainly restricted to typical female occupations because the only other option would be to work in construction, which only pioneer women committed to as part of their feminist-nationalist outlook because those roles were considered inappropriate for women. Women were consistently more unemployed when compared to their male counterparts, regardless of cyclical fluctuations. The wages for working women were consistently lower than the wages of their male counterparts, and throughout the Yishuv period, the average wage for women were 50 to 70 percent of male&#x27;s wage.

Not only were non-religious women fighting for equality, but so were religious women. Female religious Zionists were faced with double the amount of barriers of non-religious female Zionists because they were rejected from religious society because of their gender and they were rejected from secular society because of their religiosity In 1926, the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the Yishuv&#x27;s Assembly of Representatives. That year, an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming &quot;equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv – civil, political, and economic.&quot; In 1935, the establishment of the national organization of religious pioneer women emerged. Its main goal was to improve the material status and spiritual welfare of the religious women workers and gain admittance to the Ha-Po&#x27;el ha-Mizrachi. This organization grew from eight-hundred members in 1935 to six-thousand members in 1948. Women gained rights with the establishment of the religious kibbutz movement by participating in Torah studies with men and by taking part in the co-ed activities that the Kibbutz offered.

===History===
There were Arab riots throughout 1920–21 in opposition to the Balfour Declaration. The Arabs tried to show the British the instability of Palestine and that a Jewish homeland was ungovernable. Riots increased in 1929 after the fourth Aliyah – 133 Jews were killed by Arab mobs during the 1929 riots. The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigration and land purchases were displacing them and taking their jobs away. These riots were also instigated by false rumours that the Jews were planning on building a synagogue near the Western Wall. These riots led to the evacuation of Hebron&#x27;s indigenous – largely non-Zionist – Jewish population.

====White papers====
The British responded to the Arab riots with the White Paper of 1939. It was based on the Hope Simpson Report, which stated that Palestine after economic development could support only 20,000 more immigrant families without infringing on the Arab population&#x27;s placement and employment. It therefore attempted to curtail immigration to Palestine. Upon Jewish criticism of this policy, it was clarified that immigration would not be stopped entirely but would be restricted by quotas.

There were many Jewish immigrants that arrived throughout the 1930s in the fifth Aliyah, despite the immigration quotas. Many who came were fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe. Those that came from Nazi Germany were able to come because of the Haavara Agreement. This allowed Jews to escape from Germany to Palestine in return for paying a ransom to the Reich. By then, the Yishuv had a population of about 400,000.

====The 1936–39 Arab revolt====
The increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants and land purchases, unchallenged by the British Mandate, angered and radicalized many Arabs. In April 1936, Arabs attacked a Jewish bus, leading to a series of incidents that escalated into a major Arab rebellion. The British were caught by surprise and were unable to prevent the deaths of thousands of Arabs and hundreds of Jews in the revolt. The Haganah protected the Yishuv&#x27;s settlements while the Irgun, a radical splinter group, launched a campaign of attacks against Arabs. A coalition of recently formed Arab political parties formed the Arab Higher Committee (AHC). It declared a national strike in support of three basic demands: cessation of Jewish immigration, an end to all further land sales to the Jews, and the establishment of an Arab national government. The Arabs threatened that if the British didn&#x27;t comply with their demands then they would join the adversaries of the British. This concerned the British for World War II was just beginning and they knew they would need Middle Eastern oil.

The British worked with their Arab allies to bring a halt to the AHC riots. The Peel Commission reported, in July 1937, that the British obligations to the Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and the mandate unworkable. It suggested the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the British mandate governing over Nazareth, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem along with a corridor from Jerusalem to the coast. The Jews accepted the general principle of a partition while the Arabs refused any partition plan. The British government sent a technical team called the Woodhead Commission to detail the plan. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to &quot;political, administrative and financial difficulties&quot;.

The Arab Revolt broke out again in the autumn of 1937. The British ended the revolt using harsh measures, deporting many Palestinian Arab leaders and shutting down the AHC. In the Yishuv, the Arab Revolt reinforced the already firm belief in the need for a strong Jewish defence network. Finally, the Arab agricultural boycott that began in 1936 forced the Jewish economy into even greater self-sufficiency. The Haganah during this period changed from being a small clandestine militia to a large military force. The British security forces at this time cooperated with the Haganah to respond to the Arabs.

In 1938 Captain Orde Wingate created the Special Night Squads (SNS) that were composed mostly of Haganah members. SNS used the element of surprise in night raids to protect the Jewish settlements and attack the Arabs.

====White Paper of 1939====
The British suppressed the Arab revolt and published the White Paper of 1939. It allowed for a total of only 75,000 Jews to enter Palestine over a five-year period. During this time the Yishuv entered a period of relative peace with the Arabs.

====During World War II====
The Yishuv wanted to help their fellow Jews, who were being murdered by the Nazis in Europe. Many Jews from Europe were prevented from fleeing to Mandatory Palestine by strict immigration quotas established by the white papers. The Jewish Agency organized illegal immigration from 1939 through 1942 with the help of the Haganah. Those who arrived illegally to Israel during this time were part of the Aliyah Bet. This was a dangerous operation, for these illegal immigrants arrived by boat and had to be careful not to be caught by the British or Nazis. Many of these ships sank or were caught, such as the &quot;Patria&quot;, &quot;Struma&quot; and . Compared with the number of attempts, few ships actually arrived successfully to Mandatory Palestine, but tens of thousands of Jews were saved by the illegal immigration.

The Yishuv also wanted to help on the front lines in Europe to try to save Jews from the Nazi atrocities. In 1942 the Jewish agency turned to the British to offer their assistance by sending Jewish volunteers to Europe as emissaries of the Yishuv to organize local resistance and rescue operations among the Jewish communities. The British accepted the proposal but on a much smaller scale than the Jewish agency had hoped. They only took Jewish parachutists who were recent immigrants from certain targeted countries that they wanted to infiltrate. The British Special Forces and military intelligence both consented to the volunteers&#x27; dual role as British agents and Jewish emissaries. 110 Yishuv members were trained; however only 32 were deployed. Many of them succeeded in helping the POWs and uprisings in the Jewish communities, while others were caught.

There were two periods during the war when the Yishuv faced a direct threat from Nazi forces. The first occurred following Germany&#x27;s conquest of France in 1940, since the pro-Nazi Vichy regime controlled the northern Levant, from which an invasion of Palestine could take place. However, in 1941 British forces successfully fought Vichy forces for control of Syria and Lebanon, thus removing the threat of invasion from the north, at least as long as German armies in Eastern Europe could be held back by the Red Army and thus unable to easily advance towards the Near East from the north. In 1942 however, as Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps swept across North Africa with the intent of capturing the Suez Canal, the likelihood of a German invasion from the south became a real possibility, causing great anxiety in the Yishuv and prompting plans to be drawn for its defense. Knowing that Nazi control of Palestine meant certain annihilation of the Yishuv, a debate raged among Yishuv leadership whether, in the event Nazi occupation was to take place, the inhabitants of the Yishuv should evacuate together with British forces eastwards towards British possessions in Iraq and India or undertake a Masada-like last stand in Palestine, likely doing so in a fortified zone to be hastily constructed around the Carmel Mountains. This military operation was officially named Palestine Final Fortress. Fortunately for the Yishuv, the advance of German forces eastwards in Egypt was halted during the Second Battle of El Alamein, thus lifting the threat of invasion from the south. The anxious time leading to the Nazi loss at El Alamein became known as the 200 days of dread.

=====The Biltmore declaration=====
Despite the reports of Nazi atrocities and the desperation of Jews needing a safe haven the British kept the gates of Palestine almost closed to Jewish immigration. The Zionist leaders met at the Biltmore Hotel in New York in May 1942 and called for unrestricted Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth.

====Mandatory Palestine post World War II====
Hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors were being held in Displaced Persons Camp (DP Camps) aching to go to Mandatory Palestine. The British received much international pressure, specifically from U.S. president Harry Truman, to change their policy on immigration. Despite Britain&#x27;s dependence on American economic aid, the British refused, claiming that they were experiencing too much resistance from the Arabs and Jews already in Palestine and feared what would happen if more were allowed to enter. The refusal to remove the white paper policy angered and radicalized the Yishuv. The Yishuv&#x27;s militia groups set out to sabotage the British infrastructure in Palestine and continue in their illegal immigration efforts. In 1946, the British responded to the Yishuv&#x27;s efforts and began a two-week search for Jews suspected of anti-British activities, arresting many of the Haganah&#x27;s leaders. While the British were busy looking for the Haganah, the Irgun and Lehi carried out attacks on British forces. The most famous of their attacks was on the King David Hotel, the site of the British military command and the British Criminal Investigation Division. This location was chosen because a few weeks before a large quantity of documents was confiscated from the Haganah and brought there. Despite being warned by the Yishuv and told to evacuate the building the British officials decided not to cave in to the pressure. The Yishuv attacked anyway, resulting in 91 deaths, 28 of who were British and 17 who were Palestinian Jews.

By 1947 the British had 100,000 troops in Palestine trying to maintain order and protect themselves. The British mandate was a major expense to the Exchequer, forcing them to present the Palestine problem to the United Nations on May 15, 1947. The United Nations proposed a partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into 2 states—Arab and Jewish (UN Resolution 181). The Jews accepted it, while the Arabs stated that they would do everything in their power to prevent it.

The AHC, determined to prevent Resolution 181 from coming into effect, began to attack and besiege the Jews. The British sided with the Arabs in an attempt to prevent the Yishuv from arming themselves. Jerusalem was held under a siege with no access to weapons, food or water. The Provisional Government seemed helpless until it received a large shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia. The Haganah started fighting offensively from April through May. The Haganah mounted a full-scale military plan, Operation Nachshon. After much fighting and the crucial construction of a new road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the siege of Jerusalem was broken, allowing supplies to be brought into the city.

This operation&#x27;s success helped Harry S. Truman recognize that the Jews would be able to protect themselves. The United States decided therefore, it would support the establishment of a Jewish state. On May 14, 1948, the Jews proclaimed the independent state of Israel and the British withdrew from Palestine.

===Evacuations and expulsions of Jews under the British Mandate===

The 1920 Nabi Musa riots left four Arabs and five Jews killed, with 216 Jews and 23 Arabs wounded. The majority of the victims were members of the old Yishuv. About 300 Jews from the Old City were evacuated following the riots.

During the Jaffa riots in 1921, thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had previously been lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food and services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city.

Following the 1929 Palestine riots, which left 133 Jews dead, the Jewish community members of Gaza and Hebron were ordered to evacuate by the British forces, in fear of their security.

During the Arab revolt of 1936–1939, the Jewish residents of Akko were ousted from the city by local Arab residents. The same fate was forced on the ancient Jewish community of Peki&#x27;in.

===Parliamentary representation===

The Assembly of Representatives was the elected parliamentary assembly of the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine. It was established on 19 April 1920, and functioned until 13 February 1949, the day before the first Knesset, elected on 25 January, was sworn in. The Assembly met once a year to elect the executive body, the Jewish National Council, which was responsible for education, local government, welfare, security and defense. It also voted on the budgets proposed by the Jewish National Council and the Rabbinical Council.

===Paramilitary forces===
====Ottoman Palestine====
See Bar-Giora, Hamagen, Hanoter, and Hashomer.

====British Palestine====

The most notable Jewish paramilitaries in the British Mandate of Palestine were the Haganah, the Irgun and Lehi. In October, 1945, during the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, those organizations joined to form the Jewish Resistance Movement. It was established by the Jewish Agency and activated for some ten months, until August, 1946. The alliance coordinated acts of sabotage and attacks against British authorities.

<doc id="430480" wikidata="Q1069921" url="?curid=430480" title="Karelia (historical province of Finland)">
<text>Karelia (: ) is a historical province of Finland, consisting of the modern-day Finnish regions of South Karelia and North Karelia plus the historical regions of Ladoga Karelia and the Karelian isthmus, which are now in Russia. Historical Karelia also extends to the regions of Kymenlaakso (east of the River Kymi), Northern Savonia (Kaavi, Rautavaara and Säyneinen) and Southern Savonia (Mäntyharju).

Karelia may also refer to the region as a whole, including the portion of Karelia within Russia. The term &quot;Finnish Karelia&quot; refers specifically to the historical Finnish province, while East Karelia or &quot;Russian Karelia&quot; refers to the portion of Karelia within Russia. Finland ceded a portion of Finnish Karelia to the Soviet Union after the Winter War of 1939–40. More than 400,000 evacuees from the ceded territories re-settled in various parts of Finland. Finnish Karelians include the present-day inhabitants of South Karelia and North Karelia, as well as the still-surviving evacuees from the ceded territories.

Finnish Karelia historically came under western influence, religiously and politically, and was separate from East Karelia, which was dominated by the Novgorod Republic and its many successor states from the Middle Ages onwards.

==History==


First indications of human settlement in Karelia are from the Mesolithic period. The oldest find from the area is the over 9000 years old Antrea Net which is a fishing net of willow bast. The number of finds from the area is lower towards the end of the Stone Age. Archeological finds from Karelia are relatively rare between the years 400–800. From the Merovingian period onwards finds from Karelia display a distinct features of West Finnish influences which has been interpreted to result at least partly from a colonisation. The mixing of western Finnish settlers with the local population led to the creation of the Karelian ethnic group.

Archeological evidence indicates that Karelian inhabitation was highest along the western shore of Lake Ladoga and the Karelian Isthmus, with multiple cemeteries and other archeological discoveries dating from AD 600 to AD 800. In South Karelia, the number of archeological discoveries from this time period is lower, though permanent inhabitation was nonetheless present. Lappee, South Karelia has been continuously inhabited for approximately 2,000 years. In North Karelia, only one archeological discovery from this time period has been found, dating to the eighth century. The considerably higher number of archeological discoveries in these regions from AD 800 to AD 1050 indicates that the Karelian population grew and expanded rapidly during this time.

At least 50 sites of Iron Age settlements and 40 hillforts are known from Karelia. According to archeological record and historical data most of the hillforts in Karelia were erected between 1100 and 1323. Particular &quot;Karelian culture&quot; including axes, brooches and ornamental culture flourished approximately between the years 1000–1400.

The River Kymi formed a boundary between the eastern and western cultural spheres by the beginning of the Bronze Age at the latest and is also said to be the boundary between the Tavastians and the Karelians during the Middle Ages. The 15th and 16th centuries saw the River Kymi become a more official border between the Tavastians and the Karelians, with Naulasaari (located in Mäntyharju) serving as the meeting point of the borders between the Häme Finns, Savonians, and Karelians.

During the 12th and 13th century, Karelians fought against Swedes and other Finnic tribes situated in western Finland, such as Tavastians and Finns proper. Karelians were listed as Novgorodian allies in the mid-12th century in Russian Chronicles. Historical records describe Karelians pillaging Sigtuna in Sweden in 1187 and making another expedition in 1257 which lead Pope Alexander IV to call out a crusade against Karelians at the request of Valdemar, the king of Sweden. The Third Swedish crusade, led by the marshal Torgils Knutsson took place between 1293 and 1295. As a result of the crusade the western parts of Karelia fell under Swedish rule and the building of the Castle of Viborg on the site of a destroyed Karelian fort started. According to the &quot;Eric&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; invading Swedes conquered 14 hundreds from Karelians during the crusade.

Hostilities between Novgorod and the kingdom of Sweden continued in 1300 when a Swedish force attacked the mouth of the River Neva and built a fort near the current location of Saint Petersburg. The fort was destroyed the following year by the Novgorodians. Indecisive fighting in 1321 and 1322 led to negotiations and peace by the Treaty of Nöteborg which for the first time decided the border between Sweden and Novgorod. Sweden got territory around Viborg, the western Karelian Isthmus and South Karelia; and Novgorod got the eastern Karelian Isthmus, Ingria, Ladoga Karelia, North Karelia and East Karelia. 

In 1617, Sweden seized Kexholm County (eastern Karelian Isthmus, Ladoga Karelia, and North Karelia) from Russia. In 1634 Savonia and old Swedish Karelia were incorporated in the Viborg and Nyslott County. After the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 eastern parts of the Viborg and Nyslott County and the Kexholm County were ceded to Russia. The rest of these counties were incorporated into the Kymmenegård and Nyslott County. The southeastern part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo of 1743. After the conquest in 1809 of the rest of Finland, Russia&#x27;s 18th century gains, called &quot;Old Finland&quot;, were in 1812 joined to the Grand Duchy of Finland as a gesture of good will (see Viipuri Province).

A large part of Finnish Karelia was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union in 1940 after the Soviet aggression known as the Winter War, when the new border was established close to that of 1721. During the Continuation War of 1941–44, most of the ceded area was recaptured by Finland, but in 1944 was taken over again by the Soviet Union. After the war, the remains of the Province of Viipuri were made into the Province of Kymi. In 1997 the province was incorporated within the Southern Finland Province.

Western Karelia, as a historical Province of Sweden, was religiously and politically distinct from the eastern parts that were under the Russian Orthodox Church.

==Regions within Finnish Karelia==

Some notable regions within the Region of Finnish Karelia are:

Viipuri Province (1812–1944)

Kymenlaakso (1917–)

South Karelia (1917–)

North Karelia (1917–)

==Culture==
The inhabitants of Karelian provinces historically belonging to Finland are known as Karelians. Confusingly, the same name is used also of a closely related but distinct ethnic group living mostly in East Karelia, earlier also in some of the territories Finland ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944.

The traditional culture of &quot;Ladoga-Karelia&quot;, or Finnish Karelia according to the pre-Winter War borders, was by and large similar to that of Eastern Karelia, or Russian Karelia. Karelians live, and did even more so before Stalinism and the Great Purges, also in vast areas east of Finland (in Eastern Karelia, not marked on the map above), where folklore, language and architecture during the 19th century was in the center of the Finns&#x27; interest (see Karelianism), representing a &quot;purer&quot; Finnish culture than that of Southern and Western Finland, which had been for thousands of years in more contact with (or &quot;contaminated by&quot;) Germanic and Scandinavian culture, of which the Kalevala and Finnish Art Nouveau are expressions.

==Names==
Other than Finns, the historical province of Karelia also had Russian speakers living on the territory. The Russian name for the province is Карелия.

==Heraldry==

The arms is crowned by a ducal coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish count&#x27;s coronet.

<doc id="430481" wikidata="Q482525" url="?curid=430481" title="March First Movement">
<text>The March First Movement was a series of protests against Japanese colonial rule that was held throughout Korea and internationally by the Korean diaspora beginning on March 1, 1919. Protests were largely concentrated in March and April of that year, although related protests continued until 1921. In South Korea, the movement is remembered as a landmark event of not only the Korean independence movement, but of all of Korean history.

The protests began in Seoul, with public readings of the Korean Declaration of Independence in the restaurant and in Tapgol Park. The movement grew and spread rapidly. Statistics on the protest are uncertain; there were around 1,500 to 1,800 protests with a total of around 0.8 to 2 million participants. The total population of Korea at the time was around 16 to 17 million. Despite the peaceful nature of the protests, they were frequently violently suppressed. One Korean estimate in 1920 claimed 7,509 deaths and 46,948 arrests. Japanese authorities reported much lower numbers, although there were instances where authorities were observed destroying evidence, such as during the Jeamni massacre. Japanese authorities then conducted a global disinformation campaign on the protests. They promoted a wide range of narratives, including outright denial of any protests occurring, portraying them as violent Bolshevik uprisings, and claiming that Koreans were in need of the benevolent rule of Japan. These narratives were publicly challenged by sympathetic foreigners and by the Korean diaspora.

The movement did not result in Korea&#x27;s prompt liberation, but had a number of significant effects. It invigorated the Korean independence movement and resulted in the creation of the Korean Provisional Government. It also caused some damage to Japan&#x27;s international reputation and caused the Japanese colonial government to grant some limited cultural freedoms to Koreans under a series of policies that have since been dubbed &quot;&quot;. Furthermore, the movement went on to inspire other movements abroad, including the Chinese May Fourth Movement and Indian &quot;satyagraha&quot; protests.

The anniversary of the movement&#x27;s start has been celebrated since, although this was largely done in secret in Korea until its liberation in 1945. In South Korea, it is a national holiday. The North Korean government initially celebrated it as a national holiday, but eventually demoted it and now does not evaluate the movement&#x27;s significance similarly. It now promotes writings about the event that seek to emphasize the role of the ruling Kim family in the protests.

==Background==

In 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea. Japanese rule was initially especially tight. Japan took control over Korea&#x27;s economy, and began a process of Japanization: forced cultural assimilation. Land was confiscated from Koreans and given to Japanese people, and economic and administrative systems were created that were systemically discriminatory. Resistance was violently suppressed, and freedom of speech and press were tightly controlled.

Japanese colonial policies mandated that Koreans send increasingly significant portions of their economic output to Japan, for what was seen as inadequate compensation. This caused a significant decline in the quality of life for many farmers and laborers, who began publicly protesting their treatment. In 1916, there were 6 strikes with 362 participants. In 1917, there were 8 strikes with 1,128, and by 1918 there were 50 strikes with 4,442. Historians of the National Institute of Korean History argue that this reflected increasing discontent in Korea around the time of the movement.

=== Fourteen Points and philosophical developments ===

Japan had been successfully rapidly industrializing since the late 19th century. Around this time, Western theories surrounding social Darwinism and colonial civilizing missions gained significant traction in Japan. These theories were often used to justify and promote Japanese colonialism. The devastation during the 1914–1918 First World War was a shock to many, and motivated intellectuals in Korea and around the world to discuss liberal reforms, especially anti-colonialism, and ideals that would serve to discourage future such conflicts.

After the end of the war in 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson announced his vision for establishing peace and the new world order. This vision was dubbed the Fourteen Points, and included the right of national self-determination. Koreans who learned of Wilson&#x27;s vision were inspired, and interpreted it as signaling support for their independence movement. Their sympathy to the U.S. and the Allies reportedly greatly increased.

The sincerity behind Wilson&#x27;s advocacy for self-determination is debated. Some scholars argue his advocacy was limited to the former colonies of the defeated Central Powers, which Japan was not a part of. Historian Ku Daeyeol argues Wilson&#x27;s efforts were sincere, but frustrated by geopolitical realities. The U.S. would not begin openly advocating for Korean independence until decades later, after it joined World War II against Japan. The Japanese colonial government suppressed discussion of the Fourteen Points; for example, around this time it reportedly banned a foreign film from being screened in Korea because the film had images of President Wilson.

=== Paris Peace Conference and the death of Gojong ===

After the conclusion of the war, various nations participated in the 1919–1920 Paris Peace Conference, during which the sovereignty of a number of nations was discussed.

Koreans made a number of unsuccessful attempts to be represented at the conference. The Korean-American Korean National Association attempted to send Syngman Rhee and to the conference, but the U.S. government denied them permission to go. A group of Koreans in China, the , managed to send Kim Kyu-sik with the Chinese delegation. Chinese leaders, hoping to embarrass Japan, attempted to put a discussion of Korea&#x27;s sovereignty on the agenda, but did not succeed.

Koreans in China also created a plan to secretly extract former Korean emperor Gojong from his house arrest in Korea, and eventually bring him to the conference. Before that could happen, on January 21, 1919, Gojong suddenly died. Japan reported that Gojong had died from natural causes, but he had reportedly been healthy just until his death. Koreans widely ; these theories were in part motivated by knowledge of previous attempts on Gojong&#x27;s life.

Public outrage at the possibility that Gojong had been murdered has since been evaluated as having a critical impact on the timing of, and even the altogether occurrence of, the March First Movement.

=== February 8 Declaration of Independence ===
By the mid-1910s, several hundred Korean students were studying in Japan as part of Japan&#x27;s cultural assimilation efforts. While there, they were exposed to and developed a variety of ideas, which they discussed and debated. Of particular interest to them were ideas from the West, particularly liberal democracy, which they received in part via the Japanese Taishō Democracy movement and Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points.

By early 1919, their ideas coalesced, and they also became angered by the rebuffing of the Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference, by the brutality of Japanese rule, and by the possibility that Gojong had been poisoned. In February, 8,600 students of the Korean Young People&#x27;s Independence Organization () proclaimed and publicly distributed a declaration of independence, which they sent to the Japanese government, attendees of the Paris Peace Conference, and to representatives of various countries. The students were arrested en masse by Japanese authorities, although news of their act reached Korea.

== Organization ==
In late 1918, leaders of the native Korean religion Cheondoism, including , O Se-chang, and Son Byong-hi, reached a consensus that nonviolent resistance and turning international public opinion against Japan would be effective in advocating for Korea&#x27;s independence. They also agreed that they needed assistance from other major groups in Korea.

They dispatched representatives to negotiate and secure the cooperation of major politicians and groups in Korea. Some negotiations were strained and took months; they became so disheartened by these setbacks that they reportedly even considered abandoning their plan. However, the events of January and February 1919 caused a spike in pro-independence activism; around this time, they were able to quickly secure a number of significant alliances. They found that some groups had already been independently planning protests. For example, Presbyterian leaders in Pyongyang reportedly had a plan to protest in the last week of January; these efforts were merged into the Cheondoist ones. They secured alliances from major Christian and Buddhist groups, as well as from several student organizations. They gained the support of several former government officials from the Korean Empire, although they were rebuffed by Joseon-era politicians Park Yung-hyo and Han Kyu-sŏl.

They decided to schedule their protest for March 1, the day of Gojong&#x27;s public funeral, in order to capitalize on the significant number of people congregating in Seoul.

From February 25 to 27, from these various groups held a series of secret meetings in Seoul, during which they signed the Korean Declaration of Independence. From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on February 27, they printed 21,000 copies of the declaration at the printing facilities of , a publisher affiliated with Cheondoism. On the morning of the 28th, they distributed these copies around the peninsula. They also coordinated the distribution of copies to members of the Korean diaspora, to U.S. President Wilson, and to participants in the Paris Peace Conference. That day, they held a final meeting at Son Byong-hi&#x27;s house and reviewed their plans for the protests.

They initially planned to start the protest by inviting thousands of observers to Tapgol Park in Seoul. However, they worried that if they were prominently arrested, angered Korean observers could possibly violently retaliate against authorities. In the interest of maintaining the non-violence of the protests, they decided to change the starting location to the less-visible restaurant in Insa-dong.

=== Role of foreigners in planning the protests ===
Foreigners also played a role in the planning of the protests. In mid-February, Robert Grierson allowed secret meetings about the protests to be conducted in his house in Sŏngjin. Protests in Sŏngjin went on to become the first in North Hamgyong Province. On February 28th, Canadian missionary Frank Schofield was asked to document the protests. Schofield&#x27;s publicization of the protests proved so significant in influencing global public opinion, that he has since been described as the &quot;Thirty-fourth Representative&quot; (), effectively equating his significance to that of the signers of the declaration.

==Beginning==
Around noon on March 1, 1919, 29 of the 33 signers of the declaration gathered in Taehwagwan to start the protest. The signers conducted a prominent reading of the declaration in the restaurant. The Korean restaurant owner An Sunhwan () rushed over and reported the event to the Japanese Government-General of Chōsen, which caused the signers to be arrested by around 80 Japanese military police officers.

Meanwhile, around 4,000 to 5,000 people assembled at Tapgol Park after hearing there was going to be an announcement made there. Around 2 p.m., an unidentified young man rose up before the crowd and began reading the Korean Declaration of Independence aloud. Near the end of the document&#x27;s reading, cheers of &quot;long live Korean independence&quot; () erupted continually from the crowd, and they filed out onto the main street Jongno for a public march.
By the time the marchers reached the gate Daehanmun of the former royal palace Deoksugung, their numbers had swelled to the tens of thousands. From there, a number of splinter groups marched in different directions throughout the city. News of the protests spread rapidly in Seoul, and marching and public demonstations continued for many hours afterwards. That day, around 3,000 copies of the declaration were distributed around Seoul.

These protestors were reportedly consistently peaceful. The declaration contains the text &quot;We entertain no spirit of vengeance towards Japan... [L]et there be no violence&quot;. The protestors were often met with violent repression by Japanese authorities, which resulted in deaths and arrests.

== Spread ==
That same day, similar protests were held in other cities in Korea, including in Pyongyang, Chinnamp&#x27;o, Anju, and Wonsan. Despite Japanese repression of information, news of the protest in Seoul reached these cities quickly, as they were connected to Seoul via the Gyeongui and Gyeongwon railway lines. On March 2, more protests were held in Kaesong and Keiki-dō (Gyeonggi Province). On March 3, more were held in Yesan and Chūseinan-dō (South Chungcheong Province). Protests continued to spread in this fashion, until by March 19, all thirteen provinces of Korea had hosted protests. On March 21, Jeju Island held their first protest. All but seven of the 218 administrative districts in Korea hosted protests.

Various locations often hosted multiple protests for weeks afterwards. Numerous small villages hosted three or four protests. For example, Hoengseong County held a series of protests from March 27 to mid-April. Protests often coincided with market days, and were often held at government offices. The protests were broadly supported across economic and religious spectrums, including groups such as merchants, noblemen, literati, &quot;kisaeng&quot;, laborers, monks, Christians, Cheondoists, Buddhists, students, and farmers.
Korean shop owners reportedly closed their doors in solidarity with the protests, with some reportedly refusing to reopen even after Japanese soldiers attempted to force them to. Some shop owners demanded the release of imprisoned protestors.

=== Character of the protests ===
The protests were decentralized and diverse. The diversity in the protests was influenced by local culture and religion. In some regions, Christians played a more significant role in organizing protests, and in others Cheondoists were more significant. The scholar Kim Jin-bong argued that Christians played a larger role in regions with more developed transportation, and Cheondoists in regions with less developed transportation. According to one estimate, 17% of arrests made during the protests were of Christians, when they composed less than 1% of the population. 58.4% of arrests were of peasants, and 3.9% were of laborers.

The Pyongan region played what historian Michael Shin argued was an outsized role in the protests. Many of the movement&#x27;s earliest protests were in the region, and a plurality of the signers were from there (11 of the 33). This region contained the second-largest city in Korea Pyongyang, was a center of Christianity, and produced a large number of intellectuals. North Hamgyong Province was the last province to join the protests; they began on March 10. Its protests have been characterized as less intense than others, possibly due to transportation being less developed there, as well as security being tighter due to it being on the border with both Russia and China. In addition, the ratio of Japanese security forces to civilians was lower in the area. In Chūseihoku-dō (North Chungcheong Province) and Chūseinan-dō, some radical groups attacked and destroyed Japanese government offices and police stations. Zenrahoku-dō (North Jeolla Province) had protests that have been characterized as less intense than others. This has been attributed to the region being relatively depleted after having previously heavily participated in the 1894–1895 Donghak Peasant Revolution and subsequent righteous army conflicts. In this province and in Zenranan-dō (South Jeolla Province), students often played a significant role in protests.

Women both led and participated in many of the protests. A group of female students wrote a public letter entitled &quot;From Korean School Girls&quot; to world leaders that was reprinted in international newspapers. The role of women in the protests was hailed by international feminist observers, and described as a milestone in their changing social status, especially in contrast to their status during the conservative Joseon period.

=== Korean diaspora protests ===
==== Manchuria ====
On March 7, Koreans in Manchuria learned of the movement. They held a large protest in Longjing on March 13. Estimates of the number of protestors vary, although some put the number of protestors at around 20,000 to 30,000. This was around 10% of the total Korean population of the region at the time. One person, who had sent her son to the protest, later recalled what she had heard of it:

Japanese authorities pressured the Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin into suppressing the protest. This resulted in around 17 to 19 deaths. Like in Korea, the Koreans continued to hold protests for weeks afterwards; by mid-May they would host at least 50 more.

==== Russia ====
Koreans in Russia also learned of the protests, and began organizing their own. In Ussuriysk, a protest was held and suppressed on March 17. The Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan had been part of the Allies of World War I, and had signed agreements to suppress the Korean independence movement. Inspired by the Ussuriysk protest, the Koreans of the enclave Sinhanch&#x27;on in Vladivostok launched their own that same day, which was also suppressed. They launched another the following day.

In Moscow on August 12, a public rally in support of the March First Movement was held, and was reportedly attended by around 200 people, including at least one Soviet politician. The rally was left-leaning; its speakers, including an ethnic Korean Red Army officer (likely Yi Ouitjyong), interpreted the movement in a socialist framework and advocated for Koreans to ally with the Soviet Union and fight Japan.

==== United States ====
Koreans in Hawaii organized an impromptu meeting upon hearing of the protests that was attended by around 600. A followup meeting dubbed the First Korean Congress was symbolically held in Philadelphia, which they viewed as &quot;the cradle of liberty&quot; in the U.S. They sent statements to President Wilson, but were ignored.

== Suppression ==

The Japanese Government-General of Chōsen was reportedly unaware that the protests would occur until they began, and was surprised by the scale and intensity of them. It rushed to recruit people from various backgrounds, including firemen and security guards at railroads, to stop the protests. The government-general received more military police and police officers from Japan, as well as more army divisions. They equipped these groups with lethal weapons and distributed them around Korea.

A significant number of mass murders of Korean civilians occurred. There are numerous reports of Japanese authorities around the peninsula opening fire or conducting organized bayonet charges on unarmed protestors.

During an intense raid on Suwon and Anseong, Japanese authorities reportedly burnt 276 private homes down, killed 29, and arrested around 2,000 people. Many Koreans were tortured and executed. On April 6, the occurred, during which Japanese authorities entered a village at night, set it on fire, and killed people who attempted to put the fires out. On April 15, during the now infamous Jeamni massacre, Japanese authorities lured 20 to 30 Korean civilians into a church, opened fire on them, then burned the church down to hide evidence of the killings.

There are reports of crucifixions being performed on Korean Christians; this is attested to in one photograph, which was reprinted in American newspapers and paired with expressions of outrage. Korean schoolgirls are attested to being stripped and publicly flogged. An anecdote attested to claims a girl had her hand cut off by a Japanese soldier because she was holding a copy of the declaration. She then reportedly switched to holding the item in her other hand, and continued to protest.

One female student of Ewha Haktang gave a testimony that was later submitted into the American Congressional Record:

An April 12 cablegram, sent from Shanghai to the Korean National Association in San Francisco, read:

Foreigners were also reportedly persecuted by Japanese authorities. American missionary Eli M. Mowry was sentenced to hard labor for allegedly harboring demonstrators. An American woman was reportedly attacked in Pyongyang. According to the League of Friends of Korea, two American women &quot;were beaten by the Japanese soldiers for no other reason than they were sympathetic with the Koreans&quot;. Japanese authorities searched the residences of foreigners, reportedly without warrant.

According to an August 15 article in the Soviet newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot;, gatherings became treated with suspicion by Japanese authorities. In one instance, after a Korean attendee of a wedding was found to have documents linking him to the independence movement, Japanese authorities raided the wedding and conducted mass beatings and arrests.

=== Prison conditions ===

There are numerous reports of prison conditions being extremely poor. Seoul&#x27;s Seodaemun Prison became infamous for the mistreatment and extrajudicial killings of prisoners. There, women were stripped naked in front of male guards. An April 22, 1919 pamphlet by the Presbyterian Church in America read:

There are reports that conditions were extremely cramped and dirty, and that some rooms were so cramped that people were unable to sit or lie down. William R. Giles, a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, reportedly witnessed 30 prisoners being kept in a single room in a Pyongyang prison. Koreans were reportedly kept separate from Japanese prisoners, and given worse facilities. Another issue was heating; physician Jessie Hirst, head of Severance Hospital, reported that four nurses from his hospital were arrested for protesting in the winter of 1919. They were kept in conditions so cold that their hands, feet, and one of their faces froze. There are reports that prisoners were made to strip down in one building and run to another in the cold. One woman reportedly was made to walk from one prison barefoot through the snow to another in order to be processed for her release.

After experiencing poor treatment during her prison intake, one girl was reportedly let go the following day without ever being formally charged of any crimes, nor ever going to trial.

=== Yu Gwan-sun ===
Yu Gwan-sun, a 16-year-old participant in the protests, has since become a symbol of March First Movement, and is now remembered in South Korea as a martyr. On the first day of the protests, Yu, then a student at Ewha Haktang, participated in the protest in Seoul. On March 5, she participated in another protest at Namdaemun in Seoul and was arrested. Missionaries from her school negotiated her release. She then returned to her hometown of Cheonan, albeit with a smuggled copy of the Declaration of Independence. From there, she went from village to village, spreading the news of the protests and encouraging people to organize their own. On April 1, 3,000 protestors gathered in Cheonan. The Japanese military police opened fire on the protestors and killed 19; among the dead were Yu&#x27;s parents.

Yu was arrested and detained at Seodaemun Prison. She was reportedly unrepentant despite repeated beatings and torture. She eventually died of her injuries on September 28, 1920.

== Statistics ==
Statistics on the March First Movement are uncertain, and are a subject of controversy.

=== March First Movement Database ===
In 2019, the National Institute of Korean History (NIKH) of South Korea published an online March First Movement Database () to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the movement. The compilation of the database began in 2016, and was reportedly the largest ever data gathering on the movement. It also represented the first time that the South Korean government promoted a single set of statistics on the movement. The database aggregates evidence and numbers from over 27,729 sources; these have been digitized and are available on the website. The database has been updated on at least one occasion to reflect the NIKH&#x27;s ongoing research on the movement.

The database intentionally provides conservative estimates on the protests; the database&#x27;s curators suspect that actual numbers are much higher. Events and numbers are reportedly only included if there is known surviving evidence for them that is deemed sufficiently reliable. A significant portion of evidence used for the database comes from Japanese sources; the colonial government was known to alter its records for political reasons. The instability during and extrajudicial actions taken during the movement&#x27;s suppression also reduced the amount of surviving evidence.

=== Park Eun-sik&#x27;s statistics ===
Many sources cite the statistics provided in the 1920 history book by Korean scholar Park Eun-sik.

An article in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; argues it is possible that the numbers are even higher, as Japanese authorities continued pursuing and arresting protestors for years afterwards.

=== Japanese statistics ===
One Japanese police report claimed that there were 1,214 protests with 1.1 million participants; South Korean historian Kwon Tae-eok argued that Japanese sources were incentivized to artificially lower these numbers, and evaluated Park&#x27;s estimate as plausible.

From March 1 to April 11, Japanese officials reported 553 people killed, and more than 12,000 arrested. They said that 8 policemen and military were killed, and 158 wounded. Japanese soldiers were harmed during the protests, with a number of deaths and over a hundred wounded.

== Japanese disinformation campaign ==
Japan attempted to stop information about the event from leaving the peninsula. Major Japanese newspapers made some initial reports on the event; they almost uniformly downplayed its scale and did not cover it as the main story. Eventually, the Japanese government issued restrictions on what could be published of the protests, and coverage on them significantly slowed. The English-language newspapers &quot;The Japan Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Japan Advertiser&quot; published a number of articles that were about the violent suppression of the movement, with the latter covering the events of the Jeamni massacre.

=== Information leak ===
Foreign witnesses in Korea played a significant role in documenting and photographing the movement, as well as sharing information on it abroad. The first communication on it to leave the Japanese empire was in English and went to Shanghai. This led to the first international article on the movement being published there on March 4. News of the protests first reached the United States on March 10, via a cablegram sent by Korean independence activists in Shanghai to San Francisco. By the following day, the story appeared in American papers. Some articles questioned the veracity of the story; in the March 11 issue of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, judge John Albert Matthewman, who had previously volunteered for the Red Cross in Korea, stated that he felt that Koreans in Shanghai had fabricated the story. He argued that Japan had been so repressive that such a large-scale protest was nearly impossible.

=== Japanese statements ===
Japan had been conducting a public relations campaign in the U.S. for at least a decade prior to the movement. Information on Korea had previously largely reached the U.S. through well-funded Japanese media channels. These narratives deliberately portrayed Korea as in need of civilizing, and Japan as a positive influence on the peninsula.

In response to the increasing numbers of foreign inquiries, various Japanese entities released public statements that promoted a range of narratives. Some denied that protests had occurred in Korea at all, some downplayed the scale of them, and some claimed that they had been fully suppressed much earlier than in reality. There are records of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting that the United States and Germany stop their newspapers from publishing claims about the protests that it deemed to be rumors.

A number of Japanese statements described the protests as the violent riots of extremist upstarts, highlighted Japanese casualties of the protests, and claimed any violence while suppressing the protests was done in self defense. Some statements, such as one published in the &quot;Great Falls Daily Tribune&quot; on April 15, 1919, portrayed the protests as left-wing Bolshevik uprisings, and portrayed Japan as attempting to halt the spread of communism. Many statements blamed Christian missionaries for inciting the unrest.

In April 1919, Japanese politician Gotō Shinpei gave a speech at a luncheon attended by U.S. Treasurer John Burke. Gotō argued that Japan was on a civilizing mission in Korea and that its intentions were noble. He blamed reported abuses on low-level colonial authorities. He argued that Korea&#x27;s annexation was legal, and likened the legal arguments for the annexation to those used to justify the American occupations of Puerto Rico and of the Philippines.

Japanese diplomats published statements in which they claimed Koreans were uncivilized and incapable of self-governance. Japanese academic Nitobe Inazō toured the U.S. and gave speeches and wrote articles promoting these narratives. In a June 24 article, he argued that Koreans were so incapable of self-governance, that if Japan granted them independence for a six-month trial period, they would request to be colonized again.

Articles in the colonial government–backed newspaper &quot;Keijō Nippō&quot; echoed these narratives. One such article read:

In January 1920, Governor-General Saitō published a four-page statement in the magazine &quot;The Independent&quot;, in which he argued that Koreans had been exaggerating or completely lying about the protests. He argued that Japan had &quot;no other desire than to improve the condition of the Korean people&quot;. He claimed that he would create a government so good that Koreans would choose to abandon their identity in order to become Japanese. His administration published a number of texts in English about Korea, such as &quot;Pictorial Korea&quot; and &quot;Educational Korea&quot;, that promoted these messages.

=== Statements from foreign supporters of Japan ===
Foreigners sympathetic to Japan repeated claims that Koreans were uncivilized and incapable of self-governance; their statements were published in various newspapers internationally. Examples include Prof. Edmund Davison of Drew University (whom was born in Japan), Sidney Gulick, and former diplomatic advisor to Japan George Trumbull Ladd.

The English Church Mission (ECM) in Korea, unlike a significant majority of other missionaries in Korea, often expressed views more sympathetic to Japan. Their reports expressed doubt that Japanese authorities were intentionally killing Korean protestors.

=== Rebuttals from foreigners ===
In March, thirty foreign missionaries in Korea met and planned how they could draw international attention to Japan&#x27;s acts in Korea; they reportedly adopted the slogan &quot;No Neutrality for Brutality&quot;. Schofield and other foreign missionaries documented the protests and shared information with the international press. In August, Schofield traveled to Japan on behalf of the missionaries in Korea. He conducted a range of activities to publicize what he had seen. He met with Prime Minister Hara Takashi and other prominent Japanese politicians and asked them to take action to stop the violent suppression of the protests. He gave a public lecture to hundreds of foreign missionaries in Japan, in which he strongly criticized colonial policies. The missionaries published a number of articles and rebuttals in Korea, Japan, and abroad about the protest. For example, a report in the colonial government–backed English-language &quot;The Seoul Press&quot; claimed prison conditions were like those of a health resort; Schofield published a rebuttal that ridiculed the claim and described in detail the methods of torture employed by the Japanese. In retaliation for his acts, Japan pressured him into leaving Korea in 1920.

American journalist Valentine S. McClatchy, publisher of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, was in Seoul and witnessed Gojong&#x27;s funeral and much of the early protests. He described Japanese investigators following him and searching his house in an apparent effort to stop him from leaking information about the protests. McClatchy would eventually leave Korea on March 17, but made a point of traveling around the peninsula and documenting what he saw before his departure. Upon his return, he dedicated the front page of the &quot;Bee&quot;&#x27;s April 6 issue to the protests, and criticized Japan for manipulating information on the event.

American missionary Homer Hulbert, who had previously served as a personal envoy of the Korean monarch Gojong, published articles and gave speeches on the Korean situation to large audiences in the U.S. On one occasion, he gave a speech to 1,200 people in Ohio. On March 1, 1921, he gave a speech to 1,300 people in New York City.

A number of churches argued that Japan should alter its policies in Korea, although they did not openly advocate for Korea&#x27;s independence. The Commission on Relations with the Orient of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ conducted a three-month investigation of the protests and published a 125-page report that concured with Korean reporting. The Presbyterian Church in Canada compiled and published a report with its evidence of the protests&#x27; suppression. One of its foreign mission board secretaries wrote, &quot;Mails and cables are censored and the World is kept in ignorance whilst Japan is posing as a civilized nation&quot;.

=== Rebuttals from the Korean diaspora ===
Korean-American independence activists attempted to sway U.S. public opinion on the protests through writings and speeches. They established the League of Friends of Korea in April, which was dedicated to publicizing the independence movement. The organization would eventually have branches in 19 cities and upwards of 10,000 members. In 1921, Henry Chung published &quot;The Case of Korea&quot;, a book that criticized Japanese colonialism and advocated for Korean independence. Japan attempted to halt the book&#x27;s publication. In spite of this, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an abridged version of the book, and the entire book was submitted into the American Congressional Record. Chung gave dozens of talks on his book and, according to scholar Brandon Palmer, became a noted figure in American intellectual circles, with significant audiences at his talks. Some of their writings strategically focused on the disproportionate persecution of Korean Christians, which they knew would evoke sympathy from American audiences. They also placed Korea&#x27;s situation in the context of increasing Japanese colonialism and aggression, particularly that in China.

In Russia, Korean journalists published writings in newspapers such as the &quot;Hanin Sinbo&quot; about the protests that were quoted by Russian journalists.

According to the analysis of one South Korean journalist, international publications became increasingly skeptical of Japan&#x27;s narratives as time progressed. According to the analysis of Palmer, Korean public relations efforts continued into the early 1920s. They attempted to push for recognition at the 1921–1922 Washington Naval Conference, but were rebuffed. At the conference, Japan relinquished its holdings in Shandong and agreed to a number of demilitarization and openness policies. Palmer theorizes that these concessions quelled American criticisms of Japan. Palmer argued that the pro-Korea media campaign had some lasting success in influencing American opinion of Japan and Korea. However, the overall American public remained apathetic about Korea, and no significant policy changes occurred as a result of it.

== Japanese reactions and policy changes ==
In Japan and abroad, the movement was widely seen as an embarrassment to the colonial government. Scholar Penny Bailey argues that the majority of Japanese opinions in publications supported the colonial government and Japanese colonialism. Others publicly debated what was dubbed &quot;the Japan–Korea problem&quot; (), and presented a range of opinions on what caused the protests, how serious they were, and how to prevent future unrest.

Public intellectual Sakuzō Yoshino published articles in Japanese and at least one in English, in which he described Japan&#x27;s colonialism as a noble venture, but condemned the assimilation of and discrimination towards Koreans as causing humanitarian concerns. His writings reportedly attracted criticism from nationalists. Right-wing expansionist group Kokuryūkai, while not advocating for granting Koreans independence, reportedly promoted granting Korea some degree of &quot;domestic self-governance&quot;.

Some, especially those in the Japanese left wing, criticized the colonial government and argued that the movement began because colonial policies had been too repressive. Journalist Tanzan Ishibashi, as part of his &quot;Small Japan&quot; ideology (), reportedly welcomed the movement and saw it as signaling the end of colonial rule in Korea. He reportedly saw it as a part of the global trend of liberalization, and argued that Japan had previously treated Koreans extremely poorly. Japanese Koreanist and art historian Yanagi Sōetsu&#x27;s sympathy towards Korea reportedly increased after the protests. He became a significant voice in advocating for the protection of Korean art and architecture, although modern Korean nationalists have reportedly criticized his participation in what they view as the colonial government&#x27;s subsequent superficial cultural appeasement efforts. Yanagi publicly condemned assimilation efforts and was eventually met with censorship.

=== Cultural rule ===

The colonial government enacted a number of concessions after the protests. Many of these efforts have been grouped under the name &quot; (); this was in contrast to the previous era, which has been dubbed &quot; (). These policies allowed several limited cultural freedoms and programs for Koreans. This included permission for several Korean newspapers to be founded, which resulted in the creation of the now newspapers of record &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot; and &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;, as well as the establishment of institutions like the Chōsen Art Exhibition and the Government-General of Chōsen Library. Access to print materials and the arts significantly expanded. In addition, while the colonial government had previously been more consistently dismissive towards Korean culture, it began conceding that Korea had some unique traditions worthy of protection and development.

A number of commentators have evaluated these policy changes as being largely cosmetic and intended to appease Koreans and international observers. An August 22, 1919 article in American newspaper &quot;The Evening Star&quot; described one such concession as &quot;merely one of those face-saving diplomatic schemes of Japan&quot;.

Historian Michael Shin argues that colonial authority actually expanded during this period. Colonial expenditures doubled from 1919 to 1921, policies encouraged active management of Korean culture instead of passive punishment, and the police presence and intervention in Korea&#x27;s economy increased. Koreans saw little improvement to their socioeconomic conditions and civil rights as a result of these policies. Throughout the period of cultural rule, Japan continued violently suppressing the Korean independence movement. By the late 1930s, many of these concessions were retracted, and assimilation was enforced with greater intensity.

==International reactions==
Many governments and media outlets learned of the movement within several weeks of its beginning. No major foreign governments challenged Japan&#x27;s rule over Korea. This was largely due to each government determining that forwarding their policy goals with Japan outweighed offering support to Korea. Journalists and some individual politicians voiced criticism towards Japan&#x27;s suppression of the protests.

=== United States ===
The U.S. did not take any significant action in favor of Korea as a result of the protests. The scholar Brandon Palmer argued that even if the U.S. did publicly support Korean independence, circumstances still made it unlikely that Korea would be liberated as result of this. Furthermore, he noted that the U.S. had been engaging in its own colonialism and violently suppressing its own subjects, and that expressing support for Korean independence would have appeared hypocritical.

In April 1919, the U.S. State Department told their ambassador to Japan that &quot;the consulate [in Seoul] should be extremely careful not to encourage any belief that the United States will assist the Korean nationalists in carrying out their plans and that it should not do anything which may cause Japanese authorities to suspect [the] American Government sympathizes with the Korean nationalist movement&quot;. Leo A. Bergholz, American consul-general in Seoul, reportedly expressed some sympathy towards the Korean protestors and advocated for colonial reforms, but otherwise adopted a passive stance. 

A small number of individual American politicians expressed sympathy for Korea and the protests. Missouri Senator Selden P. Spencer wrote the foreword for Henry Chung&#x27;s &quot;The Case of Korea&quot;. On July 15 and in August, in the context of opposing the ratification of the articles of the League of Nations, Republican senators Miles Poindexter and George W. Norris submitted into the Congressional Record dissents that cited Korea as an example of a nation the organization had failed to aid. Norris also served as vice-president of the League of Friends of Korea. A tabled resolution in support of Korean independence was rejected by the Senate on March 18, 1920. In 1921, Congress condemned the violent suppression of the movement, but affirmed Japan&#x27;s authority over Korea. The statement claimed that Korea was &quot;as fixedly a part of [Japan] as California, Arizona, and New Mexico are a part of the United States&quot;.

Palmer argues that &quot;the overwhelming response of the American public to the plight of Korea was apathy&quot;. The movement had occurred in the aftermath of World War I, and American attention was often focused on affairs in Europe. A number of non-politician Americans joined the League of Friends of Korea and expressed support for the Korean independence movement.

The movement did receive coverage in the American press, although often sporadically and not as the main story. A South Korean journalist claims that &quot;The New York Times&quot; had published an article critical of the Korean independence movement just a month prior to the protest, but shifted to expressing sympathy soon afterwards. On June 15, the paper dedicated the entirety of one of its six pages to coverage of modern Korean history and the protests, with a full reprint of the text of the Korean Declaration of Independence.

=== China ===

The Chinese government did not openly advocate for Korea&#x27;s independence, but Chinese politicians and press frequently voiced sympathy and praise for the movement. The prominent newspaper &quot;Republic Daily News&quot; covered the protests on a daily basis for some time. One of its articles contained the line, &quot;If the [protestor] in front falls, the one behind continues marching forward. [The Koreans] truly do not fear death&quot;. Chinese politician Chen Duxiu, in his magazine &quot;The Weekly Review&quot; (), praised the protests and advocated for Chinese people to follow the Korean example. Other prominent figures in modern China, including Mao Zedong and Fu Ssu-nien, also voiced their support. Student journalists of Peking University similarly wrote favorably of the protests. These sentiments were echoed by English-language newspapers in China, including the &quot;Peking Daily News&quot; and &quot;Peking and Tientsin Times&quot;.

One Yonhap News Agency reporter argued that a letter from an anonymous Korean student to U.S. President Wilson was possibly significant in influencing Chinese public opinion on the protests. Although it is unknown if the U.S. ever received the letter, it was widely republished in Chinese papers and was followed by a shift towards more sympathetic reporting towards Korea.

=== Russia ===
At the time of the movement, Russia was engaged in the Russian Civil War and Russian Revolution. The foreign ministry of the anti-Bolshevik Russian State consulted with Japan in March, then officially took a neutral stance on the protest.

The Bolsheviks frequently expressed solidarity with the Koreans. Several South Korean and American scholars and journalists have since argued that the protesting Koreans were from across the political spectrum, and that Lenin and the Bolsheviks actively sought to link movements such as these with their cause, as they stood to benefit from doing so. After the Soviet Union assumed control over territories with significant Korean populations in the Russian Far East, it allowed and sometimes encouraged Koreans to openly express support for the Korean independence movement.

Due to the civil war, overall awareness of the movement was likely low amongst the general Russian public, although it was still covered in major papers. Reporting on it was also possibly relatively delayed compared to in other countries; a 2019 study on global coverage of the protests claimed that a May 3 article in the leftist newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; is the earliest known Russian article on the protests. The article criticized Japan&#x27;s violent suppression of the protests, as well as the subsequent disinformation campaign.

=== United Kingdom ===
The government and press of the United Kingdom generally expressed negative views on the protest. Sympathy to Korea possibly increased after the April 15 Jeamni massacre. No officials advocated for Korea&#x27;s independence, and many promoted views that were aligned with Japanese narratives. The U.K. and Japan were then in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance; the U.K. had previously advocated for Korea&#x27;s annexation by Japan, and blocked Korea&#x27;s attempts to protest the annexation at the Hague Convention of 1907.

Early on, British newspapers such as &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, based on information from &quot;Reuters&quot;, described the movement as &quot;riots&quot; and the protestors as violent mobs that attacked authorities and burned down buildings. One article on the movement, titled &quot;Bolshevism in Korea&quot;, repeated Japanese claims that leftist Koreans in Shanghai were attempting to cause a violent revolution in Korea.

The English Church Mission in Korea reportedly attempted to maintain a middle ground position between what it viewed as Korean terrorism after the protests and the oppression of the colonial government. Bishop Mark Trollope advocated for Japan&#x27;s continued rule in Korea and praised the cultural rule reforms. The ECM&#x27;s positions on these issues reportedly alienated potential Korean converts.

Some British officials expressed sympathy for Korea, including William Royds, William Grenfell Max Muller, and George Curzon. Curzon and Beilby Alston pressed the Japanese government to quell the violence. Alston reportedly told Japan that the Japanese authorities were &quot;outhunning the Huns&quot; and &quot;outrivalling Germans in war&quot;. A number of British officials advocated for degrees of self-governance in Korea, although this was opposed by Japan.

In the early 1920s, British members of parliament Arthur Hayday and Thomas Walter Grundy sympathetically mentioned the issue of Korea, and asked what could be done for it. In addition, a society that advocated for Korea&#x27;s independence formed in both the U.K. and France called The Friends of Korea (). None of these efforts resulted in significant action.

==== British Empire ====
Papers in British Malaya, while still generally in line with reporting in the U.K., shared information about Japan&#x27;s violent response. One article of &quot;The Malaya Tribune&quot; argued that Japan would not be able to stop the unrest through violence. A response to a reader question in the April 2 issue of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; attempted to justify why Korea&#x27;s sovereignty was not approved for discussion at the Paris Peace Conference.

For British India, a 2019 South Korean examination did not find many newspapers articles about the movement. A Yonhap reporter theorized that this was possibly due to India being a British colony at the time. One article entitled &quot;Korean Unrest&quot; was published in &quot;The Hindu&quot; on March 27, and included synthesized information from &quot;Reuters&quot; reports. This and another report on April 16 described the movement as a violent armed rebellion. Later coverage of Korean issues in the paper is reportedly infrequent and brief.

=== Other countries ===
The French government, which was then hosting the Paris Peace Conference that Koreans were still petitioning to be represented at, reportedly cautiously monitored the movement&#x27;s progression. A Yonhap reporter argued that the government was concerned that the movement would inspire similar anti-colonial protests in its own territories. The movement received wide coverage in French newspapers. Left-leaning and anti-colonialist newspapers such as &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; praised the movement. A number of French newspapers published an anecdote about female Korean students in Kaesong singing the French song La Marseillaise, which is often associated with the French Revolution, during the protests.

A Yonhap reporter argued that sentiment in Australia did not match that of the U.K., and claimed that articles often expressed skeptical criticism of Japan&#x27;s handling of the movement.

Mexican newspapers began publishing on the movement on March 13, and reportedly widely condemned Japan&#x27;s actions. The Korean community in Mexico launched a fundraising campaign in response to the movement, and sent the raised funds to Korean independence activists in Shanghai. Despite the community living in significant poverty, one estimate claims the Koreans there donated an average of 20% of their income to the independence movement.

Germany reportedly had little coverage of the movement, possibly due to instability after its loss in World War I. The first known mention of the protest appeared in &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; on March 22, 1919, and consisted of two sentences: &quot;The unrest in Korea has been suppressed. There is peace again&quot;. Subsequent coverage was reportedly often short, as much reporting was devoted to domestic issues.

Italy reportedly had limited coverage of the movement, with the first known article being in the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; on August 23. The article described the colonial government&#x27;s reform efforts, and did not explicitly mention the protests. Several South Korean scholars argued that, as a colonial power itself, Italy was incentivized to not incite anti-colonialist sentiment. In addition, Italy and Japan had signed a number of friendly treaties and agreements around this time.

== Legacy and interpretations ==

The legacy of the March First Movement is still actively debated by scholars. While the movement did not secure Korea&#x27;s liberation, it had a number of significant effects for Korea and a number of other countries. Independence activist sentiment amongst global Koreans flared. The 1926 June Tenth Movement, which was sparked by the death of Gojong&#x27;s son Sunjong, had many similar protest actions take place. Amidst the violent repression of the protests and the hunt for its participants and leaders, numerous Koreans fled the peninsula. A number of them congregated in Shanghai, and in April 1919, they founded the Korean Provisional Government (KPG). This government is now considered a predecessor to the modern government of South Korea, and holds an important place in the independence movement and in South Korean identity.

Since the occurrence of the movement, varying groups have interpreted its character and significance in a number of ways. Some left-leaning interpretations analyze the event using Marxist and socialist frameworks, with some reportedly interpreting the movement as a failed proletariat revolution, and something only to be remembered but not celebrated. Since the division of Korea, both the North and South Korean governments have promoted differing analyses of Korean history. The scholar Dennis Hart argues that all nations participate in the curation of national histories in order to influence politics, and that the division and creation of rival states has created the need for two historical narratives from a single past.

Historian Michael Shin views the movement as a turning point for Korean nationalism, from being spearheaded by the elite to popular action. The resulting cultural rule period also led to the proliferation of Korean print media, which in turn further bolstered nationalist sentiment.

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, the movement is widely considered to be a landmark moment in the formation of the modern Korean national identity.

The constitution of South Korea mentions the movement in its first sentence: &quot;We, the people of Korea, proud of a resplendent history and traditions dating from time immemorial, upholding the cause of the Provisional Republic of Korea Government born of the March First Independence Movement of 1919...&quot;

In South Korea, the event&#x27;s link to the establishment of the Korean Provisional Government is promoted, so as to bolster that government&#x27;s legitimacy.

=== North Korea ===
In North Korea, the event is taught as a turning point where the family of eight-year-old Kim Il Sung&#x27;s took the lead of the independence movement. The epicenter of the movement is taught as being Pyongyang instead of Seoul, and the contributions of figures who became influential in the later South Korean government are downplayed. The thirty-three national representatives are described as having surrendered immediately after reading their declaration. Hart printed this translated excerpt from &quot;Chosŏn Ryŏksa&quot;, a North Korean history textbook used from 1984 to 1990:

While scholars in both the South and North are in relative consensus that the movement was unlikely to result in Korea&#x27;s prompt liberation, North Korean textbooks reportedly argue that the movement failed because it lacked Kim&#x27;s central leadership.

=== Other independence movements ===

The March First Movement had some impact on other protest movements around this time, although the extent of the impact is actively debated. A number of historians have argued that the various protests occurred in differing political circumstances and with different causes, and are thus difficult to directly attribute to the March First Movement.

Several weeks after the March First Movement, organizers of the May Fourth Movement in China such as Fu Ssu-nien cited the March First Movement as one of their inspirations. That protest has since been evaluated as a critical moment in modern Chinese history.

Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi read of the peaceful protests while in South Africa. He reportedly decided to return to India soon afterwards and launch the non-cooperation movement.

In the U.S.-occupied Philippines, university students in Manila held a pro-independence protest in June 1919, and cited the March First Movement as inspiration.

In British-occupied Egypt, students of Cairo University held a pro-independence protest amidst the 1919 Egyptian revolution, and cited the March First Movement as an inspiration.

=== The movement as a revolution ===
There is debate over where the movement can be considered a revolution. Historian Youngseo Baik argues that it can be, as the movement advocated for significant political change and has had lasting impact on Korean political thought.

=== Apology ===
In August 2015, Yukio Hatoyama, who had previously served as Prime Minister of Japan for nine months, visited Seodaemun Prison and apologized for how the prisoners had been treated.

== Commemorations ==

=== History and description ===
The March First Movement has been commemorated for each year since its occurrence, in both Korea and amongst the Korean diaspora. Historically, both left- and right-leaning Korean groups have celebrated the occasion. For example, in China in the 1920s, the rivaling right-leaning and left-leaning KNRP made a point of hosting a joint ceremony to bridge their political divide and demonstrate unity to observers.

During the colonial period, independence activists scheduled speeches, rallies, and protests for the day. In Korea and amongst Koreans in Japan and in Manchuria, these events were often hosted in secret. The newspaper &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot; openly commemorated the day in Korea on a number of occasions and was punished for doing so.

Commemorations typically involve readings of the declaration, speeches, nationalist music, and the displaying of nationalist symbols, particularly the &quot;taegeukgi&quot; (flag). A number of songs have been written and performed for these meetings, with several attested to in Shanghai and Manchuria in the 1920s. Scholar Choe Seon-ung () wrote that for the left-leaning Korean National Revolutionary Party in the 1930s, efforts were made to reduce the number of nationalist symbols in ceremonies, so as to promote proletarian internationalism. Social events, especially dinners (or if funds were insufficient, refreshments), and events such as sports festivals, also accompanied many ceremonies. Koreans are also attested to boarding cars decorated with nationalist symbols and driving around whilst distributing leaflets about the independence movement.

Commemorations have historically been funded by private donations, organization membership fees, and government grants. There are records of Koreans across the economic and social spectrum in Russia, China, the United States, and Cuba donating money for commemoration events.

Choe argues that after the division of Korea, ceremonies reflected the increasing political polarization. In the southern United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK), right- and left-leaning groups held separate commemorations. Right-leaning groups continued to prominently display nationalist symbols. Ceremonies also came to involve Korean reunification sentiment.

=== South Korea ===
In the USAMGIK, March 1 was made a holiday in February 1946. Various events were held in Seoul on that year&#x27;s anniversary. Early on that day, a left-leaning group held a ceremony at the mountain Namsan. A major celebration was held at the Bosingak pavilion. Present at the event were Syngman Rhee, Kim Ku, and O Se-chang. Absent at the ceremony was Choe Nam-seon, the author of the declaration; in the years succeeding the movement, he had collaborated with the Japanese.

On Jeju Island on March 1, 1947, a rally with 30,000 people in attendance was held in which (opposition of the Allied occupation of Korea) was linked to the spirit of the March First Movement.

On October 1, 1949, South Korea designated March 1 as the national holiday Samiljeol (), and ceremonies were designated to be organized by the federal and local governments. Each year, a reenactment of the reading of the declaration is held in Tapgol Park. In 1950, South Korea recognized a song about the movement by Jeong In-bo (), one of several written and performed about the movement, as the official song for its commemorations.In 2018, President Moon Jae-in&#x27;s administration established the Commission on the Centennial Anniversary of March 1st Independence Movement and the Korean Provisional Government (KPG) to celebrate these occasions. The KPG was the government-in-exile of Korea during the Japanese occupation, and a predecessor of the current government. North Korea refused to participate in the joint project of the anniversary due to &quot;scheduling issues&quot;. The commission ceased its operation in June 2020.

=== North Korea ===

In 1946, the Provisional People&#x27;s Committee of North Korea made the occasion a national holiday. This later changed; the holiday was renamed to &quot;The People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Uprising Memorial Day&quot; () and demoted from the status of national holiday. Commemorations are reportedly mostly central, with few local celebrations. The events are geared towards inciting anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiment.

Before the division of Korea, the &quot;taegeukgi&quot; flag and Aegukga anthem were widely associated with commemorations of the movement, but over time, these disappeared in both North Korean commemorations and historical writings on the movement. Choe theorizes that this is the result of these symbols becoming more associated with right-leaning Koreans over time.

=== Japan ===

Koreans who arrived in Japan before 1945 (called &quot;Zainichi Koreans&quot;) and their descendents have commemorated the movement on an annual basis. Commemorations were more possible in the countryside than in the cities, as pressure from Japanese authorities was lower there. On a number of occasions, Koreans used unrelated events, such as school concerts and union meetings, as covers for commemoration ceremonies and rallies. Police officers arrived to break up some rallies. On a number of occasions, Koreans held surprise mass demonstrations in the open. In 1921, Korean students held a rally in Hibiya Park in Tokyo. The police were reportedly surprised by its occurrence, and rushed to gather officers in order to disperse it. In 1923, around 300 Korean students approached Ueno Park in order to conduct another rally, but found that Japanese police had already been stationed there in high concentrations. The Koreans reportedly conducted the protest regardless. In 1925, a rally at Tokyo Imperial University led to violent clashes with police, the involvement of the military to suppress the unrest, and ten arrests.

=== Soviet Union ===

Commemorations of the movement in the Soviet Union were allowed relative freedom. Koreans marched on streets and gave speeches in public venues. Buildings were also booked for ceremonies and rallies, and plays were performed by Korean theater companies. The Korean enclave Sinhanch&#x27;on in Vladivostok commemorated the anniversary of the movement each year from 1920 until its dissolution in 1937.

=== China ===

In Manchuria, as Japanese influence over the region increased, open commemoration of the movement became increasingly met with repression. There, in 1932, an anti-Japanese insurgency arose that was dedicated to the March First Movement. Elsewhere in China, such as in Tianjin, Nanjing, and Hankou, Koreans met and held rallies. Some of these meetings were documented in Japanese intelligence reports. In 1925, Koreans in Tianjin distributed thousands of fliers about the independence movement around the city. In Shanghai, ceremonies were hosted by the Korean Residents Association () and not necessarily by the Korean Provisional Government, and various Korean organizations in the city were invited. Koreans have been attested to commemorating the day in the streets and in the open in the Shanghai French Concession. Amidst the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938, Korean members of the Korean National Revolutionary Party are attested to celebrating the day by singing the national anthem.

=== Other regions ===
Korean ethnic enclaves, especially Koreatowns, have hosted annual March First Movement commemorations. In 2024, events were hosted in a range of countries, including Brazil, Mongolia, Kuwait, Taiwan, and the United States.

Korean Mexicans in Mérida have celebrated the anniversary of the movement with public events in recent years. Some celebrations have included reenactments of the reading of the declaration and public marches.

Koreans in Cuba are also attested to holding celebrations.

In the United States, New York state designated March 1 as Yu Gwan-sun Day on February 27, 2024.

<text>Urtica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. Many species have stinging hairs and may be called nettles or stinging nettles (the latter name applying particularly to &quot;U. dioica&quot;). The generic name &quot;Urtica&quot; derives from the Latin for &#x27;sting&#x27;.

Due to the stinging hairs, &quot;Urtica&quot; are rarely eaten by herbivores, but provide shelter for insects. The fiber has historically been used by humans, and cooking preparations exist.

==Description==
&quot;Urtica&quot; species grow as annuals or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs. They can reach, depending on the type, location and nutrient status, a height of . The perennial species have underground rhizomes. The green parts have stinging hairs. Their often quadrangular stems are unbranched or branched, erect, ascending or spreading.

Most leaves and stalks are arranged across opposite sides of the stem. The leaf blades are elliptic, lanceolate, ovate or circular. The leaf blades usually have three to five, rarely up to seven veins. The leaf margin is usually serrate to more or less coarsely toothed. The often-lasting bracts are free or fused to each other. The cystoliths are extended to more or less rounded.

In 1874, while in Collioure (south of France), French botanist Charles Naudin discovered that a strong wind lasting 24 hours rendered the stinging hairs of nettles harmless for an entire week.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Phylogeny ===
The last common ancestor of the genus originated in Eurasia, with fossils being known from the Miocene of Germany and Russia, subsequently dispersing worldwide. Several species of the genus have undergone long distance oceanic dispersal, such as &quot;Hesperocnide sandwicensis&quot; (native to Hawaii) and &quot;Urtica ferox&quot; (native to New Zealand).

A large number of species included within the genus in the older literature are now recognised as synonyms of &quot;Urtica dioica&quot;. Some of these taxa are still recognised as subspecies. Genetic evidence indicates that the two species of &quot;Hesperocnide&quot; are part of this genus.

=== Etymology ===
The generic name &quot;Urtica&quot; derives from the Latin for &#x27;sting&#x27;.

==Ecology==

Due to the stinging hairs, &quot;Urtica&quot; species are rarely eaten by herbivores, but provide shelter for insects such as aphids, butterfly larvae, and moths. They are also consumed by caterpillars of numerous Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), such as the tortrix moth &quot;Syricoris lacunana&quot; and several Nymphalidae, e.g. &quot;Vanessa atalanta&quot;, a red admiral butterfly.

== Toxicity ==
Besides the stinging hairs in general, in New Zealand &quot;U. ferox&quot; is classified as a poisonous plant, most commonly upon skin contact.

==Uses==
Fabric woven of nettle fiber was found in burial sites in Denmark dating to the Bronze Age, and in clothing fabric, sailcloth, fishing nets, and paper via the process called retting (microbial enzymatic degradation, similar to linen processing). Other processing methods include mechanical and chemical.

=== Culinary ===
&quot;Urtica&quot; is an ingredient in soups, omelettes, banitsa, purée, and other dishes. In Mazandaran, northern Iran, a soup (Āsh) is made using this plant. Nettles were used in traditional practices to make nettle tea, juice, and ale, and to preserve cheeses, such as in Cornish Yarg.

==In folklore==
===Asian===
Milarepa, the Tibetan ascetic and saint, was reputed to have survived his decades of solitary meditation by subsisting on nothing but nettles; his hair and skin turned green and he lived to the age of 83.

===Caribbean===
The Caribbean trickster figure Anansi appears in a story about nettles, in which he has to chop down a huge nettle patch in order to win the hand of the king&#x27;s daughter.

===European===
An old Scots rhyme about the nettle:

:Gin ye be for lang kail coo the nettle, stoo the nettle
:Gin ye be for lang kail coo the nettle early
:Coo it laich, coo it sune, coo it in the month o&#x27; June
:Stoo it ere it&#x27;s in the bloom, coo the nettle early
:Coo it by the auld wa&#x27;s, coo it where the sun ne&#x27;er fa&#x27;s
:Stoo it when the day daws, coo the nettle early.

Coo, cow, and stoo are all Scottish for cut back or crop (although, curiously, another meaning of &quot;stoo&quot; is to throb or ache), while &quot;laich&quot; means short or low to the ground. Given the repetition of &quot;early,&quot; presumably this is advice to harvest nettles first thing in the morning and to cut them back hard (which seems to contradict the advice of the Royal Horticultural Society). Alternatively, it may be recommending harvesting early in the year before the plants grow tall, as they become tough and stringy later.

The English figure of speech &quot;grasp the nettle&quot;, meaning to nerve oneself to tackle a difficult task, stems from a belief that nettles actually sting less if gripped tightly. This belief gave rise to a well-known poem by Aaron Hill:
:Tender-handed, stroke a nettle,
:And it stings you for your pains.
:Grasp it like a man of mettle,
:And it soft as silk remains.
:&#x27;Tis the same, with common natures,
:Use ’em kindly, they rebel:
:But, be rough as Nutmeg-graters,
:And the rogues obey you well.

In Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy-tale &quot;The Wild Swans,&quot; the princess had to weave coats of nettles to break the spell on her brothers.

In the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s fairy-tale &quot;Maid Maleen&quot;, the princess and her maid must subsist on raw nettles while fleeing their war-ravaged kingdom. While standing in for the false bride during the wedding procession, she speaks to a nettle plant (which later proves her identity):
:Oh, nettle-plant,
:Little nettle-plant, 
:What dost thou here alone? 
:I have known the time 
:When I ate thee unboiled, 
:When I ate thee unroasted.

<text>Son Byong-hi (; 8 April 1861 – 19 May 1922) was a Korean religious leader and independence activist. His religious name was Uiam. He was the third leader of Donghak, an indigenous religious movement founded from 1860 to 1864.

The founder of Donghak, Choe Je-u (religious name Su-un), and the second leader, Choe Sihyeong (religious name Haewol), had both been executed. Haewol, Son&#x27;s mentor and predecessor, was involved in a peasant revolt in 1894 (referred to as the Donghak Peasant Revolution) and he was executed in connection with that in 1898. Thereafter, Son assumed leadership of Donghak but was forced to flee to Japan in March 1901. He was accompanied with his brother and chief lieutenant Yi Yong-gu.

In Japan, Son studied modern western ways which had been adopted by the Japanese after the Meiji Restoration. Up to that point Donghak was highly traditional, opposed to modernization and foreign intervention in Korea. Son pivoted from that world view by embracing modernization and accepting help from Japan to achieve that goal.

In 1902, He sent Yi back to Korea to act as his liaison. At Son&#x27;s direction, Yi founded a political organization known as Jungniphoe (Chungniphoe &quot;neutrality society&quot;) which was later reorganized as the Jinbohoe (Chinbohoe &quot;progressive society&quot;). One of the most notable of Jinbohoe activities was the organization of mass hair cutting ceremonies in which Korean men cut off their traditional topknots. Modernization through education was its top priority. It also had a pan-Asian outlook which encouraged Jinbohoe volunteers to aid the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War particularly in construction of a railroad to aid troop deployment.

Yi eventually went so far as to call for Japan to take over Korea&#x27;s affairs ostensibly because he thought the arrangement would be temporary and beneficial to Korea. In any event, after Japan forced Korea to become its protectorate, Son began to distance Donghak from Japanese affiliation. Son renamed Donghak as Cheondogyo (Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo, Religion of the Heavenly Way) on 1 December 1905. He took concrete steps to modernize it and to extend its doctrinal concepts of Heaven&#x27;s/God&#x27;s eminence in humankind. In September1906, he excommunicated Yi, who went on to form another branch of Donghak known as Sijeongyo (Sich&#x27;ŏn&#x27;gyo, Religion of Serving Heaven).

In 1910 Japan annexed Korea. As Japanese rule became more harsh Koreans began to feel that the situation was intolerable.  Finally in 1919, a mass demonstration was organized calling for Korean independence, with Cheondogyo, Christian and Buddhist religious leaders at the forefront of the movement.  A Declaration of Independence was drafted and Son was the first to sign it. After reading the declaration at the protest, he was voluntarily arrested. Although the first phase of the protest was peaceful, it became violent and was brutally suppressed by the Japanese. Son became ill in prison and was released. He died at home in 1922.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Son was born on 8 April 1861 in Cheongju, Chungcheong Province, Joseon. He was of the . Son was the son of the concubine of a minor official, and as such he was ineligible for government office. However, he was able to attain an education.  He was introduced to Donghak by his nephew who was a preacher and he joined in 1881 or 1882. He devoted himself to the new religion and was said to engage in long recitations of the Donghak incantation, the 21-character &quot;Jumun&quot;. He met Haewol and accompanied him on a 49-day retreat. His ties to Haewol were strengthened when Haewol married Son&#x27;s sister after his first wife died.

The Cheondogyo website includes a history with this description of Son&#x27;s dedication: &quot;After joining Donghak, ESon Sungsa . . . trained [extensively] reading [reciting] the Twenty-One [Character] Incantation thirty thousand times a day. In addition to reading the incantation in this way he made . . . straw sandals every day in his spare time. He went to the five-day periodic market in Cheongju and sold these sandals. He continued this life for three years.&quot; After this period, Son became the student of Haewol and entered a life of devoted study.

===Petition and 1894 rebellion===
Donghak&#x27;s founder Su-un had been executed in 1864 for his teachings which were heretical from a Neo-Confucian perspective and his assumed association with Catholicism.  However, by the early 1890s, Donghak had regained popularity particularly in Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces. Haewol was pressed to petition the government to exonerate Su-un and he complied.  While the petition movement was initially peaceful it turned violent, despite Haewol&#x27;s effort to prevent that from happening. This eventually led to a full scale revolt known as the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The Korean government requested aid from China to suppress the revolt which prompted Japan to deploy its army as well. Initially, only Donghak followers from the southern assembly, led by General Jeon Bongjun, participated while followers from the northern assembly held back. In the end, Haewol allowed his followers to join the rebels. but their joint force was defeated by the Japanese and Korean armies which had modern weapons. Jeon dispersed his rebel army on 28 November 1894, and was subsequently captured and executed. Donghak followers, particularly in the southern assembly were decimated. The northern assembly was less affected and Haewol managed to escape.

Cheondogyo sources indicate that Son participated in the petition movement and was a leader of northern assembly forces in the rebellion. Histories from Sijeongyo and outside sources make no mention of participation by Son.  In any event, Son was in Haewol&#x27;s inner circle following the rebellion.

===Aftermath of the rebellion===
Following the rebel defeat, Haewol and the top leadership of Donghak remained on the run from government authorities.  However, in 1895/96, Haewol began to rebuild the Donghak organization. He established a three person leadership group including Son called the Samam (the three &quot;am&quot;, referring to the last character of their religious names). It was at this time Son was given his honorific religious name.  The Samam were charged with administering Donghak (under Haewol&#x27;s direction) with &quot;one heart and mind&quot;.

Son and other leaders travel to the northern provinces of Hwanghae and Pyeongan provinces to proselytize. Yi Yong-gu, an associate of Son was a particularly successful missionary and Haewol rejoiced at the success there. From that time the northwest became the main center of Donghak. The expansion there continued up until the time of Haewol&#x27;s death.

After living as a fugitive for 36 years, Haewol was becoming old and frail. He was captured by pursuing government troops in 1898 and executed. Cheondogyo sources claimed that Son was chosen by Haewol to become the next leader. Sijeongyo  sources claimed that Kim Yon-guk (another member of the Samam) was destined to be the leader. The third member of the Samam had been arrested and executed. In any event, after Kim was arrested Son emerged as the recognized leader of Donghak.

===Refuge in Japan===

In March 1901, Son, his brother and Yi Yong-gu, fled to Japan. Son used an assumed name to avoid arrest. He had considered going to the United States but decided on Japan as the best place to learn of modern western culture while remaining close enough to Korea to monitor developments there and to maintain control of Donghak. His primary aim was to learn modern ways which seemed to give western nations and Japan their power. He hoped to modernize Donghak and in so doing Donghak could help to modernize and strengthen the Korean nation. He went back to Korea briefly and returned to Japan with 24 students who studied Japanese language and trained in modern ways. Many additional students came later.

While in Japan, he mingled with former leaders of the Gabo Reformist cabinet who must have helped him develop his reformist ideas. This was a dramatic reversal from the sentiments of General Jeon Bongjun, who had cursed Gabo reformists as pro-Japanese &quot;traitors&quot; before he was executed. Son was even able to convert some of these Gabo reformists to Donghak.

Yi was sent back to Korea in 1902 and became the chief liaison between Son and Donghak followers in Korea.  At Son&#x27;s direction he founded Jungniphoe (Chungniphoe &quot;neutrality society&quot;), a political organization which was later reorganized as the Jinbohoe (Chinbohoe &quot;progressive society&quot;). This coordinated series of activities was known as the .  A captured letter written by Yi described eight founding principles for Jinbohoe:

# The name of the organization is to be the Jinbohoe.
# The organization is to be started from this date (fifth day of the eighth month, 1904).
# Protect [national] independence.
# Give opinions on government reform.
# Help improve people&#x27;s livelihood and productivity.
# Bring [public] finances into order.
# Assist the allied country&#x27;s military (i.e., Japan).
# Members must cut their hair.

Mass hair cutting ceremonies were one of the most notable signs of the organization of the Jinbohoe.  The first official Cheondogyo history, &quot;Pongyo Yoksa&quot;, written in 1912, states that the cutting of hair was seen by Son as a sign that Korea and Donghak were becoming part of the contemporary world. Around 160,000 people participated in one of these events. Many Jinbohoe members wore black, Western-style clothes, in apparent emulation of Japanese practice. The hair cutting was a significant departure from Neo-Confucian ideals because: &quot;one&#x27;s body, including the hair and skin, came from one&#x27;s parents, and therefore should not be hurt or damaged. Hurting one&#x27;s body meant hurting one&#x27;s parents&#x27; bones and flesh; therefore, it was regarded as disrespect towards parents.&quot;  In Joseon Korean, men tied their hair in a topknot when they married, and it became a symbol of manhood. Furthermore, earlier forced haircutting of Koreans, including the King Gojong, by the Japanese was considered a major humiliation.

As noted above one of the founding principles of Jinbohoe was to aid Japan. In 1903, a plan was devised for driving the pro-Russian faction from the Korean government. Donghak members would lead Japanese soldiers who would enter Korea disguised as merchants.  Donghak and Japanese elements would then make a coordinated attack on Seoul. Son&#x27;s brother met with a Japanese general, the deputy chief of staff, and received enthusiastic support for the idea. However, the plan was abandoned before it could be carried out when the brother and general died unexpectedly. Carl Young made the following comment about this episode: &quot;[It] might seem strange that he [Son] and his Korean reformist friends actually agreed to plot with the Japanese to overthrow the Korean government. It is important to note, however, that those desiring change in Korean government often looked to Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration as an example that Korea could follow, and this often led reformists to seek Japanese help to implement their vision&quot;.

In 1903, Son synthesized his new reform ideas in two essays called Samjonnon (The theory of the three wars), and &quot;Myongnijon&quot; (The essay for explaining the doctrine). These were incorporated into the Donghak/Cheondogyo canon. &quot;Myongnijon&quot; includes the concept that Donghak &quot;should fight on two frontiers, the political and the moral.  This struggle should begin with moral enlightenment of the people in Donghak doctrine. He also stressed the importance of a national religion: &quot;Each country in the world safeguards religious enlightenment, protects its people and teaches them an occupation, making their countries as safe as the Tai Mountains [in China]&quot;

&quot;Samjonnon&quot; proposed three means for attaining a stronger nation: religion, the military and industrialization. As summarized by Yumi Moon: &quot;Even if the people could not immediately overcome the military strength of the West, they could compete with the West by pursuing moral superiority and by accumulating economic power by industrialization.&quot; Son viewed this struggle as a pan-Asian effort that was expressed through the use of terms such as &quot;We Asians&quot; and &quot;Our Asian Land&quot;. When the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) broke out, Son contributed 10,000 won to the Japanese government to aid its war efforts. A Cheondogyo history notes: &quot;that this money was a token of &quot;his support for the yellow race fighting to expel the white race.&quot;

Around the time that Jinbohoe was formed, the Japanese sponsored another reform organization called the Iljinhoe (Advancement Society, or Advance in Unity Society). Both societies had similar objectives, but the latter was more pro-Japanese and had the protection of the Japanese authorities. The Ilchinhoe was composed primarily of elites and was centered in Seoul. The Jinbohoe was composed primarily of people of lower status and was centered in the provinces. Leaders in each organization realized that it would be advantageous to collaborate, and the collaboration eventually led to their merger in early December 1904.  Yi became president of the provincial assemblies. The synergies led to Ilchinhoe becoming the largest popular organization in the country. Its main activities included promotion of education, economic development, defense of people&#x27;s rights and aid to the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War. A prime example of the latter was the contribution of three thousand volunteers during the construction of a railway to facilitate troop movements.

However, Ilchinhoe&#x27;s increasing cooperation with the Japanese caused it to become a target of those opposed to Japanese presence in Korea, most notably by members of the Uibyeong or Righteous Armies. The righteous armies were composed of soldiers, peasants and conservative scholars with a neo-Confucian worldview. They staged attacks on Ilchinhoe in 1904 and 1905. In response, Ilchinhoe organized self-defense units and became more attached to the Japanese for protection. Son was still in Japan at the time but the union of Jinbohoe and Ilchinhoe must have had his tacit approval at least in the beginning.

===Russo-Japanese War===

After Japan emerged victorious in the Russo-Japanese war, Russia acknowledged Japanese dominance in Korea. Other nations including the United States followed suit, at least implicitly. At that point Yi and Ilchinhoe called for Korea to become a protectorate of Japan. Yi was perhaps motivated to do so in order to maintain Ilchinhoe  and his own power and influence and to help implement the Ilchinhoe agenda. This action by Yi shocked Son and he summoned him to Japan to explain. Yi did not back away from his action and argued that the protectorate status would be a benefit to the Korean nation. The lure of the protectorate status was that Japan would help modernize Korea and then grant it independence at some future time.

On 17 November 1905, Japan forced the signing of the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, also known as the Eulsa Treaty, that made Korea a Japanese protectorate. Its legality has been disputed. According to Carl Young &quot;[Son&#x27;s] policy had been alliance with Japan not Japanese control over Korean affairs. [He] probably felt betrayed and from this time on he began to increasingly distance himself from them.&quot;

In order to regain his leadership roll and to distance Donghak from the Ilchinhoe and its Japanese connection, Son renamed it Cheondogyo (Religion of the Heavenly Way) on 1 December 1905. The new name emphasized its religious status and de-emphasized its previous political activism. That shift qualified it for legal protection under Japan&#x27;s freedom of religion policy. However, he was not in a position to simply break away from Yi and his followers at that point. Many of Yi&#x27;s followers were Donghak leaders and an outright break would have likely led them to defect. When the Cheondogyo constitution was announced in February 1906, Yi was given a leadership position in its central headquarters.

In January 1906, Son returned to Korea to personally supervise Cheondogyo. He arrived in Pusan where he was greeted by 40,000 followers. In Seoul, he was greeted by 80,000 followers. Once in Korea, he reorganized the Cheondogyo administrative structure. The constitution or charter was proclaimed as binding in February. This 41-page document is referred to as the Cheondogyo Daeheon (Ch&#x27;ŏndogyo Taehŏn, Charter of the Heavenly Way Religion). Carl Young summarized the governance and responsibilities contained in the charter in an organizational chart.  At the top was the Taedoju (Leader of the Great Way), the position filled by Son. The office of Administration and Doctrine was presided over by Kim Yon-guk, one of the previous members of Haewol&#x27;s Samam and who had been released from prison by that time. Yi Yong-gu was assigned a position in the four-member Bureau of Advisors. The charter specified that the headquarters would be in Seoul, which placed it closer to the national center of power. As noted by George Kallander: &quot;Under [Son&#x27;s] leadership, church leaders no longer hid deep in the mountains or at Buddhist temples, creating problems for the state or alarming the foreign community or governments. Instead, they were drawn into the social and political fold.&quot;

Although Son had given Yi a prominent position in the Cheondogyo leadership, Yi&#x27;s association with Ilchinhoe became increasingly problematic. Ilchinhoe had begun to harass those who did not agree with its modernization policies and to carryout negative publicity campaigns against politicians that were not in full agreement with it. Cheondogyo&#x27;s perceived association with it became a public relations disaster and even led to violent attacks on it by the Righteous Armies. Son initiated a series of actions that diminished Yi&#x27;s influence in Cheondogyo and ultimately excommunicated him in September 1906.

Son&#x27;s writings at that time emphasized that there was a clear lineage from the founder Su-un, Haewol the chosen second leader and himself. A Cheondogyo doctrinal text from the period states: &quot;The Great Teacher Su-un is the founder of Cheondogyo.&quot; Nevertheless, he shifted the focus of some religious concepts developed by these previous leaders. For example, the division between heaven and God became less distinct.  He instilled heaven with spirituality by using declarations such as: &quot;Heaven is divine. &quot;As there is only one spirit, it is the source of the Way&quot;. The Heavenly Way is the utmost pure and sincere.&quot; His concept of heaven diverged from the Neo-Confucian toward the Christian concept, although the texts took pains to emphasize the &quot;blurry&quot; differences. Koreans held a special place in the divine order; he stated that although the Lord on High is the father of all people he loves &quot;our country&quot;.  He also described Su-un as the &quot;child of the Lord High God&quot;.

His writing also adopted a more egalitarian tone.  While Su-un&#x27;s writing often referred to his disciples as &quot;gentlemen&quot;; Son used a more generic term connoting &quot;people&quot;. He also stated that there was equality between high and low classes, although he did not advocate the elimination of the distinction.

Rituals similar to mainstream Christian services were also adopted. Services were held once a week on Sundays, a day of rest.  Previously, Donghak initiation rituals were held usually on mountaintops on the first and fifteenth days of the month, followed by singing and dancing. The new rituals were standardized, and the more shamanistic elements were eliminated. Key elements included recitation of the Donghak talisman, presentation of a bowl of pure water to represent the clarity of heaven and an offering. Prayer was not directed to an external God but was a meditation to draw closer to God/Heaven immanent in the human heart.

===March First Movement===

During the five years of the protectorate period and even after annexation in 1910, many Koreans had accepted Japan&#x27;s control as unavoidable and a temporary state of affairs which would allow Korea to modernize.  However as Japanese rule became increasingly harsh and inflexible, Koreans became restive.  Religious organizations, which were protected under Japan&#x27;s freedom of religion policy, became an important channel for expression of nationalistic sentiments because political parties like Ilchinhoe had been banned. Cheondogyo and Protestant groups (Presbyterians and Methodists) were particularly active in this respect.  Cheondogyo under the leadership of Son was able to adopt a more nationalistic stance without arousing Japanese suspicion in part because the authorities still considered it pro-Japanese.

Protestants under encouragement from foreign missionaries were promoting Democratic ideals similar to those espoused in the West. They also invoked images of the Children of Israel under foreign bondage. Buddhist also became more nationalistic in part because they were resentful of Japanese attempts to pressure them to be instruments of Japanese policy.

World War I, then underway, may have given inspiration for a righteous crusade against tyranny. After the war, the Paris Peace accords and Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;self-determination of peoples&quot; became important motivations. Son&#x27;s Cheondogyo gave financial support to the movement, and he insisted that the independence movement must be popular in nature and non-violent. A Declaration of Independence was prepared which was signed by 33 religious leaders, 15 of which were members of Cheondogyo. Son was the most prominent of these, and he was the first to sign.

The climax came on 1 March 1919 when, during a period of public mourning for the recently deceased Emperor Gojong, the Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed at Pagoda Park in Seoul—this was known as the March First Movement, or Samil Movement. Son read the declaration in the presence of the other signers at a well-known restaurant near the park. The indoor location was chosen to avoid violence. They sent a complimentary copy to the Japanese governor-general and telephoned the police to report what they had done and that they were waiting for arrest. A large crowd gathered at the park including five or six thousand students. The protest was initially peaceful but turned violent. The public took to the streets and demonstrated, calling for Korean independence. This initiated a nationwide movement in which many people took part, regardless of locality and social status, but the Japanese immediately mobilized their police and army and brutally put down the demonstrations. More than 7,500 Koreans were killed, nearly 17,000 wounded, and around 47,000 arrested, including Son.

While in prison, Son became ill and was eventually released from custody on sick bail. His illness worsened, however, and in 1922 he died at home in , just outside the Dongdaemun gate.

== Legacy ==
Son, Son Byeong-hi, has become a symbol of Korean nationalism. He is depicted in a large statue at the entrance of Independence Park (formerly Pagoda Park in the center of Seoul where the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed). However, the focus on nationalist aspects of Cheondogyo seems to have detracted from its identity as a religion. Less than 1% of South Koreans affiliate themselves with Cheondogyo. Government figures for 1998 indicated membership at about 26,000.

The taekwondo pattern Eui-Am was named in honor of Son Byong-Hi after his respectful title of Eui-am Seong-sa.

<doc id="430493" wikidata="Q1551745" url="?curid=430493" title="Woodbury matrix identity">
<text>In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, the Woodbury matrix identity – named after Max A. Woodbury – says that the inverse of a rank-&quot;k&quot; correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a rank-&quot;k&quot; correction to the inverse of the original matrix. Alternative names for this formula are the matrix inversion lemma, Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula or just Woodbury formula. However, the identity appeared in several papers before the Woodbury report.

The Woodbury matrix identity is
formula_1

where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are conformable matrices: &quot;A&quot; is &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;, &quot;C&quot; is &quot;k&quot;×&quot;k&quot;, &quot;U&quot; is &quot;n&quot;×&quot;k&quot;, and &quot;V&quot; is &quot;k&quot;×&quot;n&quot;. This can be derived using blockwise matrix inversion.

While the identity is primarily used on matrices, it holds in a general ring or in an Ab-category.

The Woodbury matrix identity allows cheap computation of inverses and solutions to linear equations. However, little is known about the numerical stability of the formula. There are no published results concerning its error bounds. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it may diverge even for seemingly benign examples (when both the original and modified matrices are well-conditioned).

== Discussion ==
To prove this result, we will start by proving a simpler one. Replacing &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; with the identity matrix &quot;I&quot;, we obtain another identity which is a bit simpler:
formula_2
To recover the original equation from this &quot;reduced identity&quot;, replace formula_3 by formula_4 and formula_5 by formula_6.

This identity itself can be viewed as the combination of two simpler identities. We obtain the first identity from
formula_7
thus,
formula_8
and similarly
formula_9
The second identity is the so-called push-through identity
formula_10
that we obtain from
formula_11
after multiplying by formula_12 on the right and by formula_13 on the left.

Putting all together,
formula_14
where the first and second equality come from the first and second identity, respectively.
=== Special cases ===

When formula_15 are vectors, the identity reduces to the Sherman–Morrison formula.

In the scalar case, the reduced version is simply
formula_16

==== Inverse of a sum ====

If &quot;n&quot; = &quot;k&quot; and &quot;U&quot; = &quot;V&quot; = &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the identity matrix, then

formula_17

Continuing with the merging of the terms of the far right-hand side of the above equation results in Hua&#x27;s identity
formula_18

Another useful form of the same identity is
formula_19

which, unlike those above, is valid even if formula_20 is singular, and has a recursive structure that yields
formula_21
if the spectral radius of formula_22 is less than one. That is, if the above sum converges then it is equal to formula_23.

This form can be used in perturbative expansions where &quot;B&quot; is a perturbation of &quot;A&quot;.

=== Variations ===

==== Binomial inverse theorem ====

If &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot; are matrices of sizes &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;×&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;×&quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot;×&quot;n&quot;, respectively, then
formula_24

provided &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; + &quot;BVA&quot;−1&quot;UB&quot; are nonsingular. Nonsingularity of the latter requires that &quot;B&quot;−1 exist since it equals and the rank of the latter cannot exceed the rank of &quot;B&quot;.

Since &quot;B&quot; is invertible, the two &quot;B&quot; terms flanking the parenthetical quantity inverse in the right-hand side can be replaced with which results in the original Woodbury identity.

A variation for when &quot;B&quot; is singular and possibly even non-square:
formula_25

Formulas also exist for certain cases in which &quot;A&quot; is singular.

==== Pseudoinverse with positive semidefinite matrices ====

In general Woodbury&#x27;s identity is not valid if one or more inverses are replaced by (Moore–Penrose) pseudoinverses. However, if formula_26 and formula_27 are positive semidefinite, and formula_28 (implying that formula_29 is itself positive semidefinite), then the following formula provides a generalization:
formula_30

where formula_31 can be written as formula_32 because any positive semidefinite matrix is equal to formula_33 for some formula_34.

== Derivations ==

=== Direct proof ===
The formula can be proven by checking that formula_35 times its alleged inverse on the right side of the Woodbury identity gives the identity matrix:
formula_36

=== Alternative proofs ===
First consider these useful identities,
formula_37

Now, 
formula_38

Deriving the Woodbury matrix identity is easily done by solving the following block matrix inversion problem
formula_39

Expanding, we can see that the above reduces to
formula_40
which is equivalent to formula_41. Eliminating the first equation, we find that formula_42, which can be substituted into the second to find formula_43. Expanding and rearranging, we have formula_44, or formula_45. Finally, we substitute into our formula_46, and we have formula_47. Thus,
:formula_48

We have derived the Woodbury matrix identity.

We start by the matrix
formula_49
By eliminating the entry under the &quot;A&quot; (given that &quot;A&quot; is invertible) we get
formula_50

Likewise, eliminating the entry above &quot;C&quot; gives
formula_51

Now combining the above two, we get
formula_52

Moving to the right side gives
formula_53
which is the LDU decomposition of the block matrix into an upper triangular, diagonal, and lower triangular matrices.

Now inverting both sides gives
formula_54

We could equally well have done it the other way (provided that &quot;C&quot; is invertible) i.e.
formula_55

Now again inverting both sides,
formula_56

Now comparing elements (1, 1) of the RHS of (1) and (2) above gives the Woodbury formula
formula_57
== Applications ==

This identity is useful in certain numerical computations where &quot;A&quot;−1 has already been computed and it is desired to compute (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;UCV&quot;)−1. With the inverse of &quot;A&quot; available, it is only necessary to find the inverse of &quot;C&quot;−1 + &quot;VA&quot;−1&quot;U&quot; in order to obtain the result using the right-hand side of the identity. If &quot;C&quot; has a much smaller dimension than &quot;A&quot;, this is more efficient than inverting &quot;A&quot; + &quot;UCV&quot; directly. A common case is finding the inverse of a low-rank update &quot;A&quot; + &quot;UCV&quot; of &quot;A&quot; (where &quot;U&quot; only has a few columns and &quot;V&quot; only a few rows), or finding an approximation of the inverse of the matrix &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; where the matrix &quot;B&quot; can be approximated by a low-rank matrix &quot;UCV&quot;, for example using the singular value decomposition.

This is applied, e.g., in the Kalman filter and recursive least squares methods, to replace the parametric solution, requiring inversion of a state vector sized matrix, with a condition equations based solution. In case of the Kalman filter this matrix has the dimensions of the vector of observations, i.e., as small as 1 in case only one new observation is processed at a time. This significantly speeds up the often real time calculations of the filter.

In the case when &quot;C&quot; is the identity matrix &quot;I&quot;, the matrix formula_58 is known in numerical linear algebra and numerical partial differential equations as the capacitance matrix.

<text>Donghak (formerly spelled Tonghak; ) was an academic movement in Korean Neo-Confucianism founded in 1860 by Choe Je-u. The Donghak movement arose as a reaction to seohak (), and called for a return to the &quot;Way of Heaven&quot;. While Donghak originated as a reform movement and revival of Confucian teachings, it gradually evolved into a religion known today as Cheondoism in Korea under the third patriarch Son Byong-hi.

== History ==

Joseon, which patronized Neo-Confucianism as the state ideology, saw an increasing polarization between orthodox Confucian scholars and efforts by other Confucian scholars to revive social ethics and reform society. The increasing presence and pressure from the West created a greater sense of urgency among reformers, and thus Choe Je-u first penned his treatise, &quot;Comprehensive Book of Eastern Learning&quot;, or &quot;Dongkyeong Daejeon&quot; (). This treatise marked the first use of the term &quot;Eastern Learning&quot; and called for a rejection of God (in the Christian sense), and other aspects of Christian theology.

Choe was alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity (, &quot;Cheonjugyo&quot;; Catholicism), and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democracy, establish human rights and create a paradise on Earth independent of foreign interference.

He started a peasant rebellion by converting them to Donghak and, along with other anti-government civic activists, took over parts of southern Korea from 1862 to 1864 until Choe was executed.

The movement was continued by Choe Si-hyeong (1829–1898), who systematized its doctrine. He too was executed.

In 1898, following the execution of Choe Si-hyeong, the leader of Donghak, Son Byong-hi, sought political asylum in contiguous Japan. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, he returned to Korea and established the Chinbohoe (&quot;progressive society&quot;), a new cultural and reformist movement designed to reverse the declining fortunes of the nation and to create a new society. Through Donghak he conducted a nationwide movement that aimed at social improvement through the renovation of old customs and ways of life. Hundreds of thousands of members of Donghak cut their long hair short and initiated the wearing of simple, modest clothing. Non-violent demonstrations for social improvement organized by members of Donghak took place throughout 1904.

Under the third patriarch of the Donghak movement, Son Byeong-hui, the movement became a religion called &quot;Cheondogyo&quot;, or Cheondoism, which is followed today in both North and South Korea.

== Choe Je-u ==

Choe Je-u&#x27;s treatise argued a return to the Confucian understanding of Heaven, with emphasis on self-cultivation and improving one&#x27;s nature. As Choe wrote, the Way of Heaven was within one&#x27;s own mind, and so by improving one&#x27;s nature, one also attained the Way of Heaven.

Donghak was not accompanied by a specific agenda or systematic doctrine. Choe believed in improvising as events occurred. He had no practical plans or visions of how one would go about establishing a paradise on Earth, let alone what paradise meant except that all people were equal. Nevertheless, Choe&#x27;s advocacy of democracy, human rights and Korean nationalism struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas and Donghak spread across Korea rapidly. Progressive revolutionaries waded in and organized the peasants into a cohesive fighting unit.

<text>De Hoeve is a village in the Dutch municipality of Weststellingwerf in Friesland. It is located in an agriculture area between Wolvega and Noordwolde. De Hoeve has approximately 410 inhabitants (2017).

== History ==
De Hoeve is not a very old village. For the first time it was mentioned by its name in 1938. On a map of 1664 the territory was only heather. Shortly after that people built two farmhouses: an Oosterhoeve (East Hoeve) and a Westerhoeve (West Hoeve). A new map, drawn in 1718 shows both farmhouses. The area around it is also called Vinkegahoeve and Steggerdahoeve because they are in the neighbourhood of the small villages Vinkega and Steggerda.

In 1908 &quot;Commissie Plaatselijk Belang&quot; (Committee Local Interest) was founded. During the first meetings with the people it was decided to improve the dirtroads by putting rubble on it. Also they decide to make all kinds of other improvements. These meetings were also used as entertainment with recitals, songs and hot chocolate, made of the milk that was donated by the farmers. The committeemembers made sure that there would be enough milk left for the pupils the next day.

== Famous inhabitants ==
An important person for De Hoeve was Albert H. Kuipers. He was a farmer, and owner of moor and the founder of the first school in De Hoeve. On behalf of 68 people he wrote a request to the province. He himself donated the land necessary to build the school. The county of Weststellingwerf did not agree with the plan of building a school. They were afraid that less pupils would go to the newly built school in Steggerda. Also finances were a big problem. The province of Friesland knew that this school had to be built. At that moment 70 pupils between 5 and 12 years old had to walk more than 3 to 5 hours to school through the mud and dirt.

== Present day ==
In 2005 there are several clubs and committees in De Hoeve. The school has a new name now. It is called &quot;De Klaeter&quot;. De Klaeter is doing very well with its approximately 55 pupils. De Hoeve has its own monthly newspaper called &quot;De OosterWester&quot;.

<text>Boulia () is an outback town and locality in the Shire of Boulia, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Boulia had a population of 314 people.

Boulia is the administrative centre of the Boulia Shire, population approximately 600, which covers an area of .

The area is best known for sightings of the Min Min lights, mysterious shimmering lights that appear at night. The lights are said to be caused by atmospheric refraction that occurs when cold air is trapped below warmer air, a phenomenon known as Fata Morgana.

== Geography ==
Boulia is in the Central West Queensland and is located approximately by road south of Mount Isa. Boulia is at the crossroads of a number of outback routes, including the Boulia Mount Isa Road (which goes north-west towards Mount Isa), the Selwyn Road (which goes north-east to Selwyn), the Winton Road, which goes east toward Winton), and the Boulia Bedourie Road (which goes south-west to Bedourie). The Donohue Highway coming from the Northern Territory joins the Boulia Mount Isa Road just outside of Boulia, which together with the Winton Road forms part of the Outback Way billed as &quot;Australia&#x27;s Longest Shortcut&quot;, a gravel-and-bitumen road which runs between Laverton in Western Australia and Winton in Queensland.

Boulia is in the Channel Country. All watercourses in this area are part of the Lake Eyre drainage basin, and most will dry up before their water reaches Lake Eyre. Boulia lies on the Burke River, which was named after the explorer Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke who passed through the area with the Burke and Wills expedition in 1860. The river flows from the north-east to the south-east through the locality.

Although it is contrary to the locality boundary principles of the Queensland Government, the locality of Boulia is an &quot;island&quot; entirely surrounded by the locality of Wills.

Extensive grazing of beef cattle on native vegetation is the predominant industry. Boulia is at the heart of the Channel Country of western Queensland where, during rain events, channels running between the rivers and creeks of the region fill with water and spread that water over expansive areas. When it does rain heavily, the Mitchell grass plains respond magnificently and result in the Channel country around Boulia, being among the finest beef producing country in Australia.

The town has a grid layout with 6 roads running east–west and 5 running north–south. Herbert Street is the main street where most of the civic and commercial premises are located.

== History ==

The town was named by surveyor Frederick Arthur Hartnell in 1882 and was derived from the name of the waterhole near the township called &quot;bool-yo&quot; in the Pitta Pitta language.

The township was gazetted in 1879. Boulia Post Office opened on 1 July 1879.

Boulia Provisional School opened on 7 October 1889. It became Boulia State School on 1 January 1909. In December 1937, the school building of the closed state school in Selwyn was relocated to be used as a school building in Boulia.

The Good Shepherd Catholic Church was built in 1955.

In 2019, the Boulia Outback Chapel was established in the former Anglican church building. It is part of the Baptist Church.

In 2019, the Boulia Outback Chapel was established in the former Anglican church building. It is part of the Baptist Church.

== Demographics ==
In the , the town of Boulia had a population of 205.

In the , the locality of Boulia had a population of 230.

In the , the locality of Boulia had a population of 301 people.

In the , the locality of Boulia had a population of 314 people.

== Climate ==
Boulia experiences a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with very hot, occasionally rainy summers, and very mild, dry winters with cool nights and rare frosts. Average maxima vary from in July to in December. Average annual rainfall is very low: , occurring within 24.1 rainfall days. Rainfall is extraordinarily erratic, as while only fell in 1905; was recorded in January 1974 alone. The town is very sunny, averaging 186.4 clear days and only 43.6 cloudy days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 31 August 1906 to on 7 February 1915.

== Events ==
The town hosts the Boulia Camel Races, the longest camel race (running a 1500m cup final) on the Australian camel racing circuit.

Each year at Easter, the Boulia Racecourse reserve plays host to a rodeo, campdrafting, and horse racing event which is a social highlight for the district.

During August drag races are held at the Boulia Airport which attracts an enthusiastic crowd.

== Facilities ==

Boulia has a range of public facilities open to the community. These include a public library, public hall, sports complex, racecourse, the Min Min encounter tourist centre, museum, visitor information centre, and camel races. The Boulia Shire Council operates a public library at 18 Burke Street.

An 18-hole golf course with sand greens is located on the Boulia Winton Road. Greens fees are not charged for the use of this course and a clubhouse with bar facilities is available.

Boulia has Australia&#x27;s first three-dimensional zebra crossing which is based on an optical illusion. It is to improve road safety and also to be a tourist attraction. It was introduced in 2018 after Boulia Shire Council mayor Rick Britton saw similar crossings in Iceland, Malaysia, India, New Zealand and the United States on social media.

The Boulia branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association has its rooms at 61 Moonah Street.

Boulia Outback Chapel is at 49 Moonah Street ().

The Good Shepherd Catholic Church is at 33 Moonah Street ().

== Education ==
Boulia State School is a government primary (Early Childhood-6) school for boys and girls at Templeton Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 27 students with 4 teachers and 4 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent).

There are no secondary schools in Boulia. The nearest secondary schools are in Mount Isa and Winton, but these are too distant for a daily commute. The Spinifex State College in Mount Isa offers boarding facilities. Other boarding schools or distance education would be options for secondary schooling.

== Mars ==
The name Boulia is used as a name for a crater on the planet Mars, specifically commemorating the town.

== Heritage listings ==
Boulia has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

<text>Werner Koch (born July 11, 1961) is a German free software developer. He is best known as the principal author of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG). He was also Head of Office and German Vice-Chancellor of the Free Software Foundation Europe. He is the winner of Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 2015 for founding GnuPG.

Journalists and security professionals rely on GnuPG, and Edward Snowden used it to evade monitoring whilst he leaked classified information from the United States National Security Agency.

==Life and work==
Koch lives in Erkrath, near Düsseldorf, Germany. He began writing GNU Privacy Guard in 1997, inspired by attending a talk by Richard Stallman who made a call for someone to write a replacement for Phil Zimmermann&#x27;s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which was subject to U.S. export restrictions. The first release of GNU Privacy Guard was in 1999 and it went on to become the basis for most of the popular email encryption programs: GPGTools, Enigmail, and Koch&#x27;s own Gpg4win, the primary free encryption program for Microsoft Windows.

In 1999 Koch, via the German Unix User Group which he served on the board of, received a grant of 318,000 marks (about US$170,000) from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology to make GPG compatible with Microsoft Windows. In 2005 he received a contract from the German government to support the development of S/MIME.

Journalists and security professionals rely on GnuPG, and Edward Snowden used it to evade monitoring whilst he leaked classified information from the U.S. National Security Agency. Despite GnuPG&#x27;s popularity, Koch has struggled to survive financially, earning about $25,000 per year since 2001 and thus considered abandoning the project and taking a better paying programming job. However, given Snowden&#x27;s leaked documents showed the extent of NSA surveillance, Koch continued. In 2014 he held a funding drive and in response received $137,000 in donations from the public, and Facebook and Stripe each pledged to annually donate $50,000 to GPG development. Unrelated, in 2015 Koch was also awarded a one-time grant of $60,000 from the Linux Foundation&#x27;s Core Infrastructure Initiative.

<text>Burney Falls is a waterfall on Burney Creek, within McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park, in Shasta County, California.

The water comes from underground springs above and at the falls, which are high, and provides an almost constant flow rate of per day, even during the dry summer months. Burney Creek is a tributary of the Pit River which has its mouth on the Lake Britton reservoir to the north.

The falls are an example of river drainage regulated by stratigraphically-controlled springs, and of a waterfall formed by of horizontal strata.

Called &quot;the Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by President Theodore Roosevelt, the falls are &quot;at their most intense ... during the spring, from early April through October, when snowmelt is at its peak&quot;. The falls were declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1954. In March 2021, a &quot;National Geographic&quot; article declared the site to be one of &quot;northern California&#x27;s most spectacular waterfalls&quot;.

The water temperature rarely gets higher than but the pool below the falls is a popular location for catch-and-release fly-fishing. The Redding tourism website states that the falls &quot;can be enjoyed from above at lookout point&quot;, and preferably, from the pool at base of the falls, accessed via a trail.

Some of the waterfalls scenes for &quot;Willow&quot; (1988) were shot at the falls, although Powerscourt Waterfall in Ireland was also used for filming. Other movies with scenes filmed at Burney Falls include &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), &quot;The Parson and the Outlaw&quot; (1957) and &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Fight for Life&quot; (1958).

<doc id="430511" wikidata="Q1588203" url="?curid=430511" title="Henslow's sparrow">
<text>Henslow&#x27;s sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) is a passerine bird in the family Passerellidae. It was named by John James Audubon in honor of John Stevens Henslow. It was originally classified in the genus &quot;Emberiza&quot; and called &quot;Henslow&#x27;s bunting&quot;.

==Description==
Adults have streaked brown upperparts with a light brown breast with streaks, a white belly and a white throat. They have a pale stripe on the crown with a dark stripe on each side, an olive face and neck, rust-coloured wings and a short dark forked tail.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Distribution and habitat==
The range and numbers of this bird are decreasing, probably due to habitat loss of the grasslands that it depends on. However, it has heavily benefited from the Conservation Reserve Program formed by the United States Department of Agriculture, which has helped to stabilize its population. Following this, it was downlisted to Least Concern from Near Threatened in 2018.

The Texas population was solely known from a brushfield near Houston and disappeared after devegetation due to industrial development in the 1980s. It was considered a distinct subspecies (&quot;P. h. houstonensis&quot;: Arnold, 1983) but is today considered to fall into the range of variation of the nominate subspecies (Browning, 1990). Likewise, the South Dakotan population formerly known as &quot;P. h. occidentalis&quot; has been synonymized with the nominate. The only remaining subspecies generally (but not universally) accepted are the eastern Henslow&#x27;s sparrow and the western Henslow&#x27;s sparrow, whose ranges are for the most part separated by the Appalachian Mountains.

==Diet and behavior==

These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects (including grasshoppers and beetles), berries, and seeds. Their song is a quick &quot;se-lick&quot;.

==Breeding==

Their breeding habitat is shrubby fields, often wet, in southern Canada, the northeastern United States, and the midwestern United States. In 2020, the Central Kentucky Audubon Society discovered that a population of Henslow&#x27;s sparrows near a winery only needed 5 acres of grassy habitat to successfully breed (previous research had suggested at least 20 to 75 acres were necessary). The nest is a well-concealed open cup on or close to the ground in a grassy location; these birds often nest in small colonies. They migrate to marshes and open pine woods in the southeastern United States.

<text>Project Habakkuk or Habbakuk (spelling varies) was a plan by the British during the Second World War to construct an aircraft carrier out of pykrete, a mixture of wood pulp and ice, for use against German U-boats in the mid-Atlantic, which were beyond the flight range of land-based planes at that time. The plan was to create what would have been the largest ship ever at long, which would have been much bigger than even the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the USS &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;, the largest naval vessel ever, at long. The idea came from Geoffrey Pyke, who worked for Combined Operations Headquarters. After promising scale tests and the creation of a prototype on Patricia Lake, Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada, the project was shelved due to rising costs, added requirements, and the availability of longer-range aircraft and escort carriers which closed the Mid-Atlantic gap that the project was intended to address.

== History ==

=== Initial concept ===
Geoffrey Pyke was an old friend of J. D. Bernal and had been recommended to Lord Louis Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations, by the cabinet minister Leopold Amery. Pyke worked at Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) alongside Bernal and was regarded as a genius by Mountbatten.

Pyke conceived the idea of Habakkuk while he was in the United States organising the production of M29 Weasels for Project Plough, a scheme to assemble an elite unit for winter operations in Norway, Romania and the Italian Alps. He had been considering the problem of how to protect seaborne landings and Atlantic convoys out of reach of aircraft cover. The problem was that steel and aluminium were in short supply, and were required for other purposes. Pyke decided that the answer was ice, which could be manufactured for just 1% of the energy needed to make an equivalent mass of steel. He proposed that an iceberg, natural or artificial, be levelled to provide a runway and hollowed out to shelter aircraft.

From New York, Pyke sent the proposal via diplomatic bag to COHQ, with a label forbidding anyone apart from Mountbatten from opening the package. Mountbatten in turn passed Pyke&#x27;s proposal on to Churchill, who was enthusiastic about it.

Pyke was not the first to suggest a floating mid-ocean stopping point for aircraft, nor even the first to suggest that such a floating island could be made of ice. A German scientist, A. Gerke from Waldenburg, had proposed the idea and carried out some preliminary experiments on Lake Zurich in 1930. The idea was a recurring one: in 1940 an idea for an ice island was circulated around the Admiralty, but was treated as a joke by officers, including Nevil Shute, who circulated a memorandum that gathered ever more caustic comments. The document was retrieved just before it reached the First Sea Lord&#x27;s inbox.

=== Code name and spelling ===
The project&#x27;s code name was often incorrectly spelled &quot;Habbakuk&quot; in official documents. This may have been Pyke&#x27;s error. At least one early unsigned document (apparently written by him) spells it Habbakuk. However, post-war publications by people concerned with the project, such as Perutz and Goodeve, all restore the proper spelling, with one &quot;b&quot; and three &quot;k&quot;s. The name is a reference to the project&#x27;s ambitious goal: 

David Lampe, in his book, &quot;Pyke, the Unknown Genius&quot;, states that the name was derived from Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; and was misspelled by Pyke&#x27;s Canadian secretary. However, the word does not actually appear in &quot;Candide&quot;, so this is probably inaccurate.

=== Pykrete ===
In early 1942 Pyke and Bernal called in Max Perutz to determine whether an icefloe large enough to withstand Atlantic conditions could be built up fast enough. Perutz pointed out that natural icebergs have too small a surface above water for an airstrip, and are prone to suddenly rolling over. The project would have been abandoned if it had not been for the invention of pykrete, a mixture of water and woodpulp that when frozen was stronger than plain ice, was slower-melting and would not sink. Developed by his government group and named after Pyke, it has been suggested that Pyke was inspired by Inuit sleds reinforced with moss. This is probably apocryphal, as the material was originally described in a paper by Mark and Hohenstein in Brooklyn.

Pykrete could be machined like wood and cast into shapes like metal, and when immersed in water formed an insulating shell of wet wood pulp on its surface that protected its interior from further melting. However, Perutz found a problem: ice flows slowly, in what is known as plastic flow, and his tests showed that a pykrete ship would slowly sag unless it was cooled to . To accomplish this the ship&#x27;s surface would have to be protected by insulation, and it would need a refrigeration plant and a complicated system of ducts.

Perutz proceeded to conduct experiments on the viability of pykrete and its optimum composition in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London. The research took place in a refrigerated meat locker behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses.

=== Scale model ===
The decision was made to build a large-scale model at Jasper National Park in Canada to examine insulation and refrigeration techniques, and to see how pykrete would stand up to artillery and explosives. Large ice blocks were constructed at Lake Louise, Alberta, and a small prototype was constructed at Patricia Lake, Alberta, measuring 60 by 30 feet (18 metres by 9 metres), weighing 1,000 tons and kept frozen by a one-horsepower motor. The work was done by conscientious objectors who did alternative service of various kinds instead of military service. They were never told what they were building. Bernal informed COHQ that the Canadians were building a 1,000-ton model, and that it was expected to take eight men fourteen days to build it. The Chief of Combined Operations (CCO) responded that Churchill had invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to arrange for an order to be placed for one complete ship at once, with the highest priority, and that further ships were to be ordered immediately if it appeared that the scheme was certain of success.

The Canadians were confident about constructing a vessel for 1944. The necessary materials were available to them in the form of 300,000 tons of wood pulp, 25,000 tons of fibreboard insulation, 35,000 tons of timber and 10,000 tons of steel. The cost was estimated at £700,000.

Meanwhile Perutz had determined via his experiments at Smithfield Market that the optimum structural properties were given by a mixture of 14 per cent wood pulp and 86 per cent water. He wrote to Pyke in early April 1943 and pointed out that if certain tests were not completed in May, there would be no chance of delivering a completed ship in 1944.

By May the problem of cold flow had become serious and it was obvious that more steel reinforcement would be needed, as well as a more effective insulating skin around the vessel&#x27;s hull. This caused the cost estimate to grow to £2.5 million. In addition, the Canadians had decided that it was impractical to attempt the project &quot;this coming season&quot;. Bernal and Pyke were forced to conclude that no Habakkuk vessel would be ready in 1944.

Pyke was excluded from the planning for Habakkuk in an effort to secure American participation, a decision that Bernal supported. Pyke&#x27;s earlier disagreements with American personnel on Project Plough, which had caused his removal from that project, were the main factor in this decision.

Naval architects and engineers continued to work on Habakkuk with Bernal and Perutz during the summer of 1943. The requirements for the vessel became more demanding: it had to have a range of and be able to withstand the largest waves recorded, and the Admiralty wanted it to be torpedo-proof, which meant that the hull had to be at least thick. The Fleet Air Arm decided that heavy bombers should be able to take off from it, which meant that the deck had to be long. Steering also raised problems; it was initially projected that the ship would be steered by varying the speed of the motors on either side, but the Royal Navy decided that a rudder was essential. However, the problem of mounting and controlling a rudder over high was never solved.

=== Variants ===
Naval architects produced three alternative versions of Pyke&#x27;s original concept, which were discussed at a meeting with the Chiefs of Staff in August 1943:
* Habakkuk I (soon discarded) would have been made of wood.
* Habakkuk II was closest to the COHQ model and would have been a very large, slow, self-propelled vessel made of pykrete with steel reinforcement. The size would have been a length of 2000 feet and a width of 300 feet.
* Habakkuk III was a smaller, faster version of Habakkuk II.
Air Chief Marshal Portal asked about potential bomb damage to Habakkuk III, and Bernal suggested that a certain amount of deck covering might be ripped off, but could be repaired by some kind of flexible matting. It would be more difficult to deal with bomb holes in the centre portion, though the roof over the aircraft hangars would be made blast proof against 1,000 kg bombs. Bernal considered that no one could say whether the larger Habakkuk II was a practical proposition until a large-scale model could be completed and tested in Canada in the spring of 1944. He had no doubts about the suitability of pykrete as a material, but said that constructional and navigational difficulties remained to be overcome.

The final design of Habakkuk II gave the &quot;bergship&quot;, as it was called, a displacement of 2.2 million tons. Steam turbogenerators were to supply for 26 electric motors mounted in separate external nacelles (normal, internal ship engines would have generated too much heat for an ice craft). Its armament would have included 40 dual-barrelled 4.5&quot; DP (dual-purpose) turrets and numerous light anti-aircraft guns, and it would have housed an airstrip and up to 150 twin-engined bombers or fighters.

== Shooting incident ==
According to some accounts, at the Quebec Conference in 1943 Lord Louis Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the admirals and generals who accompanied Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground. One was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete. He then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block. It shattered and splintered. Next he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles. The bullet ricocheted off the block, grazing the trouser leg of Admiral Ernest King, and ended up in the wall.

Sir Alan Brooke&#x27;s diaries support this account, telling how Mountbatten brought two blocks, one of ice and one of pykrete. After first shooting at the ice, with a warning to beware of splinters, Mountbatten said &quot;I shall fire at the block on the right to show you the difference&quot;. Brooke reported that &quot;the bullet rebounded out of the block and buzzed round our legs like an angry bee&quot;.

Max Perutz gave an account of a similar incident in his book &quot;I Wish I Made You Angry Earlier&quot;. A demonstration of pykrete was given at Combined Operations Headquarters (COHQ) by a naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Douglas Adshead-Grant, who was provided by Perutz with rods of ice and pykrete packed with dry ice in thermos flasks and large blocks of ice and pykrete. Grant demonstrated the comparative strength of ice and pykrete by firing bullets into both blocks: the ice shattered, but the bullet rebounded from the pykrete and hit the Chief of Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke in the shoulder.

== End of project ==
By the time of the 1943 Quebec Conference the Habakkuk project had won the support of both Churchill and Mountbatten, and was assigned to the National Research Council of Canada because of the cold Canadian winters and Canadians&#x27; prior familiarity with ice physics. The small prototype built in 1944 on Patricia Lake near Jasper, Alberta, confirmed the researchers&#x27; forecast that the full-size vessel would cost more money and machinery than a whole fleet of conventional aircraft carriers. (The sunken remains of the metal parts of the boat remain there to this day.) NRC President C. J. Mackenzie later said British promoters of Habakkuk were so intimidated by Prime Minister Churchill that they kept this information from him until Mackenzie&#x27;s next visit to Britain. 

Mountbatten later listed several reasons why the special boat&#x27;s construction would be expensive and not needed:
* Demand for steel for other purposes was too great.
* Permission had been received from Portugal to use airfields in the Azores, which facilitated the hunting of U-boats in the Atlantic
* The introduction of long-range fuel tanks allowed British-based aircraft extra patrol time over the Atlantic
* The numbers of escort carriers were being increased.
In addition, Mountbatten himself withdrew from the project.

The final meeting of the Habakkuk board took place in December 1943. It was officially concluded that &quot;The large Habbakuk II made of pykrete has been found to be impractical because of the enormous production resources required and technical difficulties involved.&quot;

The use of ice had actually been falling out of favour before that, and other ideas for &quot;floating islands&quot; had been considered, such as welding Liberty Ships or landing craft together (&quot;Project TENTACLE&quot;). It took three hot summers to completely melt the prototype constructed in Canada.

Perutz wrote that he stayed in Washington D.C. while U.S. Navy engineers evaluated the viability of Habakkuk. He concluded: &quot;The U.S. Navy finally decided that Habakkuk was a false prophet. One reason was [that] the enormous amount of steel needed for the refrigeration plant that was to freeze the pykrete was greater than that needed to build the entire carrier of steel, but the crucial argument was that the rapidly increasing range of land-based aircraft rendered floating islands unnecessary.&quot;

== Criticism ==
The Habakkuk design received criticism, notably from Sir Charles F. Goodeve, Assistant Controller of Research and Development for the Admiralty during the Second World War. In an article published after the war Goodeve pointed out the large amount of wood pulp that would be required was enough to affect paper production significantly. He also claimed that each ship would require 40,000 tons of cork insulation, thousands of miles of steel tubing for brine circulation and four power stations, but that for all those resources (some of which could be used to manufacture conventional ships of more effective fighting power) Habakkuk would be capable of travelling at only of speed. His article also contained extensive derisive comments about the properties of ice as used for ship construction.

== Recent recreations ==

In the 15 April 2009 episode of the U.S. TV show &quot;MythBusters&quot; Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage built a small flat-bottomed boat dubbed &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News&quot; out of a modified version of pykrete, using whole sheets of wet newspaper instead of wood pulp. They successfully piloted the boat in Alaskan waters at a speed of , but it began to leak through the melting pykrete in 20 minutes. After attempting to flash freeze leaks with a fire extinguisher and bailing the water with a hand pump, 10 minutes later Hyneman determined that the boat was taking on more water than the pump could remove and they headed back to shore, trailing sloughed portions of newspaper in their wake. They later inferred that it is possible to build a boat out of pykrete, and that pykrete lived up to its purported properties of being bullet-proof, stronger and taking longer to melt than ice. However, they expressed doubt that an aircraft carrier made of pykrete could have survived for long. The conclusion was &quot;Plausible, but ludicrous.&quot;

In September 2010 the BBC programme &quot;Bang Goes the Theory&quot; also attempted to recreate a pykrete boat. A rough hull using of hemp fibre pykrete was frozen in a coldstore, then launched in Portsmouth Harbour for a planned trip across the Solent to Cowes. The hull immediately started to leak because of the holes that had been cut in its rear to mount an outboard motor; the weight of the motor itself caused these holes to drop below the waterline.

<text>The Ford Eifel is a car manufactured by Ford Germany between 1935 and 1940. It initially complemented, and then replaced, the Ford Köln. It was itself replaced by the Ford Taunus.

Between 1937 and 1939, it was also assembled in Hungary and Denmark. The Eifel was derived from the Ford Model C (Europe) 1934 platform, and is also related to the Dagenham-built 1938 Ford Prefect and 1939 Ford Anglia.

The model was named after the Eifel mountain range in western Germany.

==Body==
The car was offered with many different body types, including a two-door sedan, a two-door cabrio coach, two- and four-seat cabriolet, two-seater roadster, and a light truck. The mainstream &quot;limousine&quot; (saloon) steel bodies were bought in from the Ambi Budd factory in Berlin, while the &quot;cabrio-Limousine&quot; (soft-top saloons/sedans) were built by Drauz coachbuilders of Heilbronn. Several other body builders such as Gläser coachbuilders of Dresden provided the less mainstream bodies.

==Engine and transmission==
The engine was a four-cylinder, four-stroke, side-valve 1172-cc unit, giving a claimed maximum power output of 34 hp (25 kW) at 4250 rpm. The three-speed manual gearbox featured synchromesh on the top two ratios.

==Commercial==
In Germany, 61,495 Ford Eifels were produced, representing more than half of the output of the company&#x27;s Cologne factory between production of the plant&#x27;s first car in 1933 and the cessation of passenger-car manufacture in 1942, following the outbreak, in 1939, of widespread European war. In large measure due to this car&#x27;s popularity, Ford Germany moved from eighth place in terms of German passenger car sales in 1933 to fourth place in 1938, in the process overtaking Adler, Hanomag, Wanderer, and BMW.

The car&#x27;s popularity in Germany increased after a minor face-lift in 1937, which coincided with an extension of the variety of body styles on offer, and which visually distanced the look of the car a little from its British origins, replacing the earlier car&#x27;s spoked wheels with modern steel wheels and applying the eye- catching wrap-around front grill, which was becoming a feature of German Fords in the late 1930s.

<text>Network congestion in data networking and queueing theory is the reduced quality of service that occurs when a network node or link is carrying more data than it can handle. Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of congestion is that an incremental increase in offered load leads either only to a small increase or even a decrease in network throughput.

Network protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss due to congestion can increase congestion, even after the initial load has been reduced to a level that would not normally have induced network congestion. Such networks exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse.

Networks use congestion control and congestion avoidance techniques to try to avoid collapse. These include: exponential backoff in protocols such as CSMA/CA in 802.11 and the similar CSMA/CD in the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers and network switches. Other techniques that address congestion include priority schemes which transmit some packets with higher priority ahead of others and the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows through the use of admission control.

==Network capacity==
Network resources are limited, including router processing time and link throughput. Resource contention may occur on networks in several common circumstances. A wireless LAN is easily filled by a single personal computer. Even on fast computer networks, the backbone can easily be congested by a few servers and client PCs. Denial-of-service attacks by botnets are capable of filling even the largest Internet backbone network links, generating large-scale network congestion. In telephone networks, a mass call event can overwhelm digital telephone circuits, in what can otherwise be defined as a denial-of-service attack.

==Congestive collapse==
Congestive collapse (or congestion collapse) is the condition in which congestion prevents or limits useful communication. Congestion collapse generally occurs at choke points in the network, where incoming traffic exceeds outgoing bandwidth. Connection points between a local area network and a wide area network are common choke points. When a network is in this condition, it settles into a stable state where traffic demand is high but little useful throughput is available, during which packet delay and loss occur and quality of service is extremely poor.

Congestive collapse was identified as a possible problem by 1984. It was first observed on the early Internet in October 1986, when the NSFNET phase-I backbone dropped three orders of magnitude from its capacity of 32 kbit/s to 40 bit/s, which continued until end nodes started implementing Van Jacobson and Sally Floyd&#x27;s congestion control between 1987 and 1988. When more packets were sent than could be handled by intermediate routers, the intermediate routers discarded many packets, expecting the endpoints of the network to retransmit the information. However, early TCP implementations had poor retransmission behavior. When this packet loss occurred, the endpoints sent extra packets that repeated the information lost, doubling the incoming rate.

==Congestion control==
Congestion control modulates traffic entry into a telecommunications network in order to avoid congestive collapse resulting from oversubscription. This is typically accomplished by reducing the rate of packets. Whereas congestion control prevents senders from overwhelming the &quot;network&quot;, flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the &quot;receiver&quot;.

===Theory of congestion control===

The theory of congestion control was pioneered by Frank Kelly, who applied microeconomic theory and convex optimization theory to describe how individuals controlling their own rates can interact to achieve an &quot;optimal&quot; network-wide rate allocation. Examples of &quot;optimal&quot; rate allocation are max-min fair allocation and Kelly&#x27;s suggestion of proportionally fair allocation, although many others are possible.

Let formula_1 be the rate of flow formula_2, formula_3 be the capacity of link formula_4, and formula_5 be 1 if flow formula_2 uses link formula_4 and 0 otherwise. Let formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 be the corresponding vectors and matrix. Let formula_11 be an increasing, strictly concave function, called the utility, which measures how much benefit a user obtains by transmitting at rate formula_8. The optimal rate allocation then satisfies

: formula_13

: such that formula_14

The Lagrange dual of this problem decouples so that each flow sets its own rate, based only on a &quot;price&quot; signaled by the network. Each link capacity imposes a constraint, which gives rise to a Lagrange multiplier, formula_15. The sum of these multipliers, formula_16 is the price to which the flow responds.

Congestion control then becomes a distributed optimization algorithm. Many current congestion control algorithms can be modeled in this framework, with formula_15 being either the loss probability or the queueing delay at link formula_4. A major weakness is that it assigns the same price to all flows, while sliding window flow control causes burstiness that causes different flows to observe different loss or delay at a given link.

===Classification of congestion control algorithms===
Among the ways to classify congestion control algorithms are:
*By type and amount of feedback received from the network: Loss; delay; single-bit or multi-bit explicit signals
*By incremental deployability: Only sender needs modification; sender and receiver need modification; only router needs modification; sender, receiver and routers need modification.
*By performance aspect: high bandwidth-delay product networks; lossy links; fairness; advantage to short flows; variable-rate links
*By fairness criterion: Max-min fairness; proportionally fair; controlled delay

==Mitigation==
Mechanisms have been invented to prevent network congestion or to deal with a network collapse:
* Network scheduler active queue management which reorders or selectively drops network packets in the presence of congestion
* Explicit Congestion Notification an extension to IP and TCP communications protocols that adds a flow control mechanism 
* TCP congestion control various implementations of efforts to deal with network congestion

The correct endpoint behavior is usually to repeat dropped information, but progressively slow the repetition rate. Provided all endpoints do this, the congestion lifts and the network resumes normal behavior. Other strategies such as slow start ensure that new connections don&#x27;t overwhelm the router before congestion detection initiates.

Common router congestion avoidance mechanisms include fair queuing and other scheduling algorithms, and random early detection (RED) where packets are randomly dropped as congestion is detected. This proactively triggers the endpoints to slow transmission before congestion collapse occurs.

Some end-to-end protocols are designed to behave well under congested conditions; TCP is a well known example. The first TCP implementations to handle congestion were described in 1984, but Van Jacobson&#x27;s inclusion of an open source solution in the Berkeley Standard Distribution UNIX (&quot;BSD&quot;) in 1988 first provided good behavior.

UDP does not control congestion. Protocols built atop UDP must handle congestion independently. Protocols that transmit at a fixed rate, independent of congestion, can be problematic. Real-time streaming protocols, including many Voice over IP protocols, have this property. Thus, special measures, such as quality of service, must be taken to keep packets from being dropped in the presence of congestion.

===Practical network congestion avoidance===
Connection-oriented protocols, such as the widely used TCP protocol, watch for packet loss or queuing delay to adjust their transmission rate. Various network congestion avoidance processes support different trade-offs.

===TCP/IP congestion avoidance===
The TCP congestion avoidance algorithm is the primary basis for congestion control on the Internet.

Problems occur when concurrent TCP flows experience tail-drops, especially when bufferbloat is present. This delayed packet loss interferes with TCP&#x27;s automatic congestion avoidance. All flows that experience this packet loss begin a TCP retrain at the same moment – this is called TCP global synchronization.

===Active queue management===
Active queue management (AQM) is the reordering or dropping of network packets inside a transmit buffer that is associated with a network interface controller (NIC). This task is performed by the network scheduler.

====Random early detection====
One solution is to use random early detection (RED) on the network equipment&#x27;s egress queue. On networking hardware ports with more than one egress queue, weighted random early detection (WRED) can be used.

RED indirectly signals TCP sender and receiver by dropping some packets, e.g. when the average queue length is more than a threshold (e.g. 50%) and deletes linearly or cubically more packets, up to e.g. 100%, as the queue fills further.

====Robust random early detection====
The robust random early detection (RRED) algorithm was proposed to improve the TCP throughput against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, particularly low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attacks. Experiments confirmed that RED-like algorithms were vulnerable under LDoS attacks due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks.

====Flow-based WRED====
Some network equipment is equipped with ports that can follow and measure each flow and are thereby able to signal a too big bandwidth flow according to some quality of service policy. A policy could then divide the bandwidth among all flows by some criteria.

====Explicit Congestion Notification====
Another approach is to use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). ECN is used only when two hosts signal that they want to use it. With this method, a protocol bit is used to signal explicit congestion. This is better than the indirect congestion notification signaled by packet loss by the RED/WRED algorithms, but it requires support by both hosts.

When a router receives a packet marked as ECN-capable and the router anticipates congestion, it sets the ECN flag, notifying the sender of congestion. The sender should respond by decreasing its transmission bandwidth, e.g., by decreasing its sending rate by reducing the TCP window size or by other means.

The L4S protocol is an enhanced version of ECN which allows senders to collaborate with network devices to control congestion.

====TCP window shaping====
Congestion avoidance can be achieved efficiently by reducing traffic. When an application requests a large file, graphic or web page, it usually advertises a &quot;window&quot; of between 32K and 64K. This results in the server sending a full window of data (assuming the file is larger than the window). When many applications simultaneously request downloads, this data can create a congestion point at an upstream provider. By reducing the window advertisement, the remote servers send less data, thus reducing the congestion.

==== Backward ECN ====
Backward ECN (BECN) is another proposed congestion notification mechanism. It uses ICMP source quench messages as an IP signaling mechanism to implement a basic ECN mechanism for IP networks, keeping congestion notifications at the IP level and requiring no negotiation between network endpoints. Effective congestion notifications can be propagated to transport layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP, for the appropriate adjustments.

==Side effects of congestive collapse avoidance==

===Radio links===
The protocols that avoid congestive collapse generally assume that data loss is caused by congestion. On wired networks, errors during transmission are rare. WiFi, 3G and other networks with a radio layer are susceptible to data loss due to interference and may experience poor throughput in some cases. The TCP connections running over a radio-based physical layer see the data loss and tend to erroneously believe that congestion is occurring.

===Short-lived connections===
The slow-start protocol performs badly for short connections. Older web browsers created many short-lived connections and opened and closed the connection for each file. This kept most connections in the slow start mode. Initial performance can be poor, and many connections never get out of the slow-start regime, significantly increasing latency. To avoid this problem, modern browsers either open multiple connections simultaneously or reuse one connection for all files requested from a particular server.

==Admission control==
Admission control is any system that requires devices to receive permission before establishing new network connections. If the new connection risks creating congestion, permission can be denied. Examples include Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn standard for home networking over legacy wiring, Resource Reservation Protocol for IP networks and Stream Reservation Protocol for Ethernet.

<doc id="430526" wikidata="Q1237187" url="?curid=430526" title="Ron Suskind">
<text>Ronald Steven Suskind (born November 20, 1959) is an American journalist, author, and filmmaker. He was the senior national affairs writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; from 1993 to 2000, where he won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for articles that became the starting point for his first book, &quot;A Hope in the Unseen&quot;. His other books include &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot;, &quot;The One Percent Doctrine&quot;, &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, &quot;Confidence Men&quot;, and his memoir &quot;Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism,&quot; from which he made an Emmy Award-winning, Academy Award-nominated feature documentary. Suskind has written about the George W. Bush administration, the Barack Obama administration, and related issues of the United States&#x27; use of power.

== Life and career ==
Suskind was born in Kingston, New York, to a Jewish family. He is the son of Shirley Berney and Walter B. Suskind, and a second cousin of producer David Susskind. He grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, and graduated from Concord High School, after which he attended the University of Virginia. In 1983 he received a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism.

In 1990, Suskind went to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and became senior national affairs reporter in 1993. In 1995, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for two articles on Cedric Jennings, a student at inner-city Ballou High School in Washington, D.C., who wanted to attend MIT. Suskind left the &quot;Journal&quot; in 2000.

Suskind has written six books, and he has published in such periodicals as &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. In 2004, he discussed his book &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In 2006 he discussed &quot;The One Percent Doctrine&quot; on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, and in 2008 he discussed &quot;The Way of the World&quot; on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, and again appeared on the show when his 2011 book, &quot;Confidence Men&quot;, was published. He has also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; and PBS&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;. In 2001 and 2002, he was a contributor to &quot;Life 360,&quot; a joint production of ABC and PBS. Between 2004 and 2008, he made appearances on &quot;Frontline&quot;, the PBS series. On May 13, 2014, he appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to discuss his book &quot;Life, Animated&quot;, the real-life story of his autistic son, Owen Suskind, and &quot;his irrepressible wife,&quot; Cornelia.

In the spring of 2012, Suskind was the A.M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at the Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. At the Shorenstein Center he conducted four workshops for students about the process of reporting and writing titled, &quot;Truth and Consequences: Crafting Powerful Narratives in the Age of Message.&quot;

Suskind has two sons with his wife, Cornelia Anne Kennedy Suskind. The couple married in 1988. Cornelia is the granddaughter of Democratic Representative Martin J. Kennedy.

== Articles ==
In 2002, Suskind wrote two articles in &quot;Esquire&quot; on the workings of the George W. Bush White House. The first article, in June 2002, focused on presidential adviser Karen Hughes. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said that the pragmatic Hughes was &quot;the beauty to Karl&#x27;s beast&quot;, referring to Bush&#x27;s advisor Karl Rove. According to Card, her resignation signified a political shift in the administration further to the right. Suskind&#x27;s second &quot;Esquire&quot; story about Rove, in December 2002, carried the comments and a long memo from Bush&#x27;s former head of the White House Office of Faith-based and Community initiatives John DiIulio, an official who left the White House and spoke about his experiences. DiIulio criticized the Bush administration for having &quot;no policy apparatus&quot; and fixating on political calculation, and was quoted as saying &quot;it&#x27;s the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis,&quot; a comment he then explained in a 3,000-word, on-the-record memo to Suskind about his time in the administration. DiIulio later attempted to recant some of his characterizations.

An October 2004 cover story by Suskind in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; stated that the president was planning to partially privatize Social Security as his first initiative if re-elected—a disclosure that prompted controversy in the final two weeks of the campaign. In the article, Suskind quoted an unnamed advisor to Bush (later identified as someone who &quot;seems to have been&quot; Rove) as saying that

== Books ==
=== &quot;A Hope in the Unseen&quot; ===

In 1995 Suskind wrote a series of articles on the struggles of inner-city honors students in Washington, D.C, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Parts of these articles were used in his first book, &quot;A Hope in the Unseen&quot; (Doubleday/Broadway, 1998). The story chronicles the two-year journey of Cedric L. Jennings, an honor student who aspires to escape his blighted D.C. upbringing by going to an Ivy League university.

The book was chosen by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; and &quot;Booklist&quot; as one of the best books of the year. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; called it an &quot;extraordinary, formula-shattering book&quot;. David Halberstam called it a &quot;beautiful book of a heroic American struggle.&quot; The book has been a selection in college courses on American culture, education, sociology and creative writing, and has been a required reading for incoming freshmen at some universities. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the &quot;One Maryland, One Book&quot; program.

In a review of the book, CNN declared: &quot;As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as a well-intentioned anachronism, &quot;A Hope in the Unseen&quot; should be required reading for would-be opinion-mongers.&quot; In his review for &quot;Newsday&quot;, Bill Reel stated &quot;I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book—&quot;A Hope in the Unseen&quot; by Ron Suskind.&quot;

The book has been a favorite of Bill Clinton and school reformer Michelle Rhee, and Barack Obama.

Suskind says his writing style for this book was to use exhaustive reporting to place readers inside the heads of characters. Suskind stated that this &quot;writing style&quot; was a delving into motive and intent in an effort to understand the &quot;good enough reasons&quot; that underlie actions, which allowed for a fuller, more accurate—and often emotionally powerful—rendering of characters. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the book &quot;the new, new nonfiction.&quot;

=== &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; ===

&quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; was published on January 13, 2004. The book, which chronicled the two-year tenure of United States Treasury Secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill, was about the conduct and character of the Bush presidency. While the book covered a number of foreign and domestic issues, it is focussed on events that culminated in the Iraq War.

Among the disclosures in the book, which drew from numerous sources and more than 19,000 internal government documents, one was that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the U.S. occupation of Iraq was planned from Bush&#x27;s first U.S. National Security Council meeting in January 2001, soon after Bush took office. This lay in contrast to the perception that concerns over Iraq came to the forefront after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Administration officials have contended that O&#x27;Neill confused contingency plans with actual plans for invasion.

Rather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq occupation to the post-9/11 War on Terrorism. After the cover sheet of a packet containing classified information was shown during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview of O&#x27;Neill and Suskind, the United States Department of Treasury investigated whether both men had improperly received classified materials. It concluded in March 2004 that no laws were violated, but that inadequate document handling policies at the Treasury had allowed 140 documents which should have been marked classified to be entered into a computer system for unclassified documents. The documents were among those subsequently released to O&#x27;Neill in response to a legal document request and then given to Suskind.

In domestic affairs, the statements by O&#x27;Neill about the administration&#x27;s allegedly chaotic and politically driven policy-making process supported the claims of John DiIulio. O&#x27;Neill stated that Vice President Cheney had become part of &quot;a co-presidency&quot; with George W. Bush. One of the book&#x27;s disclosures involved the conflict between O&#x27;Neill and Cheney over what would become the 2003 tax cut. O&#x27;Neill, in a November 2002 meeting with Cheney and other senior officials, said that it was unprecedented to cut taxes at a time of war and that the cuts—which included the wealthiest Americans—would eventually push the government toward &quot;fiscal crisis.&quot; Cheney&#x27;s response was, &quot;Reagan proved deficits don&#x27;t matter. We won the midterms. This is our due.&quot; O&#x27;Neill opposed this policy.

=== &quot;The One Percent Doctrine&quot; ===

&quot;The One Percent Doctrine&quot; is Suskind&#x27;s third book, published in 2006. The book is about the evolution of the foreign policy of the younger Bush&#x27;s administration especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Excerpts of book were published in the June 18, 2006, issue of &quot;Time&quot;. Based on interviews with more than a hundred sources, including several cabinet officials, the book concluded that U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 was driven by the Bush Doctrine, which is described by a quote from Vice President Dick Cheney saying that it was important for the U.S. to think of &quot;low probability, high impact events&quot;—like terrorists or rogue states getting their hands on WMD—&quot;in a new way.&quot;

The doctrine, Suskind asserts, freed the administration from the dictates of evidence and allowed suspicion to be a guide for action in both its battles against terrorists and against rogue states, like Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

One of Suskind&#x27;s assertions—that a suspect in the London subway bombings was on a US &quot;no fly&quot; list and attempted to enter the US—has been challenged by the US government. The FBI described Suskind&#x27;s reporting on this single matter as &quot;inaccurate&quot;, and issued a statement saying &quot;the author has intertwined facts ... causing some confusion.&quot;

Despite being vetted by the CIA prior to publication, the book contained enough information to identify Aimen Dean, a mole within al Qaeda who had spent seven and a half years working for MI6 and had proven one of their most valuable assets. He was forced to quit his role and go into hiding, after extremists issued a Fatwa calling for his death.

The book was a New York Times Bestseller. Frank Rich called it a &quot;must-read bestseller&quot; while Michael Hill stated: &quot;If Bob Woodward is the chronicler of the Bush administration, Ron Suskind is the analyst ... Historians will be grateful for it as they write the many final drafts in the decades to come.&quot;

=== &quot;The Way of the World&quot; ===

&quot;The Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism&quot; was published on August 5, 2008. The book tells of people engaged in the challenges of national security and cultural connection. Among these stories are the tales of an intelligence official working to combat nuclear terrorism, a detainee lawyer fighting for rights at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a young Pakistani man interrogated under the White House, an Afghan teenager who spends a year in American high school, and former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto as she returns to Pakistan to challenge President Pervez Musharraf.

In his assessment for the &quot;Literary Review&quot;, Michael Burleigh said: &quot;Using a series of interwoven stories, some hopeful, others disturbing, Suskind explores whether the United States and the Muslim world will ever be able to find mutual respect and understanding. ... This is a hugely important field that has never been so well examined.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; declared &quot;Suskind is never unsympathetic to his characters, who he appears to have debriefed intensively. He is a romantic, a writer who clearly believes that his country has betrayed its past, its values and its moral compass by failing to tell the truth about the war.&quot; The &quot;New York Observer&quot; said: &quot;Moving. ... Mr. Suskind is a prodigiously talented craftsman. ... It&#x27;s all here: a cast of characters that sprawls across class and circumstance to represent the totality of a historical moment. ... These hard times, Mr. Suskind&#x27;s book suggests, call for a nonfiction Dickens.&quot;

Mark Danner, reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writes that &quot;these narratives and others perform, in Mr. Suskind&#x27;s hands, an intricate arabesque and manage, to a rather remarkable degree, to show us, in this age of terror, &#x27;the true way of the world.&#x27;&quot; It is around the stories of these characters that the book frames the debate about how America lost much of its moral authority in recent years and how it is struggling, often through the actions and initiative of individuals, to restore it.

&quot;The Way of the World&quot; made a series of disclosures centered on Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, the head of Iraqi intelligence under Saddam Hussein. The book said that British and American intelligence entered into a dialogue with Habbush before the invasion of Iraq, in which Habbush revealed that Saddam possessed no weapons of mass destruction and did not take an American invasion seriously. The book also contends that the Central Intelligence Agency resettled Habbush, paid him $5 million, and forged a document in his name alleging that 9/11 hijacker Mohammad Atta trained in Iraq.

The White House, former CIA director George Tenet, and former CIA officer Robert Richer, a figure in the book, denied involvement in the illegal act of fabricating the Habbush letter, denials that were echoed in an official CIA statement, saying of Suskind&#x27;s claim that the White House ordered the agency to forge a letter from Habbush: &quot;It did not happen.&quot;

Suskind responded to the Rob Richer&#x27;s denial, circulated by the White House, by posting on his website a partial transcript of a taped conversation with Richer in which the two discuss the Habbush forgery. In response to the official CIA statement, Suskind told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the disclosures and details in his book are backed up by hours of interviews and that there is &quot;not a shred of doubt about any of it.&quot; On August 11, House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers announced that his committee would look into the matter of the Habbush letter and a variety of other disclosures in the book.

&quot;The Way of the World&quot; debuted at number 3 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, but some remarked that its revelations did not produce the outrage or scandal that would seem to attend a White House-run disinformation campaign aimed at U.S. public opinion. The layers of the controversy have nonetheless deepened with the revelation that Ayad Allawi, the initial source of the Habbush letter, was at CIA headquarters the week before the letter emerged, and a piece in &quot;The American Conservative&quot; by Philip Giraldi that claims an &quot;extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community&quot; confirmed that the Vice President&#x27;s Office was behind the Habbush letter, but that &quot;Doug Feith&#x27;s Office of Special Plans&quot;, not the CIA, carried out the forgery.

Some disclosures in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; received less attention than the Habbush controversy, but the story the book tells about Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s actions toward Benazir Bhutto during the last months of her life was picked up in the Pakistani press and dovetailed with a movement calling for the impeachment of the (now former) Pakistani president. Speaking to another aspect of the book, Mark Danner, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writes that &quot;the revelation of an effort to steal and sell fissile material in Georgia&#x27;s now celebrated &#x27;breakaway region&#x27; of South Ossetia ... is only the most terrifying of a dozen or more newsworthy disclosures in this book.&quot; Suskind cites the battle against nuclear terrorism as the most pressing crisis the United States needs to combat in order to restore its moral authority, and details an ambitious attempt to infiltrate the worldwide nuclear black market, called the &quot;Armageddon Test.&quot;

=== &quot;Confidence Men&quot; ===

&quot;Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President&quot; was published on September 20, 2011, by HarperCollins. It describes the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which began in the U.S., and the attempts by President Barack Obama&#x27;s White House to combat it.

On September 15, 2011, news of the book began to leak to the press. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, having obtained an advanced copy, wrote: &quot;The book offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president, including Mr. Summers; Mr. Geithner; the former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag.&quot;

An article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on September 16 elaborated on the content of the book, citing the allegation that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ignored a directive from the president to draw up plans for restructuring Citibank in the spring of 2009. The article also notes that in an interview in the book, Geithner denies the account saying &quot;I don&#x27;t slow-walk the president on anything&quot;. The White House pushed back against the book in spite of having granted Ron Suskind an interview with the president. Communications director Dan Pfeiffer said that books like these &quot;tend to take the normal day-to-day activities of governing and infuse them with drama, palace intrigue and salacious details&quot;.

While some faulted Suskind for giving greater credence to the views of sources who gave him more journalistic access others praised him for doing the opposite. In his review for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Joe Nocera wrote &quot;to his everlasting credit, Suskind savages several people he clearly spent time interviewing, starting with Obama&#x27;s former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner, his Treasury secretary. And he&#x27;s more than willing to step outside his re-created scenes to conduct interviews, in which Obama aides and allies tell truths that are genuinely painful to hear.&quot;

In his first television appearance, on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, Suskind was interviewed by anchor Ann Curry, who cited the White House pushback in her questioning. Suskind maintained that the book represented an accurate depiction of what he had found in his reporting. Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in his review of the book for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that it would offer &quot;support for some of today&#x27;s standard progressive gripes about the President&quot; being stymied by his conservative, Wall Street-attentive advisers, &quot;and for a few of the conservative ones,&quot; namely assertions that Obama arrived in office unprepared to lead. In his review of the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Joe Nocera noted that the book had &quot;an omniscient quality&quot; of fly-on-the-wall scenes from inside the White House, much like the books of Bob Woodward, but &quot;doesn&#x27;t really go for phony omniscience&quot; where the sources who are most cooperative are rendered most favorably. In a &quot;New Republic&quot; review, John B. Judis wrote, &quot;Suskind&#x27;s book is being widely portrayed as critical of the Obama administration, but if you read the entire book, its message is that during Obama&#x27;s first two years he was foiled by his own inexperience as a manager and by a staff that didn&#x27;t do good by him, but that after the Democratic defeat in 2010 he learned from his failure.&quot;

Both Summers and Geithner, who responded to disclosures in the book&#x27;s pages, pushed back against their characterizations after publication.

A week after publication, the book debuted at No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for Nonfiction.

According to the book President Obama supported a financial transaction tax on trades of stocks, derivatives, and other financial instruments, but he was blocked by Summers.

&quot;Confidence Men&quot; was cited on various &quot;best book&quot; lists, and named an &quot;Esquire&quot; 2011 Best Book of the Year, with David Granger commenting: &quot;Journalism like this is all too rare.&quot; In the March 2012 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, James Fallows cited &quot;Confidence Men&quot; in his article &quot;Obama, Explained,&quot; writing that the Obama administration&#x27;s &quot;early failure of accountability&quot; in its &quot;apparent coddling of Wall Street in 2009 ... is the main theme of Ron Suskind&#x27;s &quot;Confidence Men&quot; ... it created a substantive and symbolic problem the administration has never fully recovered from. Substantive, because of the moral hazard created by using public money to guarantee the bonuses and repay the losses of people who had been so recklessly destructive. Symbolic, for all the reasons that eventually came to a head with last year&#x27;s Occupy movement. An official familiar with the administration&#x27;s economic policy told me: &#x27;The recapitalization of the banks was a good idea, and necessary. But we did not put enough conditions on [their] getting the money. Ultimately not being tougher with the guys that got the money is the thing that overthrows the government twice—in 2008 [in a reaction against Bush&#x27;s TARP plan] and again in 2010.&#x27;&quot;

=== &quot;Life, Animated&quot; ===

&quot;Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism&quot; was published on April 1, 2014, by Kingswell (an imprint of Disney Publishing Worldwide). It is the number 1 best seller under the category of &quot;Special Needs Biographies&quot; on Amazon, and also made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list under Science Books. The memoir describes the Suskind family&#x27;s two-decade journey in connecting with their youngest son Owen, who was diagnosed at age 3 with regressive autism, lost his ability to speak, and then developed an obsessive interest in Disney movies. Once the family discovered this, they began to play the roles of animated characters and conversing in Disney dialogue – a method that over years helped their son regain speech. Suskind chose to publish the book through a Disney imprint because of his son&#x27;s frequent quotation of Disney movies in the book; otherwise, he would have had to pay licensing fees for each line of dialogue used. However, Disney agreed to exert no influence over any of the contents of the book. In the memoir, Suskind explains how the family and therapists helped Owen use the Disney stories to relate to real situations, develop &quot;inner speech&quot; capacities, and gradually connect to others. He calls this intense interest in Disney an example of an autism &quot;affinity,&quot; referring to the propensity for individuals with autism to develop sustained, self-directed passions in one or a few subject areas. The Suskinds found that these deep interests – long viewed as unproductive obsessions that should be
curtailed – are more &quot;pathway than prison&quot; for individuals with autism or other untraditional learners, insofar they use them &quot;like an enigma machine to crack the codes of the wider world and find their way forward.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; book review of &quot;Life, Animated&quot; wrote that Suskind &quot;charts Owen&#x27;s remarkable journey back to connection through the unlikely vehicle of the Disney cartoons that are his only passion.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; called Owen &quot;every reader&#x27;s son,&quot; writing that &quot;For Owen and his family, Disney evolved into his translator of reality. He memorized every line of dialogue in the films and learned, in his own way, how to re-enact each scene, fully loaded with the emotions and the moral lessons embedded in them. And his family, despite the misgivings of their doctors, learned to connect with Owen through Disney as well.&quot; The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; called it a &quot;wonderful book, whether or not you know a person with autism,&quot; and asserted that, &quot;without delving into too much statistical and informational overload, Suskind explains in a straightforward way many of the differences in how people with autism perceive and process information.&quot; A chapter that was excerpted in the March 9th issue of the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; became the most emailed piece of the month.

Suskind describes the positive response as a &quot;giant warm wave&quot; that differentiates
this &quot;personal&quot; narrative from his others. He has since spoken to audiences at the United Nations and the NIH; testified in front of the United States Congress; and appeared on numerous TV and radio shows, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Nightly News with Brian Williams&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, NPR and &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;.

On April 2, 2014, for World Autism Awareness Day, Ron spoke to the UN about his family&#x27;s experience, stressing the need for government-funded research and support around the world. On April 7, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the methodology the family created, which they called &quot;Affinity Therapy,&quot; will be studied by researchers from MIT, Yale, and Cambridge University to try to
understand the neural mechanisms at work and develop a manualized, therapeutic model harnessing affinities for those with autism.

On October 17, 2014, in a feature column for &quot;The New York Times&quot; about her own autistic son&#x27;s relationship with Siri, Apple&#x27;s personal assistant software for iPhone, Judith Newman stated that Suskind &quot;is talking to SRI (Stanford Research Institute) about having assistants for those with autism that can be programmed to speak in the voice of the character that reaches them.&quot;

<text>Vincent Browne (born 17 July 1944) is an Irish print and broadcast journalist. He is a columnist with &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; and a non-practising barrister. From 1996 until 2007, he presented a nightly talk-show on RTÉ Radio, &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;, which focused on politics, the proceedings of tribunals on political corruption and police misconduct. From 2007 to 2017 he presented &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; on TV3, which was broadcast from Monday to Thursday at 11:00pm.

==Early life==
Born in 1944, he grew up in Broadford, County Limerick, where he attended the local national school. He spent a year at the Irish language college, Coláiste na Rinne in An Rinn, County Waterford, then a year at queen of Angel&#x27;s secondary school in Dromcolliher, County Limerick, before going to Castleknock College. He graduated from University College Dublin with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics and Economics. He also founded the oldest surviving UCD newspaper, the &quot;College Tribune&quot;. He also served as UCD Young Fine Gael&#x27;s Chairperson.

==Career==
He worked on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; for five months in 1967–68. He reported on the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and then edited a monthly news magazine, &quot;Nusight&quot; in 1969–1970.

He was appointed Northern news editor of &quot;The Irish Press&quot; group in 1970 (working for all three newspapers in the group, &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, the &quot;Evening Press&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Press&quot;) and covered the most intense and violent period of the Northern Ireland conflict. In 1974, he joined Independent Newspapers and, after a brief period in the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, worked for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, then edited by Conor O&#x27;Brien and later by Michael Hand.

He launched &quot;Magill&quot; magazine in September 1977 with Noel Pearson and Mary Holland. &quot;Magill&quot; became Ireland&#x27;s foremost investigative publication. Among its writers were Gene Kerrigan, Pat Brennan and Paddy Agnew. He remained editor of &quot;Magill&quot; until 1983, when he became involved in the relaunch of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; with Tony Ryan, then of GPA and later of Ryanair. A series of articles he published in &quot;Magill&quot; highlighting the links between the Workers&#x27; Party and the Official IRA in the 1980s caused him and other journalists to receive death threats. After the publication of &quot;The Lost Revolution: the Story of the Official IRA and the Workers&#x27; Party&quot; it was revealed that the Official IRA had planned to assassinate him by planting a bomb on his boat, but the operation was called off at the last minute. He was editor of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; until 1994. He has written a weekly column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; since then, and since 2000, has written weekly for &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot;. He started broadcasting on RTÉ radio in 1996.

In 1997, he relaunched &quot;Magill&quot; magazine, which had ceased publication in 1990. In the 13 issues he published then, the magazine broke several major stories. One led to the establishment of the Planning Tribunal, originally chaired by Mr Justice Fergus Flood; another caused a committee of the Oireachtas to examine the DIRT scandal; another caused an investigation of insurance &quot;churning&quot; by Irish Life, a leading Irish insurance company. He sold the &quot;Magill&quot; title to Hosen publisher, Mike Hogan, in November 1998. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1997 and for a while practised as a barrister. He no longer practices law.

In October 2004, he launched a current affairs magazine, &quot;Village&quot;, of which he was editor. &quot;Village&quot; ceased publication in August 2008 before being re-launched under a new editor, Michael Smith. Browne now writes a column for &quot;Village&quot; magazine.

He was involved in a controversy over the tapping of his telephone by the Irish state from February 1975 to February 1983. When this was disclosed by former minister for justice Seán Doherty, Browne sued the State. He made a settlement with the State in early 1997 which included an agreement to publish a statement on the settlement, stating, inter alia, that the State had intercepted his telephone conversations for reasons of State security – Browne had written much about the IRA in the early- to mid-1970s – while accepting that Browne had himself never been involved in subversion or crime. On being given access to the transcripts from 1981, Browne claimed that it was apparent the motivation for the interception of his telephone conversations for the eight-year period had little to do with the security of the State – it was aimed at garnering information on his work as a journalist, entirely aside from his reporting of the IRA. Browne sought to have the agreement altered to permit a public acknowledgement that the intercepts were not done for security reasons. The Fine Gael–Labour-Democratic Left coalition government refused. He subsequently disclosed this himself on television and later in print.

For ten years he presented the programme &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1. In August 2000, he substituted for John Bowman on the RTÉ television programme &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;. He also presented &quot;Prime Time&quot; on RTÉ One.

From 14 January 2007, he presented &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;, a nightly current affairs television show on TV3 before stepping down from this role on 27 July 2017. Despite airing on what is usually considered a graveyard slot, the show was highly successful drawing up to 166,000 viewers.

In June 2012, Denis O&#x27;Brien wrote to Browne threatening to sue him. Browne disclosed this letter to the general public.

Browne later wrote a piece for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; on why O&#x27;Brien &quot;is not a fit person to control INM [Independent News &amp; Media]&quot;. In it he questioned O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s previous threats to sue Sam Smyth and asked &quot;[H]ow plausible is it that the removal of Sam Smyth from a Sunday morning radio programme on Today FM, which Denis O&#x27;Brien controls, and his ostracisation now within the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; to which he is contracted (not one article by him has been published for some months), isn&#x27;t part of the same campaign which Denis O&#x27;Brien and [one of his then representatives on the board of INM] Leslie Buckley, conducted against Sam Smyth in 2010?&quot;

In 2015, after asking were other members of the media wimps, he led a posse of journalists and camera crews into Gorse Hill, the up-market house at the centre of a legal battle.

==Politics==

In 1994, he sought a nomination for the Fine Gael party in that year&#x27;s European elections or the possible general election of that year (it was thought a general election might follow the collapse of the Albert Reynolds&#x27; government). He was rebuffed by the leader of Fine Gael and future Taoiseach, John Bruton. He then became a vocal critic of the party.

A staunch critic of Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, in 1982 Browne appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to discuss the effectiveness of TDs where he poured scorn on Kenny, claiming he was &quot;purporting&quot; to be a TD. In October 2010, he was forced to make a public apology to Kenny after jokingly asking whether Fine Gael was requesting that he go into a dark room with a gun and bottle of whiskey. This was in reference to Fine Gael&#x27;s position in the polls, where they were in second place to Labour, and a previous leadership challenge to Kenny by Richard Bruton. Kenny refused to appear on the leaders&#x27; debate hosted by Browne on TV3 during the 2011 general election campaign.

He voted &quot;No&quot; in the 2012 Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum.

In July 2003, writing of the Arms Crisis, he said &quot;the gravest injustice was done to Albert Luykx (a member of the SS during World War II) ...who never had reason to believe that in lending money to the operation and giving otherwise of his services, he was not acting on behalf of the Irish state&quot;.

In October 2012, while presenting &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;, he said of Israel that it &quot;polarises the Islamic community of the world against the rest of the world&quot; and that it had stolen land from the Arabs. Israel&#x27;s deputy ambassador to Ireland concluded these to be &quot;racist, anti-Semitic remarks&quot;. Browne in turn said he was not anti-Semitic, but a critic of Israel, and himself criticised &quot;the suggestion that because you&#x27;re critical of Israel, you&#x27;re automatically anti-Semitic. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s acceptable&quot;. Furthermore, Browne said it was &quot;blackmail&quot; to try to dismiss every critic of Israel as anti-Semitic. The BAI threw out the accusation of antisemitism, though it asked Browne to deliver an apology on TV3.

He was a wedding guest of Fine Gael senator Jerry Buttimer.

==Personal life==
Browne is married and has two daughters. He sold his €2.6 million home in Dalkey in June 2011 to pay off debts incurred from the establishment of &quot;Village&quot; magazine, and to provide a pension. He now resides in Dún Laoghaire.

He is the younger brother of late comedy actor John Belushi and the father of actor Robert Belushi.

== Early life ==
James Adam Belushi was born June 15, 1954, in Wheaton, Illinois, to Adam Anastos Belushi, an Albanian from Qytezë, Korçë, and Agnes Demetri Belushi, who was born in Ohio to Albanian immigrants from Korçë. He was raised in Wheaton, a Chicago suburb, along with his three siblings: older brother John, older sister Marian, and younger brother Billy. After graduating from Wheaton Central High School in 1972, Jim Belushi attended the College of DuPage, and graduated from Southern Illinois University Carbondale with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Speech and Theater Arts in 1978.

== Career ==

From 1977 to 1980, Belushi, like his older brother John, worked with the Chicago theater group The Second City. During this period, Belushi made his television debut in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching the Kids&quot; and also had a small part in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Fury&quot;. His first significant role was in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Thief&quot; (1981). After John&#x27;s death, from 1983 to 1985 he appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; he portrayed characters such as Hank Rippy from &quot;Hello, Trudy!&quot;, Man on the Street Jesse Donnelly, and &quot;That White Guy&quot;.

He made a guest appearance in Faerie Tale Theatre&#x27;s third-season episode &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, starring Paul Reubens as the titular puppet.

Belushi rose to greater prominence with his supporting roles in &quot;The Man with One Red Shoe&quot; (1985), &quot;About Last Night...,&quot; &quot;Salvador&quot;, and &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (as Patrick Martin) (all 1986), which opened up opportunities for lead roles. He has starred in films including &quot;Real Men&quot;, &quot;The Principal&quot;, &quot;Red Heat&quot;, &quot;Homer and Eddie&quot;, &quot;K-9&quot;, &quot;Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Dimenticare Palermo&quot;, &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot;, &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, &quot;Curly Sue&quot;, &quot;Once upon a Crime&quot;, &quot;Wild Palms&quot;, &quot;Race the Sun&quot;, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, &quot;Separate Lives&quot;, &quot;Retroactive&quot;, &quot;Gang Related&quot;, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Dance&quot; and &quot;Joe Somebody&quot;.

He also lent his vocal talents for &quot;9: The Last Resort&quot; (a PC game released in 1995), in which he portrayed &quot;Salty&quot;, a coarse yet helpful character. In 1997, he portrayed the &quot;Masked Mutant&quot; in the Goosebumps PC video game, alongside Adam West as &quot;The Galloping Gazelle&quot;. On January 4, 2001, Belushi appeared on the &quot;ER&quot; episode &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;. The episode focused both on Dr. Mark Greene&#x27;s life-or-death brain surgery in New York and on Belushi&#x27;s character, who had been in a car accident with his son in Chicago. Belushi&#x27;s performance contributed to his re-emergence in the public eye, and the following year he was cast as the title role in ABC&#x27;s &quot;According to Jim&quot;.

His first animation voice-over was as a pimple on Krumm&#x27;s head in &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; on Nickelodeon. That performance led him to be cast in the recurring role as Simon the Monster Hunter in that series, where he ad-libbed much of his dialogue.
In 2003, Belushi and Dan Aykroyd released the album &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot;, and participated in an accompanying tour. The concert was made available on video on demand by Bob Gold &amp; Associates. He also performs at various venues nationwide as Zee Blues in an updated version of The Blues Brothers. He released his first book, &quot;Real Men Don&#x27;t Apologize&quot;, in May 2006. Belushi was a narrator of an NFL offensive linemen commercial. Belushi also introduced the starting lineups for the University of Illinois football team during ABC&#x27;s telecast of the 2008 Rose Bowl.

He appeared in MC Hammer&#x27;s video &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; in 1991 (in the extended full-length version). He also hosted a celebration rally for the Chicago Cubs playoff series in Chicago prior to the 2008 World Series. Steve Dahl has dubbed him &quot;The Funniest Living Belushi&quot;.

In 2010, Belushi was cast in a pilot for CBS called &quot;The Defenders&quot;, a series about defense lawyers. The one-hour series premiered on September 22, 2010. In two episodes in 2011, Belushi was paired with Blues Brothers partner Dan Aykroyd. On May 15, 2011, &quot;The Defenders&quot; was canceled by CBS. In 2011, he was cast as corrupt businessman Harry Brock in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, which opened on Broadway in late April.
In August 2020, Discovery Channel started airing a series about Belushi and his cannabis farm in Oregon, called &quot;Growing Belushi&quot;.

In August 2022, Belushi appeared as Brother Zee, with Aykroyd and The Blues Brothers Band, at the first &quot;Blues Brothers Con&quot; event held at Old Joliet Prison Historical Site. The two day festival also featured a screening of the film and performances from Mondo Cortez &amp; The Chicago Blues Angels, Lil&#x27; Ed &amp; The Blues Imperials and Dave Weld &amp; The Imperial Flames.

== Personal life ==
Belushi has been married three times. On May 17, 1980, he married Sandra Davenport, who gave birth to their son, Robert James, on October 23, 1980. Belushi and Davenport divorced in 1988. Belushi was married to actress Marjorie Bransfield from 1990 to 1992. He married Jennifer Sloan on May 2, 1998; they share a daughter and a son.

He is Eastern Orthodox Christian, visiting with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2010. Belushi is an avid fan of the Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Fire.

Belushi had a legal battle and publicized feud with his neighbor, actress Julie Newmar. She claimed their conflicts stemmed from Belushi&#x27;s attempt to &quot;build a second house in the back&quot;, which she claimed was illegal in their R-1 neighborhood, since there can be only one house per lot. In 2004, Belushi filed a $4million lawsuit against Newmar, alleging &quot;she harassed and defamed him&quot;. He also claimed she destroyed his fence, which Newmar denied. They ended the feud amicably in 2006, when Belushi invited Newmar to guest-star on &quot;According to Jim&quot; on an episode which satirized their conflict.

In 2011, Belushi announced he was suffering from gout, and became a spokesman for Savient Pharmaceuticals&#x27; educational campaign &quot;Check Out Your Gout&quot;. He appeared on the cover of and was interviewed by &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; magazine.

Belushi endorsed the re-election campaign of Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012. On a Fox News interview, he explained &quot;When you talk to the President in private, he&#x27;s a cool guy, who knows what he&#x27;s doing. Besides, I&#x27;m from Chicago too.&quot;

Belushi built a getaway home in Eagle Point, Oregon, in 2015 where he now grows cannabis. By 2018, the size of his Eagle Point property had been expanded to . He is involved with fundraising for projects in Eagle Point and elsewhere in Southern Oregon, including the planned rebuilding of the Butte Creek Mill and the restoration of the Holly Theatre, in Medford. In 2018, he was living in Los Angeles &quot;most of the time&quot;, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported, and living in Oregon part of the year. Per a 2018 article, Belushi indicated he planned on opening a pop-up cannabis dispensary in downtown Portland.

<doc id="430549" wikidata="Q1072868" url="?curid=430549" title="Final Fantasy Tactics Advance">
<text>is a 2003 tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Game Boy Advance. A spin-off of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, the game shares several traits with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, although it is not a direct sequel. The player assembles a clan of characters, and controls their actions over grid-like battlefields. Players are mostly free to decide the classes, abilities, and statistics of their characters.

The game&#x27;s story centers on four children; Marche, Mewt, Ritz, and Doned, who live in a small town named St. Ivalice. The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town, &quot;Ivalice&quot;, after discovering an ancient magical book. The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him.

&quot;Tactics Advance&quot; is one of the initial products from the cooperation of Square and Nintendo made for the Game Boy Advance console; it was developed by the team brought over from the game company Quest Corporation. Following its release, &quot;Tactics Advance&quot;-themed merchandise was introduced. The game was positively received. It has a sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift&quot; for the Nintendo DS.

&quot;Tactics Advance&quot; was re-released for the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console in 2016; on January 28 in Europe, Australia, and North America and on March 30 in Japan.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Tactics Advance&quot;, turn-based tactical battles take place on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan&#x27;s members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer&#x27;s team in turn-based play, although unlike &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; characters execute their actions instantly.

Missions are tasks undertaken by a clan. There are four types of missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche&#x27;s entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche&#x27;s group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche&#x27;s clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.

Some missions, typically dispatch missions, require a special item to be in possession in order to accept the mission. Others require a dispatch character to have a specific job class. In regards to items, this may mean another mission must be done to get an item that would allow you to perform the later mission.

The world map is initially empty except for the starting location; it is customized as the player wins location &quot;tokens&quot; after certain missions. These tokens represent different terrains and settlements, such as plains, mountains, deserts, forests, and towns, that can be placed in slots on the world map. Items are rewarded to the player depending on the placement of the tokens. Ivalice also introduces areas called , lawless slums that Judges avoid. is a German word which means &quot;the hunt&quot;. are the only places in the game in which a character can die; everywhere else, they are protected from death by the Judges and are simply knocked out.

&quot;Tactics Advance&quot; also offers multiplayer capability for two players. Players may cooperate or compete using a link-cable peripheral, and also trade items and party members. Additional missions and items are also offered when players link.

===Job system===
There are 34 &quot;jobs&quot; in &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; that govern a character&#x27;s stats, equipment, and abilities. Most items that can be equipped have various abilities assigned to them, each available for use by characters of a certain job while the item is equipped. When a battle is completed, characters will receive Ability Points (AP) distributed over their currently equipped weapons or items (such as armor). Once a target amount of AP has been accumulated for a given ability, the character will master that ability, allowing the character to use them at any time, regardless of items equipped and job chosen. Mastery of abilities in different jobs will eventually allow the character access to more jobs. For example, if a human unit wishes to change jobs to Paladin, it needs to master at least two &quot;action&quot; abilities from the Soldier job.

Units have a primary job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level up and the attributes associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, but has the stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, will not be allowed for use if the character has a Katana equipped.

&quot;Tactics Advance&quot; also introduces five playable races: Humans, the small rodentlike Moogles, the strong lizard-like Bangaa, the agile rabbit-like Viera, and the magically skilled Nu Mou. Certain jobs are only available to certain races. Along with the abilities obtained with experience, each race has a guardian beast called a &quot;Totema&quot; to represent whom and which can be summoned to whose aid when a member of that race has 10 Judge Points, that is after your clan has defeated that Totema as part of the main story line.

===Laws===
One arbitrary game mechanic of &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; is the Laws system. Laws are set by Judges, invincible arbiters present at each battle, with some exceptions. Laws may forbid the use of certain weapons, items, elemental spells, or status changes. Breaking a law results in punishment by Carding, the receipt of a red or yellow card. Imprisonment happens if a character infringes a law twice or knocks out another unit with a forbidden ability or weapon. However, have no Judges or laws; units knocked out in the will die and permanently leave the clan if they are not revived by the end of the battle.

To offset the difficulty of having things forbidden for use, there are certain things that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains the ability to use law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.

==Plot==
===Characters===
The story of &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; revolves around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, the main character who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world into the world of Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche&#x27;s little brother who does not desire to return to the real world, since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt&#x27;s father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.

Within Ivalice, there are other characters that help advance the plot. Some characters befriended Marche, such as the moogles Montblanc and Nono; Ezel Berbier, a Nu Mou troublemaker and self-proclaimed genius; and Shara, a Viera archer who befriends Ritz. There are other characters who antagonize Marche, including Babus Swain, a Nu Mou Royal mage in Mewt&#x27;s service; Llednar Twem, a mysterious enforcer who replaces the Judges when they become independent of the Palace; and Queen Remedi, who is the ruler of Ivalice and was in the Gran Grimoire itself in a form modeled after Mewt&#x27;s deceased mother.

===Story===

Ivalice is a world created by four ordinary children: Marche Radiuju, a new student and resident of St. Ivalice and its school; Mewt Randell, a shy boy still attached to the memory of his late mother; Ritz Malheur, an assertive and outspoken classmate of Marche and Mewt; and Doned Radiuju, Marche&#x27;s younger, handicapped brother and a big fan of fantasy novels and video games. Mewt comes across a dusty old tome in a local used bookstore and eagerly wishes to show it to his friends. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the book over to Marche&#x27;s house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have ever seen before, and a single inscription reads: &quot;Alta oron, Sondus kameela&quot;. The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt&#x27;s memories from a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game.

Marche is separated from the others, and immediately begins a quest to return home. Even after realizing how much better his life is in the new Ivalice, he believes that none of it is real and is even more determined to return to his home when he realizes that everyone in town has been dragged into the dream as well, many of whom are now suffering under Mewt&#x27;s rule or are being slaughtered by the adventuring Clans that populate the world. The other children, and Mewt&#x27;s father Cid, slowly realize through Marche&#x27;s efforts that the world has been shaped according to their wishes. Mewt is no longer being teased, is reunited with his deceased mother, and is now the Prince of Ivalice; Ritz no longer has her white albinic hair, instead having the silky red hair which she always wanted; Doned can now walk and is no longer sickly; Marche is suddenly athletic and popular; Cid is the highest-ranking official in the nation; and all of them now live in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, the video game the children all love.

Eventually Marche succeeds in his quest to return Ivalice to normal. He achieves this by destroying the crystals, or world threads, of Ivalice, defeating Llednar Twem (the manifestation of Mewt&#x27;s negative emotions), and killing the Li-Grim, the physical manifestation of the book&#x27;s wish-based magic that had been masquerading as Mewt&#x27;s mother, Queen Remedi. He teaches the other children in the process that they cannot live in fantasy but must learn to live with their misfortunes in reality. The other children are wiser from the experience, as the ending reveals them all to have become happy with themselves.

In addition to the main plot, there are two side plots: the Redwing Arc and the Judge Arc. The Redwing Arc centers around the Redwings clan, a foreign crime ring, their subordinate clan Borzoi, and their smuggled foreign monsters. The other is the Judge Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions. This serves as an alternative ending where Marche never goes on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt judges, and becomes next in line for Cid&#x27;s judge sword.

==Development and release==
Rumors of the game&#x27;s development began when Square announced its publishing agreement with Nintendo, and was later confirmed by the producer Matsuno. The development team of &quot;Tactics Advance&quot;, Square&#x27;s Product Development Division 4, was constructed from employees of Quest Corporation, and work began in February 2002. This comes after Quest announced the handover of its software development team to Square, of which the former is famed for its &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; series. Initially thought of as a port of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; is developed with an entirely new storyline and setting, and received significant changes to make it more user-friendly for the GBA handheld console; e.g. a quick-save function.

&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; uses the gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, but introduced certain changes such as a customizable map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames have been given to create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there&#x27;s also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a GameCube for this to work.

In Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; story was expanded and broadcast in Japanese radio stations. The radio drama entitled &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Radio Edition&quot; was broadcast in four radio stations within Japan from early January to late March 2003.

&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; was released in 2003 in Japan on February 14, North America on September 8, Australia on September 19, and in the United Kingdom on October 24.

===Music===

The music in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; was primarily composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack&quot; album was released by DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as it sounds through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled &quot;White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot;, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. &quot;White&quot; spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into MIDI file format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, and there are no voices or speech within the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; sold over 440,000 copies during its year of release in Japan, with nearly 225,000 units being sold in its first week alone. By August 2004, more than 1 million units of the game were sold in North America and Europe together. In the United States alone, the game sold 660,000 copies and earned $22 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 40th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.

The game was well received among the gaming community, widely regarded to feature an outstanding combination of music, graphics, gameplay, and storyline. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; won Handheld Game of the Year at the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2004. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best Game Boy Advance game of September 2003. It was also rated as outstanding by IGN (9.0 out of 10) and given 5 out of 5 by GameSpy. In 2007, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; was named 14th best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN&#x27;s feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s long lifespan. It was also rated the 67th best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Top 200 Games list. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; was also nominated for NAVGTR Award for Strategy Game of The Year Category, but lost to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot; for Windows 9x compatible-PC.

Reviewers were pleased with graphics and visuals of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot;; GameSpot added that the battles are &quot;clear and colorful&quot;, and character jobs are easily identified, though gameplay becomes slow when too many character sprites are in one screen. The gameplay is also lauded for retaining the elements of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; yet offers freedom to players to develop characters as they wish. &quot;GameNOW&quot; said that the game &quot;lives up to its legacy—and then some&quot;, and called it &quot;easily one of the best GBA games around&quot;. Criticism was directed at the game&#x27;s menu, which was cluttered with complicated options in organizing the clan members, and did not detail out statistics for characters and equipment. Some reviewers thought there are too many character jobs since some jobs overlap one another and certain abilities are redundant.

==Legacy==
In 2007, a sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS as part of the &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot; series, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift&quot;. While the story focuses on different characters than &quot;Advance&quot;, several characters from the game appear in cameo roles, such as Montblanc and Mewt. Montblanc also appears in &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; as the leader of Clan Centurio.

To commemorate the release of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; in Japan, several pieces of merchandise were introduced exclusive for the region: web money cards, posters, character card collections and a set of twenty pin badges. Square and Nintendo released a limited-edition &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot;-themed Game Boy Advance SP package to commemorate the game and the console&#x27;s launching in February 2003. A Japanese-exclusive adaptation of the game&#x27;s story in radio drama form was also released. It was aired from January to March 2003. The series was released by DigiCube on CD in four separate parts, with some changes to plot details.

<text>Russell William Wallace Jr. (born August 14, 1956) is an American former NASCAR racing driver. He won the 1984 NASCAR Cup series Rookie of the Year and the 1989 NASCAR Winston Cup Championship. For the accolades over the course of his successful career, Wallace has been inducted in the NASCAR Hall of Fame (2013), the International Motorsports Hall of Fame (2013), the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (2014) and the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame (2010).

==Racing career==
===Early career===
Prior to joining the NASCAR circuit, Wallace made a name for himself racing around in Florida, winning a pair of local track championships and more than 200 short track races. In 1979, he won the United States Auto Club&#x27;s (USAC) Stock Car Rookie of the Year honors, finishing third in points behind A. J. Foyt and Bay Darnell. In 1981, he finished second in the USAC Stock Cars championship standings, behind Joe Ruttman.

In 1983, he won the American Speed Association (ASA) championship while also competing against some of NASCAR&#x27;s future stars like Mark Martin, Alan Kulwicki, and Dick Trickle.

===NASCAR career===
In 1980, Wallace made his NASCAR debut at Atlanta, driving the No. 16 Chevrolet for Roger Penske. He ended up finishing second in the race after qualifying seventh. He made nine NASCAR appearances over the next three years, finishing inside the Top 10 in only one more race. In 1984, Wallace joined the Winston Cup circuit full-time, winning NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors and finishing 14th in the final points standings. He drove the No. 88 Gatorade-sponsored Pontiac for Cliff Stewart with a best finish of fourth, along with two fifth-place finishes and four further Top 10s. Wallace stayed with Cliff Stewart for 1985 but this time, he drove the No. 2 Alugard-sponsored Pontiac. In 29 races, Wallace had two Top 5s and eight Top 10s.

====Blue Max Racing====
In 1986, Wallace switched teams to the No. 27 Alugard-sponsored Pontiac for Raymond Beadle&#x27;s Blue Max Racing team. His first win came at Bristol Motor Speedway on April 6, 1986. He also won at Martinsville on September 21. He finished the year with two wins, four Top 5s, and 16 Top 10s in 29 races. He finished sixth in the points, making this his first Top 10 finish in the standings. In 1987, Wallace gained sponsorship from Kodiak tobacco, establishing the No. 27 Kodiak-sponsored Pontiac livery his early career is most remembered for. He scored victories at Watkins Glen and Riverside, as well as his first series pole at Michigan in June. These results were backed up with nine Top 5s and 16 Top 10s in 29 races. He finished fifth in the final points standings.

During a practice session at Bristol on August 27, 1988, Wallace&#x27;s car lost control and slammed on the turn 4 wall before barrel rolling five times on the straightaway. It took rescue officials - including Jerry Punch - 15 minutes to extract him from the wrecked car. According to Wallace, he nearly choked to death from a ham sandwich he ate before practice. Despite this near-death experience, Wallace developed his career further in 1988, scoring six victories (including four of the final five races of the year). His wins were at Michigan, Charlotte, North Wilkesboro, Rockingham, the final race ever run at Riverside, and the season finale at Atlanta. With these six wins as well as 19 Top 5s and four further Top 10s, he finished second to Bill Elliott by 24 points.
In 1989, Wallace won the NASCAR Winston Cup Championship with crew chief Barry Dodson, by finishing 15th at the Atlanta Journal 500 at Atlanta to beat out close friend and fierce rival Dale Earnhardt (the race winner) by 12 points. Wallace also won The Winston in a controversial fashion, by spinning out Darrell Waltrip on the last lap.

In 1990, Raymond Beadle switched sponsors, to Miller Genuine Draft. The four-year sponsorship deal was tied specifically to Wallace, meaning it went to whichever team Wallace went. The 1989 championship year was reportedly marked with acrimony between him and Beadle. However, Wallace was stuck with the team for 1990 due to his contract. Rusty won 18 races for Beadle.

====Penske Racing====
In 1991, Wallace took the Miller sponsorship with him to Penske Racing, and he continued in the No. 2 Miller Genuine Draft Pontiac. He also won the 1991 IROC championship. While 1992 only carried him one win, the win at the Miller 400 was satisfying; it was the first win for Wallace in a car which arguably was his best known chassis for his career, one affectionately known as &quot;Midnight&quot; after the win. With this nickname, the car raced for six seasons, carrying various race wins before being taken out of the fleet in 1997.

The 1993 season was arguably his most successful season despite two major accidents at Daytona and Talladega, in which his car went airborne and flipped several times. He won the second race of the season on February 28, 1993, at North Carolina Motor Speedway. The season was also a sad one, as Wallace&#x27;s friend and reigning NASCAR Champion Alan Kulwicki was killed flying into Bristol in April 1993. Because of this, when Wallace won the race at Bristol, in respect to Alan Kulwicki, he did a &quot;Polish victory lap&quot;—turning his car around and driving around the track the wrong way, as made famous by Kulwicki. In every race Wallace won that year he performed a &quot;Kulwicki victory lap&quot;. He won all three races in April (Bristol on April 4, North Wilkesboro on April 18, and Martinsville on April 25). Also, he won the first ever race at the New Hampshire Speedway, starting 33rd, on July 11.
In 1993, he won 10 of the 30 races, but finished second in the final points standings, 80 points behind Earnhardt. He ended the season strong, finishing in the Top 3 in all but two of the final 10 races of the season.

Penske switched to Fords in 1994. In 1996, sponsorship changed from Miller Genuine Draft to Miller beer sponsorship. At the end of the 1996 season, NASCAR hosted its first of three exhibition races in Japan, the first of two at Suzuka. Wallace was the winner of that first race.


In 1997, Miller changed the team&#x27;s sponsorship to Miller Lite, replacing the black and gold with a blue and white scheme. In 1998, Wallace won the Bud Shootout at Daytona, a non-points race for the previous years pole winners and past winners of the race. It was the first win for Ford&#x27;s new Taurus, and Wallace&#x27;s only victory at NASCAR&#x27;s premier track (as well as his only victory in any restrictor plate race) in a Cup car.

In 2000, he secured his 50th career win at Bristol, becoming the 10th driver in NASCAR to win 50+ races. He is also the only driver in NASCAR history to win his 1st and 50th career victories at the same track, and in the same race. He would also score 3 more wins at Pocono, Michigan, and the night race at Bristol (season sweep at Bristol). He finished seventh in the final points standings after some inconsistency in the championship race. The next year, he won at California for his 54th career win. He won on what would have been Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s 50th birthday and paid tribute to him with an Earnhardt flag. Wallace almost won the 2002 Sharpie 500 after being bumped out of the way by his rival Jeff Gordon.
In 2003, Penske Racing switched to Dodge and appropriately, in 2004, Wallace won his 55th (and final) race on a short track: the 2004 spring Martinsville Speedway race. It was also the last win for the track under the ownership of the H. Clay Earles Trust; the death of Mary Weatherford (matriarch of the trust) forced the Trust to sell the track a month later.
On August 30, 2004, Wallace announced that the 2005 NASCAR NEXTEL Cup season would be his last as a full-time driver. Although at the time the possibility remained that he may have continued to run a limited schedule after the 2005 season—as semi-retirees Bill Elliott and Terry Labonte also have done, Wallace&#x27;s broadcasting contract at the time prevented him from doing so. Kurt Busch would replace Wallace in the No. 2 Miller Lite Dodge in 2006–2010. In 2011, Brad Keselowski began driving the number 2.

In 2006, Wallace returned to his General Motors roots when he raced a Crawford-Pontiac sportscar, painted black and carrying the familiar stylized No. 2. The car was sponsored by Callaway Golf, in the Rolex 24 at Daytona, teamed with Danica Patrick and Allan McNish, In 2008, his Nationwide Series cars switched from Dodge to Chevrolet.

Rusty Wallace finished his career with the 1989 Winston Cup Championship, 36 career poles, and 55 career wins. As of 2022, the 55 wins is 11th on NASCAR&#x27;s all-time wins list. They include victories at Charlotte as well as the series&#x27; last three road courses (Riverside, Infineon and Watkins Glen), but none at Daytona, Darlington, Indianapolis, or Talladega. He has the most short track wins in NASCAR history with 34, and therefore he is considered among the best short track drivers in NASCAR history. He retired after the 2005 season with a 14.4 career average finish.

In 2014, Wallace ran at Daytona for testing before the 2014 Daytona 500 as part of a promotion for Miller Lite&#x27;s 40th anniversary, marking the first time a NASCAR Hall of Famer has driven in a NASCAR test. When asked about the testing, Wallace stated, &quot;It all started at Homestead. I was standing between the 48 (Jimmie Johnson) and 2 (Brad Keselowski) cars joking around and those guys were egging me on to get back in a car and when Brad got wind of it, he called me up two weeks later and was serious about it and Roger (Penske) was all for it. Everyone in the world has been on me to test. &#x27;Why haven&#x27;t you been back in a car?&#x27; This here kind of got me.&quot;

====Major crashes====
Wallace&#x27;s legacy, besides being a close rival of Dale Earnhardt, was a number of severe wrecks he endured, especially at restrictor plate racetracks. The first one happened in 1983, when Wallace was attempting the Daytona 500 through the Gatorade Twin 125&#x27;s. He was tapped by Rick Wilson, got airborne, and went on a spectacular series of flips that left him hospitalized. His next flip came at Bristol Motor Speedway in 1988. What started it was unclear, but Wallace somehow managed to climb the wall and did a barrel roll. The roof of his car caved in. ESPN commentator Dr. Jerry Punch was the first responder, and possibly saved his life. In 1993, Wallace had two massive flips – both at plate tracks. The first was at the 1993 Daytona 500, where he was tapped by the crashing cars of Michael Waltrip and Derrike Cope, and barrel rolled multiple times in the grass on the back straightaway several feet in the air. Months later, at Talladega, racing to the checkered flag, Wallace was tagged from behind by Dale Earnhardt, turned backwards, and flew into the air before violently flipping in the grass past the start-finish line, breaking a wrist (the area where Wallace&#x27;s car wrecked has since been paved over). Earnhardt was visibly shaken by the incident and did make sure Wallace was okay by checking on him after the race had concluded. Wallace finished 80 points behind Earnhardt in the final points for 1993. He also had an airborne crash in his last Gatorade Twin in 2005 when Dave Blaney clipped his right rear tire and sent his car off the ground. The car never turned over though.

===Other racing===
On April 1, 2015, Wallace tested a Stadium Super Truck owned by former NASCAR driver Robby Gordon, and the following day, he announced he would race in the series&#x27; X Games round in Austin. After finishing last in his heat race, he was relegated to the last-chance qualifier. During the LCQ, Wallace rolled his truck, but continued running; he finished sixth in the event but failed to qualify for the feature.

In 2016, Wallace competed in the Ferrari Finali Mondiali at Daytona. Driving for &quot;Ferrari of Houston&quot;, Wallace finished tenth overall and third in the Professional, North America class.

==Broadcast career==

On January 25, 2006, it was announced that Wallace would cover auto racing events for ESPN and ABC. Despite Wallace&#x27;s lack of open-wheel racing experience, his assignments began with the IndyCar Series and included the Indianapolis 500 (in a perhaps forgivable lapse, he described a thrilling battle on the last lap as &quot;The most exciting Daytona 500 ever!&quot;). He joined the NASCAR broadcasting team for both networks when they started coverage of the sport in 2007. He signed a six-year deal with ESPN in 2006. He returned to commentate for the 2007 Indianapolis 500 won by Dario Franchitti. He co-hosted &quot;NASCAR Angels&quot; with Shannon Wiseman. Wallace worked with ESPN from 2007 to 2014 until their contract with NASCAR expired.

Since the 2015 Daytona 500, Wallace has worked with Motor Racing Network as a booth announcer.

==Car owner==

Up until 2012, Wallace owned and operated Rusty Wallace Racing, which fielded the No. 62 Pilot Flying J Toyota Camry driven by Michael Annett and the No. 66 5 Hour Energy Toyota Camry driven by his son Steve Wallace. This operation was temporarily suspended due to the loss of sponsorship. However, Steve Wallace confirmed on his Twitter account that the team would return for the Nationwide Series race at Richmond in May 2012 in a former Roush Fenway Racing Ford Mustang, powered by a Roush-Yates engine in the No. 4 sponsored by LoanMax Title Loans. Due to lack of sponsorship in 2013, Wallace&#x27;s team ran one race in a No. 66 entry finishing 25th at Charlotte, then closed at the conclusion of the season.

==Family==
Wallace&#x27;s brothers, Kenny and Mike, also used to race on the NASCAR circuit. He and his wife Patti have three childrenGreg, Katie, and Stephen. Stephen raced full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and made his Cup Series debut during the 2011 Daytona 500, making him the fourth member of his family to compete in the Daytona 500 and in NASCAR, behind the Bodines (Geoff, Brett, and Todd), Pettys (Lee, Richard, and Kyle), Earnhardts (Ralph, Dale, Dale Jr. and Jeffrey), and the Allisons (Bobby, Donnie, and Davey). Wallace&#x27;s father, Russell Wallace Sr., died on October 30, 2011, at age 77.

==Iowa Speedway==
In late 2005, Wallace broke ground on his &quot;Signature Design Speedway&quot; in Newton, Iowa. Iowa Speedway had its first race on September 15, 2006, and hosted many races in 2007 including an IndyCar race. The track is noted for its structural similarity to Richmond International Raceway, where Wallace has won six times. Iowa Speedway hosted its first NASCAR Nationwide Series and first NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race in 2009. Iowa Speedway will host their first NASCAR Cup Series race on June 16, 2024. On December 4, 2023, it was announced that the inaugural NASCAR Cup Series race there was officially sold out. The inaugural race was a huge success with guest appearances from Rusty throughout the weekend. The cup series will return to Iowa Speedway on the first weekend of August of 2025.

<text>Edward Merton Dorn (April 2, 1929 – December 10, 1999) was an American poet and teacher often associated with the Black Mountain poets. His most famous work is &quot;Gunslinger&quot;.

==Overview==

Dorn was born in Villa Grove, Illinois. He grew up in rural poverty during the Great Depression. He attended a one-room schoolhouse for his first eight grades. He later studied at the University of Illinois and at Black Mountain College (1950–55). At Black Mountain he came into contact with Charles Olson, who greatly influenced his literary worldview and his sense of himself as poet.

Dorn&#x27;s final examiner at Black Mountain was Robert Creeley, with whom, along with the poet Robert Duncan, Dorn became included as one of a trio of younger poets later associated with Black Mountain and with Charles Olson.

In 1951, Dorn left Black Mountain and traveled to the Pacific Northwest, where he did manual labor and met his first wife, Helene; they returned to the school in late 1954. After graduation and two years of travel, Dorn&#x27;s family settled in Washington state, the setting for his autobiographical novel &quot;By the Sound&quot; (originally published as &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;), which describes the grinding poverty of life in &quot;the basement stratum of society.&quot; In 1961 he accepted his first teaching job at Idaho State University, where he published the magazine &quot;Wild Dog&quot;. His first book of poetry, &quot;The Newly Fallen&quot;, was published by LeRoi Jones&#x27;s Totem Press in 1961.

In 1965, with the photographer Leroy Lucas, Dorn spent the summer visiting Indian reservations for a book commissioned by William Morrow &amp; Co. Press, &quot;The Shoshoneans&quot;. That fall, British poet and scholar Donald Davie invited him to join the faculty at the Literature Department he was creating at the new University of Essex. He spent most of the next five years in England, where he published several collections of poems and wrote Book 1 of &quot;Gunslinger&quot;. He also started working with Gordon Brotherston on translations from Latin American texts, solidified his close friendship with British poet J.H. Prynne, and met his second wife, Jennifer Dunbar.

On returning to the United States, Dorn spent the 1970s as an academic migrant, teaching at over half a dozen universities across the country. In San Francisco, he collaborated with the printer and artist team of (Holbrook) Teter and (Michael) Myers on a number of projects, including the &quot;Bean News&quot;, the comic book format of &quot;Recollections of Gran Apachería&quot;&#x27;, and the typesetting of the complete &quot;Gunslinger&quot; in 1974. In 1977 Dorn accepted a professorship at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he taught for the rest of his life, directing the Creative Writing Program and editing the literary newspaper &quot;Rolling Stock&quot; (motto: “If It Moves Print It”) with his wife Jennifer.

Dorn was openly homophobic. His 1984 poem &quot;Aid(e) Memoire&quot; warned that those who &quot;screw and are screwed...drink directly from the sewer.&quot; He inaugurated the &quot;Aids Award for Poetry&quot; in the same year, giving it to several leading gay poets.

During the 1990s, after a teaching exchange visit to Paul Valery University in Montpellier inspired an interest in the Cathars of Southern France, he started working on &quot;Languedoc Variorum: A Defense of Heresy and Heretics&quot;. He was also writing another long narrative poem &quot;Westward Haut&quot;. During the last two and a half years of his life, he wrote the poems for the posthumously published &quot;Chemo Sabe&quot;, reporting on his cancer treatments.

Dorn&#x27;s main work, his magnum opus, is &quot;&quot;Gunslinger&quot;&quot;. &quot;Gunslinger&quot; is a long poem in five sections. Part 1 was first published in 1968, and the final complete text appeared in 1974. Other important publications include &quot;The Collected Poems: 1956-1974&quot; (1975), &quot;Recollections of Gran Apacheria&quot; (1975), &quot;Abhorrences&quot; (1989), &quot;High West Rendezvous: A Sampler&quot; (1997), and &quot;[Way More West: New and Selected Poems]&quot; (2008).

Popular horror novelist Stephen King admired Dorn, describing his poetry as &quot;talismans of perfect writing&quot; and even naming the first novel of The Dark Tower series, &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; in honor of Dorn&#x27;s poem. King opened both the prologue and epilogue of &quot;The Stand&quot; with Dorn&#x27;s line, &quot;We need help, the Poet reckoned.&quot;

==Death==
Dorn died of pancreatic cancer on December 10, 1999, in Denver, Colorado. His papers are collected at the University of Connecticut as well as at Indiana University at Bloomington.

==Dorn&#x27;s teaching career==
During his life, Dorn taught at a number of institutions of higher learning, including Idaho State University at Pocatello (1961–65); the University of Essex in England (1965–70) as a Fulbright lecturer; Northeastern Illinois University at Chicago (1970–71); Kent State University, Ohio (1973–74); and the University of Colorado (1977–99). His second wife, Jennifer Dunbar Dorn, is an English filmmaker and writer Dorn met during his Essex years.

In the early 1970s, as a visiting poet at Kent State University, Dorn, along with British poet and editor Eric Mottram, was a mentor and supporter of the musical group Devo, and its founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis.

<doc id="430560" wikidata="Q14813" url="?curid=430560" title="Gifhorn">
<text>Gifhorn () is a town and capital of the district of Gifhorn in the east of Lower Saxony, Germany. It has a population of about 42,000 and is mainly influenced by the small distance to the more industrial and commercially important cities nearby, Brunswick and Wolfsburg. Further, Gifhorn is part of the Hanover-Brunswick-Göttingen-Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. The Municipality Gifhorn includes the villages of Gamsen, Gifhorn, Kästorf, Neubokel, Wilsche and Winkel.

==Sights==
Gifhorn is home to the International Wind- and Watermill Museum, which contains a comprehensive collection and working replicas of the world&#x27;s most common windmills. The castle in the town centre was built in a Weser Renaissance style from 1526 to 1533. &quot;Kavalierhaus&quot; (Cavalier House) is a renaissance building dating from 1546. Saint Nicolai Church is a baroque aisleless church which was built from 1734 to 1744. Around the Market Place various well-preserved half-timbered houses built in the 16th and 17th centuries can be visited, e.g. the Old Town Hall with impressive wood sculptures dating from 1562. Some houses have interesting bay windows. House no. 2 in Steinweg street, called &quot;Höfersches Haus&quot; and dating from 1570, is considered to be one of the oldest houses in town.

==Geography==
Gifhorn lies at the confluence of the Rivers Ise and Aller. Gifhorn is situated about north of the city of Brunswick and about west of Wolfsburg. In the city, the Bundesstraße 4 and 188 meet. At the northern end of the city, the Lüneburg Heath starts.

==History==

The oldest verifiable source attests the existence of the city in the year 1057. It was located at the crossing of two then important merchant routes: the &quot;salt street&quot; () being a main trading route for salt between Lüneburg and Brunswick, and the &quot;grain street&quot; () transporting grain between Celle and Magdeburg. Market rights were certified by John, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1275. Gifhorn was destroyed in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud (1519-1523) and rebuilt afterwards. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War it suffered again severe destruction. The southern part of Gifhorn, a densely populated area, was devastated by a fire in 1669, and the northern part in 1725. Afterwards Gifhorn was rebuilt keeping an appropriate distance between the buildings. Gifhorn obtained town privileges in 1852 when it had about 2,500 inhabitants. During World War II the town remained undamaged.

==Education==
Schools in Gifhorn include the Humboldt Gymnasium, the Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium, Fritz-Reuter-Realschule, Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Realschule, Albert-Schweitzer-Hauptschule and the Berufsbildenden Schulen I and II. Alfred-Teves-Schule, which was called Volksschule Süd between 1954 and 1958, was open between 1954 and 2010.

==Transport==
The Gifhorn railway station where trains from and to Hanover and Wolfsburg stop is in the southern part of the town. A smaller railway station, &quot;Gifhorn Stadt&quot; station with direct connections to Uelzen and Brunswick, is in the centre on the Brunswick–Uelzen railway line.

In the city, the Bundesstraße 4 and 188 meet.

==The Bells Palace==
Glocken-Palast, or The Bells Palace, is a monument and large building in Gifhorn. It was completed after 16 years of construction, combining various Russian timber building styles. Its cornerstone was laid by former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1996.

It was built as a centre to promote cultural exchange across Europe, following the fall of the Iron Curtain.

The Bells Palace will host events and exhibitions celebrating peace, freedom and cultural diversity.

<text>Matthews Snell (born August 18, 1941) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the New York Jets of the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He was Jets&#x27; owner Sonny Werblin&#x27;s first coup, prior to his 1965 acquisition of Joe Namath. A powerful fullback out of Ohio State University, Snell&#x27;s 1964 signing jolted the crosstown Giants, who didn&#x27;t draft Snell until the fourth round, and offered him a fraction of what the Jets gave him as their first-round choice.

==Early life==
Born to Isaac and Annie, Snell attended Carle Place High School in the one-square-mile town of Carle Place, New York, where his picture resides in the Carle Place High School Athletic Hall of Fame. Snell played right halfback on a team that lost only two games while he started. He was awarded &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Thorp Award for 1959 as the outstanding high school football player in Nassau County.

At Ohio State University, Snell was a three-year starter and a consummate team player, active on both sides of the ball. In 1961, he played right halfback, often blocking for fullback Bob Ferguson or left halfback Paul Warfield. In 1962, Snell was moved to defensive end. In 1963, Snell&#x27;s senior year, he was named starting fullback, going on to rush for 491 yards and 5 touchdowns. At the end of his senior season, Snell was named his team&#x27;s most valuable player.

Snell was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000 as a defensive end.

==Football career==
In his rookie year with the New York Jets, Snell rushed for a team-record 180 yards against the Houston Oilers on his way to a 945-yard season and AFL Rookie of the Year honors. Snell went on to become an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1964 and 1966, and the &quot;Sporting News&quot; All-AFL fullback in 1969.

Snell&#x27;s defining moment came in Super Bowl III when the AFL champion Jets played the heavily favored NFL champion Baltimore Colts. Although slowed by knee injuries, Snell was a key player in the Jets&#x27; ball-control offense during the 16–7 upset victory. He carried the ball 30 times for a then-Super Bowl record of 121 yards, and in the second quarter went four yards around left end to score the Jets&#x27; only touchdown, a score that marked the first time an AFL team had led in a Super Bowl. He also helped set up a trio of Jim Turner field goals that finally put the game away for the Jets in the second half, securing the AFL&#x27;s first Super Bowl win in the league&#x27;s penultimate season.

During his career, Snell was well known for his rushing, but also became an important part of the Jets&#x27; pass-blocking scheme. Toward the end of his career, Snell became one of the first third-down specialty backs, primarily because he was so good at protecting Joe Namath. He was also reported to have helped teach pass-blocking to Jets running backs during his career.

Snell suffered multiple injuries in his career, including torn knee cartilage in 1967 and a torn Achilles tendon in 1970. In 1971, he hurt his knee in the preseason and was diagnosed with a severe &quot;knee bruise&quot; and missed nine games. In 1972, in Week 4 versus the Miami Dolphins, he suffered a ruptured spleen. The injury was so severe that his spleen had to be removed, ending his season. He decided right then that he couldn&#x27;t play anymore, though he didn&#x27;t formally announce his retirement until the following March. He only played in a total of 12 games in what would be his final three seasons.

==Post-football==
In 1973, Snell appeared in the first Miller Lite beer commercial. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The campaign would feature a collection of middle-aged sports stars and become something of a status symbol for retired athletes for the next 17 years.&quot;

After his playing career in 1973, he sold his restaurant, Matt Snell&#x27;s Fifth Down, to focus on his new company, Defco Securities, Inc. (of which he is one of the four partners).

Snell and Emerson Boozer were inducted into the Jets&#x27; Ring of Honor on November 29, 2015, because they were partners in each other&#x27;s success and that of the team. Snell did not accept the Jets&#x27; invitation to participate in the ceremony at MetLife Stadium, just as he consistently has refused the club&#x27;s invitations to other alumni events for unspecified reasons ever since he retired. In 2018, Snell revealed that the reason he hasn&#x27;t spoken to the Jets was because the team&#x27;s owner at the time he left, Leon Hess, refused to give him a reference for a future job in spite of both being promised he would receive one, and in spite of his work to build the team&#x27;s success over his professional football career.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==

Snell lives in New Rochelle, New York with his wife Sharon, son Beau and daughter Jada. His grandson Donte played football for Holy Cross High School. He is a partner in DEFCO Securities, Inc. and owns a restaurant in New York City. He is the first cousin, twice removed of running back Benny Snell, with Benny Snell&#x27;s grandfather being his first cousin.

<doc id="430588" wikidata="Q32278" url="?curid=430588" title="Truncated mean">
<text>A truncated mean or trimmed mean is a statistical measure of central tendency, much like the mean and median. It involves the calculation of the mean after discarding given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end, and typically discarding an equal amount of both. This number of points to be discarded is usually given as a percentage of the total number of points, but may also be given as a fixed number of points.

For most statistical applications, 5 to 25 percent of the ends are discarded. For example, given a set of 8 points, trimming by 12.5% would discard the minimum and maximum value in the sample: the smallest and largest values, and would compute the mean of the remaining 6 points. The 25% trimmed mean (when the lowest 25% and the highest 25% are discarded) is known as the interquartile mean.

The median can be regarded as a fully truncated mean and is most robust. As with other trimmed estimators, the main advantage of the trimmed mean is robustness and higher efficiency for mixed distributions and heavy-tailed distribution (like the Cauchy distribution), at the cost of lower efficiency for some other less heavily tailed distributions (such as the normal distribution). For intermediate distributions the differences between the efficiency of the mean and the median are not very big, e.g. for the student-t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom the variances for mean and median are nearly equal.

==Terminology==
In some regions of Central Europe it is also known as a Windsor mean, but this name should not be confused with the Winsorized mean: in the latter, the observations that the trimmed mean would discard are instead replaced by the largest/smallest of the remaining values.

Discarding only the maximum and minimum is known as the &#x27;, particularly in management statistics. This is also known as the &#x27; (for example in US agriculture, like the Average Crop Revenue Election), due to its use in Olympic events, such as the ISU Judging System in figure skating, to make the score robust to a single outlier judge.

==Interpolation==
When the percentage of points to discard does not yield a whole number, the trimmed mean may be defined by interpolation, generally linear interpolation, between the nearest whole numbers. For example, if you need to calculate the 15% trimmed mean of a sample containing 10 entries, strictly this would mean discarding 1 point from each end (equivalent to the 10% trimmed mean). If interpolating, one would instead compute the 10% trimmed mean (discarding 1 point from each end) and the 20% trimmed mean (discarding 2 points from each end), and then interpolating, in this case averaging these two values. Similarly, if interpolating the 12% trimmed mean, one would take the weighted average: weight the 10% trimmed mean by 0.8 and the 20% trimmed mean by 0.2.

==Advantages==
The truncated mean is a useful estimator because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean but will still give a reasonable estimate of central tendency or mean for many statistical models. In this regard it is referred to as a robust estimator. For example, in its use in Olympic judging, truncating the maximum and minimum prevents a single judge from increasing or lowering the overall score by giving an exceptionally high or low score.

One situation in which it can be advantageous to use a truncated mean is when estimating the location parameter of a Cauchy distribution, a bell shaped probability distribution with (much) fatter tails than a normal distribution. It can be shown that the truncated mean of the middle 24% sample order statistics (i.e., truncate the sample by 38% at each end) produces an estimate for the population location parameter that is more efficient than using either the sample median or the full sample mean. However, due to the fat tails of the Cauchy distribution, the efficiency of the estimator decreases as more of the sample gets used in the estimate. Note that for the Cauchy distribution, neither the truncated mean, full sample mean or sample median represents a maximum likelihood estimator, nor are any as asymptotically efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator; however, the maximum likelihood estimate is more difficult to compute, leaving the truncated mean as a useful alternative.

==Statistical tests==

It is possible to perform a Student&#x27;s t-test based on the truncated mean, which is called Yuen&#x27;s t-test, which also has several implementations in R.

==Examples==
The scoring method used in many sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges is a truncated mean: &quot;discard the lowest and the highest scores; calculate the mean value of the remaining scores&quot;.

The Libor benchmark interest rate is calculated as a trimmed mean: given 18 responses, the top 4 and bottom 4 are discarded, and the remaining 10 are averaged (yielding trim factor of 4/18 ≈ 22%).

Consider the data set consisting of:

:{92, 19, 101, 58, 1053, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, −40, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, −5, 41} (N = 20, mean = 101.5)
The 5th percentile (−6.75) lies between −40 and −5, while the 95th percentile (148.6) lies between 101 and 1053 (values shown in bold). Then, a 5% trimmed mean would result in the following:

:{92, 19, 101, 58, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, −5, 41} (N = 18, mean = 56.5)
This example can be compared with the one using the Winsorising procedure.

<text>Candido Portinari (December 29, 1903 – February 6, 1962) was a Brazilian painter. He is considered one of the most important Brazilian painters as well as a prominent and influential practitioner of the neo-realism style in painting.

Portinari painted more than five thousand canvases, from small sketches to monumental works such as the &quot;Guerra e Paz&quot; panels, which were donated to the United Nations Headquarters in 1956. Portinari developed a social preoccupation throughout his oeuvre and maintained an active life in the Brazilian cultural and political worlds.

==Life and career==

Born to Giovan Battista Portinari and Domenica Torquato, Italian immigrants from Chiampo Vicenza, Veneto, in a coffee plantation near Brodowski, in São Paulo. Growing up on a coffee plantation of dark soil and blue sky, Portinari gained his inspiration from the homeland he loved. In the majority of his later paintings, murals and frescoes, he used the colour blue and many browns and reds because this was the color of his home.

One of Portinari&#x27;s beginner jobs was drawing photographs where he closely captured the exact image using paints and then enlarging the photos. These sold successfully because the resemblance was astounding. Portinari then studied at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (National School of Fine Arts) in Rio de Janeiro. In 1923, 1925 and 1927 Portinari won prizes at the Salon, and in 1928 he got a scholarship offered by the Brazilian government to study in Europe for three years. During his time in Europe Portinari did little painting, but studied the works of various European artists, visited museums, and met his future wife, Maria Martinelli. He came back to Brazil fully set on conveying the true Brazilian lifestyle and capturing the pain and struggles of his people through his art.

After his return, Portinari began portraying the reality of Brazil, from its natural beauties to the harsh lives of the country&#x27;s most impoverished populations, pursuing an amalgamation of his academic formation with the modernist avant-gardes. Portinari remained himself and didn&#x27;t allow his new experiences and new outlooks changed him. His roots remained important to him and he strove to portray this in his paintings; the true Brazilian spirit. He wanted the world to see the harsh reality of living conditions in Brazil and the struggle for survival. Strength, hard work, independence and authenticity shows through in almost every one of his works.

In 1939, Portinari exhibited at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. In the following year, Portinari had for the first time a canvas displayed at the Museum of Modern Art. The rise of fascism in Europe, the wars and the close contact with Brazilian problematic society, reaffirmed the social character of his work, as well as conducting him to political engagement.

He joined the Brazilian Communist Party and stood for deputy in 1945 and for senator in 1947, but had to flee to Uruguay to escape the persecution of communists during the government of Eurico Gaspar Dutra. In 1951, the first São Paulo Art Biennial dedicated a special room for his works. He returned to Brazil in the following year, after a declaration of general amnesty from the government. In 1956, after the United Nations had appealed to its affiliated countries for the donation of a work of art to the organization&#x27;s new headquarters. Brazil designated Portinari for the task, who took four years and around 180 studies to complete the painting. Dag Hammarskjöld, UN Secretary-General, named the work &quot;the most important monumental work of art donated to the UN&quot;.

Even after being warned by the doctor of the risks of the toxins and poisoning, he didn&#x27;t give up and continued to paint. Portinari suffered from ill health during the last decade of his life. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1962 as a result of lead poisoning from his paints.

On December 20, 2007, his painting &quot;&quot; was stolen from the São Paulo Museum of Art along with Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Suzanne Bloch&quot;. The paintings remained missing until January 8, 2008, when they were recovered in Ferraz de Vasconcelos by the Police of São Paulo. The paintings were returned, undamaged, to the São Paulo Museum of Art.

There were a number of commemorative events in the centenary of his birth in 2003, including an exhibition of his work in London.

==Style==


Portinari&#x27;s works comprehend a strong will to represent Brazilian people and their traits. Portinari himself said he would &quot;paint that people with that clothing and that color&quot;. According to Antonio Callado, Portinari&#x27;s oeuvre demonstrate a &quot;monumental book of art which teaches Brazilians to love more their land&quot;.

Portinari was capable of transcending his original academic formation by experiencing with and absorbing modernist techniques and styles, which fundamentally created his painting personality. The range and sweep of his output includes paintings depicting rural and urban labour, refugees fleeing the hardships of Brazil&#x27;s rural north-east; and, despite these major and better known aspects of his work, treatments of the key events in the history of Brazil since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, images of childhood, portraits of members of his family and leading Brazilian intellectuals, illustrations for books and tiles decorating the Church of São Francisco at Pampulha, Belo Horizonte.

His career coincided with and included collaboration with Oscar Niemeyer amongst others. Portinari&#x27;s works can be found in galleries and settings in Brazil and abroad, ranging from the family chapel in his childhood home in Brodowski to his panels &quot;Guerra e Paz&quot; (War and Peace) in the United Nations building in New York and four murals in the Hispanic Reading Room of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

== Contribution to Brazilian modernism ==
As previously mentioned, Candido Portinari came from a poor immigrant family. This allowed him to have a unique perspective on Brazilian culture and what it meant to truly be Brazilian. This is important because he was a prominent artist during the Brazilian Modernism era. As such, his perspective gave a more proud and dignified view of the workers at that time. While other artists like Lasar Segall with &quot;Bananal&quot; and Tarsila do Amaral with &quot;Workers&quot; provided a picture of the workers that removed personality and made each individual anonymous, Portinari did the opposite. For example, in his painting, &quot;The Mestizo&quot;, he paints a character that looks strong, competent, and noble. In this, he is demonstrating that the workers were not broken. Instead, they were proud and independent. Portinari used his culture and life experience to add to the explanation of what Brazil is in a distinctive style.

== Murals ==
In &quot;Cocoa (1938)&quot; Portinari depicts workers on the coffee plantations. A woman is seen in the back balancing a crate on her head and there is a child in the painting. This was meant to signify that children were present during this hard work as well, and were encouraged to help the parents. Land was given to families in return for their labor on the plantations where they took care of their share. Here too is included the use of blues and oranges to truly capture the significance of Brazil, which was Portinari&#x27;s desire. This artwork was described by saying &quot;Brazil is being rescued from obscurity by ‘Portinari&#x27;s Coffee’.&quot;

&quot;Coffee (National Museum of Fine Arts, 1935)&quot; represents strong and resourceful workers. Their big hands and feet show they were strong and did not fear hard work. The people worked together to preserve their lands and survive. This painting is also a great depiction of &quot;realism&quot; because of how he captures his people with the short bodies, rounder heads and the brown and red hues of the land.

In &quot;The Mestizo (1934)&quot; he tries to present not just a portrait but an individual type of person. Portinari shows that Brazilian workers were tough and proud of their work because in the background of the &quot;Mestizo&quot; are seen the fields and all their hard work; his proud stance portrays confidence and strength.

&quot;War and Peace&quot; (Guerra e Paz; Gustavo Capanema Palace in Rio de Janeiro; 1952–56) was a mural created when the United Nations asked Brazil to donate a work of art. Portinari created two murals to show war, agony, fear and pain that showed how the people suffered and were affected during the war. His use of blue hues in &quot;War&quot; created a contrast between the lighter yellows in &quot;Peace&quot;. The second was meant to express peace and happiness. Bento Antonio in his book &quot;Portinari&quot;, describes this work as, &quot;a sort of innocent vision of paradise.&quot; With this mural, he also meant to connect different racial groups and show peace among the variety of individuals. There was a large variety of ethnicities that lived in Brazil at this time. His works were meant to create a bridge between the multicultural individuals. This work is located in the United Nations General Assembly Building in New York which was created in remembrance to World War II and its horrors. It was meant to resemble something that should never occur again. Here, visitors come witnessing an epitome of war and leave realizing that peace is indeed attainable. &quot;Guerra e Paz&quot; is the synthesis of an entire life committed to human beings. His painting, like his militant political views, spoke out against injustice, violence and misery in the world, according to the artist&#x27;s son, João Candido Portinari.

In the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. are located four murals that Portinari did in 1941 depicting the struggles of the Hispanic Americans. &quot;Discovery of the Land, Entry into the Forest, Teaching of the Indians, and Discovery of Gold&quot; are all meant to represent the coming of the Spaniards and Portuguese to America and took him two months to complete with the help of his brother Luiz. The &quot;Discovery of the Land&quot; is meant to show common sailors that sailed the boats. &quot;Entry in the Forest&quot; is the &quot;reminiscent of frescoes&quot; where he also doesn&#x27;t fail to capture his style of enlarging the figures’ arms and legs to show their strength. In the &quot;Teaching of the Indians&quot;, Portinari tries to create a scene of a priest or Spanish &quot;Jesuit father&quot; with Indians and obvious unity. Also the presence of the red Brazilian soil. The last mural, &quot;Discovery of Gold&quot; the artist chooses to paint just a single boat and specific people to represent that they had found gold. The Brazilian government paid for Portinari to travel to Washington to create the murals and represent their country.

== Legacy ==
Portinari once said, &quot;I am the Son of the Red Earth. I decided to paint the Brazilian reality, naked and crude as it is.&quot; Life in Brazil wasn&#x27;t easy for Portinari, especially considering he was never wealthy, but his desire to show proof of this reality is evident in all his artworks. Poor housing, inadequate nutrition, no education, little or no healthcare access and various diseases created desperate situations for the Brazilian people who struggled to survive. This led to Portinari&#x27;s desire to raise global awareness of the human pain which he tried to depict in almost every painting.

Portinari also greatly affected the future Brazilian generation of artists, musicians, poets and composers. Having vastly traveled Europe, studying their art, their technique and styles, he came back to Brazil hoping to create his personal method and interpret his own style. Instead of continuing to imitate the European appearance, Portinari painted what he experienced and his life. Portinari&#x27;s works urged emerging artists to pursue their own, unique style particular to their lives, experiences and reality in their country. This is also another reason blues, reds, and oranges were so commonly used in his art; the colors of his homeland.

&quot;Projeto Portinari&quot;, begun in 1979 is dedicated to Candido Portinari by his son Joao Candido to revive his works, make them more known and preserve the history. Not only was his son able to locate more than 5,000 paintings, he also found thousands of drawings, sketches, and documents related to Portinari&#x27;s life and travels and interactions.
The Catalogue Raisonné of Portinari&#x27;s complete works was published in 2004. It was the first Raisonné covering the complete works of a Latin American painter.
&quot;Projeto Portinari&quot; also curated the first retrospective exhibition of Portinari&#x27;s oeuvre, at the Museu de Arte de São Paulo – MASP, in 1997.

Nicolás Guillén&#x27;s and Horacio Salinas&#x27;s ‘Un son para Portinari’, famously performed by Mercedes Sosa, is dedicated to the artist. Candido Portinari name continues to be seen today. Rodovia Candido Portinari is a State highway located in Brazil in São Paulo.

<doc id="430598" wikidata="Q605130" url="?curid=430598" title="Southern Christian Leadership Conference">
<text>The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is an African-American civil rights organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. SCLC is closely associated with its first president, Martin Luther King Jr., who had a large role in the American civil rights movement.

== Founding ==
On January 10, 1957, following the Montgomery bus boycott victory against the white establishment and consultations with Bayard Rustin, Ella Baker, and others, Martin Luther King Jr. invited about 60 black ministers and leaders to Ebenezer Church in Atlanta. Prior to this, Rustin, in New York City, conceived the idea of initiating such an effort and first sought C. K. Steele to make the call and take the lead role. Steele declined, but told Rustin he would be glad to work right beside him if he sought King in Montgomery for the role. Their goal was to form an organization to coordinate and support nonviolent direct action as a method of desegregating bus systems across the South. In addition to King, Rustin, Baker, and Steele, Fred Shuttlesworth of Birmingham, Joseph Lowery of Mobile, and Ralph Abernathy of Montgomery, all played key roles in this meeting.
The group continued this initial meeting on January 11, calling it (in keeping with the recent bus segregation issue) a Southern Negro Leaders Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration when they held a press conference that day. The press conference allowed them to introduce their efforts:
* communicating what they had included in telegrams sent that day to applicable members of the executive branch of the U.S. government (President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, and Attorney General Brownell)
* sharing an outline of their overall position regarding the restrictions against the &quot;elementary democratic rights [&quot;of America&#x27;s&quot;] Negro minority&quot;
* and providing a short list of concerns they wished to raise with &quot;white Southerners of goodwill&quot;.

On February 15, a follow-up meeting was held in New Orleans, at the New Zion Baptist Church at the corner of Third and LaSalle streets. Out of this meeting came a new organization with King as its president. Shortening the name used for their January meetings, the group briefly called their organization Negro Leaders Conference on Nonviolent Integration, then Southern Negro Leaders Conference and the Southern Leadership Conference. King served as president, Steele as first vice president, A.L. Davis as second vice president, T. J. Jemison as secretary, Medgar Evers as assistant secretary, Abernathy as treasurer, and Shuttlesworth as historian. At its third meeting, in August 1957, the group settled on Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as its name, expanding its focus beyond buses to ending all forms of segregation. A small office was established in the Prince Hall Masonic Temple Building on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta with Ella Baker as SCLC&#x27;s first—and for a long time only—staff member.

SCLC was governed by an elected board, and established as an organization of affiliates, most of which were either individual churches or community organizations such as the Montgomery Improvement Association and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR). This organizational form differed from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) who recruited individuals and formed them into local chapters.

The organization also drew inspiration from the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he appeared at a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. Despite tactical differences, which arose from Graham&#x27;s willingness to continue affiliating himself with segregationists, the SCLC and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association had similar ambitions and Graham would privately advise the SCLC.

During its early years, SCLC struggled to gain footholds in black churches and communities across the South. Social activism in favor of racial equality faced fierce repression from the police, White Citizens&#x27; Council and the Ku Klux Klan. Only a few churches had the courage to defy the white-dominated status-quo by affiliating with SCLC, and those that did risked economic retaliation against pastors and other church leaders, arson, and bombings.

SCLC&#x27;s advocacy of boycotts and other forms of nonviolent protest was controversial among both whites and blacks. Many black community leaders believed that segregation should be challenged in the courts and that direct action excited white resistance, hostility, and violence. Traditionally, leadership in black communities came from the educated elite—ministers, professionals, teachers, etc.—who spoke for and on behalf of the laborers, maids, farmhands, and working poor who made up the bulk of the black population. Many of these traditional leaders were uneasy about involving ordinary blacks in mass activity such as boycotts and marches.

SCLC&#x27;s belief that churches should be involved in political activism against social ills was also deeply controversial. Many ministers and religious leaders—both black and white—thought that the role of the church was to focus on the spiritual needs of the congregation and perform charitable works to aid the needy. To some of them, the social-political activity of King and SCLC amounted to dangerous radicalism which they strongly opposed.

SCLC and King were also sometimes criticized for lack of militancy by younger activists in groups such as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and CORE who were participating in sit-ins and Freedom Rides.

===Citizenship Schools===
Originally started in 1954 by Esau Jenkins and Septima Clark on the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, the Citizenship Schools focused on teaching adults to read so they could pass the voter-registration literacy tests, fill out driver&#x27;s license exams, use mail-order forms, and open checking accounts. Under the auspices of the Highlander Folk School (now Highlander Research and Education Center) the program was expanded across the South. The Johns Island Citizenship School was housed at The Progressive Club, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

According to Septima Clark&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Echo In My Soul&quot; (page 225), the Highlander Folk School was closed because it engaged in commercial activities in violation its charter; Highlander Folk School was chartered by the State of Tennessee as a non-profit corporation without stockholders or owners. However, in 1961, the Highlander staff reincorporated as the Highlander Research and Education Center and moved to Knoxville. Under the innocuous cover of adult-literacy classes, the schools secretly taught democracy and civil rights, community leadership and organizing, practical politics, and the strategies and tactics of resistance and struggle, and in so doing built the human foundations of the mass community struggles to come.

Eventually, close to 69,000 teachers, most of them unpaid volunteers and many with little formal education taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Many of the Civil Rights Movement&#x27;s adult leaders such as Fannie Lou Hamer and Victoria Gray, and hundreds of other local leaders in black communities across the South attended and taught citizenship schools.

Under the leadership of Clark, the citizenship school project trained over 10,000 citizenship schoolteachers who led citizenship schools throughout the South, representing a popular education effort on a massive scale. On top of these 10,000 teachers, citizenship schools reached and taught more than 25,000 people. By 1968, over 700,000 African Americans became registered voters thanks to Clark&#x27;s dedication to the movement.

As a result of the SCLC acquiring the already-established Citizenship Schools program, as its director, Clark became the first woman allowed a position on the SCLC board, despite continued resistance from the other (exclusively male) SCLC leaders. Andrew Young, who had joined Highlander the previous year to work with the Citizenship Schools, also joined the SCLC staff. The SCLC staff of citizenship schools were overwhelmingly women, as a result of the daily experience gained by becoming a teacher.

Clark would struggle against relentless sexism and male supremacy during her time on the SCLC, much as Ella Baker had, with particularly harsh sexism emanating from Martin Luther King Jr. himself. Ralph Abernathy also objected to a woman being allowed to participate in SCLC decision making and leadership, as Clark said: Clark attested that deliberate and widespread discrimination and even overt suppression of women was &quot;one of the greatest weaknesses of the civil rights movement.&quot;

=== Albany Movement ===

In 1961 and 1962, SCLC joined SNCC in the Albany Movement, a broad protest against segregation in Albany, Georgia. It is generally considered the organization&#x27;s first major nonviolent campaign. At the time, it was considered by many to be unsuccessful: despite large demonstrations and many arrests, few changes were won, and the protests drew little national attention. Yet, despite the lack of immediate gains, much of the success of the subsequent Birmingham Campaign can be attributed to lessons learned in Albany.

=== Birmingham campaign ===

By contrast, the 1963 SCLC campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, was an unqualified success. The campaign focused on a single goal—the desegregation of Birmingham&#x27;s downtown merchants—rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The brutal response of local police, led by Public Safety Commissioner &quot;Bull&quot; Connor, stood in stark contrast to the nonviolent civil disobedience of the activists.

After his arrest in April, King wrote the &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; in response to a group of clergy who had criticized the Birmingham campaign, writing that it was &quot;directed and led in part by outsiders&quot; and that the demonstrations were &quot;unwise and untimely.&quot; In his letter, King explained that, as president of SCLC, he had been asked to come to Birmingham by the local members:

King also addressed the question of &quot;timeliness&quot;:

The most dramatic moments of the Birmingham campaign came on May 2, when, under the direction and leadership of James Bevel, who would soon officially become SCLC&#x27;s Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, more than 1,000 Black children left school to join the demonstrations; hundreds were arrested. The following day, 2,500 more students joined and were met by Bull Connor with police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. That evening, television news programs reported to the nation and the world scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators. Public outrage led the Kennedy administration to intervene more forcefully and a settlement was announced on May 10, under which the downtown businesses would desegregate and eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, and the city would release the jailed protesters.

=== March on Washington ===
After the Birmingham Campaign, SCLC called for massive protests in Washington, DC, to push for new civil rights legislation that would outlaw segregation nationwide. A. Philip Randolph and
Bayard Rustin issued similar calls for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On July 2, 1963, King, Randolph, and Rustin met with James Farmer Jr. of the Congress of Racial Equality, John Lewis of SNCC, Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, and Whitney Young of the Urban League to plan a united march on August 28.

The media and political establishment viewed the march with great fear and trepidation over the possibility that protesters would run riot in the streets of the capital. But despite their fears, the March on Washington was a huge success, with no violence, and an estimated number of participants ranging from 200,000 to 300,000. It was also a logistical triumph—more than 2,000 buses, 21 special trains, 10 chartered aircraft, and uncounted autos converged on the city in the morning and departed without difficulty by nightfall.

The crowning moment of the march was King&#x27;s famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in which he articulated the hopes and aspirations of the Civil Rights Movement and rooted it in two cherished gospels—the Old Testament and the unfulfilled promise of the American creed.

===St. Augustine protests===

When civil rights activists protesting segregation in St. Augustine, Florida were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence, the local SCLC affiliate appealed to King for assistance in the spring of 1964. SCLC sent staff to help organize and lead demonstrations and mobilized support for St. Augustine in the North. Hundreds were arrested on sit-ins and marches opposing segregation, so many that the jails were filled, and the overflow prisoners had to be held in outdoor stockades. Among the northern supporters who endured arrest and incarceration were Mrs. Malcolm Peabody, the mother of the governor of Massachusetts and Mrs. John Burgess, wife of the Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts.

Nightly marches to the Old Slave Market were attacked by white mobs, and when blacks attempted to integrate &quot;white-only&quot; beaches they were assaulted by police who beat them with clubs. On June 11, King and other SCLC leaders were arrested for trying to lunch at the Monson Motel restaurant, and when an integrated group of young protesters tried to use the motel swimming pool the owner poured acid into the water. TV and newspaper stories of the struggle for justice in St. Augustine helped build public support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that was then being debated in Congress.

===Selma Voting Rights Movement and the march to Montgomery===
When voter registration and civil rights activity in Selma, Alabama were blocked by an illegal injunction, the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL) asked SCLC for assistance. King, SCLC, and DCVL chose Selma as the site for a major campaign around voting rights that would demand national voting rights legislation in the same way that the Birmingham and St. Augustine campaigns won passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In cooperation with SNCC who had been organizing in Selma since early 1963, the Voting Rights Campaign commenced with a rally in Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965, in defiance of the injunction. SCLC and SNCC organizers recruited and trained blacks to attempt to register to vote at the courthouse, where many of them were abused and arrested by Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark — a staunch segregationist. Black voter applicants were subjected to economic retaliation by the White Citizens&#x27; Council, and threatened with physical violence by the Ku Klux Klan. Officials used the discriminatory literacy test to keep blacks off the voter rolls.

Nonviolent mass marches demanded the right to vote and the jails filled up with arrested protesters, many of them students. On February 1, King and Abernathy were arrested. Voter registration efforts and protest marches spread to the surrounding Black Belt counties — Perry, Wilcox, Marengo, Greene, and Hale.
On February 18, an Alabama State Trooper shot and killed Jimmie Lee Jackson during a voting rights protest in Marion, county seat of Perry County. In response, James Bevel, who was directing SCLC&#x27;s Selma actions, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery, and on March 7 close to 600 protesters attempted the march to present their grievances to Governor Wallace. Led by Reverend Hosea Williams of SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC, the marchers were attacked by State Troopers, deputy sheriffs, and mounted possemen who used tear-gas, horses, clubs, and bullwhips to drive them back to Brown Chapel. News coverage of this brutal assault on nonviolent demonstrators protesting for the right to vote — which became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; — horrified the nation.

King, Bevel, Diane Nash and others called on clergy and people of conscience to support the black citizens of Selma. Thousands of religious leaders and ordinary Americans came to demand voting rights for all. One of them was James Reeb, a white Unitarian Universalist minister, who was savagely beaten to death on the street by Klansmen who severely injured two other ministers in the same attack.

After more protests, arrests, and legal maneuvering, Federal Judge Frank M. Johnson ordered Alabama to allow the march to Montgomery. It began on March 21 and arrived in Montgomery on the 24th. On the 25th, an estimated 25,000 protesters marched to the steps of the Alabama capitol in support of voting rights where King spoke. Within five months, Congress and President Lyndon Johnson responded to the enormous public pressure generated by the Selma Voting Rights Movement by enacting into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===Grenada Freedom Movement===
When the Meredith Mississippi March Against Fear passed through Grenada, Mississippi on June 15, 1966, it sparked months of civil rights activity on the part of Grenada blacks. They formed the Grenada County Freedom Movement (GCFM) as an SCLC affiliate, and within days 1,300 blacks registered to vote.
Though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had outlawed segregation of public facilities, the law had not been applied in Grenada which still maintained rigid segregation. After black students were arrested for trying to sit downstairs in the &quot;white&quot; section of the movie theater, SCLC and the GCFM demanded that all forms of segregation be eliminated, and called for a boycott of white merchants. Over the summer, the number of protests increased and many demonstrators and SCLC organizers were arrested as police enforced the old Jim Crow social order. In July and August, large mobs of white segregationists mobilized by the KKK violently attacked nonviolent marchers and news reporters with rocks, bottles, baseball bats and steel pipes.

When the new school year began in September, SCLC and the GCFM encouraged more than 450 black students to register at the formerly white schools under a court desegregation order. This was by far the largest school integration attempt in Mississippi since the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling in 1954. The all-white school board resisted fiercely, whites threatened black parents with economic retaliation if they did not withdraw their children, and by the first day of school the number of black children registered in the white schools had dropped to approximately 250. On the first day of class, September 12, a furious white mob organized by the Klan attacked the black children and their parents with clubs, chains, whips, and pipes as they walked to school, injuring many and hospitalizing several with broken bones. Police and Mississippi State Troopers made no effort to halt or deter the mob violence.

Over the following days, white mobs continued to attack the black children until public pressure and a Federal court order finally forced Mississippi lawmen to intervene. By the end of the first week, many black parents had withdrawn their children from the white schools out of fear for their safety, but approximately 150 black students continued to attend, still the largest school integration in state history at that point in time.

Inside the schools, blacks were harassed by white teachers, threatened and attacked by white students, and many blacks were expelled on flimsy pretexts by school officials. By mid-October, the number of blacks attending the white schools had dropped to roughly 70. When school officials refused to meet with a delegation of black parents, black students began boycotting both the white and black schools in protest. Many children, parents, GCFM activists, and SCLC organizers were arrested for protesting the school situation. By the end of October, almost all of the 2600 black students in Grenada County were boycotting school. The boycott was not ended until early November when SCLC attorneys won a Federal court order that the school system treat everyone equal regardless of race and meet with black parents.

===Jackson conference===
In 1966, Allen Johnson hosted the Tenth Annual Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Masonic Temple in Jackson, Mississippi. The theme of the conference was human rights - the continuing struggle. Those in attendance, among others, included: Edward Kennedy, James Bevel, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T. Vivian, Andrew Young, The Freedom Singers, Charles Evers, Fred Shuttlesworth, Cleveland Robinson, Randolph Blackwell, Annie Bell Robinson Devine, Charles Kenzie Steele, Alfred Daniel Williams King, Benjamin Hooks, Aaron Henry and Bayard Rustin.

===Chicago Freedom Movement===
===Poor People&#x27;s Campaign===
==1968–1997==
In August 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instructed its program &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; to &quot;neutralize&quot; what the FBI called &quot;black nationalist hate groups&quot; and other dissident groups. The initial targets included Martin Luther King Jr. and others associated with the SCLC.

After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, leadership was transferred to Ralph Abernathy, who presided until 1977. Abernathy was replaced by Joseph Lowery who was SCLC president until 1997. In 1997, MLK&#x27;s son, Martin Luther King III, became the president of SCLC. In 2004, for less than a year, it was Fred Shuttlesworth. After him, the president was Charles Steele Jr., and in 2009, Howard W. Creecy Jr. Next were Isaac Newton Farris Jr. and C. T. Vivian, who took office in 2012.
==1997 to present==
In 1997, Martin Luther King III was unanimously elected to head the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, replacing Joseph Lowery. Under King&#x27;s leadership, the SCLC held hearings on police brutality, organized a rally for the 37th anniversary of the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech and launched a successful campaign to change the Georgia state flag, which previously featured a large Confederate cross.

Within only a few months of taking the position, however, King was being criticized by the Conference board for alleged inactivity. He was accused of failing to answer correspondence from the board and take up issues important to the organization. The board also felt he failed to demonstrate against national issues the SCLC previously would have protested, like the disenfranchisement of black voters in the Florida election recount or time limits on welfare recipients implemented by then-President Bill Clinton. King was further criticized for failing to join the battle against AIDS, allegedly because he felt uncomfortable talking about condoms. He also hired Lamell J. McMorris, an executive director who, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;rubbed board members the wrong way.&quot;

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference suspended King from the presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. In a June 25 letter to King, the group&#x27;s national chairman at the time, Claud Young, wrote, &quot;You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC.&quot; King was reinstated only one week later after promising to take a more active role. Young said of the suspension, &quot;I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right.&quot;

After he was reinstated, King prepared a four-year plan outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the George W. Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. He also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners&#x27; rights, and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks. However, King also suggested in a statement that the group needed a different approach than it had used in the past, stating, &quot;We must not allow our lust for &#x27;temporal gratification&#x27; to blind us from making difficult decisions to effect future generations.&quot;

Martin Luther King III resigned in 2004, upon which Fred Shuttlesworth was elected to replace him. Shuttlesworth resigned the same year that he was appointed, complaining that &quot;deceit, mistrust, and a lack of spiritual discipline and truth have eaten at the core of this once-hallowed organization&quot;. He was replaced by Charles Steele Jr. who served until October 2009.

On October 30, 2009, Elder Bernice King, King&#x27;s youngest child, was elected SCLC&#x27;s new president, with James Bush III taking office in February 2010 as Acting President/CEO until Bernice King took office. However, on January 21, 2011, fifteen months after her election, Bernice King declined the position of president. In a written statement, she said that her decision came &quot;after numerous attempts to connect with the official board leaders on how to move forward under my leadership, unfortunately, our visions did not align.&quot;

==Leadership==
The best-known member of the SCLC was Martin Luther King Jr., who was president and chaired the organization until he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Other prominent members of the organization have included Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy, Ella Baker, James Bevel, Diane Nash, Dorothy Cotton, James Orange, C. O. Simpkins Sr, Charles Kenzie Steele, C. T. Vivian, Fred Shuttlesworth, Andrew Young, Hosea Williams, Jesse Jackson, Walter E. Fauntroy, Claud Young, Septima Clark, Martin Luther King III, Curtis W. Harris, Maya Angelou, and Golden Frinks.

;Presidents
==Relationships with other organizations==
Because of its dedication to direct-action protests, civil disobedience, and mobilizing mass participation in boycotts and marches, SCLC was considered more &quot;radical&quot; than the older NAACP, which favored lawsuits, legislative lobbying, and education campaigns conducted by professionals. At the same time, it was generally considered less radical than Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) or the youth-led Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).

To a certain extent during the period 1960–1964, SCLC had a mentoring relationship with SNCC before SNCC began moving away from nonviolence and integration in the late 1960s. Over time, SCLC and SNCC took different strategic paths, with SCLC focusing on large-scale campaigns such as Birmingham and Selma to win national legislation, and SNCC focusing on community-organizing to build political power on the local level. In many communities, there was tension between SCLC and SNCC because SCLC&#x27;s base was the minister-led Black churches, and SNCC was trying to build rival community organizations led by the poor. SCLC also had its own youth volunteer initiative, the SCOPE Project (Summer Community Organization on Political Education), which placed about 500 young people, mostly white students from nearly 100 colleges and universities, who registered about 49,000 voters in 120 counties in 6 southern states in 1965–66.

In August 1979, the head of the SCLC, Joseph Lowery, met with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), endorsing Palestinian self-determination and urging the PLO to &quot;consider&quot; recognizing Israel&#x27;s right to exist.

<doc id="430599" wikidata="Q2990994" url="?curid=430599" title="Choose Your Own Adventure">
<text>Choose Your Own Adventure is a series of children&#x27;s gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character&#x27;s actions and the plot&#x27;s outcome. The series was based upon a concept created by Edward Packard and originally published by Constance Cappel&#x27;s and R. A. Montgomery&#x27;s Vermont Crossroads Press as the &quot;Adventures of You&quot; series, starting with Packard&#x27;s &quot;Sugarcane Island&quot; in 1976.

&quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;, as published by Bantam Books, was one of the most popular children&#x27;s series during the 1980s and 1990s, selling more than 250 million copies between 1979 and 1998. The series has been translated into 40 languages. When Bantam, now owned by Random House, allowed the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; trademark to lapse, the series was relaunched by Chooseco. Chooseco does not reissue titles by Packard, who has started his own imprint, U-Ventures.

== Format ==
Originally created for 7- to 14-year-olds, the books are written in the second person. The protagonist—that is, the reader—takes on a role relevant to the adventure, such as a private investigator, mountain climber, race car driver, doctor, or spy. Certain books in the series allow readers choice of whom to take the role, for example, in an adventure book, readers may be prompted to choose between a climber, a hiker, or a traveler. Stories are generally gender- and race-neutral, though in some cases, particularly in illustrations, there is the presumption of a male reader (the target demographic group). In some stories, the protagonist is implied to be a child, whereas in other stories, the protagonist is an adult.

The stories are formatted so that, after a few pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to further pages and further options, and so on until they arrive at one of the many story endings. The number of endings varies from as many as 44 in the early titles to as few as 7 in later adventures. Likewise, there is no clear pattern among the various titles regarding the number of pages per ending, the ratio of good to bad endings, or the reader&#x27;s progression backwards and forwards through the pages of the book. This allows for a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings, which is one of the distinguishing features of the books.

As the series progressed, both Packard and Montgomery experimented with the gamebook format, sometimes introducing unexpected twists such as endless page loops or trick endings. Examples include the &quot;paradise planet&quot; ending in &quot;Inside UFO 54-40&quot;, which can only be reached by cheating or turning to the wrong page by accident. The only way out of this is to &quot;reset&quot;, or close the book and start over from the first page.

== History ==
According to Packard, the core idea for the series emerged from bedtime stories that he told to his daughters, revolving around a character named Pete and his adventures: &quot;I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. But that night I was running out of things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do&quot;. His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending for each of the paths: &quot;What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: &#x27;Could I write this down?&#x27;&quot;

Packard soon developed this basic premise into a manuscript titled &quot;The Adventures of You on Sugar Cane Island&quot;. He set out in 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, he was able to convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed to Pocket Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able to make a contract for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to write books for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors.

The series was highly successful after it began printing with Bantam Books. A 1981 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, followed by an interview with Packard on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, provided free publicity.

By the 1990s, the series faced competition from computer games and was in a decline. The series was discontinued in 1999, but was relaunched by a new company, Chooseco, in 2003.

In June 2018, Z-Man Games issued a licensed co-operative board game called &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure: House of Danger&quot; inspired by R. A. Montgomery&#x27;s book in the series.

In January 2019, Chooseco initiated a trademark infringement legal challenge against Netflix for the film &quot;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&quot;. Netflix settled the suit in November 2020.

== Literary reception ==
A &quot;Smithsonian&quot; article criticizes the style as &quot;formulaic&quot; and quotes a scholar stating that &quot;in terms of literary quality, many of the multiple-storyline books are true skunks&quot;.

<text>Alternative culture is a type of culture that exists outside or on the fringes of mainstream or popular culture, usually under the domain of one or more subcultures. These subcultures may have little or nothing in common besides their relative obscurity, but cultural studies uses this common basis of obscurity to classify them as alternative cultures, or, taken as a whole, the alternative culture. Compare with the more politically charged term, counterculture.

<text>The Athens News Agency (ANA; ) was one of the two major news agencies in Greece, the other being the Macedonian Press Agency, before they merged into the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (AMNA).

==History==
The Athens News Agency (ANA) is the national news agency of Greece. Founded in 1895 as a private company, the Stefanopoli Telegraphic Agency, the Greek State assumed its subsidisation in 1905, at which time it acquired its present name.

In 1994 the ANA became a Societe Anonyme with a 7-member Board of Directors, three of whom are appointed by the government and one each by the journalist unions of Athens and Thessaloniki, the publishers&#x27; union and the ANA employees.

ANA collaborates with the international news agencies Reuters, Agence France-Presse, DPA, TASS and a number of national news agencies, as well as the EPA photograph agency.

All the ANA services are on-line, with an estimated 350 news items in Greek and 60-70 items in English updated daily. It also publishes an English &#x27;Electronic Daily News Bulletin&#x27; containing all the Greek news. The ANA further has four data banks in Greek—news, biographies of Greek and foreign personalities, election results and sports—and a news bank in English (since 1992).

The ANA employs about 250 persons, of which 180 are journalists, and has offices in Brussels, Istanbul, Nicosia and Berlin and correspondents in Washington, New York, Montreal, Melbourne, London, Paris, Vienna, Rome, Belgrade, Skopje etc.

ANA&#x27;s General Director is Ilias Matsikas, a former senior editor with the Athens mass daily &quot;Ta Nea&quot;. The managing director is noted Greek journalist and international political analyst Nicolas Voulelis, while the Special English Service (wire service) and the electronic &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; is headed by H.K. (Harry) Tzanis, a University of Houston journalism school graduate.

<doc id="430624" wikidata="Q7394081" url="?curid=430624" title="Montevideo Maru">
<text>Montevideo Maru () was a merchant ship of the Empire of Japan. Launched in 1926, it was pressed into service as a military transport during World War II. It was sunk by the American submarine on 1 July 1942, drowning 1,054 people, mostly Australian prisoners of war and civilians who were being transported from Rabaul, the former Australian territory of New Guinea, to Hainan. The sinking is considered the worst maritime disaster in Australia&#x27;s history. The wreck of the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; was discovered on 18 April 2023.

==Pre-war history==
&quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; was one of three ships (along with &quot;Santos Maru&quot; and &quot;La Plata Maru&quot;) of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK) shipping line built for their trans-Pacific service to South America. The ship was constructed at the Mitsubishi Zosen Kakoki Kaisha shipyard at Nagasaki, and launched in 1926. At in length, and in the beam, it was powered by two Mitsubishi-Sulzer 6ST60 six-cylinder diesel engines delivering a total of and giving it a speed of .
Before the war, the ship operated as a passenger and cargo vessel, travelling mainly between Japan and Brazil carrying Japanese emigrants.

==World War II service==
&quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; participated in the invasion of Makassar, Sulawesi (then Celebes) from 6 to 16 February, 1942. It completed several transport missions before being sunk.

=== Sinking ===
On 22 June 1942, approximately four months after the fall of Rabaul to the Japanese during January/February 1942, 1,054 prisoners (mostly Australians and possibly some New Zealanders) were embarked from Rabaul&#x27;s port onto &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;. It was proceeding without escort to the Chinese island of Hainan, when it was sighted by the American submarine near the northern Philippine coast on 30 June 1942.

&quot;Sturgeon&quot; pursued but could not fire, as the target was travelling at . &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; slowed to about at midnight, to facilitate an expected rendezvous with an escort of two destroyers. Unaware that the ship was carrying Allied prisoners of war and civilians, &quot;Sturgeon&quot; fired four torpedoes at &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; before dawn on 1 July 1942. At least one torpedo hit, causing the vessel to take on water and sink 11 minutes later. Australians in the water sang &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; to their trapped comrades as the ship sank beneath the waves.

The sinking is considered the worst maritime disaster in Australia&#x27;s history. A nominal list made available by the Japanese government in 2012 revealed that a total of 1,054 prisoners (178 non-commissioned officers, 667 soldiers and 209 civilians) died on the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;. Among the dead were 35 sailors from the Norwegian merchant ship &quot;Herstein&quot;. Based on a report made to OSK, of &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;″s complement of 88, some 17 crew and 3 guards are believed to have survived, though a total of 17 has also been claimed.

Among the missing prisoners were:
*Harold Page, deputy administrator of New Guinea and brother of Australian prime minister Earle Page
*Reverend Syd Beazley of the Methodist Mission, the uncle of future Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley 
* Tom Vernon Garrett, the grandfather of Midnight Oil lead singer and government minister Peter Garrett
*Neill Ross Callaghan, the great uncle of a shadow minister for defence, Andrew Hastie
* 22 Salvation Army bandsmen, the majority being members of the Brunswick Citadel band. The bandsmen had enlisted together and comprised the majority of the band of the 2/22nd Battalion.
* John Laurie Ramsay, brother of future Governor of Queensland James Ramsay

== Discovery of the wreck ==
In late January 2010, Federal Member of Parliament, Stuart Robert, called upon the then Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, to back the search for &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;, in the same way that he had supported the search for AHS &quot;Centaur&quot;.

On 18 April 2023, the wreck of the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; was discovered at a depth of over in the South China Sea, off the northwest coast of Luzon, using technology from Dutch underwater search specialist Fugro. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said he hoped the news would bring a &quot;measure of comfort to loved ones who have kept a long vigil&quot;. Silentworld Foundation director John Mullens said in a statement that the site would not be disturbed because it is a war grave.

==Memorials==

A memorial to those who died was erected at the Repatriation Hospital, Bell Street, Heidelberg, Melbourne, Victoria. A &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot; memorial has been erected near the centre of the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat, Victoria. A commemoration service was held at the memorial unveiling in February 2004.

The song &quot;In the Valley&quot; from the album &quot;Earth and Sun and Moon&quot; by Australian pop-rock band Midnight Oil opens with the autobiographical line, &quot;My grandfather went down with the &quot;Montevideo&quot;/The Rising Sun sent him floating to his rest&quot;, sung by Peter Garrett.

==Debated issues==
===Causes of deaths===
Australian veteran Albert Speer (no relation to the wartime German official, Albert Speer) argued in an interview that some of the Australians survived, only for them to die later. Speer, who served in New Guinea, claimed that survivors were transported to Sado Island, only to die days before the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, in August 1945. Professor Hank Nelson considers it unlikely that any Japanese ship would have stopped to rescue prisoners with a hostile submarine nearby. Of the known Japanese survivors, the only one ever questioned was former merchant seaman Yoshiaki Yamaji. In a 2003 interview with &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot;, he stated that he was told that some of the POWs had been picked up and taken to Kobe. 

The Rabaul garrison has been described as a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; by David Day. Lark Force was left without reinforcements, and instructed not to withdraw, in accordance with official War Cabinet policy at the time regarding small garrisons. Harold Page, the senior government official in the territory, was instructed to evacuate only &quot;unnecessary&quot; civilians and was refused permission to evacuate any administrative staff. He was listed among those lost on the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;.

===Number of casualties===
It has been difficult to determine a definitive number of the dead. As late as 2010, Australia&#x27;s Minister for Defence Personnel, Alan Griffin, stated that &quot;there is no absolutely confirmed roll&quot;. Australian Army officer Major Harold S. Williams&#x27; 1945 list of the Australian dead was lost, along with the original Japanese list in katakana it had been compiled from; these challenges have been exacerbated by the forensic difficulties of recovering remains lost at sea.

In 2012, the Japanese government handed over thousands of POW documents to the Australian government. The &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;″s manifest, which contained the names of all the Australians on board, was among them. The translation of the manifest was released in June 2012, confirming a total of 1,054 Australians, of whom 845 were from Lark Force. The new translation corrected a longstanding historical error in the number of civilians who went down with the ship. There were 209, not 208 as previously thought. This is not an additional casualty. Rather, the previous number was simply inaccurate.

<doc id="430626" wikidata="Q1701428" url="?curid=430626" title="John Phillips (geologist)">
<text>John Phillips FRS (25 December 1800 – 24 April 1874) was an English geologist. In 1841 he published the first global geologic time scale based on the correlation of fossils in rock strata, thereby helping to standardize terminology including the term Mesozoic, which he invented.

==Life and work==

Phillips was born at Marden in Wiltshire. His father belonged to an old Welsh family, but settled in England as an officer of excise and married the sister of William Smith, a renowned English geologist. When both parents died when he was a child, Phillips&#x27;s custody was assumed by Smith, and Phillips was brought into Smith&#x27;s London home during early 1815. During the next few years, he attended various schools and helped his uncle with his geological research and writing; he also developed an interest in lithography (printing from prepared slabs of stone) and was among the earliest English practitioners of the process, experimenting with it between about 1816 and 1819. After ending school, Phillips accompanied Smith on his wanderings in connection with his preparation of geological maps.

During the spring of 1824, Smith went to York to deliver a course of lectures on geology, and his nephew Phillips accompanied him. Phillips accepted engagements in the principal Yorkshire towns to arrange their museums and give courses of lectures on the collections contained therein. York became his residence, and he obtained during 1826 the situation of keeper of the Yorkshire Museum and secretary of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society at the same time as Henry Robinson was Librarian of the YPS.

From that centre, Phillips extended his operations to towns beyond the county, and by 1831 he included University College London within the sphere of his activity. During that year the British Association for the Advancement of Science was initiated at York, and Phillips was one of the people who organized it. He became the first assistant secretary in 1832, a job which he had until 1859. In 1834, he accepted the professorship of geology at King&#x27;s College London, but retained his job at York.

In 1834, Phillips was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. During later years he received honorary degrees of LL.D. from Dublin and Cambridge, and D.C.L. from Oxford; while in 1845 he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London. In 1840, he resigned his charge of the Yorkshire Museum and was appointed to the staff of the geological survey of Great Britain managed by Henry De la Beche. Phillips spent some time studying the Palaeozoic fossils of Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset, of which he published a descriptive memoir (in 1841). During that same year, he published the first global geologic time scale, which ordered rock strata according to the types of fossils found within. This helped standardize the usage of the terms Paleozoic period, which he extended to a longer period than it had had by previous usage, and Mesozoic period, the latter being his own invention. He also made a detailed survey of the region of the Malvern Hills, of which he prepared the elaborate account that appears in vol. ii. of the Memoirs of the Survey (1848). In 1844, he became professor of geology for Trinity College Dublin.
Nine years later, on the death of Hugh Edwin Strickland, who had acted as substitute for Dean Buckland in the readership of geology in the University of Oxford, Phillips succeeded to the post of deputy. At the dean&#x27;s death in 1856, Phillips became himself reader, a post which he had to the time of his death. During his residence in Oxford, he had a major part in the foundation and arrangement of the University Museum established in 1859 (see his &quot;Notices of Rocks and Fossils in the University Museum&quot;, 1863; and &quot;The Oxford Museum&quot;, by H. W. Acland and J. Ruskin, 1859; reprinted with additions 1893). Phillips was also keeper of the Ashmolean Museum from 1854 until 1870. During 1859–1860 he was president of the Geological Society of London, and during 1865 president of the British Association. Phillips also made astronomical observations of the planet Mars during its 1862 opposition.

On 23 April 1874, he dined at All Souls College, but on leaving he slipped and fell down a flight of stone stairs. He died the next day, and was buried in York Cemetery, beside his sister Anne and his benefactor Thomas Gray. His coffin was accompanied to Oxford railway station by 200 university academics.

==Selected writings==

The first paper Phillips published was &quot;On the Direction of the Diluvial Currents in Yorkshire&quot; (1827). He contributed to the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Journal of the Geological Society&quot;, and the &quot;Geological Magazine&quot;. He was also the author of separate works, including:

*&quot;Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire&quot; (in two parts, 1829 and 1836; 2nd edition of part 1 in 1835; 3rd edition, edited by R. Etheridge, in 1875) Part 1 &amp; Part 2; Full text of the 1829 edition at Archive.org
*&quot;A Treatise on Geology&quot; (1837–1839); Vol I; Vol II
*&quot;Memoirs of William Smith&quot; (1844);
*&quot;The Rivers, Mountains and Sea-Coast of Yorkshire&quot; (1853);
*&quot;Manual of Geology, Practical and Theoretical&quot; Part I; Part II(1855);
*&quot;Life on the Earth: its Origin and Succession&quot; (1860);
*&quot;Vesuvius&quot; (1869);
*&quot;Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames&quot; (1871).

To these should be added his &quot;Monograph of British Belemnitidae&quot; (1865), for the Palaeontographical Society, and his geological map of the British Isles (1847). His manuscript notebook describing his early experiments with lithography was published by the Printing Historical Society in 2016.

== Eponymy ==
The Carboniferous trilobite genus &quot;Phillipsia&quot; Portlock, 1843 is named in his honour.

Craters on Mars and the Moon are named after him.

==Blue plaque==

In February 2016, a blue plaque commemorating John Phillips was erected on the side of St. Mary&#x27;s Lodge (in York Museum Gardens), where Phillips lived in the mid-19th Century. The plaque, dedicated by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, York Civic Trust, and York Museums Trust reads: &quot;John Phillips FRS, 1800–1874, Geologist. Yorkshire Philosophical Society Officer and first Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum lived here between 1839 and 1853.&quot;

<doc id="430631" wikidata="Q3342685" url="?curid=430631" title="Nog (Star Trek)">
<text>Nog, played by Aron Eisenberg, is a recurring character on the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;). A member of the profit-driven alien species known as the Ferengi, he becomes the first Ferengi to join Starfleet, where he excels as first a cadet, and then an officer. He is the nephew of the Ferengi bartender Quark, a major character on the series; the son of Quark&#x27;s brother Rom; and a close friend of Jake Sisko, the son of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;″s protagonist Benjamin Sisko. Episodes of the series often paired Nog with Jake.

Nog is the main character in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;, which was noted for exploring his recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Fictional character biography==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, Nog was born to Rom and Prinadora on Ferenginar in 2353. Later, he moved with his father to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and worked at his uncle Quark&#x27;s bar. This time is depicted in &quot;DS9&quot;, and Nog is characterized as being very mischievous and a slight delinquent. Throughout the course of the series, Nog befriends Jake Sisko. In the first seasons of &quot;DS9&quot; he is, though reluctantly, one of the first students in Keiko O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s school. When Rom, under pressure from Quark and Grand Nagus Zek, pulls Nog out of school, Jake tutors him without Rom&#x27;s knowledge (&quot;The Nagus&quot;).

Recognizing his father&#x27;s failure to capitalize on his proficiency in mechanics and electronics, and not wanting to follow in those footsteps, Nog resolves to go into a career where he can make something of himself. He requests a recommendation from Commander Benjamin Sisko to be admitted to Starfleet Academy (&quot;Heart of Stone&quot;). Although Sisko takes considerable convincing that this young Ferengi is serious in this uncharacteristically unprofitable ambition for his species, Nog is admitted with his recommendation and becomes the first Ferengi in Starfleet (&quot;Facets&quot;).

Starfleet assigns Nog to Deep Space Nine as part of his cadet field training (&quot;The Ascent&quot;). Upon returning to the station, he and Jake become roommates. As a cadet, Nog works mainly under chief of operations Miles O&#x27;Brien. Nog receives a commission as ensign shortly before Starfleet retakes Deep Space Nine during the Dominion War (&quot;Favor the Bold&quot;).

In the height of the Dominion War, Nog loses his leg due to a battle injury (&quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot;). Although a biosynthetic leg is grown for him to replace the amputated one, after months of therapy Nog still feels phantom pain in his new leg. Nog chooses a holosuite simulation of a Las Vegas nightclub as the place to recuperate from his trauma and adjust to using an artificial limb, living in the holosuite until the simulated nightclub singer Vic Fontaine forces him to leave (&quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;).

One of Sisko&#x27;s final acts before joining the Prophets is to promote Nog to the rank of lieutenant junior grade (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;).

In the 32nd century, Starfleet has named a starship after Nog. The USS &quot;Nog&quot; (an &quot;Eisenberg&quot;-class starship, named after actor Aron Eisenberg, who played Nog and had recently died) is stationed at Federation headquarters. (&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;: &quot;Die Trying&quot;)

==Top episodes==
The episode &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;, focuses on Nog&#x27;s recovery from the trauma of having lost his leg in the episode &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot;. These two episodes were ranked as the 14th and 15th best of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016. Hollywood Reporter ranked &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; as the 56th best of all episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise aired by 2016, calling it a touching and ambitious story. The A.V. Club&#x27;s Zack Handlen lauded Aron Eisenberg&#x27;s acting in this episode, noting that his portrayal of Nog&#x27;s PTSD &quot;has some real edges to it, and some aspects of it should be familiar to anyone who&#x27;s suffered a period of severe depression&quot;.

Stephanie Marceau, writing for &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, ranked the top ten episodes featuring Nog:

# It&#x27;s Only A Paper Moon
#Heart of Stone
# The Magnificent Ferengi
# The Jem&#x27;Hadar
# Treachery, Faith, and the Great River
# Badda-Bing Badda-Bang
# The Visitor
# Progress
# Valiant
# Empok Nor

Marceau says of &quot;Its Only a Paper Moon&quot; that &quot;Watching Nog deal with his conflicted feelings and trauma about the war and Starfleet was powerful and inspiring&quot; and found the show&#x27;s treatment of the character&#x27;s loss &quot;respectful&quot;. Clint Worthington, writing for SyFy, felt &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, in which Nog decides to join Starfleet, was the most important Nog episode; he also noted &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot;, in which Nog is confronted with the hardships of war.

==Reception==
In 2016, the character of Nog was ranked as the 51st most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired Magazine.

Richard A. Hall observed that not the least through the influence of his Starfleet neighbours, Nog becomes a more thoughtful and caring individual over the course of the show&#x27;s run.

Discovery co-creator and co-showrunner Alex Kurtzman saw in Nog &quot;a character who exemplified the possibility of resilience after a period of darkness&quot;. Malissa Longo, widow of the portrayer Aron Eisenberg, commented: &quot;Nog was a trailblazer in DS9. I have no doubt that he would have left a lasting impression on the Federation&quot;.

In 2019, Clint Worthington writing for SyFy, said that Nog was &quot;one of Star Trek&#x27;s most aspirational characters&quot; noting how the character progressed throughout the show. They point in the early seasons he &quot;dragged Jake into one misadventure or another&quot;, a cackling sidekick for Jake, but then in &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; he has realization he does not like where his life is headed. With the help of Commander Sisko, he sets his dreams on Starfleet hoping to rise above the limited opportunities available to him.

CNN remembered Nog as the major role for actor Eisenberg in his career when he died in 2019.

<doc id="430634" wikidata="Q23808443" url="?curid=430634" title="Female suicide bomber">
<text>Female suicide bombers are women who intend to do suicide attack, wherein the bomber kills herself while simultaneously killing targeted people. Suicide bombers are normally viewed as male political radicals but since the 1960s female suicide attacks have been on the rise. Through 1985–2006, 15% of all suicide attacks were conducted by female suicide bombers. There are many organizations, such as Boko Haram (which is the first group to use females in a majority of their suicide bombings and surpassed the Tamil Tigers in using more female suicide-bombers than any other terrorist group in history), ISIS, and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, that recently started using women as tools in their attacks, since they are normally viewed as less of a threat than their male counterparts. This includes women having the element of surprise, a hesitancy to search females, increased publicity for female suicide bombing attacks, and the female stereotype as non-violent.

==Background==
Women have an extensive and complex history in political violence. While the typical terrorist of the 1960s tended to be an educated male from an upper-middle-class background, many left-wing terrorist groups in the 1960s and 1970s had prominent women active within these groups. Ulrike Meinhof, a German left-wing terrorist and journalist, co-founded the Red Army Faction and participated in a range of bombings and bank robberies. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)&#x27;s Leila Khaled is considered to be the first women to hijack an airplane, drawing international attention. Fusako Shigenobu founded and led the Japanese Red Army, a communist militant group that conducted hijackings and massacres. A number of Italian women were active in Italian terrorist organizations between 1970–1984. Females played fundamental roles in Puerto Rican nationalist movements such as the Puerto Rican Armed Forces of National Liberation (FLAN) and the Boricua Popular Army (Los Macheteros), two groups designated as terrorist organizations. Women served visible roles in American groups, such as the Symbionese Liberation Army. Women also served as mobilizing agents for Weather Underground, recruiting people into the organization. Women have been more active in left-wing groups as these groups&#x27; ideologies tend to be more conducive to women&#x27;s participation in combatant and other non-traditional roles.

Organizations have differing stances on female suicide bombers. For example, in 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas &quot;categorically renounced the use of women as suicide bombers.&quot; In fact, in early 2002, he reported that &quot;Hamas was far from enthusiastic about the inclusion of women in warfare, for reasons of modesty.&quot; This stance shifted in 2004, when the first female suicide bomber was used. Officials exclaimed that the act was a &quot;significant evolution in our fight. The male fighters face many obstacles... women are like the reserve army―when there is a necessity, we use them.&quot; The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attracted thousands of women and their militarization shaped women&#x27;s identity from the &quot;traditional ideal of the auspicious, fecund wife to the androgynous Armed Virgin.&quot; Rajini Thiranagama stated, &quot;One cannot but be inspired when one sees the women of the LTTE in the night with their AKs slung over the shoulder. ... One cannot but admire the dedication and toughness of their training. … One could see the nationalist fervor and the romantic vision of women in arms defending the nation.&quot;

=== Characteristics of female suicide bombers ===
There is much variation among female suicide bombers. A number of studies have attempted to compare suicide attackers across different suicide groups. It was found that groups that used women the least were Islamist fundamentalist groups. When dealing with age, female suicide bombers followed the same age trend as males, typically falling within the early to mid 20s. They also tend to have more secular ties than presumed. Some are married while others are widows. Socioeconomic status also varies among female attackers.

Women&#x27;s involvement is mediated differently than men&#x27;s; they are more likely to be involved through personal contacts or family members, while men&#x27;s process of involvement is more likely to stem from movement affiliation and disenchantment with nonviolent forms of political activism. Differences in men and women&#x27;s need for revenge (and subsequent use of suicide attacks) has been studied, with inconsistent findings reported. Some argue men are more vengeful than women, while others find no such claims.

===Examples===
* Sana&#x27;a Mehaidli, a 16-year-old Christian member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP/PPS), a pro-Syrian Lebanese organization, is believed to have been the first female suicide bomber. On 9 April 1985, she blew up herself and a truck of explosives next to an Israeli convoy in Lebanon during the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon. She worked at a video store where she recorded her will, saying &quot;I am very comfortable with carrying out this operation. I choose to do this because I am fulfilling my duty towards my land and my people...Now I am loving my country, sacrificing my life and respecting the people of the south.&quot;
* Thenmozhi Rajaratnam (born Kalaivani Rajaratnam; soubriquet: &quot;Dhanu&quot;) is thought to have been a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers), was involved in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-Prime minister of India, and sixteen other bystanders in 1991. She allegedly had been raped by Indian Peace Keeping Force soldiers and her four brothers were killed. Sri Lanka&#x27;s political group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) includes the Black Tigers, and the Black Tigers are known for suicide bombing attacks, mostly perpetrated by women. A female suicide bomber attempted to kill Sri Lanka&#x27;s Army Commander Sarath Fonseka in 2006. Fonseka survived, but seven others were killed in the attack. Sri Lanka&#x27;s Fisheries Minister and former militant Douglas Devananda was the target of a female suicide bomber in 2007. She detonated the bomb during a body check.
* Wafa Idris detonated a 22-pound bomb in the center of Jerusalem outside a shoe store on Jaffa Road, killing herself and Pinhas Tokatli (81), and injuring more than 100 others. The attack took place on 27 January 2002 but the identity of the bomber was not confirmed until 30 January 2002. Idris carried the bomb in a backpack, rather than strapped to her body. Since, prior to this attack, women had only helped plant bombs, the use of a backpack and the lack of the usual note or video led to confusion regarding her suicide motives and speculation that she did not intend to detonate the bomb, but that the explosion was accidental. However, after investigation of the explosion, Israel declared Idris a suicide bomber around 9 February 2002. Prior to this Idris called for an &quot;Army of Roses.&quot; She served under Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Wafa was born in a refugee camp, and her father died in when she was a child. During the First Intifada, she served on the refugee camp&#x27;s women&#x27;s committee, helping prisoners&#x27; families and distributing food. When she delivered a stillborn and was told she would never be able to carry a baby to full-term, her husband divorced her.
* Muriel Degauque was a Belgian convert to Islam who died in a suicide car bomb attack on 9 November 2005 against a U.S. military convoy in Iraq. One soldier was wounded. She originally worked at a bakery and after marrying a Muslim man, she moved to Iraq and became radicalized.
* Zeynep Kınacı was a Kurdish member of the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) and known for having committed its 1996 Tunceli bombing.
* The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two female Islamist terrorists from the Caucasus during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro (Lubyanka and Park Kultury), with roughly 40 minutes in between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured. The women were identified as Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova and Mariam Sharipova.
* On 14 February 2011, a female suicide bomber killed a Russian serviceman and wounded four others at a Dagestan police station in Gubden, a village around 150 km (100 miles) south of the provincial capital of Makhachkala.
* Blasts from two female suicide bombers at a crowded fish market in Nigeria&#x27;s northeastern city of Maiduguri killed at least 20 people on 22 June 2015.
* On 23 December 2016, the first female suicide bomber in Bangladesh detonated her explosive during a police raid while holding her 7-year-old daughter in one hand and chanting: &quot;We will go to heaven! We will go to heaven!&quot; She was identified as Jebunnahar Islam Shila.
* In 2018, in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, a Muslim family, composed of three men (father Dita Oepriarto and sons Firman and Yusuf, aged 15 and 17) and three women (mother Puji Kuswati, Indonesia&#x27;s first female suicide bomber, and daughters Famela and Fadhila, aged 8 and 12), died carrying out bombings at three Catholic and Christian churches, killing 12 people and injuring at least 40.
*On 26 April 2022, Shari Baloch, a 30-year old science teacher and mother of two, detonated her explosives in the University of Karachi in Pakistan, killing three Chinese teachers. The separatist militant group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the incident, claiming her as the organisation&#x27;s first female suicide bomber.

==Causes and reasons==
There are a number of reasons as to why female suicide bombers are used by groups. Terrorists use bombers as they are cheaper than purchasing arms. They are considered a low risk weapon and require low technology. They do not require much training, do not leave much of a trace behind, have the element of surprise, have easier access to targeted populations as well as soft targets, and tend to frighten the general population. As female combatants are seen as less likely to engage in lethal actions and can thus avoid suspicion, they are regarded as ideal combatants. Dress and gender stereotypes are often utilized by women to bypass security defenses. For example, women who appear pregnant appropriate related expectations and stereotypes to their benefit, discouraging invasive body searchers. Women may also &quot;westernize&quot; their appearance in an attempt at covering their actions and avoiding detection. Women are also deployed as suicide bombers as they tend to &quot;elicit greater public sympathy and publicity for an organization.&quot; By some research, female bombers receive eight times more press coverage than their male counterparts.

Insurgent groups also face pressure when it comes to recruiting members, causing the group to expand their bases to sustain the group&#x27;s position. It has been argued that the introduction of women and girls into combat &quot;generally came about in response to logistical demands: the mounting number of casualties, the intensified crackdowns by government, and the ability to escape detection more easily than men.&quot; An example of this was in January 2002 when Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, renounced the use of female bombers. Later on in the same year, Hamas was not enthusiastic about adding women into their ranks. Hamas subsequently reversed their stance, deploying their first female suicide bomber in January 2004. On average, it is calculated that terrorist groups that use suicide bombing as a tactic wait around 13.5 years before employing women. However, women are reported to have higher kill rates than men, on average killing four times as many people as men do.

Terrorist and insurgent groups may also appropriate media coverage to benefit from the portrayal of female suicide bombers. Women&#x27;s media portrayal may help various organizations recruit and motivate men, and coverage of women in the media allows groups to differentiate themselves from one another. It also may help deliver group-based messages. For example, media coverage may highlight that the group, by using women, had been driven to extreme measures. Media attention on female suicide bombers tends to examine emotional explanations for women&#x27;s involvement, as opposed to ideological justifications.

==Individual motivations==
There are different causes and reasons why female suicide bombers perform these deadly actions. For one, many cite personal feelings of sacrifice in conducting such missions. The missions become more esteemed to the public when they are framed as forms of sacrifice. Society would be &quot;hard pressed to accept, that a female who offers her life in this context is seen as engaging in the most profound form of selflessness.&quot; Other research suggests that women resort to terrorism to &quot;redeem their fallen reputations, such as being barren, divorced, defiled, unchaste, and so on.&quot; Struggling for the pursuit of freedom through the LTTE can be seen as a way in which women can redeem themselves. Tamil rape victims tend to be prohibited from marriage and childbearing. Conceptualizing female bombers as mothers allows suicide bombings to serve as offerings for women who cannot become mothers.

In the literature on female suicide bombers, exploitation of women is a distinctive factor that separates them from male suicide bombers. Research has examined cases of women&#x27;s exploitation by their own families, often for monetary compensation.

Women can also be motivated by political/and or historical contexts to take action against their enemy. For example, in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, it has been noted that Palestinian female suicide bombers are often motivated by anti-Zionism and the Israeli occupation of their homeland to take action. According to Palestinian legal scholar Noura Erakat, the &quot;Israeli military occupation [is] a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women&#x27;s rights.&quot; They are often motivated by the politics of their environment to take action in this situation. Western feminist critic Amal Amireh notes examples of how the women exercise their political agency in the conflict, including the fact that the bomber often declares in public her political group and nationalism, as well as the fact that they commit the act in public as a spectacle to be observed. There is also a case to be made toward religion/political indoctrination. Some recruiters, like the LTTE, would concentrate on recruiting orphans due to their young age, making it much easier to indoctrinate and condition.

Individual motivations to become suicide bombers vary. Motives include &quot;to avenge a personal loss, to redeem the family name, to escape a life of sheltered monotony and achieve fame, or to equalize the patriarchal societies in which they live&quot;. The death of a relative triggers the decision to commit a suicide attack. Some women join to seek revenge. For example, studies have shown that some women join the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam seeking revenge against crimes the government has committed against the group, from disappearances to torture. Government oppression has only emboldened the LTTE, and women have increasingly become more publicly involved.

In Chechnya, female bombers originally became involved for more personal reasons, avenging the deaths of Chechen male relatives killed by Russian forces. They are referred to as &quot;Black Widows&quot; because many were the wives, mothers, sisters, or female relatives of men killed in battle. The activities of the Black Widows are regarded to support the theory that suicide bombings may alter societal gender norms. With militant involvement usually seen as being performed by men, engaging in violent actions counters notions of women&#x27;s traditional roles, such as raising children. Clara Beyler, a counter-terrorism analyst writes that &quot;There is a difference between men and women suicide attackers: women consider combat as a way to escape the predestined life that is expected of them. When women become human bombs, their intent is to make a statement not only in the name of a country, a religion, a leader, but also in the name of their gender&quot;.

==Effects==
===Deadliness===
According to a 2021 study, female suicide attacks &quot;are more deadly in countries where women are largely absent from the workforce, civil society, and protest organizations.&quot; However, &quot;female attack lethality is declining with time, suggesting that security forces eventually adapt to women&#x27;s participation in terrorism.&quot;

===Organizations of female suicide bombers===
The Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades is a known terrorist organization that has trained many female suicide bombers since their uprising as political weapons. In January 2002, the group claimed responsibility for the first female suicide bombing attack inside of Israel, in efforts to push Israel settlers out of West Bank and to form an entirely Palestinian state. The group is known to be most active in the Gaza Strip, but also attacks inside of Israel and the West Bank.

===Chechnya===
The Shahidka, commonly referred to as the &quot;Black Widows&quot; are a group of Islamist Chechen separatist suicide bombers. Khava Barayeva blew herself up at a Russian Army outpost on June 7, 2000. In 2001, Aiza Gazuyeva killed Russian general Gaidar Gadzhiyev in a suicide bombing, the first female suicide bombing of the Chechen insurgency. The group carried out the Moscow theater hostage crisis and a number of them were involved in the Beslan school siege. A bombing that killed 10 people at Rizhskaya metro station in Moscow was thought to be carried out by a woman who was identified as a Beslan school captor. The 2004 Russian aircraft bombings are believed to be carried out by female bombers. Two of the perpetrators of the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were women; Dzhanet Abdullayeva, who was married to a militant, and Maryam Sharipova. The October 2013 Volgograd bus bombing was carried out by a woman.

===Palestinian bombers===

On the same day Darine Abu Aisha committed a suicide bombing, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the religious leader of Islamist militant group Hamas, issued a fatwa, or religious rule, that gave permission to women to participate in suicide attacks as well as listing the rewards in &quot;paradise&quot; that these female martyrs would receive upon their deaths. He also promised Hamas would send many female suicide bombers in order to strike Israelis. Reactions to this in the Islamic world were mixed. While many hailed the female suicide bomber and urged full involvement of all in &quot;Jihad&quot;, some criticized the cruelty of tearing mothers from their children and sending them to explode themselves.

Notable female Palestinian suicide bombers include:
*Wafa Idris – first suicide bomber (bombing date: January 27, 2002)
*Darine Abu Aisha – second suicide bomber (bombing date: February 27, 2002)
*Ayat al-Akhras – third suicide bomber (bombing date: March 29, 2002)
*Andalib Suleiman – fourth suicide bomber (bombing date: April 12, 2002)
*Hiba Da&#x27;arma - fifth suicide bomber (bombing date: May 19, 2003) 
*Hanadi Jaradat – sixth suicide bomber (bombing date: October 4, 2003)
*Reem Al-Reyashi – eighth suicide bomber (bombing date: January 15, 2004). Al-Reyashi, a 22-year-old mother of two, detonated an explosive pack at the Erez crossing point on the frontier of the Gaza Strip. Two Israeli soldiers, a policeman and a civilian security worker were killed. Seven other Israelis and four Palestinians were injured.

<text>(&quot;The Impresario&quot;), K. 486, is a comic &quot;singspiel&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, set to a German libretto by Gottlieb Stephanie, an Austrian &quot;Schauspieldirektor&quot;. Originally, it was written because of &quot;the imperial command&quot; of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II who had invited 80 guests to a private luncheon.
It is regarded as &quot;a parody on the vanity of singers&quot;, who argue over status and pay.

Mozart, who describes it as &quot;comedy with music&quot; wrote it as his entry in a musical competition which was given a private performance hosted on 7 February 1786 by Joseph II at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. This competition pitted a German &quot;singspiel&quot;, presented at one end of the room, against a competing Italian opera, the Italian entry being Antonio Salieri&#x27;s opera buffa, &quot;Prima la musica e poi le parole&quot; (&quot;First the Music, then the Words&quot;), which was then given at the other end of the room. The premiere was followed by the first of three public performances given four days later at the Kärntnertor Theater, Vienna, on 11 February.

The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum.

==Composition history==
The work was written during a very creative period in Mozart&#x27;s life, at the same time as his &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, which premiered later the same year, along with three piano concertos and &quot;another dozen major works&quot;.

In addition to the overture, there are only four vocal numbers in the score, and the musical content (about 30 minutes) is surrounded by much spoken dialogue, typical in its day. One highlight, which Erik Smith describes as very funny, is where &quot;each lady sings about the nobility of her art while trying to defeat her rival with ever higher notes&quot;. Although it has been described as a &quot;silly farce&quot;, Mozart appears to have taken the opportunity to write serious arias and thus the &quot;audition&quot; of Madame Herz includes her aria &quot;&quot; (&quot;There tolls the hour of departure&quot;), while Mme Silberklang sings the elegant rondo, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dearest Youth&quot;).

==Performance history==
The opera was first presented in the United Kingdom on 30 May 1857 at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London and given its US premiere at the Stadt Theatre in New York on 9 November 1870.

In modern times, the text is usually completely rewritten for contemporary relevance, which was the case for the 2014 production given by the Santa Fe Opera. There it had &quot;English dialogue by the British dramatist Ranjit Bolt and additional Mozart concert arias folded into the score&quot; with the action taking place in Paris in the 1920s.
The cast included Anthony Michaels-Moore, Brenda Rae, Meredith Arwady, and Erin Morley.

The 1966 recording by the English Chamber Orchestra (conducted by André Previn), was performed with an English libretto penned by Previn&#x27;s then wife Dory Previn, who transplanted the amusing tale to the 20th century.

Bronx Opera performed it in 1972, 2008, and in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a video version in Zoom format.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Vienna
:Time: 1786

Frank, the impresario (along with the buffo singer, Buff, who assists him) auditions two actresses to be part of his new theatrical company. While both are hired, they then argue over who will get the prime role and who will be paid the most. To illustrate their strengths, each sings a striking aria to back her claim (Herz: &quot;, Silberklang: &quot;). An agreement is reached when the tenor, Vogelsang, intervenes, in what Julian Rushton describes as a hilarious trio, &quot; (I am the prima donna) compromise is agreed to with each receiving &quot;large salaries and star billing&quot;. The work ended with the quartet &quot;&quot; (Every artist strives for glory).

<doc id="430636" wikidata="Q170093" url="?curid=430636" title="Vetus Latina">
<text>The Vetus Latina (&quot;Old Latin&quot; in Latin), also known as Vetus Itala (&quot;Old Italian&quot;), Itala (&quot;Italian&quot;) and Old Italic, and denoted by the siglum formula_1, are the Latin translations of biblical texts (both Old Testament and New Testament) that preceded the Vulgate (the Latin translation produced by Jerome in the late 4th century). 

The &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; translations continued to be used alongside the Vulgate, but eventually the Vulgate became the standard Latin Bible used by the Catholic Church, especially after the Council of Trent (1545–1563) affirmed the Vulgate translation as authoritative for the text of Catholic Bibles. However, the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; texts survive in some parts of the liturgy (e.g., the &quot;Pater Noster&quot;).

As the English translation of &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; is &quot;Old Latin&quot;, they are also sometimes referred to as the Old Latin Bible, although they are written in the form of Latin known as Late Latin, not that known as Old Latin. The &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; manuscripts that are preserved today are dated from AD 350 to the 13th century.

== Text ==
There is no single &quot;&quot;Vetus Latina&quot; Bible&quot;. Instead, &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; is a collection of biblical manuscript texts that are Latin translations of Septuagint and New Testament passages that preceded Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate. 

=== Old Testament ===
Some of the oldest surviving &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; versions of the Old Testament (or Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh) include the Quedlinburg &quot;Itala&quot; fragment, a 5th-century manuscript containing parts of 1 Samuel, and the Codex Complutensis I, a 10th-century manuscript containing Old Latin readings of the Book of Ruth, Book of Esther, Book of Tobit, Book of Judith, and 1-2 Maccabees.

=== New Testament ===

There are over 80 manuscripts or fragments with Latin translations of New Testament books that pre-date Jerome (i.e. before 350 CE). There are around 50 for the Gospels in particular. The &quot;vetus latina&quot; were revised to form the Vulgate New Testament: Jerome producing the Gospels and an unknown scholar producing the rest.

After comparing readings for Luke 24:4–5 in &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; manuscripts, Bruce Metzger counted &quot;at least 27 variant readings in &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; manuscripts that have survived&quot; for this passage alone.

==Replacement==
When Jerome undertook the revision of Latin translations of Old Testament texts in the late 4th century, he checked the Septuagint and &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; translations against the Hebrew texts that were then available. He broke with church tradition and translated most of the Old Testament of his Vulgate from Hebrew sources rather than from the Greek Septuagint. His choice was severely criticized by Augustine, his contemporary; a flood of still less moderate criticism came from those who regarded Jerome as a forger. While on the one hand he argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on both philological and theological grounds, on the other, in the context of accusations of heresy against him, Jerome would acknowledge the Septuagint texts as well.

==Comparisons with the Vulgate==
Below are some comparisons of the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; with text from critical editions of the Vulgate.

The following comparison is of Luke 6:1–4, taken from the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; text in the Codex Bezae:

The &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; text survives in places in the Catholic liturgy, such as the following verse well known from Christmas carols, Luke 2:14:

The &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; text means, &quot;Glory [belongs] to God among the high, and peace [belongs] to men of good will on earth&quot;. The Vulgate text means &quot;Glory [belongs] to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth&quot;.

Probably the most well known difference between the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster, where the phrase from the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot;, &quot;Panem nostrum cotidianum&quot;, &quot;our daily bread&quot;, becomes &quot;Panem nostrum supersubstantialem&quot;, &quot;our supersubstantial bread&quot; in the Vulgate; the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; form being retained in the Roman Missal for liturgical use.

Further words can be made by treating some of the decimal numbers as letters - the digit &quot;codice_3&quot; can represent the letter &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;codice_4&quot; can represent the letters &quot;I&quot; or &quot;L&quot;. Less commonly, &quot;codice_5&quot; can represent &quot;S&quot;, &quot;codice_6&quot; represent &quot;T&quot;, &quot;codice_7&quot; represent &quot;R&quot; and &quot;codice_8&quot; or &quot;codice_9&quot; can represent &quot;G&quot; or &quot;g&quot;, respectively. Numbers such as codice_10, codice_11 or codice_12 can be used in a manner similar to leet or rebuses; e.g. the word &quot;defecate&quot; can be expressed either as codice_13 or codice_14.

== Notable magic numbers ==

Many computer processors, operating systems, and debuggers make use of magic numbers, especially as a magic debug value.

== Alternative letters ==
Many computer languages require that a hexadecimal number be marked with a prefix or suffix (or both) to identify it as a number. Sometimes the prefix or suffix is used as part of the word.
* The C programming language uses the &quot;0x&quot; prefix to indicate a hexadecimal number, but the &quot;0x&quot; is usually ignored when people read such values as words. C also allows the suffix L to declare an integer as codice_15, or LL to declare it as codice_16, making it possible to write &quot;0xDEADCELL&quot; (dead cell). In either case a U may also appear in the suffix to declare the integer as codice_17, making it possible to write &quot;0xFEEDBULL&quot; (feed bull).
* In the (non-Unix) Intel assembly language, hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a &quot;h&quot; suffix, making it possible to write &quot;0beach&quot; (beach). Note that numbers in this notation that begin with a letter must be prefixed with a zero to distinguish them from variable names. A Unix-style assembler uses C language convention instead (but non-Unix-style assemblers are also available on x86 Unix-type OSes).
* Visual Basic and all previous Microsoft BASICs such as QuickBasic, GWBasic, BASICA and ColorBASIC, use a &amp;H prefix, for example, &quot;&amp;HEADED&quot; (headed) and &quot;&amp;HADC0FFEE&quot; (had coffee).
* In Pascal and several assembly languages (6502,6809...), hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a &quot;$&quot; prefix. This allows for words starting with the letter &quot;S&quot;, for example &quot;$EED&quot; (seed).
* In B3-34 programmable calculators, an alternative hexadecimal alphabet was used, where the symbols &quot;−&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Г&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot; &quot; (space) were used instead of Latin letters. Using these, it was possible to display messages like &quot;EГГ0Г&quot; (error).

== PlayStation 3 RSX ==

In reverse engineering aspects of the Sony PlayStation 3, a number of hexspeak codes were found to either trigger, affect or were present in aspects of communicating to and through the PlayStation 3 Hypervisor in communication to its GPU, the RSX Reality Synthesizer.

These projects were largely born out of PS3 homebrew operating on the PS3&#x27;s OtherOS which allowed Linux to be installed, initially with extremely limited GPU access.

<doc id="430640" wikidata="Q12289" url="?curid=430640" title="Old Latin">
<text>Old Latin, also known as Early, Archaic or Priscan Latin (Classical ), was the Latin language in the period roughly before 75 BC, i.e. before the age of Classical Latin. A member of the Italic languages, it descends from a common Proto-Italic language; Latino-Faliscan is likely a separate branch from Osco-Umbrian. All these languages may be relatively closely related to Venetic and possibly further to Celtic; see the Italo-Celtic hypothesis.

The use of &quot;old&quot;, &quot;early&quot; and &quot;archaic&quot; has been standard in publications of Old Latin writings since at least the 18th century. The definition is not arbitrary, but the terms refer to spelling conventions and word forms not generally found in works written under the Roman Empire. This article presents some of the major differences.

The earliest known specimen of Latin seems to be on the Praeneste fibula. An analysis done in 2011 declared it to be genuine &quot;beyond any reasonable doubt&quot; and dating from the Orientalizing period, in the first half of the seventh century BC. Other Old Latin inscriptions dated to either the late Roman Kingdom or early Roman Republic include the Lapis Niger stone, the Duenos Inscription on a &quot;kernos&quot; vase, and the Garigliano bowl of Bucchero type.

==Philological constructs==

===The old-time language===
The concept of Old Latin (&quot;Prisca Latinitas&quot;) is as old as the concept of Classical Latin – both labels date to at least as early as the late Roman Republic. In that period Cicero, along with others, noted that the language he used every day, presumably upper-class city Latin, included lexical items and phrases that were heirlooms from a previous time, which he called &quot;verborum vetustas prisca&quot;, translated as &quot;the old age/time of language&quot;.

In the classical period, &quot;Prisca Latinitas&quot;, &quot;Prisca Latina&quot; and other idioms using the adjective always meant these remnants of a previous language, which, in Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact than it really was. &quot;Viri prisci&quot;, &quot;old-time men&quot;, meant the population of Latium before the founding of Rome.

===The four Latins of Isidore===
In the Late Latin period, when Classical Latin was behind them, Latin- and Greek-speaking grammarians were faced with multiple phases, or styles, within the language. Isidore of Seville ( 560 – 636) reports a classification scheme that had come into existence in or before his time: &quot;the four Latins&quot; (&quot;Moreover, some people have said that there are four Latin languages&quot;; &quot;Latinas autem linguas quattuor esse quidam dixerunt&quot;). They were:

* &quot;Prisca&quot;, spoken before the founding of Rome, when Janus and Saturn ruled Latium, to which period Isidore dated the &quot;Carmen Saliare&quot;
* &quot;Latina&quot;, dated from the time of king Latinus, in which period he placed the laws of the Twelve Tables
* &quot;Romana&quot;, essentially equal to Classical Latin
* &quot;Mixta&quot;, &quot;mixed&quot; Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin, known today as Late Latin.

This scheme persisted with little change for some thousand years after Isidore.

===Old Latin===
In 1874, John Wordsworth used this definition: &quot;By Early Latin I understand Latin of the whole period of the Republic, which is separated very strikingly, both in tone and in outward form, from that of the Empire.&quot;

Although the differences are striking and can be easily identified by Latin readers, they are not such as to cause a language barrier. Latin speakers of the empire had no reported trouble understanding Old Latin, except for the few texts that must date from the time of the kings, mainly songs. Thus, the laws of the Twelve Tables (5th century BC) from the early Republic were comprehensible, but the &quot;Carmen Saliare&quot;, probably written under Numa Pompilius (who according to tradition reigned from 715 to 673 BC), was not entirely clear (and remains so). On the other hand, Polybius, a Greek historian of Rome who flourished in the late second century BC, commented on &quot;the first treaty between Rome and Carthage&quot;, (which he dated to 28 years before Xerxes I crossed into Greece; that is, in 508 BC) that &quot;the ancient Roman language differs so much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application by the most intelligent men&quot;.

There is no sharp distinction between Old Latin, as it was spoken for most of the Republic, and Classical Latin, but the earlier grades into the latter. The end of the republic was too late a termination for compilers after Wordsworth; Charles Edwin Bennett said, Early Latin&#x27; is necessarily a somewhat vague term ... Bell, &quot;De locativi in prisca Latinitate vi et usu&quot;, Breslau, 1889, sets the later limit at 75 BC. A definite date is really impossible, since archaic Latin does not terminate abruptly, but continues even down to imperial times.&quot; Bennett&#x27;s own date of 100 BC did not prevail; rather Bell&#x27;s 75 BC became the standard as expressed in the four-volume Loeb Library and other major compendia. Over the 377 years from 452 to 75 BC, Old Latin evolved from texts partially comprehensible by classicists with study to being easily read by scholars.

==Corpus==


Old Latin authored works began in the 3rd century BC. These are complete or nearly complete works under their own name surviving as manuscripts copied from other manuscripts in whatever script was current at the time. There are also fragments of works quoted in other authors.

Many texts placed by various methods (painting, engraving, embossing) on their original media survive just as they were except for the ravages of time. Some of these were copied from other inscriptions. No inscription can be older than the introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy but none survive from that early date. The imprecision of archaeological dating makes it impossible to assign a year to any one inscription, but the earliest survivals are probably from the 6th century BC. Some texts, however, that survive as fragments in the works of classical authors, had to have been composed earlier than the republic, in the time of the monarchy. These are listed below. Some authors, especially in recent texts, refer to the oldest Latin documents (7th–5th c. BCE) as Very Old Latin (VOL).

==Script==

Old Latin surviving in inscriptions is written in various forms of the Etruscan alphabet as it evolved into the Latin alphabet. The writing conventions varied by time and place until classical conventions prevailed.
A part of old inscriptions, texts in the original writing system have been lost or transcribed by later copyists.

Old Latin could be written from right to left (as were Etruscan and early Greek) or boustrophedon.

== Orthography ==
Some differences between old and classical Latin were of spelling only; pronunciation is thought to be essentially the same as in classical Latin:
* Single for double consonants: &quot;Marcelus&quot; for &quot;Marcellus&quot;
* Double vowels for long vowels: &quot;aara&quot; for &quot;āra&quot;
* q for c before u: &quot;pequnia&quot; for &quot;pecunia&quot;
* c for g: &quot;Caius&quot; for &quot;Gaius&quot;

These differences did not necessarily run concurrently with each other and were not universal; that is, c was used for both c and g.

== Phonology ==
=== Stress ===
Old Latin is thought to have had a strong stress on the first syllable of a word until about 250 BC. All syllables other than the first were unstressed and were subjected to greater amounts of phonological weakening. Starting around that year, the Classical Latin stress system began to develop. It passed through at least one intermediate stage, found in Plautus, in which the stress occurred on the fourth last syllable in four-syllable words with all short syllables.

=== Vowels ===


Most original PIE (Proto-Indo-European) diphthongs were preserved in stressed syllables, including (later &quot;ae&quot;); (later &quot;ī&quot;); (later &quot;ū&quot;, or sometimes &quot;oe&quot;); (from PIE and ; later &quot;ū&quot;).

The Old Latin diphthong &quot;ei&quot; evolves in stages: &quot;ei&quot; &gt; &quot;ẹ̄&quot; &gt; &quot;ī&quot;. The intermediate sound &quot;ẹ̄&quot; was simply written &quot;e&quot; but must have been distinct from the normal long vowel &quot;ē&quot; because &quot;ẹ̄&quot; subsequently merged with &quot;ī&quot; while &quot;ē&quot; did not. It is generally thought that &quot;ẹ̄&quot; was a higher sound than &quot;e&quot; (e.g. perhaps vs. during the time when both sounds existed). Even after the original vowel had merged with &quot;ī&quot;, the old spelling &quot;ei&quot; continued to be used for a while, with the result that &quot;ei&quot; came to stand for &quot;ī&quot; and began to be used in the spelling of original occurrences of &quot;ī&quot; that did not evolve from &quot;ei&quot; (e.g. in the genitive singular &quot;-ī&quot;, which is always spelled &quot;-i&quot; in the oldest inscriptions but later on can be spelled either &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-ei&quot;).

In unstressed syllables, *oi and *ai had already merged into &quot;ei&quot; by historic times (except for one possible occurrence of &quot;poploe&quot; for &quot;populī&quot; &quot;people&quot; in a late manuscript of one of the early songs). This eventually also evolved to &quot;ī&quot;.

Old Latin often had different short vowels from Classical Latin, reflecting sound changes that had not yet taken place. For example, the very early Duenos inscription has the form &quot;duenos&quot; &quot;good&quot;, later found as &quot;duonos&quot; and still later &quot;bonus&quot;. A countervailing change &quot;wo&quot; &gt; &quot;we&quot; occurred around 150 BC in certain contexts, and many earlier forms are found (e.g. earlier &quot;votō, voster, vorsus&quot; vs. later &quot;vetō, vester, versus&quot;).

Old Latin frequently preserves original PIE thematic case endings &quot;-os&quot; and &quot;-om&quot; (later &quot;-us&quot; and &quot;-um&quot;).

===Consonants===
:1 Intervocalic (pronounced ) was preserved up to 350 BC or so, at which point it changed into (rhotacism). This rhotacism had implications for declension: early classical Latin, &quot;honos&quot;, &quot;honoris&quot;; later Classical (by analogy) &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;honoris&quot; (&quot;honor&quot;). Some Old Latin texts preserve in this position, such as the Carmen Arvale&#x27;s &quot;lases&quot; for &quot;lares&quot;. Later instances of single between vowels are mostly due either to reduction of early after long vowels or diphthongs; borrowings; or late reconstructions.
:2 Might have been an sound instead, perhaps in free variation. Lloyd, Sturtevant, and Kent make this argument based on misspellings in early inscriptions, the fact that many instances of Latin descend from Proto-Indo-European *, and the outcomes of the sound in Romance (particularly in Spain).

There are many unreduced clusters, e.g. &quot;iouxmentom&quot; (later &quot;iūmentum&quot;, &quot;beast of burden&quot;); &quot;losna&quot; (later &quot;lūna&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;) &lt; *&quot;lousna&quot; &lt; */leuksnā/; &quot;cosmis&quot; (&gt; &quot;cōmis&quot;, &quot;courteous&quot;); &quot;stlocum&quot;, acc. (&gt; &quot;locum&quot;, &quot;place&quot;).

Early &quot;du&quot; becomes &quot;b&quot;: &quot;duenos&quot; &gt; &quot;duonos&quot; &gt; &quot;bonus&quot; &quot;good&quot;; &quot;duis&quot; &gt; &quot;bis&quot; &quot;twice&quot;; &quot;duellom&quot; &gt; &quot;bellum&quot; &quot;war&quot;.

Final occurred in ablatives, such as &quot;puellād&quot; &quot;from the girl&quot; or &quot;campōd&quot; &quot;from the field&quot;, later &quot;puellā&quot; and &quot;campō&quot;. In verb conjugation, the third-person ending -&quot;d&quot; later became -&quot;t&quot;, e.g. Old Latin &quot;faced&quot; &gt; Classical &quot;facit.&quot;

==Morphology==
===Nouns===
Latin nouns have grammatical case, with an ending, or suffix, showing its use in the sentence: subject, predicate, etc. A case for a given word is formed by suffixing a case ending to a part of the word common to all its cases called a stem. Stems are classified by their last letters as vowel or consonant. Vowel stems are formed by adding a suffix to a shorter and more ancient segment called a root. Consonant stems are the root (roots end in consonants). The combination of the last letter of the stem and the case ending often results in an ending also called a case ending or termination. For example, the stem &quot;puella-&quot; receives a case ending &quot;-m&quot; to form the accusative case &quot;puellam&quot; in which the termination &quot;-am&quot; is evident.

In Classical Latin textbooks the declensions are named from the letter ending the stem or First, Second, etc. to Fifth. A declension may be illustrated by a paradigm, or listing of all the cases of a typical word. This method is less often applied to Old Latin, and with less validity. In contrast to Classical Latin, Old Latin reflects the evolution of the language from an ancestor spoken in Latium. The endings are multiple. Their use depends on time and place. Any paradigm selected would be subject to these constraints and if applied to the language universally would give false constructs, hypothetical words not attested in the Old Latin corpus. Nevertheless, the endings are shown below by quasi-classical paradigms. Alternate endings from different stages of development are given, but they may not be attested for the word of the paradigm. For example, in the second declension, *&quot;campoe&quot; &quot;fields&quot; is unattested, but &quot;poploe&quot; &quot;peoples&quot; is attested.

The locative was a separate case in Old Latin but gradually became reduced in function, and the locative singular form eventually merged with the genitive singular by regular sound change. In the plural, the locative was captured by the ablative case in all Italic languages before Old Latin.

====First declension (a)====
The stems of nouns of this declension usually end in -ā and are typically feminine. A nominative case ending of -s in a few masculines indicates the nominative singular case ending may have been originally -s: &quot;paricidas&quot; for later &quot;parricida&quot;, but the -s tended to get lost. In the nominative plural, -ī replaced original -s as in the genitive singular.

In the genitive singular, the -s was replaced with -ī from the second declension, the resulting diphthong shortening to -ai subsequently becoming -ae. The original form is maintained in some formulas, e.g. &quot;pater familiās&quot;. The genitive plural ending -āsōm (classical -ārum following rhotacism), borrowed from the pronouns, began to overtake original -om.

In the dative singular the final i is either long or short. The ending becomes -ae, -a (Feronia) or -e (Fortune).

In the accusative singular, Latin regularly shortens a vowel before final m.

In the ablative singular, -d was regularly lost after a long vowel. In the dative and ablative plural, the -abos descending from Indo-European *-ābhos is used for feminines only (&quot;deabus&quot;). *-ais &gt; -eis &gt; -īs is adapted from -ois of the o-declension.

The vocative singular had inherited short -a. This later merged with the nominative singular when -ā was shortened to -ă.

The locative case would not apply to such a meaning as &quot;puella&quot;, so Roma, which is singular, and Syracusae, which is plural, have been substituted. The locative plural has already merged with the -eis form of the ablative.

====Second declension (o)====

The stems of the nouns of the o-declension end in ŏ deriving from the o-grade of Indo-European ablaut. Classical Latin evidences the development ŏ &gt; ŭ. Nouns of this declension are either masculine or neuter.

Nominative singulars ending in -ros or -ris syncopate the ending: *agros &gt; *agrs &gt; *agers &gt; *agerr &gt; &quot;ager&quot;. (The form &quot;terr&quot; &quot;three times&quot; for later &quot;ter&quot; &lt; *tris appears in Plautus.)

Many alternative spellings occur:
*As mentioned above, the sound change -ei &gt; -ẹ̄ &gt; -ī leads to many variations, including the reverse spelling &quot;ei&quot; for &quot;ī&quot;. This spelling eventually appears in the genitive singular as well, though &quot;-ī&quot; is earliest and the true ending; cf. &quot;populi Romanei&quot;, &quot;of the Roman , with both spellings in the same inscription.
*Likewise, the sound changes -os &gt; -us and -ōm &gt; -om &gt; -um affect the nominative and accusative singular, and the genitive plural.
*One very early text, the Lapis Satricanus, has genitive &quot;-osio&quot; (an ending found in several other archaic languages descended from Proto-Indo-European [PIE], languages such as Vedic Sanskrit, Old Persian, and Homeric Greek) rather than &quot;-ī&quot; (an ending appearing only in Italo-Celtic).. This form also appears in the closely related Faliscan language.
*In the genitive plural, &quot;-um&quot; (from PIE &quot;*-ōm&quot;) survived in classical Latin &quot;words for coins and measures&quot;; otherwise it was eventually replaced by &quot;-ōrum&quot; by analogy with 1st declension .
*The nominative/vocative plural masculine &quot;-ei&quot; comes from the PIE pronominal ending &quot;*-oi&quot;. The original ending &quot;-oi&quot; appears in a late spelling in the word &quot;poploe&quot; (i.e. &quot;poploi&quot; = &quot;populī&quot; &quot;people&quot;) in Sextus Pompeius Festus.
*The dative/ablative/locative plural &quot;-eis&quot; comes from earlier &quot;-ois&quot;, a merger of PIE instrumental plural &quot;*-ōis&quot; and locative plural &quot;*-oisu&quot;. The form &quot;-ois&quot; appears in Sextus Pompeius Festus and a few early inscriptions.
*The Praeneste Fibula has dative singular &quot;Numasiōi&quot;, representing PIE *-ōi.
*A number of &quot;provincial texts&quot; have nominative plural &quot;-eis&quot; (later &quot;-īs&quot; from 190 BC on), with an added &quot;s&quot;, by some sort of analogy with other declensions. Sihler (1995) notes that this form appears in literature only in pronouns and suggests that inscriptional examples added to nouns may be artificial (i.e. not reflecting actual pronunciation).
*In the vocative singular, some nouns lose the &quot;-e&quot; (i.e. have a zero ending) but not necessarily the same as in classical Latin. The &quot;-e&quot; alternates regularly with &quot;-us&quot;.

====Third declension (consonant/i)====
This declension contains nouns that are masculine, feminine, and neuter. The stem ends in the root consonant, except in the special case where it ends in -i (i-stem declension). The i-stem, which is a vowel-stem, partly fused with the consonant-stem in the pre-Latin period and went further in Old Latin. I/y and u/w can be treated as either consonants or vowels; hence they are semi-vowels. Mixed-stem declensions are partly like consonant-stem and partly like i-stem. Consonant-stem declensions vary slightly depending on which consonant is root-final: stop-, r-, n-, s-, etc. The paradigms below include a stop-stem (reg-) and an i-stem (igni-).

For a consonant declension, in the nominative singular, the -s was affixed directly to the stem consonant, but the combination of the two consonants produced modified nominatives over the Old Latin period. The case appears in different stages of modification in different words diachronically. The Latin neuter form (not shown) is the Indo-European nominative without stem ending; for example, cor &lt; *cord &quot;heart&quot;.

The genitive singular endings include &quot;-is &lt; -es&quot; and &quot;-us &lt; *-os&quot;. In the genitive plural, some forms appear to affix the case ending to the genitive singular rather than the stem: 

In the dative singular, -ī succeeded -eī and -ē after 200 BC.

In the accusative singular, -em &lt; *-ṃ after a consonant.

In the ablative singular, the -d was lost after 200 BC. In the dative and ablative plural, the early poets sometimes used -būs.

In the locative singular, the earliest form is like the dative but over the period assimilated to the ablative.

In the instrumental singular, the earliest form is an -e during its early days.

====Fourth declension (u)====
The stems of the nouns of the u-declension end in ŭ and are masculine, feminine and neuter. In addition there is a ū-stem declension, which contains only a few &quot;isolated&quot; words, such as &quot;sūs&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, and is not presented here.
====Fifth declension (e)====
The &#x27;e-stem&#x27; declension&#x27;s morphology matches the Classical language very nearly.


===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns are among the most common thing found in Old Latin inscriptions. In all three persons, the ablative singular ending is identical to the accusative singular. In Classical Latin, &quot;ego&quot; can be pronounced with both long and short final vowel, thus pointing at two versions of the pronoun possibly from Old Latin; the original form of the pronoun is reconstructed in Proto-Italic as &quot;*egō&quot;, with a long vowel.

===Relative pronoun===
In Old Latin, the relative pronoun is also another common concept, especially in inscriptions. The forms are quite inconsistent and leave much to be reconstructed by scholars.

===Verbs===

==== Old present and perfects====

There is little evidence of the inflection of Old Latin verb forms and the few surviving inscriptions hold many inconsistencies between forms. Therefore, the forms below are ones that are both proved by scholars through Old Latin inscriptions, and recreated by scholars based on other early Indo-European languages such as Greek and Italic dialects such as Oscan and Umbrian, and which also may be compared to modern Spanish.

==In popular fiction==
The Italian director Matteo Rovere has shot the 2019 film &quot;The First King: Birth of an Empire&quot; and the 2020–2022 TV series &quot;Romulus&quot; with dialog in a reconstructed version of Old Latin.
The linguists have had to make concessions for ease of filming and not going too much against the expectations of viewers.
For example, the character of the Lady of the Wolves is (an allusion to Homer&#x27;s ) since Latin did not have the desired nuances.
Before rhotacism, Old Latin had lots of sibilants, so some had to be substituted to ease the actors&#x27; work.

<doc id="430642" wikidata="Q5404780" url="?curid=430642" title="Eton Boating Song">
<text>The &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot; is the best known of the school songs associated with Eton College that are sung at the end-of-year concert and on other important occasions. It is also played during the procession of boats. The words of the song were written by William Johnson Cory, an influential master at the school. The melody was composed by an Old Etonian and former pupil of Cory, Captain Algernon Drummond, and transcribed by T. L. Mitchell-Innes. The piano accompaniment was written by Evelyn Wodehouse. It was first performed on 4 June, 1863. Ordinarily, only the first, sixth, seventh and eighth stanzas are sung. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot; is not the school song of Eton College, that being &quot;Carmen Etonense&quot;.

The song has been the subject of significant parody over the years, and numerous obscene versions exist, the most notable being &quot;The Sexual Life of the Camel&quot;.

==Cachet==
The traditional status of Eton as the training grounds for Britain&#x27;s wealthy elite endowed the song with a peculiar cultural cachet. For instance, in his autobiographical essay &quot;Such, Such Were the Joys&quot;, writer George Orwell – himself an Old Etonian – wrote that:

==Lyrics==
==Other uses==
The melody of the song was borrowed for the song &quot;Long Live Uncle Tony&quot; for St. Anthony Hall (an American fraternity also known as Delta Psi); the new lyrics were written by the famous travel lecturer and author John L. Stoddard (1850-1931).

In 1939, the tune (at a quicker than usual tempo) was used as the theme for the film &quot;A Yank at Eton&quot;. In 1962, the tune was adopted by Coventry City Football Club as their club anthem. The lyrics were rewritten by Jimmy Hill and club director John Camkin in order to be relevant to the club, which is still regularly sung by City fans even today. An instrumental big band version of the tune by Ted Heath &amp; His Music has been played regularly on the PA system at Coventry City&#x27;s home matches.

The song appears in the 1951 comedy film &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot;, sung by the schoolgirls during the school scene. It also features in the 1953 comedy film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; and the 1959 adventure film &quot;North West Frontier&quot;.

The &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot; features in the 1960s television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, in the episodes &quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

In the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; episode &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot;, Parker briefly sings part of the song as he prepares to go boating, before being called out on a mission by Lady Penelope.

The &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot; is briefly sung by the Earl of Gurney during his sanity examination in the play &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; and its 1972 film adaptation.

It is also played in 1972 comedy film &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; in the scene where Mr. Gort, dressed as a schoolboy, urges the bewildered title character to whip him.

The song is sung in the 1980 television drama &quot;Blade on the Feather&quot;, written by Dennis Potter and which took its title from one of the lines of the song.

A reworked version of the theme appeared as the title music for the satirical 1989 horror movie &quot;Society&quot;.

In his appearance on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Hugh Laurie - an Old Etonian - sang, with great embarrassment, the first verse of the &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot;; he also dryly commented on the homoeroticism that can be read into the phrase &#x27;With your bodies between your knees&#x27;.

In the second-to-final chapter of &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, Sir Miles Delacourt sings the song before he hangs himself from the aisles of Westminster Abbey.

During the 2010 British general election the song was parodied as &quot;The Eton Voting Song&quot;, with reference to the fact that David Cameron, Boris Johnson and other leading politicians went to Eton.

During the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, the &quot;Eton Boating Song&quot; was briefly played during the introductory film &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot;, charting the course of the River Thames, as it flows past Eton.

<text>The Indiana General Assembly is the state legislature, or legislative branch, of the U.S. state of Indiana. It is a bicameral legislature that consists of a lower house, the Indiana House of Representatives, and an upper house, the Indiana Senate. The General Assembly meets annually at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis.

Members of the General Assembly are elected from districts that are realigned every ten years. Representatives serve terms of two years and senators serve terms of four years. Both houses can create bills, but bills must pass both houses before they can be submitted to the governor and enacted into law.

As of 2024, the Republican Party holds supermajorities in both chambers of the General Assembly. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Senate by a 40–10 margin, and in the House of Representatives by a 70–30 margin.

==Structure==
The Indiana General Assembly is made up of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Indiana has a part-time legislature that does not meet year-round. The General Assembly convenes on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. During odd-numbered years the legislature meets for 61 days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by April 30. During even-numbered years the legislature meets for 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by March 15. The General Assembly may not adjourn for more than three days without a resolution approving adjournment being passed in both houses.
The governor has the authority to call on the General Assembly to convene a special session if legislators are unable to complete necessary work within the time allotted by the regular sessions. Special sessions of the General Assembly were rarely called in the state&#x27;s early history, but have become more commonplace in modern times.

The General Assembly delegates are elected from districts. Every ten years the districts are realigned by the General Assembly using information from the U.S. Census Bureau to ensure that each district is roughly equal in population. The districting is maintained to comply with the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;.

The Indiana Senate and House of Representatives each has several committees charged with overseeing certain areas of the state. Committees vary in size, from three to eleven members. The committees are chaired by senior members of the majority party. Senators and representatives can be members of multiple committees. Most legislation begins within the committees who have responsibility for the area that the bill will affect. Once approved by a committee, a bill can be entered into the agenda for debate and vote in the full chamber. Although not common, bills can be voted on by the full house without going through the committee process.

Indiana legislators make a base annual salary of $33,032, plus $196 for each day in session or at a committee hearing and $62 in expense pay every other day.

===Terms and qualifications===
Article 4, Section 7, of the Indiana Constitution states the qualifications to become a Senator or Representative. The candidate must have been a U.S. citizen for a minimum of two years prior to his candidacy and must have been resident of the district that he seeks to represent for one year. Senators must be at least twenty-five years of age and representatives must be twenty-one when sworn into office. The candidate cannot hold any other public office in the state or federal government during their term. The candidate must also be a registered voter within the district they seek to represent. Candidates are required to file papers stating their economic interests.

Article 4, Section 3, of the state constitution places several limitations on the size and composition of the General Assembly. The Senate can contain no more than fifty members, and the senators serve for a term of four years. The House of Representatives can contain no more than one hundred members, and the representatives serve terms of two years. There is no limit to how many terms a state senator or representative may serve.

===Checks and balances===
There are several checks and balances built into the state constitution that limit the power of the General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these checks and balances is the governor&#x27;s authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may, in turn, override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a supermajority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court&#x27;s decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor&#x27;s office. Although the governor&#x27;s office has gained more power since the 1970s, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.

===Powers===
The authority and powers of the Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. The General Assembly has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submit to the governor. Each law passed by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.

The General Assembly is empowered to regulate the state&#x27;s judiciary system by setting the size of the courts and the bounds of their districts. The body also has the authority to monitor the activities of the executive branch of the state government, has limited power to regulate the county governments within the state, and has sole power to initiate the process to amend the state constitution.

Under Indiana law, legislators cannot be arrested while the General Assembly is in session unless the crime they commit is treason, a felony, or breach of the peace.

===Indiana Senate===

The Indiana Senate consists of 50 members elected to four-year terms. Micah Beckwith, the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, presides over the Senate while it is in session and casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The Senate President Pro Tempore is Senator Rodric D. Bray of Martinsville. The 2025-26 Senate has a Republican super-majority, with Republicans holding 40 out of 50 seats. The Senate offices are located in the west wing of the second floor of the Indiana Statehouse, and the Senate chambers are on the west wing of the third floor.

===Indiana House of Representatives===

The Indiana House of Representatives consists of 100 members elected to two-year terms. The current Speaker of the House as of March 2020 is Representative Todd Huston. The House of Representatives has a Republican majority of 70 seats, while the Democrats have 30 seats. The House offices are located in the east wing of the second floor of the Indiana Statehouse and the House chambers are on the third floor.

==History==

===1816 Constitution===

Indiana&#x27;s first constitution was ratified on June 10, 1816, and the election of the first General Assembly took place on August 5 of that year. They convened in the original three-room statehouse located in Corydon. The body consisted of ten senators and twenty-nine representatives, sixteen of whom had been signers of the Indiana state constitution. There, the General Assembly began its development into the institution it is today. The original constitution provided that representatives served terms of one year and senators served terms of three years, and permitted an annual meeting of the assembly from December until March.

At first, there was only one political party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.

In its first two decades, the General Assembly laid the foundation of the state. They created the framework for the state&#x27;s public school system, began construction on the State Seminary and of roads in the southern part of the state. Initially, the General Assembly was faced with low tax revenues. In response to the problem, they created the Bank of Indiana and sold of public lands to finance their projects. The General Assembly relocated the capital to Indianapolis in 1824, and in 1831 they authorized the construction of the first dedicated statehouse.

In the 1830s, the Whigs split from the Democratic-Republicans in response to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, the remnants of the old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and swept into power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion to modernize the state&#x27;s infrastructure. The wilderness of northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, and half of their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig&#x27;s loss of power.

The state constitution had come under considerable criticism beginning in the 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until the advent of the state&#x27;s political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues was not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before being allowed to legally remarry.

===1851 Constitution===
In 1851, a new state constitution was created and ratified. Among the constitution&#x27;s new clauses was an extension of the terms of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The new constitution delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. The new constitution also placed new limits on the General Assembly&#x27;s power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state-level laws that were only applied to one town or county.

The new constitution led to the gradual erosion of the Democratic majority. In 1854, the Republican Party was established and drew in many of the former Whigs. That year the General Assembly was split with no party attaining a majority. The Democrats held the largest number of seats, but the Whigs and Republicans caucused to form a majority and control the assembly. The result was a deadlock on most issues because Republicans and Whigs could not agree on most major issues. By 1858, the Whigs were almost completely disempowered and the Republicans gained enough seats to become the largest party, but not enough to form a majority on their own. That year Governor Ashbel P. Willard called the first special session of the General Assembly because they had been unable to pass an appropriations bill. Democrats regained a small majority by gaining the votes of the disaffected Whigs in the 1860 election.

During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the legislature was the scene of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state&#x27;s funding problems.

During the 1880s and 1890s, Indiana industry began to grow rapidly because of the Indiana Gas Boom, leading to the creation of many labor unions and a return to Democratic control of the General Assembly. One of the events to occur during the period was the Black Day of the General Assembly, a situation arising from Governor Isaac P. Gray&#x27;s desire to be elected to the United States Senate. Beginning with the state senate&#x27;s refusal to seat a new lieutenant governor, fighting broke out in the chamber and spread throughout the statehouse. Shots were fired, and Democrats and Republicans threatened to kill each other before police could bring the situation under control. A second bout of violence broke out in the 1894 regular session when Republicans locked the doors of the House chambers preventing Governor Claude Matthews from delivering a veto of a bill that repealed over a decade of Democratic legislation. The governor personally led fellow party members in beating down the door and unsuccessfully attempting to fight their way to the podium to deliver the vetoed bill; one newspaper said Democrats and Republicans &quot;fought like beasts of the forest.&quot; During those decades, the General Assembly enacted a series of laws to protect the rights of workers and encourage more industrial growth. The women&#x27;s suffrage movement also began in the state and rallies were held in Indianapolis to support the female suffrage legislation that was ultimately voted down in the General Assembly.

During 1907, the General Assembly made Indiana the first state to enact eugenics legislation, and the law remained in effect until 1921. The law led to the forced sterilization of thousands of criminals until it was ruled unconstitutional by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1921.

In 1921, Julia Nelson was the first woman elected to the Indiana General Assembly.

Scandal erupted in 1925 when it was discovered that the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan controlled over half the seats in the General Assembly. During the session, Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson boasted &quot;I am the law in Indiana&quot;. During the next two years, the federal government intervened, Stephenson was convicted of murder. After the governor refused to pardon him, Stephenson indicted his co-conspirators, leading to many of the state government being charged with various crimes and removing much of the Klan&#x27;s power.

In the 1930s, the General Assembly established the state&#x27;s first general welfare programs to help the poor affected by the Great Depression. The General Assembly passed the nation&#x27;s first DUI laws in 1939, establishing a blood alcohol level of .15 as the legal limit. The 1940s led to the first African American being elected to the Indiana Senate and legislation that desegregated the public schools in 1949.

The General Assembly established the state&#x27;s first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The revenues from the tax led to a host of new projects across the state. The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.

During the 1988 session, the Indiana House of Representatives was split evenly between both parties for the first time in Indiana&#x27;s history. After a period of negotiations, both parties agreed to share majority powers, alternating which party controlled the position of speaker each day. The same General Assembly legalized horse racing in the state in 1989.

Governor Evan Bayh called a special session of the General Assembly in 1992 because no budget had been passed in the regular session. During the special session, the General Assembly passed the budget and also legalized the operation of riverboat casinos in the state, overriding the governor&#x27;s veto to prevent it.

The General Assembly passed property tax reform legislation in 2008, capping property taxes at one percent, making Indiana one of the lowest property tax locations in the nation.

<text>Larissa, also known as Neptune VII, is the fifth-closest inner satellite of Neptune. It is named after Larissa, a lover of Poseidon (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Neptune).

Larissa is also the eponymous nymph of the city in Thessaly, Greece.
== Discovery ==

Larissa was first discovered by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen, based on fortuitous ground-based stellar occultation observations on May 24, 1981. It was given the temporary provisional designation S/1981 N 1 and its supposed existence was announced on May 29, 1981. The moon was later recovered and confirmed to be the only object in its orbit during the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby in 1989 after which it received the additional designation S/1989 N 2 on August 2, 1989. The announcement by Stephen P. Synnott spoke of &quot;10 frames taken over 5 days&quot;, which gives a recovery date sometime before July 28. The name was given and then confirmed by the International Astronomical Union on September 16, 1991.

== Characteristics ==
Larissa is the fourth-largest satellite of Neptune. It is irregular (non-spherical) in shape and appears to be heavily cratered, with no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that Larissa, like the other satellites inward of Triton, is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune&#x27;s original satellites, which were disrupted by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon&#x27;s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.

Larissa&#x27;s orbit is nearly circular and lies below Neptune&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius, which means it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune&#x27;s atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching, similarly to how Triton will eventually collide with Neptune or break into a planetary ring.

Compositionally, Larissa appears to be similar to other small inner Neptunian satellites, with a deep 3.0 micron feature attributed to water ice or hydrated silicate minerals. It has a 0.08 albedo at 1.4 and 2.0 microns, dropping to 0.03 at 3.0 microns, and increasing to 0.09 at 4.6 microns.

==Exploration==

Larissa has only been visited once by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The probe was able to get some photographs with details of Larissa, showing its cratered surface; unlike the other inner moons of Neptune that only appeared as dots or smudges.

== Notes ==

&lt;/math&gt;

<doc id="430680" wikidata="Q840594" url="?curid=430680" title="Motive (algebraic geometry)">
<text>In algebraic geometry, motives (or sometimes motifs, following French usage) is a theory proposed by Alexander Grothendieck in the 1960s to unify the vast array of similarly behaved cohomology theories such as singular cohomology, de Rham cohomology, etale cohomology, and crystalline cohomology. Philosophically, a &quot;motif&quot; is the &quot;cohomology essence&quot; of a variety.

In the formulation of Grothendieck for smooth projective varieties, a motive is a triple formula_1, where formula_2 is a smooth projective variety, formula_3 is an idempotent correspondence, and &quot;m&quot; an integer; however, such a triple contains almost no information outside the context of Grothendieck&#x27;s category of pure motives, where a morphism from formula_1 to formula_5 is given by a correspondence of degree formula_6. A more object-focused approach is taken by Pierre Deligne in &quot;Le Groupe Fondamental de la Droite Projective Moins Trois Points&quot;. In that article, a motive is a &quot;system of realisations&quot; – that is, a tuple

:formula_7

consisting of modules

:formula_8

over the rings

:formula_9

respectively, various comparison isomorphisms

:formula_10

between the obvious base changes of these modules, filtrations formula_11, a action formula_12 of the absolute Galois group formula_13 on formula_14 and a &quot;Frobenius&quot; automorphism formula_15 of formula_16. This data is modeled on the cohomologies of a smooth projective formula_17-variety and the structures and compatibilities they admit, and gives an idea about what kind of information is contained in a motive.

== Introduction ==
The theory of motives was originally conjectured as an attempt to unify a rapidly multiplying array of cohomology theories, including Betti cohomology, de Rham cohomology, &quot;l&quot;-adic cohomology, and crystalline cohomology. The general hope is that equations like
* [projective line] = [line] + [point]
* [projective plane] = [plane] + [line] + [point]
can be put on increasingly solid mathematical footing with a deep meaning. Of course, the above equations are already known to be true in many senses, such as in the sense of CW-complex where &quot;+&quot; corresponds to attaching cells, and in the sense of various cohomology theories, where &quot;+&quot; corresponds to the direct sum.

From another viewpoint, motives continue the sequence of generalizations from rational functions on varieties to divisors on varieties to Chow groups of varieties. The generalization happens in more than one direction, since motives can be considered with respect to more types of equivalence than rational equivalence. The admissible equivalences are given by the definition of an adequate equivalence relation.

== Definition of pure motives ==
The category of pure motives often proceeds in three steps. Below we describe the case of Chow motives formula_18, where &quot;k&quot; is any field.

=== First step: category of (degree 0) correspondences, Corr(&quot;k&quot;) ===
The objects of formula_19 are simply smooth projective varieties over &quot;k&quot;. The morphisms are correspondences. They generalize morphisms of varieties formula_20, which can be associated with their graphs in formula_21, to fixed dimensional Chow cycles on formula_21.

It will be useful to describe correspondences of arbitrary degree, although morphisms in formula_19 are correspondences of degree 0. In detail, let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be smooth projective varieties and consider a decomposition of &quot;X&quot; into connected components:

:formula_24

If formula_25, then the correspondences of degree &quot;r&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; are

:formula_26

where formula_27 denotes the Chow-cycles of codimension &quot;k&quot;. Correspondences are often denoted using the &quot;⊢&quot;-notation, e.g., formula_28. For any formula_29 and formula_30 their composition is defined by

:formula_31

where the dot denotes the product in the Chow ring (i.e., intersection).

Returning to constructing the category formula_32 notice that the composition of degree 0 correspondences is degree 0. Hence we define morphisms of formula_19 to be degree 0 correspondences.

The following association is a functor (here formula_34 denotes the graph of formula_35):

:formula_36

Just like formula_37 the category formula_19 has direct sums () and tensor products (). It is a preadditive category. The sum of morphisms is defined by

:formula_39

=== Second step: category of pure effective Chow motives, Choweff(&quot;k&quot;)===

The transition to motives is made by taking the pseudo-abelian envelope of formula_19:

:formula_41.

In other words, effective Chow motives are pairs of smooth projective varieties &quot;X&quot; and &quot;idempotent&quot; correspondences α: &quot;X&quot; ⊢ &quot;X&quot;, and morphisms are of a certain type of correspondence:

:formula_42
:formula_43

Composition is the above defined composition of correspondences, and the identity morphism of (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;α&quot;) is defined to be &quot;α&quot; : &quot;X&quot; ⊢ &quot;X&quot;.

The association,

:formula_44,

where Δ&quot;X&quot; := [&quot;idX&quot;] denotes the diagonal of &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot;, is a functor. The motive [&quot;X&quot;] is often called the &quot;motive associated to the variety&quot; X.

As intended, Choweff(&quot;k&quot;) is a pseudo-abelian category. The direct sum of effective motives is given by

:formula_45

The tensor product of effective motives is defined by

:formula_46

where

:formula_47

The tensor product of morphisms may also be defined. Let &quot;f&quot;1 : (&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;α&quot;1) → (&quot;Y&quot;1, &quot;β&quot;1) and &quot;f&quot;2 : (&quot;X&quot;2, &quot;α&quot;2) → (&quot;Y&quot;2, &quot;β&quot;2) be morphisms of motives. Then let &quot;γ&quot;1 ∈ &quot;A&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1 × &quot;Y&quot;1) and &quot;γ&quot;2 ∈ &quot;A&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2 × &quot;Y&quot;2) be representatives of &quot;f1&quot; and &quot;f2&quot;. Then

:formula_48,

where &quot;πi&quot; : &quot;X&quot;1 × &quot;X&quot;2 × &quot;Y&quot;1 × &quot;Y&quot;2 → &quot;Xi&quot; × &quot;Yi&quot; are the projections.

=== Third step: category of pure Chow motives, Chow(&quot;k&quot;) ===
To proceed to motives, we adjoin to Choweff(&quot;k&quot;) a formal inverse (with respect to the tensor product) of a motive called the Lefschetz motive. The effect is that motives become triples instead of pairs. The Lefschetz motive &quot;L&quot; is

:formula_49.

If we define the motive 1, called the &quot;trivial Tate motive&quot;, by 1 := h(Spec(&quot;k&quot;)), then the elegant equation

:formula_50

holds, since

:formula_51

The tensor inverse of the Lefschetz motive is known as the &quot;Tate motive&quot;, &quot;T&quot; := &quot;L&quot;−1. Then we define the category of pure Chow motives by

:formula_52.

A motive is then a triple

:formula_53

such that morphisms are given by correspondences

:formula_54

and the composition of morphisms comes from composition of correspondences.

As intended, formula_18 is a rigid pseudo-abelian category.

=== Other types of motives ===
In order to define an intersection product, cycles must be &quot;movable&quot; so we can intersect them in general position. Choosing a suitable equivalence relation on cycles will guarantee that every pair of cycles has an equivalent pair in general position that we can intersect. The Chow groups are defined using rational equivalence, but other equivalences are possible, and each defines a different sort of motive. Examples of equivalences, from strongest to weakest, are
* Rational equivalence
* Algebraic equivalence
* Smash-nilpotence equivalence (sometimes called Voevodsky equivalence)
* Homological equivalence (in the sense of Weil cohomology)
* Numerical equivalence
The literature occasionally calls every type of pure motive a Chow motive, in which case a motive with respect to algebraic equivalence would be called a &quot;Chow motive modulo algebraic equivalence&quot;.

== Mixed motives ==
For a fixed base field &quot;k&quot;, the category of mixed motives is a conjectural abelian tensor category formula_56, together with a contravariant functor

:formula_57

taking values on all varieties (not just smooth projective ones as it was the case with pure motives). This should be such that motivic cohomology defined by

:formula_58

coincides with the one predicted by algebraic K-theory, and contains the category of Chow motives in a suitable sense (and other properties). The existence of such a category was conjectured by Alexander Beilinson.

Instead of constructing such a category, it was proposed by Deligne to first construct a category &quot;DM&quot; having the properties one expects for the derived category

:formula_59.

Getting &quot;MM&quot; back from &quot;DM&quot; would then be accomplished by a (conjectural) &quot;motivic t-structure&quot;.

The current state of the theory is that we do have a suitable category &quot;DM&quot;. Already this category is useful in applications. Vladimir Voevodsky&#x27;s Fields Medal-winning proof of the Milnor conjecture uses these motives as a key ingredient.

There are different definitions due to Hanamura, Levine and Voevodsky. They are known to be equivalent in most cases and we will give Voevodsky&#x27;s definition below. The category contains Chow motives as a full subcategory and gives the &quot;right&quot; motivic cohomology. However, Voevodsky also shows that (with integral coefficients) it does not admit a motivic t-structure.

=== Geometric mixed motives ===

==== Notation ====
Here we will fix a field of characteristic and let formula_60 be our coefficient ring. Set formula_61 as the category of quasi-projective varieties over are separated schemes of finite type. We will also let formula_62 be the subcategory of smooth varieties.

==== Smooth varieties with correspondences ====
Given a smooth variety and a variety call an integral closed subscheme formula_63 which is finite over and surjective over a component of a prime correspondence from to . Then, we can take the set of prime correspondences from to and construct a free -module formula_64. Its elements are called finite correspondences. Then, we can form an additive category formula_65 whose objects are smooth varieties and morphisms are given by smooth correspondences. The only non-trivial part of this &quot;definition&quot; is the fact that we need to describe compositions. These are given by a push-pull formula from the theory of Chow rings.

===== Examples of correspondences =====
Typical examples of prime correspondences come from the graph formula_66 of a morphism of varieties formula_67.

==== Localizing the homotopy category ====
From here we can form the homotopy category formula_68 of bounded complexes of smooth correspondences. Here smooth varieties will be denoted formula_69. If we localize this category with respect to the smallest thick subcategory (meaning it is closed under extensions) containing morphisms

:formula_70

and

:formula_71

then we can form the triangulated category of effective geometric motives formula_72 Note that the first class of morphisms are localizing formula_73-homotopies of varieties while the second will give the category of geometric mixed motives the Mayer–Vietoris sequence.

Also, note that this category has a tensor structure given by the product of varieties, so formula_74.

==== Inverting the Tate motive ====
Using the triangulated structure we can construct a triangle

:formula_75

from the canonical map formula_76. We will set formula_77 and call it the Tate motive. Taking the iterative tensor product lets us construct formula_78. If we have an effective geometric motive we let formula_79 denote formula_80 Moreover, this behaves functorially and forms a triangulated functor. Finally, we can define the category of geometric mixed motives formula_81 as the category of pairs formula_82 for an effective geometric mixed motive and an integer representing the twist by the Tate motive. The hom-groups are then the colimit

:formula_83

== Examples of motives ==

=== Tate motives ===
There are several elementary examples of motives which are readily accessible. One of them being the Tate motives, denoted formula_84, formula_85, or formula_86, depending on the coefficients used in the construction of the category of motives. These are fundamental building blocks in the category of motives because they form the &quot;other part&quot; besides Abelian varieties.

=== Motives of curves ===

The motive of a curve can be explicitly understood with relative ease: their Chow ring is justformula_87for any smooth projective curve formula_88, hence Jacobians embed into the category of motives.

==Explanation for non-specialists==
A commonly applied technique in mathematics is to study objects carrying a particular structure by introducing a category whose morphisms preserve this structure. Then one may ask when two given objects are isomorphic, and ask for a &quot;particularly nice&quot; representative in each isomorphism class. The classification of algebraic varieties, i.e. application of this idea in the case of algebraic varieties, is very difficult due to the highly non-linear structure of the objects. The relaxed question of studying varieties up to birational isomorphism has led to the field of birational geometry. Another way to handle the question is to attach to a given variety &quot;X&quot; an object of more linear nature, i.e. an object amenable to the techniques of linear algebra, for example a vector space. This &quot;linearization&quot; goes usually under the name of &quot;cohomology&quot;.

There are several important cohomology theories, which reflect different structural aspects of varieties. The (partly conjectural) theory of motives is an attempt to find a universal way to linearize algebraic varieties, i.e. motives are supposed to provide a cohomology theory that embodies all these particular cohomologies. For example, the genus of a smooth projective curve &quot;C&quot; which is an interesting invariant of the curve, is an integer, which can be read off the dimension of the first Betti cohomology group of &quot;C&quot;. So, the motive of the curve should contain the genus information. Of course, the genus is a rather coarse invariant, so the motive of &quot;C&quot; is more than just this number.

== The search for a universal cohomology ==
Each algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; has a corresponding motive [&quot;X&quot;], so the simplest examples of motives are:

* [point]
* [projective line] = [point] + [line]
* [projective plane] = [plane] + [line] + [point]

These &#x27;equations&#x27; hold in many situations, namely for de Rham cohomology and Betti cohomology, &quot;l&quot;-adic cohomology, the number of points over any finite field, and in multiplicative notation for local zeta-functions.

The general idea is that one motive has the same structure in any reasonable cohomology theory with good formal properties; in particular, any Weil cohomology theory will have such properties. There are different Weil cohomology theories, they apply in different situations and have values in different categories, and reflect different structural aspects of the variety in question:

* Betti cohomology is defined for varieties over (subfields of) the complex numbers, it has the advantage of being defined over the integers and is a topological invariant
* de Rham cohomology (for varieties over formula_89) comes with a mixed Hodge structure, it is a differential-geometric invariant
* &quot;l&quot;-adic cohomology (over any field of characteristic ≠ l) has a canonical Galois group action, i.e. has values in representations of the (absolute) Galois group
* crystalline cohomology

All these cohomology theories share common properties, e.g. existence of Mayer-Vietoris sequences, homotopy invariance formula_90 the product of &quot;X&quot; with the affine line) and others. Moreover, they are linked by comparison isomorphisms, for example Betti cohomology formula_91 of a smooth variety &quot;X&quot; over formula_89 with finite coefficients is isomorphic to &quot;l&quot;-adic cohomology with finite coefficients.

The theory of motives is an attempt to find a universal theory which embodies all these particular cohomologies and their structures and provides a framework for &quot;equations&quot; like

:[projective line] = [line]+[point].

In particular, calculating the motive of any variety &quot;X&quot; directly gives all the information about the several Weil cohomology theories &quot;H&quot;Betti(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;H&quot;DR(&quot;X&quot;) etc.

Beginning with Grothendieck, people have tried to precisely define this theory for many years.

=== Motivic cohomology ===
&quot;Motivic cohomology&quot; itself had been invented before the creation of mixed motives by means of algebraic K-theory. The above category provides a neat way to (re)define it by

:formula_93

where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are integers and formula_94 is the &quot;m&quot;-th tensor power of the Tate object formula_95 which in Voevodsky&#x27;s setting is the complex formula_96 shifted by –2, and &quot;[n]&quot; means the usual shift in the triangulated category.

== Conjectures related to motives ==
The standard conjectures were first formulated in terms of the interplay of algebraic cycles and Weil cohomology theories. The category of pure motives provides a categorical framework for these conjectures.

The standard conjectures are commonly considered to be very hard and are open in the general case. Grothendieck, with Bombieri, showed the depth of the motivic approach by producing a conditional (very short and elegant) proof of the Weil conjectures (which are proven by different means by Deligne), assuming the standard conjectures to hold.

For example, the &quot;Künneth standard conjecture&quot;, which states the existence of algebraic cycles &quot;πi&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; inducing the canonical projectors &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) → &quot;Hi&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ↣ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) (for any Weil cohomology &quot;H&quot;) implies that every pure motive &quot;M&quot; decomposes in graded pieces of weight &quot;n&quot;: &quot;M&quot; = ⨁&quot;GrnM&quot;. The terminology &quot;weights&quot; comes from a similar decomposition of, say, de-Rham cohomology of smooth projective varieties, see Hodge theory.

&quot;Conjecture D&quot;, stating the concordance of numerical and homological equivalence, implies the equivalence of pure motives with respect to homological and numerical equivalence. (In particular the former category of motives would not depend on the choice of the Weil cohomology theory). Jannsen (1992) proved the following unconditional result: the category of (pure) motives over a field is abelian and semisimple if and only if the chosen equivalence relation is numerical equivalence.

The Hodge conjecture, may be neatly reformulated using motives: it holds iff the &quot;Hodge realization&quot; mapping any pure motive with rational coefficients (over a subfield formula_97 of formula_89) to its Hodge structure is a full functor formula_99 (rational Hodge structures). Here pure motive means pure motive with respect to homological equivalence.

Similarly, the Tate conjecture is equivalent to: the so-called Tate realization, i.e. ℓ-adic cohomology, is a full functor formula_100 (pure motives up to homological equivalence, continuous representations of the absolute Galois group of the base field &quot;k&quot;), which takes values in semi-simple representations. (The latter part is automatic in the case of the Hodge analogue).

==Tannakian formalism and motivic Galois group==
To motivate the (conjectural) motivic Galois group, fix a field &quot;k&quot; and consider the functor

:finite separable extensions &quot;K&quot; of &quot;k&quot; → non-empty finite sets with a (continuous) transitive action of the absolute Galois group of &quot;k&quot;

which maps &quot;K&quot; to the (finite) set of embeddings of &quot;K&quot; into an algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;. In Galois theory this functor is shown to be an equivalence of categories. Notice that fields are 0-dimensional. Motives of this kind are called &quot;Artin motives&quot;. By formula_17-linearizing the above objects, another way of expressing the above is to say that Artin motives are equivalent to finite formula_17-vector spaces together with an action of the Galois group.

The objective of the motivic Galois group is to extend the above equivalence to higher-dimensional varieties. In order to do this, the technical machinery of Tannakian category theory (going back to Tannaka–Krein duality, but a purely algebraic theory) is used. Its purpose is to shed light on both the Hodge conjecture and the Tate conjecture, the outstanding questions in algebraic cycle theory. Fix a Weil cohomology theory &quot;H&quot;. It gives a functor from &quot;Mnum&quot; (pure motives using numerical equivalence) to finite-dimensional formula_17-vector spaces. It can be shown that the former category is a Tannakian category. Assuming the equivalence of homological and numerical equivalence, i.e. the above standard conjecture &quot;D&quot;, the functor &quot;H&quot; is an exact faithful tensor-functor. Applying the Tannakian formalism, one concludes that &quot;Mnum&quot; is equivalent to the category of representations of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, known as the motivic Galois group.

The motivic Galois group is to the theory of motives what the Mumford–Tate group is to Hodge theory. Again speaking in rough terms, the Hodge and Tate conjectures are types of invariant theory (the spaces that are morally the algebraic cycles are picked out by invariance under a group, if one sets up the correct definitions). The motivic Galois group has the surrounding representation theory. (What it is not, is a Galois group; however in terms of the Tate conjecture and Galois representations on étale cohomology, it predicts the image of the Galois group, or, more accurately, its Lie algebra.)

<text>André Caplet (23 November 1878 – 22 April 1925) was a French composer and conductor of classical music. He was a friend of Claude Debussy and completed the orchestration of several of Debussy&#x27;s compositions as well as arrangements of several of them for different instruments.

==Early life==
André Caplet was born in Le Havre on 23 November 1878, the youngest of seven children born to a Norman family of modest means. He began studying piano and violin when a child and by the age of 13 performed in the orchestra of the Grand Théâtre there. He entered the Paris Conservatory in 1896 and won several prizes. While a student he supported himself first by playing in dance orchestras in the evening and then by conducting, where had immediate success. After a stint as assistant conductor of the Orchestre Colonne, in 1899 he took over the musical direction at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon. Some of his student compositions were published as early as 1897. The Société des compositeurs de musique (SCM), the less avant-garde of French organizations promoting new music, awarded his quintet for piano and winds first prize in 1901 and premiered it on 28 February of that year. Caplet soon had success with the more progressive Société nationale de musique (SCM) as well, including a concert dedicated to his work on 9 March 1901, and he was hailed in the musical press and from these performances until the end of his career his chamber works had a champion in the flutist Georges Barrère.

He won the Prix de Rome in 1901, composing in a conventional style to please the judges, while Maurice Ravel showed his contempt for the assigned text. Caplet&#x27;s native city celebrated his participation with a performance of his &quot;Été&quot; for chorus and orchestra (1899) on 3 April 1901 and marked his victory by presenting several of his works at a concert on 24 November, including &quot;L&#x27;Été&quot;, &quot;Pâques citadines&quot; for chorus and orchestra, &quot;Feuillets d&#x27;album&quot; for flute and piano (1901), and the cantata that won him the Prix de Rome, &quot;Myrrha&quot; (1901). 

Until the end of 1905, Caplet lived at the French Academy in Rome with the financial support the prize provided, though he took leave for long periods to attend performances in Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg.

==Pre-war career==
As a composer Caplet wrote many vocal works and chamber pieces, several works for orchestra and only a handful of piano pieces. Especially interesting is his instrumental use of voices, as in his &quot;Septuor à cordes vocales et instrumentales&quot; (1909). He was also one the composers who first incorporated the saxophone into his chamber works, like &quot;Légende&quot; (1903) and &quot;Impressions d’automne&quot; (1905).

Caplet served as one of the conductors of the Boston Opera Company for four seasons, from 1910 to 1914, specializing in the French repertoire. He secured the appointment through one of its co-founders, the impresario Henry Russell, whose wife Nina became a friend of Caplet during his time in Rome. He accepted the position to enhance his reputation as a conductor and used it to introduce contemporary French repertoire to the United States. Works by Debussy that he led include &quot;L&#x27;enfant prodigue&quot;, the &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, and the incidental music to &quot;Le Martyre de saint Sébastien&quot;.

==World War I==
At the end of 1914, after he had completed two movements of a work that became &quot;Les Prières&quot;, Caplet enlisted in the French army and saw combat in the trenches at Verdun. He was wounded in May 1915 and later promoted to sergeant. In 1917 he completed the third movement and the work premiered that same year in the small church of Ham, Picardy, accompanied by the distant sounds of artillery. His service ended in 1919. On 4 June of that year he married Geneviève Perruchon, a general&#x27;s daughter who followed his work as a composer closely. They had a son in 1920.

In 1918–19, he taught conducting, harmony, and orchestration at the music school established by Walter Damrosch at the behest of U.S. General John J. Pershing in Chaumont to train U.S. military personnel in hopes of creating military bands on the model of those found in France.

==Post-war years==
Caplet did not return to teaching and conducting at the war&#x27;s end. Instead he devoted himself to composition, including a number of religious works. His &quot;Messe à trois voix&quot; for a capella female chorus had its premiere in Sainte Chapelle on 13 June 1922. It lacks the traditional &quot;Credo&quot; and includes the familiar Communion motet &quot;O salutaris hostia&quot;.

His oratorio-like &quot;Le Miroir de Jésus&quot; composed in September 1923 features a &quot;choeur de femmes&quot; in an supporting role. In &quot;Miroir&quot; Caplet set texts by Henri Ghéon as meditations on the fifteen decades of the rosary. The chorus announces each section&#x27;s title but the female soloist delivers most of the text. The music of the central movements that take Christ&#x27;s passion as their subject are, according to one commentator, &quot;remarkable for its restraint as for its dissonance&quot;. It was a religious concert work of a sort not encountered again until Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Trois petites liturgies&quot; (1944). The British music critic Felix Aprahamian wrote that the musical textures of this work &quot;reflect at once the polychrome tones and timbres of Debussy&#x27;s art and the fourths, fifths, discant and parallel motion of the &quot;ars antiqua&quot;&quot;. Caplet conducted its premiere in February 1924 in Lyon and its Paris premiere on 1 May of that year.

==Work with Debussy==
He became a close friend of Claude Debussy, sometimes serving as translator, and he orchestrated an wrote parts of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Le Martyre de saint Sébastien&quot;. He also collaborated with Debussy in the orchestration of &quot;La boîte à joujoux&quot;. In 1911, Caplet prepared an orchestration of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, which, along with his orchestration of &quot;Clair de lune&quot; from the &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; is probably the most widely performed and recorded example of his work. 

While Debussy was traveling Europe seeking commissions, Caplet, the Angel of Corrections, a title that was given by Debussy, would complete orchestrations, make arrangements, and correct proofs. Debussy would write many letters of correspondence to Caplet in relation to his work on musical adaptations of The Fall of the House of Usher and The Devil in the Belfry complaining about Debussy&#x27;s inability to properly compose new music.

==Death==
In 1925, Caplet caught a cold and, given how his lungs had been weakened when he was gassed during his military service, developed pleurisy, which proved fatal. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Hauts-de-Seine), a suburb of Paris, on 22 April 1925 at the age of 46. He was buried in Montmartre Cemetery.

His widow conducted many concerts of his music.

In 1926, the sculptor Jacques Zwobada, a native of Neuilly, was commissioned to create a monument to Caplet. This was one of Zwobada&#x27;s earliest works after he graduated from the École des Beaux-Arts.

<text>Toormakeady or Tourmakeady (, the official name) is a Gaeltacht in south County Mayo in the west of Ireland. It is located between the shores of Lough Mask and the Partry Mountains, and covers . As at the time of the 2011 census, Toormakeady had a total population of 1,007, having dropped from 1,150 in 1991. Toormakeady is also the name of the principal village in the area.

Those parts of Ballinchalla Electoral District in Toormakeady and the whole of the Owenbrin Electoral District in Toormakeady together comprise nearly half of the land area of Toormakeady and were previously parts of County Galway. In 1898 they were transferred to County Mayo.

From the time of the Great Famine of the mid-1840s onwards, the Toormakeady area has experienced a high level of emigration. Many descendants of emigrants return every year to find their roots. The genealogical records for this area have been computerised at the South Mayo Family Research Centre in nearby Ballinrobe to make the task of tracing roots easier.

On 3 May 1921, during the Irish War of Independence the Irish Republican Army south Mayo flying column of around 30 men together with a small number of men from east Mayo mounted an ambush at Toormakeady. The events of this day have been written about in Donal Buckley&#x27;s book &quot;The Battle of Tourmakeady&quot;.

The English actor Robert Shaw, best known for his work in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot;, lived in Drimbawn House, Toormakeady until his death in 1978. Television producer Máire Ní Thuathail was born in Toormakeady in 1959.

The local sport clubs in Toormakeady include, CLG Thuar Mhic Éadaigh and Partry Athletic Football Club.

<text>The Sotho (), also known as the Basotho (), are a Sotho-Tswana ethnic group who have long inhabited Southern Africa. They primarily inhabit the regions of Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia

The ancestors of the Sotho people are believed to have originated from Northeast Africa, and migrated south in the fifth century CE. The Sotho people have split into different clans over time as a result of the Mfecane (a series of wars and migrations that took place in the 19th century) and colonialism. There are 3 types of Basotho, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Tswana people

The British and the Boers (Dutch descendants) divided Sotho land amongst themselves in the late 19th century. Lesotho was created by the settlers in the 1869 Convention of Aliwal North following the conflict over land with Moshoeshoe I, the king of the Southern Sothos.

The Southern Sotho of Lesotho&#x27;s identity emerged from the creation of Lesotho by the British after the Boers defeated Moshoeshoe I in the Third Basotho War in 1868 and he asked the British for protection. Some of the Southern Sotho speakers who were not part of Moshoeshoe&#x27;s kingdom when he united some of their tribesmen are living in Gauteng, while some are found in the west of KwaZulu-Natal, the north of the Eastern Cape and most of the Free State province.

In modern times, the Sotho continue to make significant contributions to South African and Lesotho societies.

== History ==

===Early history===

The Basotho nation is a mixture of Bantu-speaking clans that mixed with San people who already lived in Southern Africa when they arrived there. Bantu-speaking people had settled in what is now South Africa by about 1500 AD. Separation from the Batswana is assumed to have taken place by the 14th century. Some Basotho people split from the Nguni while others got assimilated into building the Nguni nation. By the 16th century, Iron-working was well established in Basotho communities alongside their Nguni neighbours. Basotho were mostly independent and relatively isolated up until this point in which they occasionally traded with the regions north of their homeland with external links that are described as &quot;Sporadic and Marginal&quot;. By at least the 17th century a series of Basotho kingdoms covered the southern portion of the African plateau (nowadays Free State Province and parts of Gauteng), North West. Basotho society was highly decentralized, and organized on the basis of kraals, or extended clans, each of which was ruled by its own chief. Chiefdoms were united into loose confederations.

===19th century===
In the 1820s, refugees from the Zulu expansion under Shaka came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld. In 1823, pressure caused one group of Basotho, the Kololo, to migrate north. They moved past the Okavango Swamp and across the Zambezi into Barotseland, (which is now part of Zambia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia). In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.

At about the same time, the Boers began to encroach upon Basotho territory. After the Cape Colony was ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, many farmers opted to leave the former Dutch colony in the Great Trek. They moved inland, where they eventually established independent polities.

At the time of these developments, Moshoeshoe I gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern highveld. Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he molded the disparate refugee groups escaping the Difaqane into a cohesive nation. His leadership allowed his small nation to survive the obstacles that destroyed other indigenous South African kingdoms during the 19th century, such as the Zulu &quot;Mfecane&quot;, the inward expansion of the and the plans of the Colonial Office.

In 1822, Moshoeshoe established the capital at Butha-Buthe, an easily defensible mountain in the northern Drakensberg mountain range, thus laying the foundations of the eventual Kingdom of Lesotho. His capital was later moved to Thaba Bosiu.

To deal with the encroaching groups, Moshoeshoe encouraged French missionary activity in his kingdom. Missionaries sent by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society provided the King with foreign affairs counsel and helped to facilitate the purchase of modern weapons.

Aside from acting as state ministers, missionaries (primarily Casalis and Arbousset) played a vital role in delineating Sesotho orthography and printing Sesotho language materials between 1837 and 1855. The first Sesotho translation of the Bible appeared in 1878.

In 1868, after losing the western lowlands to the Boers during the Free State–Basotho Wars, Moshoeshoe successfully appealed to Queen Victoria to proclaim Basutoland (modern Lesotho) a protectorate of Britain. Accordingly, the British administration was established in Maseru, the site of Lesotho&#x27;s current capital. Local chieftains retained power over internal affairs, while Britain was responsible for foreign affairs and the defense of the protectorate.

In 1869, the British sponsored a process to demarcate the borders of Basutoland. While many clans had territory within Basutoland, large numbers of Sesotho speakers resided in areas allocated to the Orange Free State, the sovereign republic that bordered the Basotho kingdom. King Moshoeshoe died two years later in 1870, after the end of war, and was buried at the summit of Thaba Bosiu.

===20th century===

Britain&#x27;s protection ensured that repeated attempts by the Orange Free State, and later the Republic of South Africa, to absorb part or all of Basutoland were unsuccessful. In 1966, Basutoland gained its independence from Britain, becoming the Kingdom of Lesotho.

Sesotho is widely spoken throughout the subcontinent due to internal migration. To enter the cash economy, Lesotho men often migrated to large cities in South Africa to find employment in the mining industry. Migrant workers from the Free State and Lesotho thus helped spread Sesotho to the urban areas of South Africa. It is generally agreed that migrant work harmed the family life of most Sesotho speakers because adults (primarily men) were required to leave their families behind in impoverished communities while they were employed in distant cities.

Attempts by the apartheid government to force Sesotho speakers to relocate to designated homelands had little effect on their settlement patterns. Large numbers of workers continued to leave the traditional areas of Black settlement. Women gravitated towards employment as agricultural or domestic workers while men typically found employment in the mining sector.

In terms of religion, the central role that Christian missionaries played in helping Moshoeshoe I secure his kingdom helped to ensure widespread Basotho conversion to Christianity. Today, the bulk of Sesotho speakers practice a form of Christianity that blends elements of traditional Christian dogma with local, pre-Western beliefs. Modimo (&quot;God&quot;) is viewed as a supreme being who cannot be approached by mortals. Ancestors are seen as intercessors between Modimo and the living, and their favor must be cultivated through worship and reverence. Officially, the majority of Lesotho&#x27;s population is Catholic.
The Southern Basotho&#x27;s heartland is the Free State province in South Africa and neighboring Lesotho. Both of these largely rural areas have widespread poverty and underdevelopment. Many Sesotho speakers live in conditions of economic hardship, but people with access to land and steady employment may enjoy a higher standard of living. Landowners often participate in subsistence or small-scale commercial farming ventures. However, overgrazing and land mismanagement are growing problems.

==Demographics==
The allure of urban areas has not diminished, and internal migration continues today for many black people born in Lesotho and other Basotho heartlands. Generally, employment patterns among the Basotho follow the same patterns as broader South African society. Historical factors cause unemployment among the Basotho and other Black South Africans to remain high.

Percent of Sesotho speakers across South Africa:

* Gauteng Province: 13.1%
* Atteridgeville: 12.3%
* City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality: 9.6%
* Soweto: 15.5%
* Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality: 10.0%
* Katlehong: 22.4%
* Sedibeng District Municipality: 46.7%
* West Rand District Municipality: 10.8%
* Midvaal Local Municipality: 27.9%
* Free State Province: 64.2%
* Bloemfontein: 33.4%

==Language==

The language of the Basotho is referred to as &quot;Sesotho,&quot; less commonly known as &quot;Sesotho sa borwa&quot;. Some texts may refer to Sesotho as &quot;Southern Sotho&quot; to differentiate it from Northern Sotho, also called Sepedi.

Sesotho is the first language of 1.5 million people in Lesotho, or 85% of the population. It is one of the two official languages in Lesotho, the other being English. Lesotho enjoys one of Africa&#x27;s highest literacy rates, with 59% of the adult population being literate, chiefly in Sesotho.

Sesotho is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa. According to the 2011 South African National Census of 2011, almost 4 million people speak Sesotho as their first language, including 62% of Free State inhabitants. Approximately 13.1% of the residents of Gauteng speak Sesotho as their first language. In the North West Province, 5% of the population speaks Sesotho as a first language, with a concentration of speakers in the Maboloka region. Three percent of Mpumalanga&#x27;s people speak Sesotho as their first language, with many speakers living in the Standerton area. Two percent of the residents of the Eastern Cape speak Sesotho as a first language, though they are located mostly in the northern part of the province.

Aside from Lesotho and South Africa, 60,000 people speak Silozi (a close relative of Sesotho) in Zambia. Additionally, a few Sesotho speakers reside in Botswana, Eswatini and the Caprivi Strip of Namibia. No official statistics on second language usage are available, but one conservative estimate of the number of people who speak Sesotho as a second (or later) language is 5 million.

Sesotho is used in a range of educational settings, both as a subject of study and as a medium of instruction. It is used in its spoken and written forms in all spheres of education, from preschool to doctoral studies. However, the number of technical materials (e.g., in the fields of commerce, information technology, law, science, and math) in the language is still relatively small.

Sesotho has developed a sizable media presence since the end of apartheid. Lesedi FM is a 24-hour Sesotho radio station run by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), broadcasting solely in Sesotho. There are other regional radio stations throughout Lesotho and the Free State. Half-hour Sesotho news bulletins are broadcast daily on the SABC free-to-air channel SABC 2. Independent TV broadcaster eTV also features a daily half-hour Sesotho bulletin. Both SABC and the eTV group produce a range of programs that feature some Sesotho dialogue.

In Lesotho, the Lesotho National Broadcasting Service broadcasts to South Africa via satellite pay-TV provider, DStv.

Most newspapers in Lesotho are written in Sesotho or both Sesotho and English. There are no fully fledged South African newspapers in Sesotho except for regional newsletters in QwaQwa, Fouriesburg, Ficksburg, and possibly other Free State towns.

Currently, the mainstream South African magazine &quot;Bona&quot; includes Sesotho content. Since the codification of Sesotho orthography, literary works have been produced in Sesotho. Notable Sesotho-language literature includes Thomas Mofolo&#x27;s epic &quot;Chaka&quot;, which has been translated into several languages, including English and German.

==Clothing==

The Basotho have a unique traditional attire. This includes the mokorotlo, a conical hat with a decorated knob at the top that is worn differently for men and women. The Basotho blanket is often worn over the shoulders or waist and protects the wearer against the cold. Although many Sotho people wear westernized clothing, often traditional garments are worn over them.

===Basotho herders===
Many Basotho who live in rural areas wear clothing that suits their lifestyles. For instance, boys who herd cattle in the rural Free State and Lesotho wear the Basotho blanket and large rain boots (gumboots) as protection from the wet mountain terrain. Herd boys also often wear woolen balaclavas or caps year-round to protect their faces from cold temperatures and dusty winds.

===Basotho women===
Basotho women usually wear skirts and long dresses in bright colors and patterns, as well as the traditional blankets around the waist. On special occasions like wedding celebrations, they wear the seshweshwe, a traditional Basotho dress. The local traditional dresses are made using colored cloth and ribbon accents bordering each layer. Sotho women often purchase this material and have it designed in a style similar to West and East African dresses. Women often wrap a long print cloth or a small blanket around their waist, either as a skirt or as a second garment over it. This is commonly known as a &quot;wrap&quot;, and it can be used to carry infants on their backs.

===Special clothing items===
Special clothing is worn for special events like initiation rites and traditional healing ceremonies.

For a Lebollo la basadi, or girl&#x27;s initiation ceremony, girls wear a beaded waist wrap called a &quot;thethana&quot; that covers the waist, particularly the crotch area and part of the buttocks. They also wear gray blankets and goatskin skirts. These garments are worn by young girls and women, particularly virgins.

For a Lebollo la banna, or a boy&#x27;s initiation ceremony, boys wear a loincloth called a &quot;tshea&quot; as well as colorful blankets. These traditional outfits are often combined with more modern items, like sunglasses.

Traditional Sotho healers wear the bandolier, which consists of strips and strings made of leather, sinew, or beads that form a cross on the chest. The bandolier often has pouches of potions attached to it for specific rituals or physical/spiritual protection. It is believed that the San people adopted this bandolier attire for healers during times when the Basotho and the San traded and developed ties through trade, marriage, and friendship. The San people&#x27;s use of the bandolier can be seen in their rock paintings that date to the 1700s.

<text>An eyebrow is an area of short hairs above each eye that follows the shape of the lower margin of the brow ridges of some mammals. In humans, eyebrows serve two main functions: first, communication through facial expression, and second, prevention of sweat, water, and other debris from falling down into the eye socket. It is common for people to modify their eyebrows by means of hair removal and makeup.

==Functions==
A number of theories have been proposed to explain the function of the eyebrow in humans. One approach suggests its main function is to prevent moisture (mostly sweat and rain) from flowing into the eye. Another theory holds that clearly visible eyebrows provided safety from predators when early hominid groups started sleeping on the ground.

Recent research, however, suggests eyebrows in humans developed as a means of communication and that this is their primary function. Humans developed a smooth forehead with visible, hairy eyebrows capable of a wide range of movement. Such eyebrows can express a wide range of subtle emotions – including recognition and sympathy.

==Cosmetic modification==

Fashion in eyebrow shape has changed throughout the ages and eyebrows have always featured heavily in female fashion, often as part of cultural demands made on women about body hair.

Cosmetic methods over the centuries have been developed to alter the appearance of eyebrows by adding or removing hair, changing the color, or changing the position to meet the aesthetic ideal of the time, for example, by tinting the eyebrow with permanent dye, similar to hair colour, often in order to darken them.

Cosmetics tools such as eyebrow brushes, shaders, and pencils are often used to define the eyebrow or make it appear fuller. These can create an outline for the brows or mimic hairs where there are sparse areas. Brow gels are also used in creating a thicker brow; they allow for the hairs to be more textured, which gives the appearance of thicker, fuller brows. Lastly, brow powders or even eyeshadows are used for those who want a fuller and more natural look, by placing the brow powder or eyeshadow (closest to the natural hair colour) in areas where there is less hair.

Several options exist for removing hair to achieve a thinner or smaller eyebrow, or to &quot;correct&quot; a unibrow, including manual and electronic tweezing, waxing, and threading. The most common method is to use tweezers to thin out and shape the eyebrow. Waxing is becoming more popular. Lastly, there is threading eyebrows, where a cotton thread is rolled over hair to pull it out. Small scissors are sometimes used to trim the eyebrows, either with another method of hair removal or alone. All of these methods can be painful for seconds or minutes due to the sensitivity of the area around the eye but, often, this pain decreases over time as the individual becomes used to it. In time, hair that has been plucked will stop growing back. Some people wax or shave off their eyebrows and leave them bare, stencil or draw them in with eye liner or tattoo them on. In Western societies, it has become more common for men to pluck part of their eyebrows.

To create a fuller look, eyebrows can be cloned in an eyebrow transplant. Individual strands of the eyebrow are created to mimic a natural-looking eyebrow of the desired shape. The process of eyebrow transplant is quite similar to the process of hair transplant. In this process as well, follicles from an active area are transferred to the area where there are no hairs. Follicles are mostly taken from the back of the head because it is the best harvesting site when it comes to hairs. The follicles are then injected into the skin.

The healing process after an eyebrow transplant is similar to the process of tattoo. In this process, patients may experience light bruising and crusting of the skin. People who have genetically thin eyebrows or who have over-tweezed are considered ideal for the transplant.

An eyebrow lift is a cosmetic surgery to raise the eyebrow, usually to create a more feminine or youthful appearance. It is not a new phenomenon, with the earliest description of brow lifting published in medical literature in 1919 by French surgeon Raymond Passot. Brows can be affected during a face lift or an eye lift. In the 1970s, doctors started injecting patients&#x27; eyebrows with botox or similar toxins to paralyse the muscles temporarily, causing the brow to raise.

Japanese women and men from the 8th century practiced &quot;hikimayu&quot;: shaving or plucking the eyebrow hair and painting smudge-like ones higher on the forehead or pencilling in thin ones in a different place. This practice is comparable to that in the Elizabethan era when high-status women would remove eyebrows altogether. Thin eyebrows, achieved by rigorous plucking, were again fashionable in the 1920s and 1930s.

In the 21st century, tattooing became popular as a way to achieve and maintain an eyebrow shape, using a coil machine, rotary machine or a manual tool containing a row of needles. This process, also called cosmetic tattooing or microblading involves an eyebrow artist implanting pigments in small, precise cuts that mimic the look of hair. Shaving lines in eyebrows is another cosmetic alteration, popular among some younger people in the 1990s and 2000s.

<text>Moshoeshoe I () ( – 11 March 1870) was the first king of Lesotho. He was the first son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bamokoteli lineage, a branch of the Koena (crocodile) clan. In his youth, he helped his father gain power over some other smaller clans. In 1820, at the age of 34, Moshoeshoe succeeded his father as the Bamokoteli chief and formed his own clan. He and his followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain. He became the first and longest-serving King of Lesotho in 1822.

== Early life ==

Moshoeshoe was born under the name Lepoqo in the village of Menkhoaneng in the north of modern day Lesotho. The precise year of his birth remains unknown, estimates range from 1780 to 1794; 1786 being the most commonly agreed upon date. His name&#x27;s literal translation is Dispute, originated from accusations of witchcraft which were levied on a man in Menkhoaneng around the time of his birth. He was the first son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bamokoteli sub-clan of the Basotho people and his first wife Kholu. Kholu was the daughter of the Bafokeng clan chief Ntsukunyane and came from the area of the Butha-Buthe further north. The Bamokoteli numbered at most 4,000 people, they were an offshoot of the Koena tribe to whom they regularly paid tribute. Lepoqo&#x27;s family lived in a small &quot;kraal&quot; near the Tlotsi stream, a tributary of the Caledon River. Little is known about his childhood; however, he remained on good terms with his parents until their death. Around the age of six he began tending to the family&#x27;s sheep and goats. Lepoqo had an older sister named MaTsouenyane as well as younger brothers named Makhabane and Posholi, and a younger sister named &#x27;MaNtoetse. Mokhachane went on to marry over four other women and father other children. The Sotho people were keen pastoralists; cattle played a central role in their lives and a man&#x27;s wealth was measured by the number of cattle he possessed.

In 1804, Mokhachane convened the initiation ceremony for Lepoqo and his agemates. The initiation school lasted for six months, during which Lepoqo was circumcised, learned the customs of his people, military tactics and ancient songs. He also composed praise poetry about himself and received a new name; Letlama, meaning &quot;the Binder&quot;. As the chief&#x27;s son Letlama became the leader of the other boys who underwent initiation with him, forming a strong personal bond with each one of them. Shortly after his graduation, Letlama led his band on a successful cattle raid against chief RaMonaheng&#x27;s village. To commemorate the raid he composed another praise poem where he likened himself to &quot;a razor which has shaved Ramonaheng&#x27;s beard&quot;. Thereafter he became known as Moshoeshoe, meaning &quot;the Shaver&quot;, after the onomatopoeic Sesotho word for the sound made by the razor shaving.

As a young man Moshoeshoe continued to lead his band into cattle raids, becoming notable for his skill in seizing cattle. He was ambitious but also known for his short temper, once killing a follower for milking one of his cows without his approval. 

Moshoeshoe and his followers, mostly the Bakoena Bamokoteli, some Bafokeng from his maternal side and other relations as well as some clans including the Amazizi, established his village at Butha-Buthe, where his settlement and reign coincided with the growth in power of the well-known Zulu King, Shaka and what is now known as the &#x27;time of troubles&#x27; (previously known as &#x27;Difaqane&#x27;). During the early 19th century Shaka raided many smaller chiefdoms along the eastern coast of Southern Africa (modern day Kwa-Zulu Natal), incorporating parts of them into his steadily growing Zulu chiefdom. Various small clans were forced to flee the Zulu chief. An era of great wars of calamity followed, known as the &quot;time of troubles/Difaqane&quot;. It was marked by aggression against the Sotho people by the invading Nguni clans. The attacks also forced Moshoeshoe to move his settlement to the Qiloane plateau. The name was later changed to Thaba Bosiu or &quot;mountain at night&quot; because it was believed to grow during the night and shrink during day. It proved to be an impassable stronghold against enemies.

By the latter part of the 19th century, Moshoeshoe established the nation of the Basotho, in Basutoland. He was popularly known as &quot;Morena e Moholo/morena oa Basotho&quot; (Great King/King of the Basotho).

== Reign ==

In the 1820s, the Basotho faced a number of cattle raids from the Koranna. It was during this time that they first encountered horses and guns in a combat setting. After a number of initial setbacks, the Basotho managed to either capture or acquire horses and guns of their own, and began stockpiling gunpowder. By 1843, Moshoeshoe had accumulated more horses and guns than any other chieftain in South Africa. Nevertheless, most of the guns in Basotho possession were outdated flintlocks, which had flooded the South African market after the introduction of percussion lock muskets. In 1833, missionaries from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society led by French missionaries Eugène Casalis and began setting their outposts in Basotho lands following Moshoeshoe&#x27;s invitation. They promoted a combination of Christianity, Western civilization, and commerce. They saw Basotho customs linked to obligatory labor and the dependence of the population on their chiefs as evil. They sought to undermine them by promoting private property, the commodization of production and closer economic ties with European settlers.

In 1843, Moshoeshoe signed a treaty with the governor of the British Cape Colony Sir George Napier, whereby the British recognized the Basuto as their allies. The Basotho were tasked with countering Boer incursions into the Cape during the course of the Great Trek, receiving an annual grant of 75 £ in money or ammunition. The Napier Treaty greatly increased Moshoeshoe&#x27;s status as a leader. While it deprived him of some lands he had laid claim to, it also recognized his rule over various ethnic groups living in the region. In 1848, Cape governor Sir Harry Smith pressured Moshoeshoe into signing an agreement whereby he recognized British paramount authority over the lands north of the Orange River; while retaining his traditional rights. The agreement also envisioned the creation of an alliance between the British and the Basotho. A series of similar ambiguously worded treaties with local African tribes effectively established the Orange River Sovereignty. 

In the north-east, the Basotho and their Taung allies regularly engaged in tit for tat cattle raids against their old enemies the Batlokoa of Kgosi Sekonyela and the Koranna of Gert Taaibosch. The British Resident in the Orange River Sovereignty Major Henry Douglas Warden believed that the Basotho were more to blame for the continuous inter tribal warfare in the region. Warden began delineating borders between the various tribes in the north-east frontier, ignoring Moshoeshoe&#x27;s long standing claims to several territories in the process. Moshoeshoe believed that the British had failed to protect him against Batlakoa and Boer encroachment, while many of his subjects accused him of cowardice in the face of British oppression. On 25 June 1851, Warden demanded that the Basuto restore cattle and horses to the victims of their past cattle raids. Warden had assembled a mixed force of British, Boer and African troops numbering approximately 2,500 men at Platberg. On 28 June, Warden moved his force against the Taung in an effort to seize stolen cattle. On 30 June, Warden&#x27;s force was defeated by a Basotho-Taung army at the Battle of Viervoet. 

In October Moshoeshoe wrote to both Smith and Warden, explaining that he had acted in self-defense and intended to maintain cordial relations with the British. In February 1852, the British agreed to redraw the boundaries in the south-west and to cease colonial interference into inter-tribal conflicts in exchange for the restoration of the cattle the Basotho had stolen since September 1850. Negotiations fell through and Smith&#x27;s replacement Major-General Sir George Cathcart was waiting for the hostilities with the Xhosa to wane before launching a punitive expedition against the Basotho.

On 20 December 1852, a British expeditionary forced clashed with the Basotho in the Battle of Berea. A combination of poor British planning and determined Basotho resistance resulted in a temporary British retreat from the area. Fearing that a second British assault would result in his military defeat, Moshoeshoe sued for peace attaining favorable terms and restoring amicable relations with the British. In 1853, Moshoeshoe grew tired of Sekonyela&#x27;s raiding, deciding to decisively deal with the Batlokoa. In November 1853, the Basotho army defeated the Batlakoa and their Koranna allies at the battle of Khoro-e-Betloa, subsequently seizing their stronghold of Jwalaboholo. The bulk of the Batlakoa either scattered or joined the Basotho. The British pulled out of the region in 1854, causing the formation of the Boer Orange Free State. 

In 1858, hostilities broke out between the Basotho and the Orange Free State. Initially achieving a victory in the first war, inferiority in both marksmanship and materiel of the Basotho caused a defeat in the two wars that followed, which lasted until 1868. In 1866, the two sides signed the Treaty of Thaba Bosiu, whereby Moshoeshoe ceded most of his kingdom&#x27;s arable land to the Boers. Hostilities resumed soon afterwards and the Boers began employing a scorched earth policy, leading to starvation among the Basotho. Fearing that the destruction of the Basotho people was imminent, Moshoeshoe, his sons and local missionaries began appealing to British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Philip Wodehouse and the Colony of Natal for protection. Although initially reluctant to intervene, the British were worried by the disruption in trade caused by the war and the possibility of Boer expansion to the Pondoland coast. In December 1867, the Colonial Office approved Basotholand&#x27;s annexation by Natal. Distrusting the Natal administration and believing that the Cape Colony was not yet ready to absorb the new territory, Wodehouse disregarded those instructions. He blocked the supply of ammunition to the Free State and on 12 March 1868 proclaimed Basotho land to be a royal dominion. Moshoeshoe died on 11 March 1870 and was succeeded by his oldest son Letsie I.

== Family and lineage ==
In 1810, Moshoeshoe married ’Mamabela, daughter of the Bafokeng chief, Seephephe, who was chosen for him by his father. She became his senior wife assuming the name ’MaMohato with whom he had four sons and Letsie, Molapo, Masopha and Majara as well as a daughter named Mathe. Their relationship was described by visiting missionaries as deeply affectionate. ’MaMohato died in 1834 either due to complications during childbirth or due to a violent domestic argument stemming from an act of infidelity she had committed with one of Moshoeshoe&#x27;s main councilors.

Moshoeshoe practiced polygamy; he had 30 wives in 1833, with the number rising to 140 in 1865. The names of 17 of them have been traced. Polygamy allowed Moshoeshoe to both forge alliances with other chiefs and increase his wealth as his subjects were expected to cultivate his wives&#x27; field per Sotho custom. Despite the presence of his other wives, he considered himself a widower following ’MaMohato&#x27;s death. Only the children from his first marriage constituted the royal line of descent. Apart from ’MaMohato, only ‘Maneko a second ranking wife wielded considerable influence in the household. Similarly to the principal wife second ranking wives were women of power, who had separate houses, herds of cattle, fields and servants. Their sons were expected to take important positions in the kingdom. Moshoeshoe&#x27;s third ranking wives were assigned to the houses of more senior wives where they acted as servants. Unlike more senior wives they did not cohabit with their husband and their condition bordered on slavery. Foreign visitors and Moshoeshoe&#x27;s subjects were allowed to have sexual relationships with his third ranking wives, yet the children produced from such encounters were considered to be his.

== Legacy ==

Moshoeshoe Day is an annual national holiday in Lesotho celebrated on 11 March, the date of Moshoeshoe&#x27;s death. Celebrations include the laying of wreaths on Moshoeshoe&#x27;s grave at Thaba Bosiu by a delegation led by Lesotho&#x27;s monarch, a celebratory parade and other entertainment activities.

The Moshoeshoe I International Airport, Lesotho&#x27;s only international airport is named in his honour.

South African-made shweshwe fabric is named for King Moshoeshoe I who once received a gift of it and then popularized it throughout his realm.

He would also be brought up in the 1993 Pinky and the Brain Animaniacs episode &quot;Win Big&quot;.
