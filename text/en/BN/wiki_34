<text>Within biological taxonomy, a honey bee race would be an informal rank in the taxonomic hierarchy, below the level of subspecies. It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one race. Therefore, a strain (within the honey bee context) is a lower-level taxonomic rank used at the intraspecific level within a race of a subspecies. Strains are often seen as inherently artificial concepts, more usually within biology as characterized by a specific intent for genetic isolation, however, within beekeeping circles, &quot;strain&quot; is more likely to be used to describe very minor differences throughout the same subspecies, such as the color ranges of &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; from brown to grey. Within &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; there are two races, the darker leather brown northern Italian bee from the Ligurian Alps region which was discovered to be resistant to acarine in the 1900s, while the other Italian bee race, from regions near Bologna and further south, was highly susceptible to acarine and within this race there are two color strains, the traditional Italian yellow and a rarer all-golden color.

== Description ==
The races of the honey bee are classified into various named instances of an informal taxonomic rank of race—below that of subspecies—on the basis of shared genetic traits. The term &quot;honey bee&quot; means a bee of the species &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; which descend from bees that originated in Africa.

Differences in the colors of bees may be more pronounced in queens and drones; workers are much less easily differentiated by color. Drones are produced from the unfertilized eggs of queens and therefore their genetic characteristics depend entirely on those of the queen, whereas worker bees are produced from fertilized eggs. To make things even more complicated, a queen will normally mate multiple times, the spermatozoa from which are retained within her body, meaning that workers may only be half-sisters to each other, and their colors and other characteristics may differ.

In the Americas, there has been a great deal of interbreeding of subspecies, since all honey bees were imported at some point after 1492 and the subsequent Columbian Exchange. Among beekeepers, the term &quot;race&quot; has been used increasingly imprecisely, and is often used to refer to bee subspecies and hybrids, as well as subspecies divisions, more improperly.

There are also variations within subspecies (like within &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;), being little more than color variants that may not be correlated with distinct distributions; these are sometimes referred to as &quot;native races&quot;. These are often given their own names when described, but zoological nomenclature does not recognize these named &quot;races&quot; as valid, as only ranks of subspecies and above have formal scientific names in zoology.

== Classifications ==
Based on morphological similarities and the separation of regions during and since the last Ice Age, there are five bee lineages:
* A (African, subspecies from central and southern Africa)
* C (&quot;carnica&quot;, subspecies from east and south of the Alps, including those along the northern Mediterranean)
* M (&quot;mellifera&quot;, subspecies from western Europe),
* O (Oriental, subspecies from the eastern end of the range of the species)
* Y (&quot;yemenitica&quot;, subspecies from Ethiopia)
(Hybrids and bee breeds, even with known ancestry, such as the Buckfast bee, are not included within the bee lineages; they are crossings of the &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; subspecies and are not defined as subspecies in their own right)

The known subspecies within the lineage &#x27;A&#x27; are:
* &quot;A. m. adansonii&quot;
* &quot;A. m. capensis&quot;
* &quot;A. m. intermissa&quot; (formerly known as &quot;A. m. major&quot;)
* &quot;A. m. jemenitica&quot;
* &quot;A. m. lamarckii&quot;
* &quot;A. m. litorea&quot;
* &quot;A. m. monticola&quot;
* &quot;A. m. ruttneri&quot;
* &quot;A. m. sahariensis&quot;
* &quot;A. m. scutellata&quot;
* &quot;A. m. unicolor&quot;

The known subspecies within the lineage &#x27;C&#x27; are:
* &quot;A. m. carnica&quot;
* &quot;A. m. cecropia&quot;
* &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;
* &quot;A. m. macedonica&quot;

The known subspecies within the lineage &#x27;M&#x27; are:
* &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;
* &quot;A. m. iberiensis&quot; (formerly known as &quot;A. m. iberica&quot;)
* &quot;A. m. sinisxinyuan&quot;

The known subspecies within the lineage &#x27;O&#x27; are:
* &quot;A. m. adami&quot;
* &quot;A. m. anatoliaca&quot;
* &quot;A. m. armeniaca&quot;
* &quot;A. m. caucasica&quot;
* &quot;A. m. cypria&quot;
* &quot;A. m. meda&quot;
* &quot;A. m. syriaca&quot;

The known subspecies within the lineage &#x27;Y&#x27;) are:
* &quot;A. m. bandasii&quot; 
* &quot;A. m. sudanensis&quot;
* &quot;A. m. yemenitica&quot;

<text>In ancient Rome, &#x27; (from Greek , &quot;hot&quot;) and &#x27; (from Greek ) were facilities for bathing. usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes, while were smaller-scale facilities, public or private, that existed in great numbers throughout Rome.

Most Roman cities had at least one – if not many – such buildings, which were centers not only for bathing, but socializing and reading as well. Bathhouses were also provided for wealthy private villas, town houses, and forts. They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream, or within cities by aqueduct. The water would be heated by fire then channelled into the caldarium (hot bathing room). The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in &quot;De architectura&quot; (V.10).

==Terminology==
&quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; and may all be translated as &#x27;bath&#x27; or &#x27;baths&#x27;, though Latin sources distinguish among these terms.

 or , derived from the Greek signifies, in its primary sense, a bath or bathing-vessel, such as most persons of any consequence among the Romans possessed in their own houses, and hence the chamber which contained the bath, which is also the proper translation of the word . The diminutive is adopted by Seneca to designate the bathroom of Scipio in the villa at Liternum, and is expressly used to characterize the modesty of republican manners as compared with the luxury of his own times. But when the baths of private individuals became more sumptuous and comprised many rooms, instead of the one small chamber described by Seneca, the plural or was adopted, which still, in correct language, had reference only to the baths of private persons. Thus, Cicero terms the baths at the villa of his brother Quintus .

 and , which according to Varro have no singular number, were the public baths, but this accuracy of diction is neglected by many of the subsequent writers, and particularly by the poets, amongst whom is not uncommonly used in the plural number to signify the public baths, since the word could not be introduced in a hexameter verse. Pliny also, in the same sentence, makes use of the neuter plural for public, and of for a private bath.

 (Greek: , , &#x27;hot springs, hot baths&#x27;, from the Greek adjective , &#x27;hot&#x27;) meant properly warm springs, or baths of warm water; but came to be applied to those magnificent edifices which grew up under the empire, in place of the simple of the republic, and which comprised within their range of buildings all the appurtenances belonging to the Greek gymnasia, as well as a regular establishment appropriated for bathing. Writers, however, use these terms without distinction. Thus the baths erected by Claudius Etruscus, the freedman of the Emperor Claudius, are styled by Statius , and by Martial . In an epigram by &quot;Martial&quot;——the terms are not applied to the whole building, but to two different chambers in the same edifice.

==Building layout==
A public bath was built around three principal rooms: the &quot;tepidarium&quot; (warm room), the &quot;caldarium&quot; (hot room), and the &quot;frigidarium&quot; (cold room). Some also featured steam baths: the &quot;sudatorium&quot;, a moist steam bath, and the &quot;laconicum&quot;, a dry hot room.

By way of illustration, this article will describe the layout of Pompeii&#x27;s Old Baths, otherwise known as the Forum Baths, which are among the best-preserved Roman baths. These baths were connected to the forum at Pompeii, hence the name. The references are to the floor plan pictured to the right.

This specific complex consists of a double set of baths, one for men and one for women. It has six different entrances from the street, one of which (&quot;b&quot;) gives admission to the smaller women&#x27;s set only. Five other entrances lead to the men&#x27;s department, of which two (&quot;c&quot; and &quot;c2&quot;), communicate directly with the furnaces, and the other three (&quot;a3, a2, a&quot;) with the bathing apartments.

===Palaestra===
Passing through the principal entrance, &quot;a&quot; (barely visible, right side, one third of the total length from above), which is removed from the street by a narrow footway surrounding the building and after descending three steps, the bather would find a small chamber on his left (&quot;x&quot;) with a toilet (&quot;latrina&quot;), and proceed into a covered portico (&quot;g, g&quot;), which ran round three sides of an open court (&quot;palaestra, A&quot;). These together formed the vestibule of the baths (), in which the servants waited.

====Use of the palaestra====
This palaestra was the exercise ground for the young men, or perhaps served as a promenade for visitors to the baths. Within this court the keeper of the baths (), who exacted the &quot;quadrans&quot; paid by each visitor, was also stationed. The room (&quot;f)&quot; which runs back from the portico, might have been appropriated to him; but most probably it was an &quot;oecus&quot; or &quot;exedra&quot;, for the convenience of the better classes while awaiting the return of their acquaintances from the interior. In this court, advertisements for the theatre or other announcements of general interest were posted, one of which, announcing a gladiatorial show, still remains. At the sides of the entrance were seats ().

The 1898 edition of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Dictionary of Classical Antiquities&quot; provided illustrations envisioning the rooms of the Old Baths at Pompeii:
===Apodyterium and frigidarium===

A passage (&quot;c&quot;) leads into the &quot;apodyterium&quot; (&quot;B&quot;), a room for undressing in which all visitors must have met before entering the baths proper. Here, the bathers removed their clothing, which was taken in charge by slaves known as capsarii notorious in ancient times for their dishonesty. The was a spacious chamber, with stone seats along three sides of the wall (&quot;h&quot;). Holes are still visible on the walls, and probably mark the places where the pegs for the bathers&#x27; clothes were set. The chamber was lighted by a glass window, and had six doors. One of these led to the &quot;tepidarium&quot; (&quot;D&quot;) and another to the &quot;frigidarium&quot; (&quot;C&quot;), with its cold plunge-bath referred to as &quot;baptisterium&quot; (more commonly called &quot;natatorium&quot; or ), , , or ; the terms and suggest that some of those baths were also swimming pools. The bath in this chamber is of white marble, surrounded by two marble steps.

===Tepidarium===

From the the bather who wished to go through the warm bath and sweating process entered the (&quot;D&quot;). It did not contain water either at Pompeii nor at the Baths of Hippias, but was merely heated with warm air of an agreeable temperature, in order to prepare the body for the great heat of the vapour and warm baths, and, upon returning, to prevent a too-sudden transition to the open air. In the baths at Pompeii this chamber also served as an for those who took the warm bath. The walls feature a number of separate compartments or recesses for receiving the garments when taken off. The compartments are divided from each other by figures of the kind called atlantes or telamones, which project from the walls and support a rich cornice above them in a wide arch.

Three bronze benches were also found in the room, which was heated as well by its contiguity to the hypocaust of the adjoining chamber, as by a brazier of bronze (&quot;foculus&quot;), in which the charcoal ashes were still remaining when the excavation was made. Sitting and perspiring beside such a brazier was called .

The is generally the most highly ornamented room in baths. It was merely a room to sit and be anointed in. In the Forum Baths at Pompeii the floor is mosaic, the arched ceiling adorned with stucco and painting on a coloured ground, the walls red.

Anointing was performed by slaves called &quot;unctores&quot; and &quot;aliptae&quot;. It sometimes took place before going to the hot bath, and sometimes after the cold bath, before putting on the clothes, in order to check the perspiration. Some baths had a special room (&quot;destrictarium&quot; or &quot;unctorium&quot;) for this purpose.

===Caldarium===

From the a door opened into the (&quot;E&quot;), whose mosaic floor was directly above the furnace or hypocaust. Its walls also were hollow, behind the decorated plaster one part of the wall was made from interconnected hollow bricks called , forming a great flue filled with heated air. At one end was a round basin (&quot;labrum&quot;), and at the other a quadrangular bathing place (, , , ), approached from the platform by steps. The held cold water, for pouring upon the bather&#x27;s head before he left the room. These basins are of marble in the Old Baths, but we hear of of solid silver. Because of the great heat of the room, the was but slightly ornamented.

===Laconicum===

The Old Baths have no &quot;laconicum&quot;, which was a chamber still hotter than the , and used simply as a sweating-room, having no bath. It was said to have been introduced at Rome by Agrippa and was also called &quot;sudatorium&quot; and .

===Service areas===
The has a passage (q) communicating with the mouth of the furnace (i), called or and, passing down that passage, we reach the chamber M, into which the projects, and which is entered from the street at &quot;c&quot;. It was assigned to the , or persons in charge of the fires. Of its two staircases, one leads to the roof of the baths, and one to the boilers containing the water.

There were three boilers, one of which () held the hot water; a second, the tepid (); and the third, the cold (). The warm water was filled into the warm bath by a pipe through the wall, marked on the plan. Underneath the hot chamber was set the circular furnace &quot;d&quot;, of more than . in diameter, which heated the water and poured hot air into the hollow cells of the hypocaustum. It passed from the furnace under the first and last of the caldrons by two flues, which are marked on the plan. The boiler containing hot water was placed immediately over the furnace; as the water was drawn out from there, it was supplied from the next, the , which was raised a little higher and stood a little way off from the furnace. It was already considerably heated from its contiguity to the furnace and the hypocaust below it, so that it supplied the deficiency of the former without materially diminishing its temperature; and the vacuum in this last was again filled up from the farthest removed, which contained the cold water received directly from the square reservoir seen behind them. The boilers themselves no longer remain, but the impressions which they have left in the mortar in which they were embedded are clearly visible, and enable us to determine their respective positions and dimensions. Such coppers or boilers appear to have been called , from their similarity of shape to a milestone.

Behind the boilers, another corridor leads into the court or palaestra (&quot;K&quot;), appropriated to the servants of the bath.

===Women&#x27;s bath===
The adjoining, smaller set of baths were assigned to the women. The entrance is by the door &quot;b&quot;, which conducts into a small vestibule (&quot;m&quot;) and from there into the (&quot;H&quot;), which, like the one in the men&#x27;s bath, has a seat (&quot;,&quot; ) on either side built up against the wall. This opens upon a cold bath (&quot;J&quot;), answering to the of the men&#x27;s set, but of much smaller dimensions. There are four steps on the inside to descend into it.

Opposite to the door of entrance into the is another doorway which leads to the (&quot;G&quot;), which also communicates with the thermal chamber (&quot;F&quot;), on one side of which is a warm bath in a square recess, and at the farther extremity the . The floor of this chamber is suspended, and its walls perforated for flues, like the corresponding one in the men&#x27;s baths. The in the women&#x27;s baths had no brazier, but it had a hanging or suspended floor.

==Purpose==

The baths often included, aside from the three main rooms listed above, a &quot;palaestra&quot;, or outdoor gymnasium where men would engage in various ball games and exercises. There, among other things, weights were lifted and the discus thrown. Men would oil themselves and remove the excess with a strigil (cf. the well known Apoxyomenus of Lysippus from the Vatican Museum). Often wealthy bathers would bring a , a slave that carried his master&#x27;s towels, oils, and strigils to the baths and then watched over them once in the baths, as thieves and pickpockets were known to frequent the baths.

The changing room was known as the &quot;apodyterium&quot; (from Greek from &#x27;to take off&#x27;).

==Cultural significance==
In many ways, baths were the ancient Roman equivalent of community centres. Because the bathing process took so long, conversation was necessary. Many Romans would use the baths as a place to invite their friends to dinner parties, and many politicians would go to the baths to convince fellow Romans to join their causes. The had many attributes in addition to the baths. There were libraries, rooms for poetry readings, and places to buy and eat food. The modern equivalent would be a combination of a library, art gallery, mall, restaurant, gym, and spa.

One important function of the baths in Roman society was their role as what we would consider a &quot;branch library&quot; today. Many in the general public did not have access to the grand libraries in Rome and so as a cultural institution the baths served as an important resource where the more common citizen could enjoy the luxury of books. The Baths of Trajan, of Caracalla, and Diocletian all contained rooms determined to be libraries. They have been identified through the architecture of the baths themselves. The presence of niches in the walls are assumed to have been bookcases and have been shown to be sufficiently deep to have contained ancient scrolls. There is little documentation from the writers of the time that there did exist definitive public libraries maintained in the baths, but records have been found that indicated a slave from the imperial household was labelled (&#x27;maintenance man of the Greek library of the baths&#x27;). However, this may only indicate that the same slave held two positions in succession: &quot;maintenance man of the baths&quot; () and &quot;employee in the Greek library&quot; (a ). The reason for this debate is that, although Julius Caesar and Asinius Pollio advocated for public access to books and that libraries be open to all readers, there is little evidence that public libraries existed in the modern sense as we know it. It is more likely that these reserves were maintained for the wealthy elite.

Baths were a site for important sculpture; among the well-known pieces recovered from the Baths of Caracalla are the &quot;Farnese Bull&quot; and &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot; and over life-size early 3rd century patriotic figures, (now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples).

The Romans believed that good health came from bathing, eating, massages, and exercise. The baths, therefore, had all of these things in abundance. Since some citizens would be bathing multiple times a week, Roman society was surprisingly clean. When asked by a foreigner why he bathed once a day, a Roman emperor is said to have replied &quot;Because I do not have the time to bathe twice a day.&quot; Emperors often built baths to gain favour for themselves and to create a lasting monument of their generosity. If a rich Roman wished to gain the favour of the people, he might arrange for a free admission day in his name. For example, a senator hoping to become a Tribune might pay all admission fees at a particular bath on his birthday to become well known to the people of the area.

==Location==
Baths sprang up all over the empire. Where natural hot springs existed (as in Bath, England; Băile Herculane, Romania or Aquae Calidae near Burgas and Serdica, Bulgaria) were built around them. Alternatively, a system of &quot;hypocausta&quot; (from &#x27;below&#x27; and &#x27;to burn&#x27;) were utilised to heat the piped water from a furnace ().

==Remains of Roman public baths==

A number of Roman public baths survive, either as ruins or in varying degrees of conservation. Among the more notable are the Roman baths of Bath and the Ravenglass Roman Bath House in England as well as the Baths of Caracalla, of Diocletian, of Titus, of Trajan in Rome and the baths of Sofia, Serdica and Varna. Probably the most complete are various public and private baths in Pompeii and nearby sites. The Hammam Essalihine is still in use today.

In 1910, Pennsylvania Station was opened in New York City, with a Main Waiting Room that borrowed heavily from the frigidarium of the Baths of Diocletian, especially with the use of repeated groin vaults in the ceiling. The success of the design of Pennsylvania Station in turn was copied in other railroad stations around the world.

<doc id="432938" wikidata="Q7230603" url="?curid=432938" title="Port Eliot">
<text>Port Eliot in the parish of St Germans, Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, is the ancestral seat of the Eliot family, whose present head is Albert Eliot, 11th Earl of St Germans.

Port Eliot comprises a stately home with its own church, which serves as the parish church of St Germans. An earlier church building was Cornwall&#x27;s principal cathedral. The house is within an estate of which extends into the neighbouring villages of Tideford, Trerulefoot and Polbathic. Both house and garden are Grade I listed.

==History==
Originally built as a priory with adjoining St Germans Priory Church, parts of the house date back to the 12th century. It was substantially altered and remodelled in the 17th and 18th centuries by noted architects, including Sir John Soane.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Eliot family invested substantially in the estate, building numerous farmhouses, fishermen&#x27;s cottages and other dwellings across the land. Many of these remain part of the estate to this day, and they are rented out to local residents and friends of the family. Some properties, mainly lying remote from the estate, have been sold in recent years. In 2014, the 700-hectare estate was purchased by the Duchy of Cornwall.

==Festivals==

===Elephant Fayre===

In 1980 a small festival which had outgrown its site at Polgooth in mid-Cornwall approached the Port Eliot estate and asked if it could be held in the idyllic grounds. The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s. The festival ran from 1981 to 1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts. 

Over the years the festival grew, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 and bands such as The Cure, The Fall and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The burning down of the oldest tree in the park, looting of the village surgery and the robbing of stall-holders in 1985 prompted Lord Eliot and fellow organisers to make the 1986 festival the last.

===Port Eliot Festival===
In 2003 Lord St Germans began the Port Eliot Lit Fest in Cornwall. Which carried on as Port Eliot Festival until 2019.

==Public access==

In March 2008 the house and grounds opened to the public for the first time, for 100 days, and attracted 12,000 visitors. There is a shop and cafe with gardens open all year round. Guided tours of the house are available.

<text>The Baths of Caracalla () in Rome, Italy, were the city&#x27;s second largest Roman public baths, or &quot;thermae&quot;, after the Baths of Diocletian. The baths were likely built between AD 212 (or 211) and 216/217, during the reigns of emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla. They were in operation until the 530s and then fell into disuse and ruin.

Both during and since their operation as baths, they served as inspiration for many other notable buildings, ancient and modern, such as the Baths of Diocletian, the Basilica of Maxentius, the original Pennsylvania Station in New York City, Chicago Union Station and the Senate of Canada Building. Artworks recovered from the ruins include famous sculptures such as the &quot;Farnese Bull&quot; and the &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot;.

Today the Baths of Caracalla are a tourist attraction.

== History ==

=== Construction ===

Construction of the baths was probably initiated by emperor Septimius Severus and completed during the reign of his son, Caracalla. They were inaugurated in AD 216. The baths were located in the southern area of the city, Regio XII Piscina Publica, where members of the Severan family commissioned other construction works: the &quot;Via Nova&quot; leading to the baths and the Septizodium on nearby Palatine Hill. The site chosen for the baths formerly belonged to a vast garden estate known as the , developed by Gaius Asinius Pollio during the reign of Augustus. The &quot;Farnese Bull&quot; sculptural group that was later moved into the Baths of Caracalla was already present at the site in the time of Pollio, who had imported it to display in his gardens.

The estate of Pollio was appropriated by Caracalla to build his baths; the existing structures were demolished in some cases to their ground floors, filled in with earth and incorporated into the foundations of the new complex. The remains of one of these structures, a noble (house), were excavated initially by Francesco Ficoroni in the mid-18th century and again in 1860–67 by G.B. Guidi. Recently this two-storey domus deep below the baths, built in 134-138 during the reign of Hadrian, and partially demolished in 206 has been opened to the public revealing lavishly decorated frescoed ceilings and a lararium, a room dedicated to Roman and Egyptian gods. 

For work to have been mostly completed in the time of Caracalla, workers would have to have installed over of material every day for six years.

Work on additional decorations continued under Caracalla&#x27;s successors Elagabalus and Severus Alexander. The baths were likely mostly finished by 235. Later renovations were conducted under Aurelian (after a fire) and by Diocletian. Under Constantine the Great the &quot;caldarium&quot; was modified.

The building was heated by a hypocaust, a system of burning coal and wood underneath the ground to heat water provided by a dedicated aqueduct. The baths were free and open to the public.

===Late antiquity===

The baths were fully functional in the 5th century when they were referred to as one of the seven wonders of Rome. Olympiodorus of Thebes mentions a capacity of 1,600. This is interpreted to refer to the maximum number of simultaneous visitors, as the daily capacity is thought to have been 6,000 to 8,000 bathers.

The baths remained in use until the 6th century. In the mid-4th century a Christian pilgrimage site came into being, known as the , close to the baths near the Church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. The baths thus became useful to pilgrims and the Church community for their water supply. In 537 during the Gothic War,  King Vitiges of the Ostrogoths laid siege to Rome and severed the city&#x27;s water supply. Shortly thereafter the baths were abandoned. Located too far away from the still-populated area of Rome, the baths were mostly disused but in the 6th and 7th centuries were apparently used for the burials of pilgrims who died after being cared for in the nearby xenodochium of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. Some simple tombs from this era have been found inside the bath area.

Popes Adrian I, Sergius II and Nicholas I may have had some work done on the aqueduct through the 9th century.

The earthquake of 847 destroyed much of the building, along with many other Roman structures.

=== Other uses ===

At least since the 12th century the baths were used as a quarry for construction materials, and of decorative pieces to be reused in churches and palaces (e.g. in Pisa Cathedral and Santa Maria in Trastevere).

During the 14th century, the area was used as vineyards and gardens. In the 15th century, Pope Pius II used stone from the Baths in the construction of the Loggia of the Benediction at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. In 1524, Pope Clement VII granted an excavation license to Cardinal Lorenzo Pucci to remove unlimited quantities of columns, marble, travertine and other ancient stone from the Baths of Caracalla for a new palace the Cardinal was building near St. Peter&#x27;s. In the mid-16th century Clement&#x27;s successor Pope Paul III had excavations conducted in the area during the construction of his new villa. Substantial architectural decoration remained standing at this time, as documented in the drawings of the Renaissance architects Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Antonio Dosio and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder.
The excavations of Paul III between 1545 and 1547 uncovered many large statues made of marble and bronze, as well as innumerable architectural fragments, lamps, intaglios, and cameos. The quantity of materials was so great that a museum was created to house the collection, known as the Museo Farnese (relocated to the Real Museo Borbonico in the late 18th century). The pope granted the area to the Roman Seminary of the Jesuits. It was used as a playground for children. Philip Neri may have brought children from his oratory here—he is believed to have commissioned the fresco &quot;Madonna supported by an angel&quot; still located in the &quot;natatio&quot;.

Between the 16th and 18th centuries interest in the structure was rekindled and several famous architects made drawings of the ruins (Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Falda, Giambattista Nolli and Giuliano da Sangallo).

The aqueduct serving the baths was in use up to the 19th century. The Aqua Antoniniana aqueduct, a branch of the earlier Aqua Marcia also worked on under Diocletian, was specifically built to serve the baths.

=== Excavation and restoration ===

In 1824, excavations at the baths were conducted by Count Egidio di Velo, whose findings included the mosaics showing athletes now at the Vatican Museums. Further work followed by Luigi Canina in the &quot;frigidarium&quot; (until the mid-19th century) and then by Battista Guidi (1860–7).

From 1866 to 1869 restoration work in the central part of the complex revealed a torso of Hercules, porphyry columns and figure-adorned capitals. In 1870, the area became the property of the Italian government and Pietro Rosa conducted excavations in the eastern &quot;palaestra&quot;. In 1878–9, Giuseppe Fiorelli discovered mosaics in the &quot;caldarium&quot; and western &quot;palaestra&quot;.

From the early 20th century, excavations expanded into the outer areas of the complex and downward, revealing the subterranean passages, including a Mithraeum (see below). Systematic work on the galleries, started in the 18th and 19th centuries, resumed after 1901. On the eastern side more work was done in the late 1930s, when an opera stage was installed in the &quot;caldarium&quot;. Except for some sketches no documentation of these restorations survives.

Further restoration work took place in the 1980s, when thick vegetation and illegally built houses in the area were cleared away. The southern wall with its cisterns, the southwestern library and the octagonal hall known as the Temple of Jupiter were restored at that point. In 1998–9, the opera stage was dismantled and modern visitor facilities were added to the baths. They reopened to the public in 2001.

The baths were the only archaeological site in Rome to be damaged by an earthquake near L&#x27;Aquila in 2009. They experienced minor damage in August 2016 from an earthquake in central Italy.

==Description==
=== Overview ===
The bath complex covered approximately . The complex is rectangular, measuring 337 m × 328 m. Its construction involved the moving of a substantial amount of earth, as parts of the nearby hills had to be removed or leveled into platforms. Several million bricks were used in the construction. The baths contained at least 252 columns, 16 of which had a height of over 12 m.

Water was carried to the baths by the then newly constructed Acqua Antoniniana, from the major Acqua Marcia. The exact path of the aqueduct supplying the baths is not known as only a few segments have been discovered. The aqueduct connected to the southern side of the baths where it filled 18 cisterns. These in turn were connected by lead pipes with the baths proper.

The baths followed the &quot;great Imperial baths&quot; blueprint for Roman baths. They were more a leisure centre than just a series of baths. Besides being used for bathing, the complex also offered facilities for taking walks, reading/studying, exercise and body care. The main building stood in the centre with no connections to the surrounding walls, which housed the cisterns, two symmetrical libraries (south), two large &quot;exedras&quot; (east and west) and &quot;tabernae&quot; (shops) to the north. The surviving library measures 38 m × 22 m. Between the outer wall and the central complex were gardens (&quot;xystus&quot;).

The axis of the baths was laid out in a northeast to southwest fashion to make use of the sun&#x27;s heat. The &quot;caldarium&quot; faced southwest, the &quot;frigidarium&quot; northeast. Overall, the bath area was arranged along a single linear axis. However, dressing rooms and &quot;palaestra&quot; were arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building, giving easier access and facilitating the flow of people in and out of the thermal area, thus increasing the number of potential users of the baths.

The bath main building was 214 m × 110 m and the height to the top of the roof line was 44 m (145 ft); it covered and could hold an estimated 1,600 bathers.

=== Interior ===

The baths were the second to have a public library within the complex. Like other public libraries in Rome, there were two separate and equal sized rooms or buildings; one for Greek language texts and one for Latin language texts. The surviving library had three walls covered by niches (a total of 32) that housed the books. A larger niche in the middle of the southern wall likely contained a statue. A masonry ledge in front of the three other walls probably served as a bench. The floor is made from marble.

The baths consisted of a central &quot;frigidarium&quot; (cold room) measuring under three groin vaults high, a double pool &quot;tepidarium&quot; (medium), and a circular &quot;caldarium&quot; (hot room) in diameter, as well as two &quot;palaestras&quot; (gyms where wrestling and boxing were practiced). The northeastern end of the bath building contained a &quot;natatio&quot; or swimming pool. The &quot;caldarium&quot; had seven pools, the &quot;frigidarium&quot; four, the &quot;tepidarium&quot; two. Next to the &quot;caldarium&quot; were saunas (&quot;laconica&quot;).

The central room was the &quot;frigidarium&quot;, whose high roof was supported by eight giant columns made from Egyptian granite. Walls and floor were made from marble. The hall served a dual purpose: It was a meeting place and transition area for visitors heading for other parts of the bath. It also housed the cold baths, in the form of four pools, two of which were connected to the &quot;tepidarium&quot; and two of which communicated with the &quot;natatio&quot; via some waterfalls. In the middle of the &quot;frigidarium&quot; was another circular pool (now at the Archaeological Museum at Naples) surrounding a fountain. It was flanked by two additional brick pools.

The &quot;caldarium&quot; was a circular room with marble floors and topped by a dome of almost 36 m diameter, close to the size of the Pantheon&#x27;s dome. The weight of the dome was carried by just eight masonry pillars. Between them were glass windows that helped heat the large room (and reduced the weight of the walls). Its seven pools measured 9.5 m × 5 m (depth of 1 m). Only six of these remain. The seventh was replaced by a small apse during the restoration by Constantine.

The Olympic-sized &quot;natatio&quot; pool measured 50 m × 22 m. The walls rose to more than 20 m and the northern façade was structured by three huge columns made from grey granite. Between those columns were niches on several levels that housed ornamental statues.

The &quot;natatio&quot; was roofless with bronze mirrors mounted overhead to direct sunlight into the pool area. The entire bath building was on a raised platform high to allow for storage and furnaces under the building.

===Subterranean features===

Discovered in 1912 by Ettore Ghislanzoni, the Mithraeum at the baths is considered the largest documented gathering space for the worshippers of Mithra, the Persian god in vogue with the military and mostly lower-class men, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The mithraeum was approximately long and wide with a cross-vaulted ceiling. It can be only roughly dated by the two main events associated with the baths: the mithraeum was created after the complex was completed circa AD 217 and it was probably no longer in use when the aqueduct supplying the complex was cut in the 530s.

The floor of the main room was covered with a black and white mosaic. Benches lined the walls. A fresco portraying Mithra (or a torch bearer) is on the western wall. The only other ornamentation was a marble block, roughly carved into the shape of a snake. In the floor near the entrance a circular pit was found covered with a marble slab, with a terracotta bowl containing the remains of staves of wheat. A rectangular hole in the floor gives access to a small tunnel that runs under the center of the main hall into an adjoining room, where there is an entrance/exit with staircase. This, a unique feature in a mithraeum, has been controversial. Most scholars view this as a &quot;fossa sanguinis&quot;, a ritual pit over which the bull at the center of the Mithraic mythology was slaughtered, bathing one or more initiates in its blood. Others think it was used as a sort of stage trap door allowing a person to stage a surprising entry into the room.

In a nearby room, a statue of Aphrodite Anadyomene was found in 1912. It is now located in the Museo Nazionale Romano at the Baths of Diocletian.

Apart from housing the mithraeum, the tunnels served to heat the baths and as sewers for the outflow of water. They were also used to store the fuel for the furnaces – which are estimated to have burned around 10 tons of wood per day. Storage capacity had been estimated at more than 2,000 t of wood.

Overall, these tunnels ran for hundreds of metres underneath the main structure. They were lit by skylight-type windows that allowed the air to circulate, thus keeping the stored wood from rotting.

An underground water mill was excavated beginning in 1912. First thought to be medieval in origin it is now considered to date to Antiquity. It may have been a part of the original workings of the baths. Fire damage indicates it was burned in the 3rd century, but rebuilt with some alterations.

==Works of art==

The baths were originally ornamented with high-quality sculptures, estimated to have numbered more than 120. Despite their location in one of the city&#x27;s working class areas, of all the antique baths in Rome the Baths of Caracalla were found to have contained the most lavish assortment of statues. Although many were destroyed in the Middle Ages to make lime, beginning in the 16th century under Pope Paul III Farnese, sculptures were excavated from the area to serve as decorations in newly built palazzi.

Among the well-known pieces recovered from the Baths of Caracalla are the &quot;Farnese Bull&quot; (probably from the eastern &quot;palaestra&quot;) and &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot; (from the &quot;frigidarium&quot;), now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples; others are in the Museo di Capodimonte there. One of the many statues is the colossal statue of Asclepius.

Two granite tubs from the &quot;frigidarium&quot; were taken to Piazza Farnese where they still serve as fountains, made by Girolamo Rainaldi. A granite column from the &quot;natatio&quot; was taken to Florence by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici in Piazza Santa Trinita. It is now known as the Column of Justice. In the Lateran Collection of the Vatican Museums are mosaics composed of rectangular panels depicting athletes, which were discovered in 1824 in two of the library &quot;exedrae&quot; to the east and west of the baths complex. They have been restored and are on display in the Gregoriano Profano Museum.

==Cultural impact==

The Baths of Caracalla (and especially the central &quot;frigidarium&quot;) had a significant impact on the architecture of many later buildings. In Roman times, these included the Baths of Diocletian and the Basilica of Maxentius.

In the 19th and early 20th century, the design of the baths was used as the inspiration for several modern structures, including St George&#x27;s Hall in Liverpool, the original Pennsylvania Station (demolished in 1963) in New York City, the current Senate of Canada Building in Ottawa and the main hall of the University of Leipzig (demolished in 1968).

The main halls of Penn Station, the Senate of Canada Building and Chicago Union Station made use of direct copies of the &quot;frigidarium&#x27;s&quot; architecture.

== Use as a cultural venue ==
=== Opera and concerts ===
The central part of the bath complex (the &quot;caldarium&quot;) was the summer home of the Rome Opera company from 1937 to 1993. In 2001, use of the venue by the opera resumed but it now uses a temporary movable stage outside of the main structure, which reduces the stress on the antique ruins.

It is also a concert venue, having achieved fame as the venue and backdrop for the first Three Tenors concert in 1990.

=== Sporting ===
The area was used for the Rome Grand Prix four times between 1947 and 1951.

At the 1960 Summer Olympics, the venue hosted the gymnastics events.

=== Film ===

The baths were used as a filming location for &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot;.

== Visiting ==
The extensive ruins of the baths have become a popular tourist attraction. The baths are open to the public for an admission fee. Access is limited to certain areas/walkways to avoid additional damage to the mosaic floors.

<text>The 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade was an armoured brigade of the Canadian Army during World War II. It was part of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division.

== Organization ==
As of 1942 the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade comprised:
* 21st Armoured Regiment (The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards)
* 22nd Armoured Regiment (The Canadian Grenadier Guards)
* 28th Armoured Regiment (The British Columbia Regiment)
* 1st Battalion, The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)

And their supporting units, including:
* 4th Canadian Brigade Company, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps;
* 12 Canadian Field Ambulance

Arriving in Normandy in July 1944, the brigade saw service in the battles that took the Canadians from Caen to Falaise (and the Falaise Pocket). Unlike their peers in the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, the 4th Armoured Brigade almost always fought in support of its affiliated 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade.

Following the Normandy campaign the brigade saw service in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany before being disbanded in the Netherlands in 1946.

== Commanders ==
* E. L. M. Burns (1942–1943)
* Desmond Smith (1943–1944)
* Eric Leslie Booth (1944)
* Robert Moncel (1944–1946)

<doc id="432961" wikidata="Q753858" url="?curid=432961" title="Intertropical Convergence Zone">
<text>The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ , or ICZ), known by sailors as the doldrums or the calms because of its monotonous windless weather, is the area where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;monsoon trough&quot; (a usage that is more common in Australia and parts of Asia).

==Meteorology== 
The ITCZ was originally identified from the 1920s to the 1940s as the &quot;Intertropical Front&quot; (&quot;ITF&quot;), but after the recognition in the 1940s and the 1950s of the significance of wind field convergence in tropical weather production, the term &quot;Intertropical Convergence Zone&quot; (&quot;ITCZ&quot;) was then applied.

The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that encircle the globe near the Equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trade winds move in a southwestward direction from the northeast, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move northwestward from the southeast. When the ITCZ is positioned north or south of the Equator, these directions change according to the Coriolis effect imparted by Earth&#x27;s rotation. For instance, when the ITCZ is situated north of the Equator, the southeast trade wind changes to a southwest wind as it crosses the Equator. The ITCZ is formed by vertical motion largely appearing as convective activity of thunderstorms driven by solar heating, which effectively draw air in; these are the trade winds. The ITCZ is effectively a tracer of the ascending branch of the Hadley cell and is wet. The dry descending branch is the horse latitudes.

The location of the ITCZ gradually varies with the seasons, roughly corresponding with the location of the thermal equator. As the heat capacity of the oceans is greater than air over land, migration is more prominent over land. Over the oceans, where the convergence zone is better defined, the seasonal cycle is more subtle, as the convection is constrained by the distribution of ocean temperatures. Sometimes, a double ITCZ forms, with one located north and another south of the Equator, one of which is usually stronger than the other. When this occurs, a narrow ridge of high pressure forms between the two convergence zones.

== ITCZ over oceans vs. land ==
The ITCZ is commonly defined as an equatorial zone where the trade winds converge. Rainfall seasonality is traditionally attributed to the north–south migration of the ITCZ, which follows the sun. Although this is largely valid over the equatorial oceans, the ITCZ and the region of maximum rainfall can be decoupled over the continents. The equatorial precipitation over land is not simply a response to just the surface convergence. Rather, it is modulated by a number of regional features such as local atmospheric jets and waves, proximity to the oceans, terrain-induced convective systems, moisture recycling, and spatiotemporal variability of land cover and albedo.

==South Pacific convergence zone==
The South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) is a reverse-oriented, or west-northwest to east-southeast aligned, trough extending from the west Pacific warm pool southeastwards towards French Polynesia. It lies just south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere warm season, but can be more extratropical in nature, especially east of the International Date Line. It is considered the largest and most important piece of the ITCZ, and has the least dependence upon heating from a nearby land mass during the summer than any other portion of the monsoon trough. The southern ITCZ in the eastern tropical Pacific and southern tropical Atlantic, known as the SITCZ, occurs during the Southern Hemisphere fall between 3° and 10° south of the equator east of the 140th meridian west longitude during cool or neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns. When ENSO reaches its warm phase, otherwise known as El Niño, the tongue of lowered sea surface temperatures due to upwelling off the South American continent disappears, which causes this convergence zone to vanish as well.

==Effects on weather==
Variation in the location of the intertropical convergence zone drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations, resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes. Longer term changes in the intertropical convergence zone can result in severe droughts or flooding in nearby areas.

In some cases, the ITCZ may become narrow, especially when it moves away from the equator; the ITCZ can then be interpreted as a front along the leading edge of the equatorial air. There appears to be a 15 to 25-day cycle in thunderstorm activity along the ITCZ, which is roughly half the wavelength of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO).

Within the ITCZ the average winds are slight, unlike the zones north and south of the equator where the trade winds feed. As trans-equator sea voyages became more common, sailors in the eighteenth century named this belt of calm &quot;the doldrums&quot; because of the calm, stagnant, or inactive winds.

==Role in tropical cyclone formation==
Tropical cyclogenesis depends upon low-level vorticity as one of its six requirements, and the ITCZ fills this role as it is a zone of wind change and speed, otherwise known as horizontal wind shear. As the ITCZ migrates to tropical and subtropical latitudes and even beyond during the respective hemisphere&#x27;s summer season, increasing Coriolis force makes the formation of tropical cyclones within this zone more possible. Surges of higher pressure from high latitudes can enhance tropical disturbances along its axis. In the tropical north Atlantic and the eastern portion of the tropical north Pacific oceans, tropical waves move along the axis of the ITCZ causing an increase in thunderstorm activity, and clusters of thunderstorms can develop under weak vertical wind shear.

==Hazards==
In the Age of Sail, to find oneself becalmed in this region in a hot and muggy climate could mean death when wind was the only effective way to propel ships across the ocean. Calm periods within the doldrums could strand ships for days or weeks. Even today, leisure and competitive sailors attempt to cross the zone as quickly as possible as the erratic weather and wind patterns may cause unexpected delays.

In 2009, thunderstorms along the Intertropical Convergence Zone played a role in the loss of Air France Flight 447, which crashed while flying from Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris. The aircraft crashed with no survivors while flying through a series of large ITCZ thunderstorms, and ice forming rapidly on airspeed sensors was the precipitating cause for a cascade of human errors which ultimately doomed the flight. Most aircraft flying these routes are able to avoid the larger convective cells without incident.

== Effects of climate change ==
Based on paleoclimate proxies, the position and intensity of the ITCZ varied in prehistoric times along with changes in global climate. During Heinrich events within the last 100 ka, a southward shift of the ITCZ coincided with the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell coincident with weakening of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell. The ITCZ shifted north during the mid-Holocene but migrated south following changes in insolation during the late-Holocene towards its current position. The ITCZ has also undergone periods of contraction and expansion within the last millennium. A southward shift of the ITCZ commencing after the 1950s and continuing into the 1980s may have been associated with cooling induced by aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere based on results from climate models; a northward rebound began subsequently following forced changes in the gradient in temperature between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These fluctuations in ITCZ positioning had robust effects on climate; for instance, displacement of the ITCZ may have led to drought in the Sahel in the 1980s.

Atmospheric convection may become stronger and more concentrated at the center of the ITCZ in response to a globally warming climate, resulting in sharpened contrasts in precipitation between the ITCZ core (where precipitation would be amplified) and its edges (where precipitation would be suppressed). Atmospheric reanalyses suggest that the ITCZ over the Pacific has narrowed and intensified since at least 1979, in agreement with data collected by satellites and in-situ precipitation measurements. The drier ITCZ fringes are also associated with an increase in outgoing longwave radiation outward of those areas, particularly over land within the mid-latitudes and the subtropics. This change in the ITCZ is also reflected by increasing salinity within the Atlantic and Pacific underlying the ITCZ fringes and decreasing salinity underlying central belt of the ITCZ. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report indicated &quot;medium agreement&quot; from studies regarding the strengthening and tightening of the ITCZ due to anthropogenic climate change.

Less certain are the regional and global shifts in ITCZ position as a result of climate change, with paleoclimate data and model simulations highlighting contrasts stemming from asymmetries in forcing from aerosols, volcanic activity, and orbital variations, as well as uncertainties associated with changes in monsoons and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The climate simulations run as part of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) did not show a consistent global displacement of the ITCZ under anthropogenic climate change. In contrast, most of the same simulations show narrowing and intensification under the same prescribed conditions. However, simulations in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) have shown greater agreement over some regional shifts of the ITCZ in response to anthropogenic climate change, including a northward displacement over the Indian Ocean and eastern Africa and a southward displacement over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

==In literature==
The doldrums are notably described in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1798) and also provide a metaphor for the initial state of boredom and indifference of Milo, the child hero of Norton Juster&#x27;s classic 1961 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. It is also cited in the 1939 book &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot;.

<doc id="432962" wikidata="Q1886171" url="?curid=432962" title="UnionFS">
<text>Unionfs is a filesystem service for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD which implements a union mount for other file systems. It allows files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system. Contents of directories which have the same path within the merged branches will be seen together in a single merged directory, within the new, virtual filesystem.

When mounting branches, the priority of one branch over the other is specified. So when both branches contain a file with the same name, one gets priority over the other.

The different branches may be either &quot;read-only&quot; or &quot;read/write&quot; file systems, so that writes to the virtual, merged copy are directed to a specific real file system. This allows a file system to appear as writable, but without actually allowing writes to change the file system, also known as copy-on-write. This may be desirable when the media is physically read-only, such as in the case of Live CDs.

Unionfs was originally developed by Erez Zadok and his team at Stony Brook University.

==Uses==
In Knoppix, a union between the file system on the CD-ROM or DVD and a file system contained in an image file called &quot;knoppix.img&quot; (knoppix-data.img for Knoppix 7) on a writable drive (such as a USB memory stick) can be made, where the writable drive has priority over the read-only filesystem. This allows the user to change any of the files on the system, with the new file stored in the image and transparently used instead of the one on the CD.

Unionfs can also be used to create a single common template for a number of file systems, or for security reasons. It is sometimes used as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; snapshotting system.

Docker uses file systems inspired by Unionfs, such as Aufs, to layer Docker images. As actions are done to a base image, layers are created and documented, such that each layer fully describes how to recreate an action. This strategy enables Docker&#x27;s lightweight images, as only layer updates need to be propagated (compared to full VMs, for example).

&quot;UbuntuLTSP&quot;, the Linux Terminal Server Project implementation for Ubuntu, uses Unionfs when PXE booting thin or thick clients.

==Other implementations==
Unionfs for Linux has two versions. Version 1.x is a standalone one that can be built as a module. Version 2.x is a newer, redesigned, and reimplemented one.

aufs is an alternative version of unionfs.

overlayfs written by Miklos Szeredi has been used in OpenWRT and considered by Ubuntu and has been merged into the mainline Linux kernel on 26 October 2014 after many years of development and discussion for version 3.18 of the kernel.

&quot;unionfs-fuse&quot; is an independent project, implemented as a user space filesystem program, instead of a kernel module or patch. Like Unionfs, it supports copy-on-write and read-only or read–write branches.

The Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system uses union mounts extensively to build custom namespaces per user or processes.

Union mounts have also been available in BSD since at least 1995.

The GNU Hurd has an implementation of Unionfs. As of January 2008, it works, but results in a read-only mount-point.

mhddfs works like Unionfs but permits balancing files over drives with the most free space available. It is implemented as a user space filesystem.

mergerfs is a FUSE based union filesystem which offers multiple policies for accessing and writing files as well as other advanced features (xattrs, managing mixed RO and RW drives, link CoW, etc.).

Sun Microsystems introduced the first implementation of a stacked, layered file system with copy-on-write, whiteouts (hiding files in lower layers from higher layers), etc. as the Translucent File Service in SunOS 3, circa 1986.

JailbreakMe 3.0, a tool for jailbreaking iOS devices released in July 2011, uses unionfs techniques to speed up the installation process of the operating system modification.

<doc id="432964" wikidata="Q1124854" url="?curid=432964" title="American Girls (band)">
<text>American Girls were an American all-female band based in California, United States.

American Girls originally started as a film project, which fizzled. After some personnel changes and more rehearsing, the band sustained many comparisons to the Go-Go&#x27;s, who were popular at the time as well assigned to the same label, IRS Records. However, American Girls featured veterans of the all-women band scene including Brie Howard who had played drums for Fanny and Miiko Watanabe who played bass with the Screamin&#x27; Sirens. They recorded one album only, which was intended as a demo but was pressed to vinyl in its original form. The eponymous debut album was released in March 1986. The cover shows the band in a hotel room, with alcohol, a deck of cards, and a copy of &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;.

The video for their single &quot;American Girl&quot; received some airplay on MTV.

Their song &quot;Androgynous&quot; appeared in the 1986 film &quot;Tough Guys&quot; and the song &quot;American Girl&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;. They also opened for The Lords of the New Church on 1986 tour dates.

Miles Copeland III (brother of the Police&#x27;s Stewart Copeland) was the band&#x27;s manager.

<doc id="432965" wikidata="Q968686" url="?curid=432965" title="George Hadley">
<text>George Hadley (12 February 1685 – 28 June 1768) was an English lawyer and amateur meteorologist who proposed the atmospheric mechanism by which the trade winds are sustained, which is now named in his honour as Hadley circulation. As a key factor in ensuring that European sailing vessels reached North American shores, understanding the trade winds was becoming a matter of great importance at the time. Hadley was intrigued by the fact that winds which should by all rights have blown straight north had a pronounced westerly flow, and it was this mystery he set out to solve.

==Life==
Hadley was born in London, England to George Hadley (High Sheriff of Hertfordshire) and Katherine FitzJames. He had an unremarkable childhood, and was eclipsed in his early years by his older brother John Hadley (1682–1744), the inventor of the octant (a precursor to the sextant). With John and his other brother Henry, George had constructed effective Newtonian telescopes.

George Hadley entered Pembroke College, Oxford, on 30 May 1700, and on 13 August 1701 became a member of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where his father purchased chambers for him. He was called to the bar on 1 July 1709, but remained more interested in mechanical and physical studies than in legal work For 7 years, succeeding William Derham, he was in charge of interpreting the meteorological diaries sent to the Royal Society from observers around the world, mainly in Britain and Scandinavia. He tried to correlate the data in the different temperature and pressure scales then in use and attempted to deduce general patterns that emerged over time. He twice published an account of the results in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;.

Hadley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 February 1735, and on 22 May that year published a short paper in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; (vol. 39, 1735, 58–62) giving an explanation of the trade winds. His theory remained relatively unknown and was independently created several times. Among the later creators was John Dalton, who later eventually became aware of Hadley&#x27;s priority. During the second half of the 19th century the theory gradually became known as &quot;Hadley&#x27;s principle&quot;.

In 1686, Edmond Halley had proposed a theory in an attempt to explain the trade winds, a theory which remained the most widely known internationally almost to the beginning of the 19th century. George Hadley&#x27;s version recognised that the Earth&#x27;s rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass moving relative to the Earth, an element that had been missing in Halley&#x27;s proposal. Later, in the second half of the 19th century, Hadley&#x27;s theory was itself shown to be deficient in that it was based on an assumption that when air mass travels from one latitude to another its linear momentum is conserved. However, since the air mass is at all times in a state of circumnavigating the Earth axis, it is in fact the angular momentum that is conserved, causing an effect known as the Coriolis effect. When using the correct angular momentum conservation in calculations the predicted effect is twice as large as when the erroneous conservation of linear momentum is used. The fact that Hadley&#x27;s principle is deficient in this respect is not known to everyone who should know; it can still be found in popular books and popular websites.

Hadley never married. In later life he left London and lived for a while at East Barnet with a nephew, most likely his brother John Hadley&#x27;s son John. Most of his later years were spent at Flitton, Bedfordshire, where another nephew, Hadley Cox (d. 1782), son of his sister Elizabeth, was vicar.

Hadley died at Flitton on 28 June 1768 aged 83 years, and was buried in the chancel of Flitton church. Another nephew, Henry&#x27;s son John, also became a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Commemorations==
The Met Office Hadley Centre was named in his honour. A crater on Mars was also named after him.

<text>The University of Nottingham Malaysia is a private university branch campus of the University of Nottingham. The university is situated in Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia. The university is rated ‘Competitive’ in the SETARA 2025 rating system by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).

The campus is run as a company called The University of Nottingham Malaysia Sdn Bhd (473520-K) with the provost being dual hatted as the CEO. The majority shareholder is Boustead Holdings.

The Malaysia campus was the first campus of a British university in Malaysia and one of the first to open outside Britain thus earning the distinction of the Queen&#x27;s Awards for Enterprise 2001 and the Queen&#x27;s Award for Industry (International Trade) 2006.

The University of Nottingham&#x27;s other overseas campus is located in Ningbo, China.

== History ==
Following an invitation from the Ministry of education to establish an overseas campus, a partnership between Boustead Holdings Berhad, YTL Corporation Berhad and the University of Nottingham was formally announced in 1998.

This development was the first ever branch campus of a British University established outside of the UK.

The University of Nottingham welcomed its first 89 students in September 2000 in Kuala Lumpur. In 2005, the university relocated to campus in Semenyih, in the valley of Broga Hill. In 2006, the campus reopened a Kuala Lumpur branch in Chulan Tower on Jalan Conlay to teach MBA students.

== Campus ==

=== Semenyih campus ===
The Malaysia campus is primarily based at a plot situated in Semenyih, Selangor. It was voted one of the 9 most beautiful university campuses in Malaysia by Tatler Asia. 

=== KL Teaching Centre (KLTC) ===
Besides the main campus in Semenyih, a city teaching facility is maintained in Chulan Tower in Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s central business district. Postgraduate programmes such as International Relations, Management Psychology and MBA are taught at the KLTC. 

=== Future Students Centre ===
In 2023, UNM unveiled a one-stop hub called Future Students Centre (FSC) located at Menara Axis in Petaling Jaya. The centre offers a spacious and convenient location for programme counselling. It also has an accommodation showroom and a campus-scale model, which allows students and parents to understand the UNM campus better.

== Academic ==
Being a branch campus of the University of Nottingham, students are not necessarily taught with similar course materials and generally do not sit the same exam papers as those in the UK, but are still under the jurisdiction of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). Upon completing a degree at the Malaysia campus, students are awarded a University of Nottingham degree certificate at a convocation held locally which is indistinguishable from the certificates awarded at the Nottingham campus. The degrees that are awarded are accredited by international professional bodies such as the Association of MBAs and the UK Engineering Council.

The Engineering Degree courses are accredited by the Board of Engineering Malaysia (BEM) and the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA).

== Research ==
The university was given a five-star rating in the Malaysia Research Assessment (MyRA) for research excellence in 2020. The only foreign university in Malaysia to be awarded two consecutive MyRAs.

Comprising 280 academic staff, the university&#x27;s research focuses on future food Malaysia and developing sustainable societies, nanotechnology, inclusion in the workplace, data analytics and artificial intelligence, among others.

Some of the leading organisations that UNM collaborates with in research include Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme, Sime Darby Foundation, WWF, YTI, Petronas Research and Cancer Research Malaysia.  

Apart from the taught undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, the university conducts projects for research-based postgraduate studies. There are more than 20 research programmes being carried out at the Malaysia Campus.

=== Biotechnology Research Centre ===
The Biotechnology Research Centre is a research centre specialising in the applied research of biotechnology products, specifically palm oil crop. The building cost RM3.5M, excluding internal fittings and scientific equipment. Inside the main research building there are two labs, one for the teaching of UNMC biotechnology students and the other for research.

The research centre is operated as a joint collaboration with Applied Agricultural Resources Sdn. Bhd (AAR), a start-up company.

== Partnerships ==
UNM has academic and research collaborations with CNN Academy in Abu Dhabi to provide postgraduate students with journalism education and training. 

UNM also partnered with the National Tech Association of Malaysia (PIKOM) since 2020 focusing on talent development, education and training placements and also driving innovation through research and development.  

== Student life ==
=== Mobility programme ===
As part of Nottingham&#x27;s advantage scheme, students may be exchanged to other campuses. In the words of Vincenzo Raimo, director of Nottingham&#x27;s International Office &quot;“Students can continue studying exactly the same modules available at Nottingham in the UK but overseas instead — experience the excitement of Asia but within the familiar academic setting of Nottingham University, ... Transfers are open to anyone getting good grades and whose degree subject is among those taught overseas. Air fares may not be cheap, but the cost of living is — and anyone spending the full year at a branch pays just half the UK tuition fee. &quot;&quot;

Besides exchanging to the UK campus or the China campus, students may also take part in Universitas 21 mobility programme in which students may also be exchanged with universities partner to Universitas 21 in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Denmark, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Japan, China, and South Korea.
These exchanges are not guaranteed but subject to agreement by the exchange partners at the time.

== Transportation ==

Shuttle bus services are offered free as a university incentive to alleviate on-campus parking issues. However, shuttle bus services are by regulations restricted to students and staff of the university. The nearest public bus route is at the nearest town of Semenyih, approximately from campus.

The university provides free transportation to the nearby Tesco super store and IOI City Mall which located in Putrajaya, special bus service to the Semenyih mosque for Friday prayers, and a shuttle bus service for students living in the student town of Taman Tasik Semenyih or Semenyih Lake park. A pedestrian bridge connects the neighbouring Taman Tasik Semenyih to the North entrance.

<doc id="432972" wikidata="Q504455" url="?curid=432972" title="Andrew Dice Clay">
<text>Andrew Dice Clay (born Andrew Clay Silverstein; September 29, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He rose to prominence in the late 1980s with a brash, deliberately offensive persona known as &quot;The Diceman&quot;. In 1990, he became the first stand-up comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden for two consecutive nights. That same year, he played the lead role in the comedy-mystery film &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;.

Clay has appeared in several films and television shows, including critically acclaimed supporting roles in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; (2013) and the 2018 remake of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, the latter of which earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. He continues his acting career while also touring and performing stand-up. The television show &quot;Dice&quot; aired on Showtime for two seasons. He also launched a podcast, &quot;I&#x27;m Ova Hea&#x27; Now&quot;, in September 2018.

==Early life==
Clay was born to parents Jacqueline and Fred Silverstein in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, where he was raised. He is Jewish. He has one sister. Clay&#x27;s father was a boxer and real estate agent.

At age five, Clay was entertaining his family with impressions, and by seven he was playing drums, inspired by the sounds of big band music. Clay attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn and as a teenager worked as a drummer on the Catskill Mountains circuit in the 1970s, playing bar mitzvahs and weddings under the name Clay Silvers. Upon returning to New York City, he failed to form a big band of his own. He pursued higher education but dropped out to become a full-time comedian. Clay cites Elvis Presley, Fonzie, John Travolta, and Sylvester Stallone as his heroes.

==Career==
===1970s===
Clay began his stand-up career in 1978 when he auditioned at Pips comedy club in Sheepshead Bay, which turned into a headline spot at the venue the next week, billed as Andrew Clay. His act was mainly impressions, including a character named &quot;The Diceman&quot;, based on Jerry Lewis as Buddy Love from &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, which transformed into John Travolta in &quot;Grease&quot;. It took him three weeks to prepare the act. A picture of him on stage during his early sets at Pips was described: &quot;In a baggy white shirt, pants rolled up to his knees and a pair of thick glasses&quot;, with a black leather jacket underneath the shirt so he could seamlessly switch to his Travolta character when the lights went out. With his new act, Clay graduated to larger and more prestigious comedy venues, including The Improv, Catch a Rising Star, and Dangerfield&#x27;s. He recalled his father being supportive of his act during one performance at Dangerfield&#x27;s. &quot;He knew it was different right off the bat [...] He saw it worked&quot;. The persona was more of a shock to his mother, but she got used to it and he recalled her laughing at his jokes.

===1980s===
By 1980, Clay had moved to Los Angeles and landed work at the Comedy Store, owned by Mitzi Shore. His sets were not an instant hit, and because of his dirty act and her unwillingness to have other comics follow him, Shore had Clay perform at late hours, making him &quot;wait and perform for ten drunks&quot;. In 1982, Clay landed his first film role, in &quot;Wacko&quot;. In 1983, Clay added the &quot;Diceman&quot; moniker to his name and no longer relied on impressions, instead creating an alter ego based on his heroes. He first used the act at the Comedy Store after he was asked to fill in for a comic who canceled their spot. He said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have my Jerry Lewis stuff with me, so I just winged it, saying whatever popped in my head&quot;.

His performances at the venue led to his first sitcom roles, with appearances on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, and feature-length films, including &quot;Making the Grade&quot; (1984), &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), and &quot;Casual Sex?&quot; (1988). A review by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Michael Wilmington described Clay&#x27;s character as &quot;a macho bozo from Jersey&quot;. From 1986 to 1988, he had a regular role as Max Goldman on &quot;Crime Story&quot;. His act included a drum solo as a tribute to Buddy Rich. Clay then pursued stand-up comedy full-time as the Dice character.

Clay&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1988 when he performed at an all-male Big Brother Association dinner event with &quot;all of Hollywood&#x27;s royalty [...] dressed in tuxedos, and I show up in a black leather jacket with a flag on the back that said &#x27;Rock and Roll&#x27;&quot;. The set was a hit; the next day, 20th Century Fox offered him a film deal and entered talks with producer Joel Silver. Also in 1988, Clay performed a seven-minute set at Dangerfield&#x27;s in New York City for Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s HBO stand-up showcase special &quot;Nothing Goes Right&quot;, launching him into the national spotlight.

In January 1989, Clay&#x27;s HBO special, &quot;The Diceman Cometh&quot;, appeared on HBO. It became a top video rental, according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. In March, he released his debut comedy album, &quot;Dice&quot;, which was certified gold by the RIAA for selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S. It peaked at No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Clay was named Comedy Act of the Year by readers of &quot;Performance&quot; magazine.

In September 1989, Clay performed a three-minute set at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards, which included Otto Petersen&#x27;s adult versions of the Mother Goose nursery rhymes. The incident led to MTV imposing a lifetime ban on Clay from appearing on the network. The ban was lifted in 2011.

In December 1989, Clay performed two unadvertised, largely improvised sets at Dangerfield&#x27;s, which were recorded for his second comedy album, &quot;The Day the Laughter Died&quot;, produced by Rick Rubin. Released in March 1990 on Geffen Records, the album sold 250,000 copies in seven weeks, peaking at No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===1990s===
In February 1990, Clay became the first comedian to sell out two consecutive nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City, totaling 38,000 people in attendance. 

When Clay was booked to host the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode of May 12, 1990, cast member Nora Dunn refused to appear in the episode due to the sexist and homophobic content in Clay&#x27;s stand-up act. Sinéad O&#x27;Connor also canceled her appearance as the episode&#x27;s musical guest in protest. During Clay&#x27;s opening monologue, security guards removed protesters from the studio. NBC used a five-second tape delay to cut offensive content from the live broadcast, but one remark escaped removal. The episode was the show&#x27;s fourth-highest-rated episode of the season.

Clay first met his agent, Dennis Arfa, at Dangerfield&#x27;s, which led to his first HBO special and ultimately his starring role in the 1990 film &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;; in 1991, he received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performance in the film.

In 1991, Clay ran his own production company, Fleebin Dabble Productions. He is featured on the front cover of the April 1991 issue of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, becoming the second man to front the magazine, after George Burns. Footage of Clay&#x27;s shows at Madison Square Garden was used to produce his 1991 stand-up concert film &quot;Dice Rules&quot;. His controversial act affected the number of venues willing to screen the film; it opened in 40 theatres nationwide. 20th Century Fox was originally to release it, but it dropped out over the controversial material, leaving it to be picked up by Seven Arts. This was followed by the release of &quot;One Night with Dice&quot;, filmed in 1986. A sell-out show at Symphony Hall in Salt Lake City in August 1991 was met with angry protesters outside the venue over his perceived homophobia and hateful material, during which police were called.

In 1993, ABC dropped a proposed one-hour television drama that was to feature Clay after management deemed him too controversial. Clay had signed a one-year deal with ABC that kept him from working with other networks. In July 1993, Clay released &quot;No Apologies&quot;, the first stand-up concert pay-per-view special. It was purchased by over 250,000 homes and was the highest-grossing non-sports pay-per-view event of the year. It was to feature Joey Buttafuoco, but the plan was dropped on his attorney&#x27;s advice after the publicity it attracted. Clay followed it with a second pay TV special, &quot;The Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;, which aired in around 100,000 homes. In 1994, Clay accepted more TV roles.

In 1995, he signed a development deal with CBS and producer Bruce Helford, resulting in his starring role on the sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot;. In mid-1995, Clay explained that the Diceman character had &quot;sort of gone out of hand&quot;, which he felt happy about because it allowed him to pursue more television and film work. The situation led to a change in his stand-up act, focusing more on being a husband and a father, yet still with an &quot;edge&quot;.

In 1996, Clay released an HBO special, &quot;Assume the Position&quot;, returning to his Diceman character.

In 1998, Clay released the triple album &quot;Filth&quot; through his website. Later in 1998, he began appearing on the New York City-based radio show &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;. His opening act at the time, Jim Norton, became the show&#x27;s co-host in late 2000.

===2000s===
In 2000, Clay released &quot;I&#x27;m Over Here Now&quot; and &quot;Banned for Life&quot;. Later in 2000, he released &quot;Face Down, Ass Up&quot;. He supported these with a nationwide tour that included a headline show at Madison Square Garden, ten years after his two sold-out performances.

In 2005, Clay signed a deal with Sirius Satellite Radio to broadcast his own show, &quot;Out of the Cage&quot;.

In 2007, he attempted a comeback with the reality TV series &quot;&quot; on VH1, which lasted seven episodes.

He appeared as a part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 2&quot; and was the first celebrity to be fired after he openly entertained the idea of quitting in Donald Trump&#x27;s presence and called him &quot;Donny Trump&quot;. On &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Clay said the show was edited to exclude situations where Trump treated Clay poorly, based on his comic treatment of women rather than his accomplishments. Throughout the season, each celebrity was raising money for a charity of their choice; Clay had selected StandUp For Kids.

===2010s===
In 2011, Clay was featured in the eighth and final season of &quot;Entourage&quot; as Johnny Drama&#x27;s co-star in the fictional program &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot;. Clay also appeared as himself in the &quot;Entourage&quot; film. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Raising Hope&quot; as himself, which aired on November 29, 2011.
In May 2012, Clay appeared on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast and also did a set at The Bamboozle festival in Asbury Park. In December 2012, he had a stand-up comedy special on Showtime titled &quot;Indestructible&quot;.

In May 2013, Clay began a podcast with Michael Wheels named &quot;Rollin&#x27; with Dice and Wheels...The Podcast&quot;. It ran for 46 episodes, the last of which was released in December 2015.

Clay appeared with Cate Blanchett in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;, which opened on July 26, 2013. In an interview with &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot;, Clay said that, as he had not been in a movie in 12 years, &quot;It was a thrill to do something dramatic, something I&#x27;ve always wanted to do.&quot; His performance was critically praised.

In July 2013, Clay signed a book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster for a memoir to be co-authored with David Ritz. In November 2014, Clay released his book &quot;The Filthy Truth&quot;.

In 2015, Clay hosted &quot;The Blue Show&quot;, showcasing some of his favorite blue comics, which was released on Showtime.

In 2016, Clay had a guest role as a record executive in the Martin Scorsese/Mick Jagger-produced television series &quot;Vinyl&quot; for HBO.

In 2017, Clay competed in and won, with his wife Valerie Silverstein, the Fox reality cooking series &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot;.

In September 2018, Clay launched his podcast &quot;I&#x27;m Ova Hea&#x27; Now&quot; on the GaS Digital Network. Later that year, he appeared as Lorenzo in the musical drama film &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, alongside Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, playing Gaga&#x27;s character&#x27;s father. Clay beat out several high-profile actors for the part, including Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, and his performance received positive reviews, as did the film.

==Personal life==
Clay has married three times. From 1984 to 1986, he was married to Kathy Swanson and from 1992 to 2002 to Kathleen &quot;Trini&quot; Monica. He had two sons with Monica, one of whom, Max, has followed his father into stand-up comedy and occasionally opens for him on tour. Clay&#x27;s third marriage was to hairstylist Valerie Vasquez from 2010 to 2014. Clay was in an eight-year relationship with his ex-fiancée, comedian Eleanor Kerrigan.

In 2017, Clay had a stent placed in a partially blocked artery. In 2021, he was diagnosed with Bell&#x27;s palsy, though the condition was declared temporary and he continues to perform live.

He has homes in New York City and Los Angeles.

==In popular culture==
On the third-season &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; episode &quot;Brown and Blue&quot;, a reluctant Murphy is made to interview a rising yet crudely controversial comedian, Tony Rocket (Michael Chiklis), whose character is loosely modeled on the Diceman and his material during the height of his popularity.

A December 1990 episode of &quot;Night Court&quot; focuses on a raunchy comedian, Monte &quot;The Potty Man&quot; Potter, who alienates everyone with his jokes.

Clay&#x27;s voice was sampled in EMF&#x27;s 1991 hit &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. Clay can be heard saying &quot;Oh!&quot; repeatedly throughout the song. He also utters &quot;It&#x27;s Unbelievable&quot; at the song&#x27;s midway point and near its conclusion.

Clay also played himself in season 8 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;, with his trademark brash voice starring in an animation series &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot; alongside &quot;Johnny Drama&quot;.

<doc id="432982" wikidata="Q713268" url="?curid=432982" title="Francesco Maria Veracini">
<text>Francesco Maria Veracini (1 February 1690 – 31 October 1768) was an Italian composer and violinist, perhaps best known for his sets of violin sonatas. As a composer, according to Manfred Bukofzer, &quot;His individual, if not subjective, style has no precedent in baroque music and clearly heralds the end of the entire era&quot;, while Luigi Torchi maintained that &quot;he rescued the imperiled music of the eighteenth century&quot;, His contemporary, Charles Burney, held that &quot;he had certainly a great share of whim and caprice, but he built his freaks on a good foundation, being an excellent contrapuntist&quot;. The asteroid 10875 Veracini was named after him.

==Life==
Francesco Maria Veracini was born at about 8:00 a.m. on 1 February 1690 in the family house on the via Palazzuolo, parish of San Salvatore, Ognissanti, Florence. The second and only surviving son of Agostino Veracini, a pharmacist and undertaker (and ironically one of the few Veracinis who was not a violinist, even as an amateur), he was taught the violin by his uncle, Antonio Veracini, with whom he later often appeared in concert, as well as by Giovanni Maria Casini and his assistant Francesco Feroci. His grandfather, Francesco (di Niccolò) Veracini, had been one of the first violinists of Florence, and ran a music school in the house until ill health forced him to turn the business over to his eldest son, Antonio, in 1708. In addition, the family managed a painting studio and possessed a large collection of art works, including four Ghirlandaios, a Rubens, a Caracci and a dozen other paintings by the three members of the family from two generations, including Francesco&#x27;s third son, Benedetto. The painter Niccolò Agostino Veracini was Francesco Maria&#x27;s cousin. Veracini esteemed Carlo Ambrogio Lonati as a great violinist.

He is known to have been a soloist in Venice at the Christmas masses at San Marco, on 24 and 25 December 1711. On 1 February 1712 he performed a violin concerto of his own composition (the first recorded public performance by Veracini playing one of his own compositions), accompanied by trumpets, oboes, and strings as part of the celebrations in honour of the Austrian ambassador to Venice of the newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI. The celebration, held in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari included a vocal Te Deum and Mass, as well as motets and concertos performed under the direction of padre Ferdinando Antonio Lazari. The manuscript scores of all the works performed that day, including Veracini&#x27;s concerto, were bound together in a handsome presentation volume now found in the National Library of Austria. According to another opinion, this concerto was Veracini&#x27;s Violin Concerto in D Major, &quot;a otto strumenti, di Francesco Maria Ueracini Suonato dallo stesso al post comunio&quot;, 1711), but was performed in Frankfurt rather than Venice, at Charles VI&#x27;s coronation on 22 December 1711, just two days before Veracini&#x27;s appearance as a soloist on Christmas Eve in Venice, some 800 kilometers to the south.

In 1714, Veracini went to London and played instrumental pieces (&quot;symphonies&quot; in contemporary parlance) between the acts of operas at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre. At the court of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine and Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici he performed his oratorio &quot;Mosè al Mar Rosso&quot;. In 1716 he was appointed as the head of a Venetian music school. There is a legend that, when Giuseppe Tartini heard Veracini playing the violin, he was so impressed by his bowing technique, and so dissatisfied with his own skill, that he retreated the next day to Ancona &quot;in order to study the use of the bow in more tranquility, and with more convenience than at Venice, as he had a place assigned him in the opera orchestra of that city&quot;.

Veracini wrote a set of violin/recorder sonatas dedicated to Prince Friedrich August, who came to celebrate carnival. The Prince recruited not only singers, as he was told to do by his father, but also musicians for the court in Dresden. He hired an entire opera company under the direction of the Italian composer Antonio Lotti, the librettist Antonio Maria Lucchini, the castrati Senesino and Matteo Berselli, the brothers Mauro architects, two painters, and two carpenters (Charlton 2000). In 1718 the Prince also secured the services of the eccentric Francesco Maria Veracini—at a very high salary— Johann David Heinichen and Giuseppe Maria Boschi.

===Dresden===

To justify his salary, Veracini had to compose chamber music for the court, transferring him to the official payroll as Kapellmeister in August 1717 and not as a violinist. In 1719 Veracini was sent to recruit more Italian singers for the new Dresden opera, &quot;am Zwinger&quot;. Whilst in Venice he secured the services of Margherita Durastanti and Vittoria Tesi and in Bologna added Maria Antonia Laurenti. Veracini also took the opportunity to visit his home town where he married Chiara Tesi.

In 1721 Veracini wrote another set of violin sonatas dedicated to the Prince (published in Dresden as his Opus 1). Unfortunately, there was animosity among all these gifted musicians at the court in Dresden. In 1722, the arrogant Veracini was involved in a quarrel, staged according to one source by the composer and violinist Pisendel, which resulted in Veracini leaping out of an upper-story window and breaking his foot in two places and (also) his hip. There are two conflicting accounts of this incident on August 13, one involving humiliation of Veracini at the hands of the last-desk violinist in the orchestra, who was asked to play the same concerto, replacing Veracini. Pisendel had been rehearsing his composition intensively with this violinist. The braggart Veracini fell into such a rage over this that he did not come out of his room for several days, and out of shame and despair finally publicly threw himself out of a window onto the street in Dresden. According to Veracini the jealous German musicians allegedly plotted to murder him (so he claimed in his writings). He fled Dresden by jumping out a window and apparently broke a leg in the fall. After the incident Veracini walked with a limp for the rest of his life. It is a myth Senesino was involved in the quarrel as he was either dismissed by Heinichen or by the court which ran out of money. G.F. Handel offered the singer a contract for London two years before the alleged incident with Veracini.

It seems the Dresden musicians, fearing for their position, felt relieved Veracini had left the city. Back in his native Florence in 1723, Veracini played music in a church. During this time he suffered from his bad reputation and was said by Charles Burney to have been &quot;usually qualified with the title of &quot;Capo pazzo&quot;&quot; [&quot;head lunatic&quot;]. He composed a Te Deum for the coronation of Pope Clement XII in 1730.

His uncle Antonio died in 1733, leaving the bulk of his estate to Francesco Maria. Amongst other things, this included no fewer than eight violins made by Jacob Stainer and three Amatis.

===London===
Back in London in 1733, Veracini appeared in many concerts. In 1735 he composed an opera for the Opera of the Nobility, &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot;. Francesca Cuzzoni, Antonio Montagnana, Farinelli and Senesino had a role. George Frederic Handel was present at the premiere in Haymarket Theatre. Charles Jennens liked the opera and ordered a score; Lord Hervey, not known for his musical perception, and Henry Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth were bored. However, the work enjoyed a run of twenty performances over six months. Many of the arias were published separately by John Walsh . Veracini composed the fifth version, based on Pietro Metastasio’s libretto, written for the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI. The score, which survived in the Newman Flower Collection (or the Henry Watson Music Library?) of the Manchester Central Library was developed by German musicologist Holger Schmitt-Hallenberg along with Fabio Biondi, who composed the recitatives that have not been preserved. It was performed in Kraków December 2013 and in Vienna and Madrid in January 2014.

In 1736 he wrote some arias for the pasticcio &quot;Orfeo&quot; by Nicola Porpora. In 1737, he wrote &quot;La Clemenza di Tito&quot;, on a libretto by Angelo Maria Cori based on Metastasio. In 1738 Veracini wrote his third opera, &quot;Partenio&quot;, and returned to Florence where he stayed till 1741. Back in London he composed his last opera, &quot;Roselinda&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot;, a most unusual choice of material at that time. In that opera Veracini included the well-known Scots ballad tune &quot;The Lass of Paties Mill&quot;. It was staged in London in 1744, the same year his oratorio &quot;L&#x27;errore di Salomone&quot; was staged. Burney, scorned the music of &quot;Roselinda&quot; as &quot;wild, awkward, and unpleasant; manifestly produced by a man unaccustomed to write for the voice, and one possessed of a &quot;capo pazzo&quot;&quot;, and ridiculed the inclusion of the ballad tune as an attempt &quot;to flatter the English&quot; that failed because &quot;few of the North Britons, or admirers of this national and natural Music, frequent the opera, or mean to give half a guinea to hear a Scots tune, which perhaps their cook-maid Peggy can sing better than any foreigner&quot;, but confessed that &quot;This opera, to my great astonishment when I examined the Music, ran twelve nights&quot;, whereas &quot;L&#x27;errore di Salomone&quot; was given only twice. Veracini left London a little more than a year later.

In 1745 or shortly after, he survived a shipwreck in which he lost two of his Stainer violins (the ones he called St. Peter and St. Paul), &quot;thought to have been the best in the world&quot;, and all of his effects. He returned to Florence, where he was appointed &quot;maestro di capella&quot; of the churches of San Pancrazio and San Gaetano, the latter one at which his uncle had worked, focusing on church music. Though he mostly conducted in his later years, he still sometimes appeared as a violinist. Veracini died in Florence.

==Compositions==
In addition to violin sonatas, edited by Ferdinand David, operas and oratorios, Veracini also wrote violin concertos, sonatas for recorder and basso continuo, and orchestral suites, called Overtures. The six Overtures were performed for Prince Friedrich August in Venice in 1716, as part of Veracini&#x27;s ultimately successful attempt to secure a position at the Dresden court. They are all either in F major or B-flat major, except for one in G minor. The last one of these, in B-flat major, is remarkable for concluding with a unison minuet. Veracini also wrote a &quot;lively, highly original theory treatise&quot;, &quot;Il trionfo della pratica musicale&quot;, and edited other composers&#x27; works, adding &quot;improvements&quot; of his own, such as he did in his &quot;Dissertazioni&quot; with the Opus 5 Violin Sonatas of Arcangelo Corelli.

The phrase was first used in sociology by Morton Grodzins when he adopted the phrase from physics where it referred to the adding a small amount of weight to a balanced object until the additional weight caused the object to suddenly and completely topple, or tip. Grodzins studied integrating American neighborhoods in the early 1960s. He discovered that most of the white families remained in the neighborhood as long as the comparative number of black families remained very small. But, at a certain point, when &quot;one too many&quot; black families arrived, the remaining white families would move out &quot;en masse&quot; in a process known as white flight. He called that moment the &quot;tipping point&quot;.

The idea was expanded and built upon by Nobel Prize-winner Thomas Schelling in 1971. A similar idea underlies Mark Granovetter&#x27;s threshold model of collective behavior.

==Other uses==
The phrase has extended beyond its original meaning and been applied to any process in which, beyond a certain point, the rate of the process increases dramatically. It has been applied in many fields, from economics to human ecology to epidemiology. It can also be compared to phase transition in physics or the propagation of populations in an unbalanced ecosystem.

Journalists and academics have applied the phrase to dramatic changes in governments, such as during the Arab Spring. The concept of a tipping point is described in an article in an academic journal, the &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot;, titled &quot;China at the Tipping Point? Foreseeing the unforeseeable&quot;:

Regime transitions belong to that paradoxical class of events which are inevitable but not predictable. Other examples are bank runs, currency inflations, strikes, migrations, riots, and revolutions. In retrospect, such events are explainable, even overdetermined. In prospect, however, their timing and character are impossible to anticipate. Such events
seem to come closer and closer but do not occur, even when all the conditions are ripe—until suddenly they do.

American journalists at NPR have used it to describe an influx of sexual assault allegations, saying that a tipping point has been passed regarding societal tolerance of sexual harassment and feminism.

Mathematically, the angle of repose may be seen as a bifurcation. In control theory, the concept of positive feedback describes the same phenomenon, with the problem of balancing an inverted pendulum being the classic embodiment. The concept has also been applied to the popular acceptance of new technologies, for example being used to explain the success of VHS over Betamax. 

===Decarbonization===
The concept of social tipping points has been applied to analyze global decarbonization pathways and the ability to activate contagious and fast-spreading processes of social and technological change that would accelerate carbon emission reductions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

A study suggests, &quot;path dependencies, increasing returns to scale and learning-by-doing cost reductions can produce sudden, tipping-point-like transitions that cannot be extrapolated from past system behaviour&quot;, and that &quot;historically, technological innovation and government policies often motivated by energy security concerns have also, in notable cases, spurred rapid shifts in energy systems&quot;.

Moreover, &quot;social norms that shape individual behaviour and preferences can exhibit similar tipping-point style dynamics&quot;, which could affect &quot;the regulatory and market conditions in which energy technologies compete&quot;. When social norms of sustainability are costly – or at least detrimental rather than beneficial – for individuals to violate, this may substantially increase the probability that an individual engages in pro-environmental behaviour.

Removing all subsidies from fossil fuels could intervene the tipping points occur. And researchers also stress the importance of building carbon-neutral cities, which could educate the general public and drive consumer interest in emerging clean technologies.

==In popular culture==
The term was popularized in application to daily life by Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s 2000 bestselling book &quot;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference&quot;.

<text>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.

Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day&#x27;s activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body&#x27;s ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve immune system function, and to meet emergency situations.

== Overview ==

Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term &quot;fitness&quot; increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten. The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine&#x27;s ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.

A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills, and on age- or health-related needs such as bone health. Many sources also cite mental, social and emotional health as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a triangle made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness has been shown to have benefits in preventing ill health and assisting recovery from injury or illness. Along with the physical health benefits of fitness, it has also been shown to have a positive impact on mental health as well by assisting in treating anxiety and depression.
Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many other chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy lifestyle or aging as well and has been listed frequently as one of the most popular and advantageous self-care therapies. Working out can also help some people sleep better by building up sleeping pressure and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of exercise&#x27;s benefits are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.

== Activity guidelines ==
The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans were released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide science-based guidance for people ages 3 years and older to improve their health by participating in regular physical activity. These guidelines recommend that all adults should move more and sit less throughout the day to improve health-related quality of life including mental, emotional, and physical health. For substantial health benefits, adults should perform at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week. The recommendation for physical activity to occur in bouts of at least 10 minutes has been eliminated, as new research suggests that bouts of any length contribute to the health benefits linked to the accumulated volume of physical activity. Additional health benefits may be achieved by engaging in more than 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are of moderate or greater intensity and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.

Guidelines in the United Kingdom released in July 2011 include the following points:
The intensity at which a person exercises is key, and light activity such as strolling and house work is unlikely to have much positive impact on the health of most people. For aerobic exercise to be beneficial, it must raise the heart rate and cause perspiration. A person should do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. There are more health benefits gained if a person exercises beyond 150 minutes.
Sedentary time (time spent not standing, such as when on a chair or in bed) is bad for a person&#x27;s health, and no amount of exercise can negate the effects of sitting for too long.
These guidelines are now much more in line with those used in the U.S., which also includes recommendations for muscle-building and bone-strengthening activities such as lifting weights and yoga.

== Exercise ==
=== Aerobic exercise ===
Cardiorespiratory fitness can be measured using VO2 max, a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize. Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increase stamina, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body&#x27;s oxygen consumption. This form of exercise is an important part of all training regiments, whether for professional athletes or for the everyday person.

Prominent examples of aerobic exercises include:

*Jogging – Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises.
* Working on elliptical trainer – This is a stationary exercise machine used to perform walking, or running without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.
*Walking – Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.
*Treadmill training – Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically warm up first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes.
*Swimming – Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat in water and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.
*Cycling – Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.

=== Anaerobic exercise ===

Anaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that does not require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy. It helps to promote strength, endurance, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity. Anaerobic exercises are thought to increase the metabolic rate, thereby allowing one to burn additional calories as the body recovers from exercise due to an increase in body temperature and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) after the exercise ended.

Prominent examples of anaerobic exercises include:

* Weight training – A common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. 
*Isometric exercise – Helps to maintain strength. A muscle action in which no visible movement occurs and the resistance matches the muscular tension.
*Sprinting – Running short distances as fast as possible, training for muscle explosiveness.
* Interval training – Alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity. This type of activity also builds speed and endurance.

== Training ==
Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person&#x27;s ability to perform in a specific activity, such as sports or military service, with a reasonable efficiency. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport. These include, among others:
* 100 m sprint: In a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.
* Century ride: Cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more.
* Middle distance running: Athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training. The hard-working muscles are at their peak for a longer period of time as they are being used at that level for the longer period of time. 
* Marathon: In this case, the athlete must be trained to work aerobically, and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum.
* Many firefighters and police officers undergo regular fitness testing to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job.
* Members of armed forces are often required to pass a formal fitness test. For example, soldiers of the U.S. Army must be able to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT).
* Hill sprints: Requires a high level of fitness to begin with; the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The Army often trains to do mountain climbing and races.
* Plyometric and isometric exercises: An excellent way to build strength and increase muscular endurance.
* Sand running creates less strain on leg muscles than running on grass or concrete. This is because sand collapses beneath the foot, which softens the landing. Sand training is an effective way to lose weight and become fit, as more effort is needed (one and a half times more) to run on the soft sand than on a hard surface.
* Aquajogging is a form of exercise that decreases strain on joints and bones. The water supplies minimal impact to muscles and bones, which is good for those recovering from injury. Furthermore, the resistance of the water as one jogs through it provides an enhanced effect of exercise (the deeper you are, the greater the force needed to pull your leg through).
* Swimming: Squatting exercise helps in enhancing a swimmer&#x27;s start.

For physical fitness activity to benefit an individual, the exertion must trigger a sufficient amount of stimuli. Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice—and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression. These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.

=== High intensity interval training ===

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed at a high level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low-intensity activity. Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity can have the effect of increasing cardiac benefits for humans when compared with exercising at a low or moderate level. When one&#x27;s workout consists of a HIIT session, their body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost. Research into the benefits of HIIT have shown that it can be very successful for reducing fat, especially around the abdominal region. Furthermore, when compared to continuous moderate exercise, HIIT proves to burn more calories and increase the amount of fat burned post- HIIT session. Lack of time is one of the main reasons stated for not exercising; HIIT is a great alternative for those people because the duration of a HIIT session can be as short as 10 minutes, making it much quicker than conventional workouts.

== Effects ==
=== Controlling blood pressure ===
Physical fitness has been proven to support the body&#x27;s blood pressure. Staying active and exercising regularly builds a stronger heart. The heart is the main organ in charge of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Engaging in a physical activity raises blood pressure. Once the subject stops the activity, the blood pressure returns to normal. The more physical activity, the easier this process becomes, resulting in a fitter cardiovascular profile. Through regular physical fitness, it becomes easier to create a rise in blood pressure. This lowers the force on the arteries, and lowers the overall blood pressure.

=== Cancer prevention ===
Centers for disease control and prevention provide lifestyle guidelines for maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in physical activity to reduce the risk of disease. The WCRF/ American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) published a list of recommendations that reflect the dietary and exercise behaviors which are proven to reduce incidence of cancer.

The WCRF/AICR recommendations include the following: 
* Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight. 
* Each week, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity.
* Children should engage in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity each week.
* Be physically active for at least thirty minutes every day.
* Avoid sugar, and limit the consumption of energy-packed foods.
* Balance one&#x27;s diet with a variety of vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc.
* Limit sodium intake and the consumption of red meats and processed meats.
* Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day.

These recommendations are also widely supported by the American Cancer Society. The guidelines have been evaluated and individuals who have higher guideline adherence scores have substantially reduced cancer risk as well as improved outcomes of a multitude of chronic health problems. Regular physical activity is a factor that helps reduce an individual&#x27;s blood pressure and improves cholesterol levels, two key components that correlate with heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The American Cancer Society encourages the public to &quot;adopt a physically active lifestyle&quot; by meeting the criteria in a variety of physical activities such as hiking, swimming, circuit training, resistance training, lifting, etc. It is understood that cancer is not a disease that can be cured by physical fitness alone, however, because it is a multifactorial disease, physical fitness is a controllable prevention. The large associations between physical fitness and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy of preventative interventions.
The American Cancer Society asserts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider intentional exercise and basic activities performed on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding of what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.

=== Inflammation ===
Studies have shown an association between increased physical activity and reduced inflammation. It produces both a short-term inflammatory response and a long-term anti-inflammatory effect. Physical activity reduces inflammation in conjunction with or independent of changes in body weight. However, the mechanisms linking physical activity to inflammation are unknown.

=== Immune system ===
Physical activity boosts the immune system. This is dependent on the concentration of endogenous factors (such as sex hormones, metabolic hormones and growth hormones), body temperature, blood flow, hydration status and body position. Physical activity has been shown to increase the levels of natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, complements, cytokines, antibodies and T cytotoxic cells. However, the mechanism linking physical activity to immune system is not fully understood.

=== Weight control ===
Achieving resilience through physical fitness promotes a vast and complex range of health-related benefits. Individuals who keep up physical fitness levels generally regulate their distribution of body fat and prevent obesity. Studies prove that running uses calories in the body that come from the macronutrients eaten daily. In order for the body to be able to run, it will use those ingested calories, therefore it will burn calories. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat, is most directly affected by engaging in aerobic exercise. Strength training has been known to increase the amount of muscle in the body, however, it can also reduce body fat. Sex steroid hormones, insulin, and appropriate immune responses are factors that mediate metabolism in relation to abdominal fat. Therefore, physical fitness provides weight control through regulation of these bodily functions.

=== Menopause and physical fitness ===
Menopause is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last menstrual cycle. There are a number of symptoms connected to menopause, most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life. One way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness. Prior to and during menopause, as the female body changes, there can be physical, physiological or internal changes to the body. These changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercise. These changes include:

* Preventing weight gain: around menopause women tend to experience a reduction in muscle mass and an increase in fat levels. Increasing the amount of physical exercise undertaken can help to prevent these changes.
* Reducing the risk of breast cancer: weight loss from regular exercise may offer protection from breast cancer.
* Strengthening bones: physical activity can slow the bone loss associated with menopause, reducing the chance of bone fractures and osteoporosis.
* Reducing the risk of disease: excess weight can increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity can counter these effects.
* Boosting mood: being involved in regular activities can improve psychological health, an effect that can be seen at any age and not just during or after menopause.

The Melbourne Women&#x27;s Midlife Health Project followed 438 women over an eight-year period providing evidence showing that even though physical activity was not associated with vasomotor symptoms (more commonly known as hot flashes) in this cohort at the beginning, women who reported they were physically active every day at the beginning were 49% less likely to have reported bothersome hot flushes. This is in contrast to women whose level of activity decreased and were more likely to experience bothersome hot flushes.

=== Mental health ===

Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being. This improvement is due to an increase in blood flow to the brain, allowing for the release of hormones as well as a decrease of stress hormone levels in the body (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline) while also stimulating the human body&#x27;s mood boosters and natural painkillers. Not only does exercise release these feel-good hormones, it can also help relieve stress and help build confidence. The same way exercising can help humans to have a healthier life, it also can improve sleep quality. Based on studies, even 10 minutes of exercise per day can help insomnia. These trends improve as physical activity is performed on a consistent basis, which makes exercise effective in relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety, positively impacting mental health and bringing about several other benefits. For example:

* Physical activity has been linked to the alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms.
* In patients with schizophrenia, physical fitness has been shown to improve their quality of life and decrease the effects of schizophrenia.
* Being fit can improve one&#x27;s self-esteem.
* Working out can improve one&#x27;s mental alertness and it can reduce fatigue.
* Studies have shown a reduction in stress levels.
* Increased opportunity for social interaction, allowing for improved social skills

To achieve some of these benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least 30–60 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week.

*Different forms of exercise have been proven to improve mental health and reduce the risk of depression, anxiety, and suicide.
*Benefits of Exercise on Mental health include ... Improved sleep, Stress relief, Improvement in mood, Increased energy and stamina, Reduced tiredness that can increase mental alertness. There are beneficial effects for mental health as well as physical health when it comes to exercise.

== History ==
In the 1940s, an emigrant M.D. from Austria named Hans Kraus began testing children in the U.S. and Europe for what he termed, &quot;Muscular Fitness.&quot; (in other words, muscular functionality) Through his testing, he found children in the U.S. to be far less physically capable than European children. Kraus published some alarming papers in various journals and got the attention of some powerful people, including a senator from Pennsylvania who took the findings to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Eisenhower was &quot;shocked.&quot; He set up a series of conferences and committees; then in July 1956, Eisenhower established the President&#x27;s Council on Youth Fitness.

In Greece, physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a gymnasium. Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation&#x27;s ability to train soldiers for an effective military force. Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries.

Gymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful to health. This was a key motivating factor for the forming of a physical culture movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women, and children and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways, it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture.

== Education ==

<text>Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692 – 26 February 1770) was an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque era born in Pirano in the Republic of Venice (now Piran, Slovenia). Tartini was a prolific composer, composing over a hundred pieces for the violin, the majority of them violin concertos. He is best remembered for his Violin Sonata in G Minor (the Devil&#x27;s Trill Sonata).

==Early life==

Tartini was born on 8 April 1692 in Pirano (today part of Slovenia), a town on the peninsula of Istria, in the Republic of Venice to Gianantonio – native of Florence – and Caterina Zangrando, a descendant of one of the oldest aristocratic Piranese families.

It appears Tartini&#x27;s parents intended him to become a Franciscan friar and, in this way, he received basic musical training. Tartini studied violin first at the &quot;collegio delle Scuole Pie&quot; in Capodistria (today Koper).

He studied law at the University of Padua, where he became skilled at fencing. After his father&#x27;s death in 1710, he married Elisabetta Premazore, a woman his father disapproved of because of her poverty, unknown father and greater age (she was 20, he was 18). Unfortunately, Elisabetta was a favourite of the powerful Cardinal Giorgio Cornaro, who promptly charged Tartini with abduction. Tartini fled Padua to go to the monastery of St. Francis in Assisi, where he could escape prosecution. In Assisi he studied under Bohuslav Matěj Černohorský.

==Career==
Legend says when Tartini heard Francesco Maria Veracini&#x27;s playing in 1716, he was impressed by it and dissatisfied with his own skill. He fled to Ancona and locked himself away in a room to practice, according to Charles Burney, &quot;in order to study the use of the bow in more tranquility, and with more convenience than at Venice, as he had a place assigned him in the opera orchestra of that city&quot;.

Tartini&#x27;s skill improved tremendously and, in 1721, he was appointed &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; at the Basilica di Sant&#x27;Antonio in Padua, with a contract that allowed him to play for other institutions if he wished. In Padua, he met and befriended fellow composer and theorist Francesco Antonio Vallotti. Between 1723 and 1725 he was in Prague, where he was master of the chapel of the Count Kinsky.

Tartini was the first known owner of a violin made by Antonio Stradivari in 1715, which Tartini bestowed upon his student Salvini, who in turn gave it to the Polish composer and virtuoso violinist Karol Lipiński upon hearing him perform: the instrument is thus known as the Lipinski Stradivarius. Tartini also owned and played the Antonio Stradivarius violin ex-Vogelweith from 1711.

In 1726, Tartini started a violin school which attracted students from all over Europe. Gradually, Tartini became more interested in the theory of harmony and acoustics and from 1750 to the end of his life he published various treatises, in which he also treated problems of music theory on a mathematical basis.

==Death==
He died of gangrene on 26 February 1770 in Padua.

==Memorials==
Tartini&#x27;s home town, Piran (now in Slovenia), has a statue of him in the square, which was the old harbour, originally Roman, named Tartini Square (, ). Silted up and obsolete, the port was cleared of debris, filled, and redeveloped. One of the old stone warehouses is now the Hotel Giuseppe Tartini. 

His birthday is celebrated by a concert in the main town cathedral.

== Compositions ==

Today, Tartini&#x27;s most famous work is the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Trill Sonata&quot;, a solo violin sonata that requires a number of technically demanding double stop trills and is difficult even by modern standards. According to a legend embroidered upon by Madame Blavatsky, Tartini was inspired to write the sonata by a dream in which the Devil appeared at the foot of his bed playing the violin.

Almost all of Tartini&#x27;s works are violin concerti (at least 135) and violin sonatas. Tartini&#x27;s compositions include some sacred works such as a Miserere, composed between 1739 and 1741 at the request of Pope Clement XII, and a Stabat Mater, composed in 1769. He also composed trio sonatas and a sinfonia in A. Cataloguing Tartini&#x27;s compositions is a challenge for scholars and editors. Tartini never dated his manuscripts, and revised works that had been completed or even published long before, making it difficult to determine when a work was written, when it was revised, and the extent of the revisions. The scholars Minos Dounias and Paul Brainard have attempted to divide Tartini&#x27;s works into periods based entirely on the stylistic characteristics of the music.

Sixty-two manuscripts with compositions of Tartini are housed at the Biblioteca comunale Luciano Benincasa in Ancona.

Luigi Dallapiccola wrote a piece called &quot;Tartiniana&quot; based on various themes by Tartini.

==Theoretical work==
In addition to his work as a composer, Tartini was a music theorist, of a very practical bent. He is credited with the discovery of sum and difference tones, an acoustical phenomenon of particular utility on string instruments (intonation of double-stops can be judged by careful listening to the difference tone, the &quot;terzo suono&quot;). He published his discoveries in a treatise &quot;Trattato di musica secondo la vera scienza dell&#x27;armonia&quot; (Padua, 1754). His treatise on ornamentation was eventually translated into French — though when its influence was rapidly waning, in 1771 — by a certain &quot;P. Denis&quot;, whose introduction called it &quot;unique&quot;; indeed, it was the first published text devoted entirely to ornament and, though it was all but forgotten, as only the printed edition survived, has provided first-hand information on violin technique for modern historically informed performances, once it was published in English translation by Sol Babitz in 1956. Of greater assistance to such performance was Erwin Jacobi&#x27;s published edition. In 1961, Jacobi published a tri-lingual edition consisting of the French (basis of the following two), English (translation by Cuthbert Girdlestone), plus Jacobi&#x27;s own translation into German (Giuseppe Tartini. &quot;Traité des agréments de la musique&quot;, trans. and ed. Erwin Jacobi. Celle: Hermann Moeck Verlag, 1961). Of significant import, Jacobi&#x27;s edition also includes a facsimile of the original Italian found in Venice in 1957, copied in the hand of Giovanni Nicolai (one of Tartini&#x27;s best-known students) and includes an opening section on bowing and a closing section on how to compose cadenzas not previously known. Another copy (though less complete) of the Italian original was found among manuscripts purchased by the University of California, Berkeley in 1958, a collection that also included numerous ornamented versions of slow movements of concertos and sonatas, written in Tartini&#x27;s hand. Minnie Elmer analyzed these ornamented versions in her master&#x27;s thesis at UC, Berkeley in 1959 (Minnie Elmer. &quot;The Improvised Ornamentation of Giuseppe Tartini&quot;. Unpublished M.A. thesis. Berkeley, 1959).

==Publications==

== Fictional portrayal ==
Tartini is mentioned in Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;The Ensouled Violin&quot;, a short story included in the collection &quot;Nightmare Tales&quot;.

The folklore of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s violin&quot;, classically exemplified by a similar story told of Niccolò Paganini, is widespread; it is an instance of the deal with the devil. A modern variant is the country song &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;; the PBS segment on violin in its series &quot;Art&quot; was titled &quot;Art of violin: the devil&#x27;s instrument&quot;.

Tartini&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Trill&quot; is the signature work of a central character in Daniel Silva&#x27;s &quot;The English Assassin&quot;. Anna Rolfe, the daughter of a Swiss banker, is a famous violinist and the sonata features prominently in the novel. The story of Tartini&#x27;s inspirational dream is told. The story also forms the basis of the mystery novel, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Trill,&quot; by violinist and author Gerald Elias.

Tartini&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Trill&quot; is also featured in the Japanese anime &quot;Descendants of Darkness&quot; (&quot;Yami no Matsuei&quot;). The three-part story is also named after the composition.

<doc id="432989" wikidata="Q934370" url="?curid=432989" title="Needham–Schroeder protocol">
<text>The Needham–Schroeder protocol is one of the two key transport protocols intended for use over an insecure network, both proposed by Roger Needham and Michael Schroeder. These are:
* The &quot;Needham–Schroeder Symmetric Key Protocol&quot;, based on a symmetric encryption algorithm. It forms the basis for the Kerberos protocol. This protocol aims to establish a session key between two parties on a network, typically to protect further communication.
* The &quot;Needham–Schroeder Public-Key Protocol&quot;, based on public-key cryptography. This protocol is intended to provide mutual authentication between two parties communicating on a network, but in its proposed form is insecure.

== Symmetric protocol ==
Here, Alice formula_1 initiates the communication to Bob . formula_2 is a server trusted by both parties. In the communication:
* formula_3 and formula_4 are identities of Alice and Bob respectively
* formula_5 is a symmetric key known only to formula_3 and formula_2
* formula_8 is a symmetric key known only to formula_4 and formula_2
* formula_11 and formula_12 are nonces generated by formula_3 and formula_4 respectively
* formula_15 is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between formula_3 and formula_4

The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation:

: formula_18
:: Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob.
: formula_19
:: The server generates formula_15 and sends back to Alice a copy encrypted under formula_8 for Alice to forward to Bob and also a copy for Alice. Since Alice may be requesting keys for several different people, the nonce assures Alice that the message is fresh and that the server is replying to that particular message and the inclusion of Bob&#x27;s name tells Alice who she is to share this key with.
: formula_22
:: Alice forwards the key to Bob who can decrypt it with the key he shares with the server, thus authenticating the data.
: formula_23
:: Bob sends Alice a nonce encrypted under formula_15 to show that he has the key.
: formula_25
:: Alice performs a simple operation on the nonce, re-encrypts it and sends it back verifying that she is still alive and that she holds the key.

=== Attacks on the protocol ===
The protocol is vulnerable to a replay attack (as identified by Denning and Sacco). If an attacker uses an older, compromised value for , he can then replay the message formula_26 to Bob, who will accept it, being unable to tell that the key is not fresh.

=== Fixing the attack ===
This flaw is fixed in the Kerberos protocol by the inclusion of a timestamp. It can also be fixed with the use of nonces as described below. At the beginning of the protocol:
: formula_27
:: Alice sends to Bob a request.
: formula_28
:: Bob responds with a nonce encrypted under his key with the Server.
: formula_29
:: Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob.
: formula_30
:: Note the inclusion of the nonce.

The protocol then continues as described through the final three steps as described in the original protocol above. Note that formula_31 is a different nonce from . The inclusion of this new nonce prevents the replaying of a compromised version of formula_26 since such a message would need to be of the form formula_33 which the attacker can&#x27;t forge since she does not have .

== Public-key protocol ==
This assumes the use of a public-key encryption algorithm.

Here, Alice formula_1 and Bob formula_35 use a trusted server formula_36 to distribute public keys on request. These keys are:
* formula_37 and , respectively public and private halves of an encryption key-pair belonging to formula_3 (formula_2 stands for &quot;secret key&quot; here)
* formula_40 and , similar belonging to formula_4
* formula_42 and , similar belonging to . (Note that this key-pair will be used for digital signatures, i.e., formula_43 used for signing a message and formula_42 used for verification. formula_42 must be known to formula_3 and formula_4 before the protocol starts.)

The protocol runs as follows:
: formula_48
:: formula_3 requests &#x27;s public keys from .
: formula_50
:: formula_2 responds with public key formula_40 alongside &#x27;s identity, signed by the server for authentication purposes.
: formula_53
:: formula_3 chooses a random formula_11 and sends it to .
: formula_56
:: formula_4 now knows A wants to communicate, so formula_4 requests &#x27;s public keys.
: formula_59
:: Server responds.
: formula_60
:: formula_4 chooses a random , and sends it to formula_3 along with formula_11 to prove ability to decrypt with .
: formula_64
:: formula_3 confirms formula_12 to , to prove ability to decrypt with .

At the end of the protocol, formula_3 and formula_4 know each other&#x27;s identities, and know both formula_11 and . These nonces are not known to eavesdroppers.

=== An attack on the protocol ===
This protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. If an impostor formula_70 can persuade formula_3 to initiate a session with them, they can relay the messages to formula_4 and convince formula_4 that he is communicating with .

Ignoring the traffic to and from formula_2, which is unchanged, the attack runs as follows:
: formula_75
:: formula_3 sends formula_11 to , who decrypts the message with .
: formula_78
:: formula_70 relays the message to , pretending that formula_3 is communicating.
: formula_81
:: formula_4 sends formula_12.
: formula_84
:: formula_70 relays it to .
: formula_86
:: formula_3 decrypts formula_88 and confirms it to , who learns it.
: formula_89
:: formula_70 re-encrypts , and convinces formula_4 that she&#x27;s decrypted it.

At the end of the attack, formula_4 falsely believes that formula_3 is communicating with him, and that formula_11 and formula_12 are known only to formula_3 and .

The following example illustrates the attack. Alice () would like to contact her bank (). We assume that an impostor () successfully convinces formula_3 that they are the bank. As a consequence, formula_3 uses the public key of formula_70 instead of using the public key of formula_4 to encrypt the messages she intends to send to her bank. Therefore, formula_3 sends formula_70 her nonce encrypted with the public key of . formula_70 decrypts the message using their private key and contacts formula_4 sending it the nonce of formula_3 encrypted with the public key of formula_4. formula_4 has no way to know that this message was actually sent by . formula_4 responds with their own nonce and encrypts the message with the public key of . Since formula_70 is not in possession of the private key of formula_3 they have to relay the message to formula_3 without knowing the content. A decrypts the message with her private key and respond with the nonce of formula_4 encrypted with the public key of . formula_70 decrypts the message using their private key and is now in possession of nonce formula_3 and . Therefore, they can now impersonate the bank and the client respectively.

=== Fixing the man-in-the-middle attack ===
The attack was first described in a 1995 paper by Gavin Lowe.
The paper also describes a fixed version of the scheme, referred to as the Needham–Schroeder–Lowe protocol. The fix involves the modification of message six to include the responder&#x27;s identity, that is we replace:
: formula_60
with the fixed version:
: formula_116
and the intruder cannot successfully replay the message because A is expecting a message containing the identity of I whereas the message will have identity of .

<text>Thomas Mundy Peterson (October 6, 1824 – February 4, 1904) of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, has been claimed to be the first African American to vote in an election under the just-enacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

His vote was cast on March 31, 1870; the Amendment had been ratified almost two months earlier, on February 3, but was only officially certified by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish on March 30.

==Biography==
Peterson was born in Metuchen, New Jersey. His father, also named Thomas, worked for the Mundy family. His mother, Lucy Green, was a slave of Hugh Newell (1744–1816) of Freehold Township, New Jersey. She was manumitted at age 21 by Newell&#x27;s will. After moving to Perth Amboy, Peterson married Daphne Reeves, whose mother, Bette, had been a slave on an estate of Andrew Bell in Perth Amboy.

For several years (between 1871 and 1878) Peterson was an employee of the Board of Education, serving as a custodian of School No. 1 located on State Street in Perth Amboy. He was also a general handyman around town and was active in both the United States Republican Party and the Prohibition Party. It has been claimed that he also holds the distinction of being the city&#x27;s first &quot;colored&quot; person to serve on a jury, however, no direct evidence has been found.
Peterson is most notably remembered for voting in the local election held at Perth Amboy City Hall over the town&#x27;s charter. Some citizens wanted to revise the existing charter while others wished to abandon the charter altogether in favor of a township form of government. Peterson cast his ballot in favor of revising the existing charter. This side won 230 to 63. Peterson was afterward appointed to be a member of the committee of seven that made subsequent amendments leading to the final version that was approved by the State Legislature on April 5, 1871. Historical records as to his contribution to revisions in the form of minutes, writing, or other records are still wanting. Through his work on the committee, he helped shape the city&#x27;s educational system by aiding in organization of the Perth Amboy Board of Education in 1870 and construction of School No. 1, the city&#x27;s first public school. When the school opened for classes in 1871, 378 students enrolled and Peterson became its first custodian. 

To honor Thomas Mundy Peterson as the first African-American voter after the passage of the 15th Amendment, the citizens of Perth Amboy raised $70 ($ in dollars) to award him with a gold medal. The full medal consists of a gold bar from which a two-inch diameter medallion was hung. The hanging medal featured a profile bust of a clean-shaven Abraham Lincoln. It was presented to Thomas Mundy Peterson on Memorial Day, which was then called Decoration Day, May 30, 1884. The celebrations included a mass meeting to honor Mr. Peterson, held at the City Hall. The committee in charge was composed of James Lawrence Kearny, Patrick Convery, both of whom had been city officials; J.M Boggs, former collector of the port; Alderman John Fothergill; Ex-Mayor Uriah Burdge Watson; and I.T. Golding, former city official. The committee was representative of the Democratic and Republican parties. There was a program of speaking in tribute to Mr. Peterson, presided by Mayor James M. Chapman. The Reverend Dr. David Stevenson, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church, delivered the invocation. The principal speaker was Ex-Mayor William Paterson, Judge of the Court of Errors and Appeals. James Kearny, on behalf of the people of Perth Amboy, presented Mr. Peterson with his medal, which he is said to have loved and never considered himself properly dressed without it affixed to his left breast. 

Charles F. Hartman (1888-1953) was a prominent Mississippi book dealer known for collecting and dealing in African-Americana and materials related to the history of the American South. As described by Heartman in 1945, &quot;Little remains to be said. Peterson-Mundy sported a beard, and a portrait of him, wearing the medal, is known. In his old age, when he could not hold a full-time job, he was occasionally in want. Too proud to ask for anything, voluntary charitable administrations of his friends were apparently not sufficient, and it seems that on several occasions he had to pledge the medal for a small loan, to be redeemed at the earliest possible moment, until one day the greatest redeemer took hold of him, with the pledge unclaimed. It [the medal] passed into the hands of the Honorable Harold E. Pickersgill, Recorder of the City of Perth Amboy for many years, an indefatigable collector of New Jerseyana. It was one of his prized possessions. Some time after the judge&#x27;s death I was fortunate to acquire the medal, an important memorabilia in the collection, where also can be found the pamphlet describing the history and transactions for the presentation, as well as a pencil-portrait sketch of Thomas Peterson-Mundy.&quot; In 1948 Xavier University of Louisiana acquired a large portion of Heartman&#x27;s Collection of Material Relating to the Negro Culture, the Peterson-Mundy medal included. It is presently preserved in the XULA Library Archives &amp; Special Collections and has been utilized for exhibitions at numerous historical institutions including the National Museum of African American History and Culture. 

While he is known today as &quot;Thomas Mundy Peterson,&quot; there are no contemporary records that include the three names together. The one exception is the cover for the program describing the ceremony when he was given the &quot;voting medal,&quot; and that calls him &quot;Thomas Peterson-Mundy.&quot; Contemporary documents refer to him as either Thomas Peterson or Thomas (or Tom) Mundy. His death certificate, the undertaker&#x27;s accounts book, and a land deed all refer to him as &quot;Thomas H. Peterson.&quot; In the obituary appearing in &quot;The Perth Amboy Evening News,&quot; he is called Thomas Henry Peterson.

==Legacy==
In October 1989, the school where Peterson had worked was renamed after him. It is currently on State Street, Perth Amboy.

In New Jersey, March 31 is annually celebrated as &quot;Thomas Mundy Peterson Day&quot; in recognition of his historic vote.

Peterson may well have been the first to vote after the ratification of the 15th Amendment — a result of his local election happening to be scheduled the day after the amendment&#x27;s ratification. But he was far from being, as is often claimed, the first African American to vote in an election.

Several New England towns and Northern states had allowed some free men of color to vote since colonial days, though some later rescinded those rights. New Jersey had allowed black residents to vote if they met residency and property requirements until 1807. And several states of the former Confederacy had allowed black suffrage earlier in Reconstruction; Louisiana, for example, had elected the nation&#x27;s first black lieutenant governor, first black mayor, and first black elected member of Congress in 1868, each largely on the votes of freedmen.

In all, more than 700,000 African Americans had cast votes in U.S. elections before Peterson.

<doc id="433005" wikidata="Q1448484" url="?curid=433005" title="The Emperor's New Mind">
<text>The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics is a 1989 book by the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose.

Penrose argues that human consciousness is non-algorithmic, and thus is not capable of being modeled by a conventional Turing machine, which includes a digital computer. Penrose hypothesizes that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in the understanding of human consciousness. The collapse of the quantum wavefunction is seen as playing an important role in brain function.

Most of the book is spent reviewing, for the scientifically-minded lay-reader, a plethora of interrelated subjects such as Newtonian physics, special and general relativity, the philosophy and limitations of mathematics, quantum physics, cosmology, and the nature of time. Penrose intermittently describes how each of these bears on his developing theme: that consciousness is not &quot;algorithmic&quot;. Only the later portions of the book address the thesis directly.

==Overview==
Penrose states that his ideas on the nature of consciousness are speculative, and his thesis is considered erroneous by some experts in the fields of philosophy, computer science, and robotics.

&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot; attacks the claims of artificial intelligence using the physics of computing: Penrose notes that the present home of computing lies more in the tangible world of classical mechanics than in the imponderable realm of quantum mechanics. The modern computer is a deterministic system that for the most part simply executes algorithms. Penrose shows that, by reconfiguring the boundaries of a billiard table, one might make a computer in which the billiard balls act as message carriers and their interactions act as logical decisions. The billiard-ball computer was first designed some years ago by Edward Fredkin and Tommaso Toffoli of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Reception==
Following the publication of the book, Penrose began to collaborate with Stuart Hameroff on a biological analog to quantum computation involving microtubules, which became the foundation for his subsequent book, &quot;Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness&quot;.

Penrose won the Science Book Prize in 1990 for &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot;.

According to an article in the &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot;, Penrose incorrectly claims a barrier far away from a localized particle can affect the particle.

<doc id="433006" wikidata="Q445413" url="?curid=433006" title="Intershop">
<text>Intershop was a chain of government-owned and operated retail stores in the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) in which only hard currencies (and later Forum checks) could be used to purchase high-quality goods, usually from or associated with Western countries. The East German mark was not accepted as payment. Intershop was originally oriented towards visitors from Western countries, and later became an outlet where East Germans could purchase goods they could not otherwise obtain. An unintended consequence was that ordinary East Germans had some insight into the selection of goods available in the West, which they could then compare with the rather limited offerings available in their own country.

==Product offerings==
Intershops sold imported products such as cigarettes, liquor, appliances and even car accessories. It even sold quality East German products that were exported and then re-imported. Those items were sometimes sold at a lower price than the same product, as sold in domestic shops.

== History ==
Intershop was founded on 14 December 1962 as a publicly owned company (Volkseigener Betrieb - VEB). Its purpose was to increase the flow of hard currency into the GDR. There was such a lack of foreign currency that even small amounts were welcome. The groups targeted were mainly tourists and other foreigners in transit from the West. The first mobile carts were in the Berlin Friedrichstraße station, where tax-free cigarettes were sold for much less than in West Berlin. Little by little, alcohol and other goods were gradually added. By 1962, annual sales totalled more than one million Deutsche Marks (DM).

Originally, Intershop was organised as a division of Mitropa, the company that provided catering services to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. With the arrival of the first Interhotels, which were intended to house Western tourists, Intershops also began appearing in these Western-oriented hotels. One could also purchase items in one&#x27;s room (via room service) with hard currency. Over time, these hotel-based Intershops grew as well.

Later, Intershops were opened at border crossings, rest stops and transit stops on the GDR Autobahns, railway stations, bus stations, ferry terminals and airports. As an example of the GDR regime&#x27;s desire for hard currency, in the 1980s, in the Berlin Friedrichstraße underground (U-Bahn) station, there was an Intershop kiosk on the platform of the U6 line created specifically for travellers from West Berlin who may not have wanted to pass through the GDR border controls. One could disembark from the underground train, make a purchase, and then get back on the next train, and go back to West Berlin, all without passing through the GDR border controls. Purchases could be paid for with any fully convertible currency, such as US dollars, Pounds Sterling, Swiss francs, and especially West German marks.

Until 1974, GDR citizens were not allowed to hold foreign currency. By decree of the Council of Ministers of the GDR (&quot;Ministerrat der DDR&quot;), this ban was relaxed in that year, and East Germans were then allowed to shop in most Intershops. The Intershops at Autobahn rest stops (so-called &quot;Transitshops&quot;), which were sometimes self-service, were still only for travellers from non-socialist countries and required travel documents for entry. Additionally, certain duty-free items such as tobacco, spirits, coffee, perfume, brand name clothing, watches and jewellery required a foreign passport. The prices for these goods were significantly lower than in West Germany or West Berlin, while the other goods that would have interested East Germans were relatively expensive. East Germans could not legally exchange East German marks for hard currency. The only legal ways for East Germans to acquire hard currency were either as gifts from relatives living in the West or wages earned for work in Western countries.

For East Germans without hard currency, there were 300 Exquisit shops (which sold higher priced clothing, shoes, and cosmetics) from 1962 onwards and 550 Delikat shops (which sold high end and gourmet food items) from 1976 onwards. Most of the goods sold in Exquisit and Delikat shops were of East German origin but were normally unavailable in the regular state-run stores. These shops were intended to give East Germans access to high-quality goods and to absorb surplus purchasing power.

In 1977, Erich Honecker said, &quot;These shops obviously aren&#x27;t permanent companions of socialism. But we can&#x27;t ignore the fact that the rising number of visitors is bringing more such currency among us than before.&quot; Honecker made these remarks in response to criticism that Intershops were a key driver of inequality. In the same speech, Honecker defended trade with capitalist countries. He said, &quot;Naturally, we haven&#x27;t overlooked the fact that the citizens of the German Democratic Republic who have no such funds are at a disadvantage, in a certain sense, compared to those who have such currency at their disposal.&quot; Honecker said the 9.5 million yearly visitors from capitalist countries &quot;who eat with us, usually spend the night and obviously also have money in their pockets. Through the Intershops, we have created the possibility that these funds stay with us in the country.&quot;

Starting in April 1979, East Germans were required to convert hard currency at the East German state bank &quot;(Staatsbank der DDR)&quot; into the so-called &quot;forum check&quot;. A forum check mark had a value of one West German mark. The &quot;Forum Außenhandelsgesellschaft mbH&quot; was responsible for the management of Intershops and had 900 employees.

By 1978, there were reportedly 100 Intershops in operation across East Germany. It was noted that Intershop gave an opportunity for West German companies, as well as companies based in the West, to sell consumer goods to a communist bloc country. The rise of Intershop was noted to have created a visibly separate social class in East Germany, where people who had access to an Intershop, as well as the means to shop there, were seen consuming items offered by the chain. Consumerism promoted by the existence of Intershop also caused labour disputes in some areas, with workers demanding part of their salary to be paid in hard currency so that they could shop at Intershop.

The Ministry of State Security (Stasi) monitored the Intershops very closely, with relatives of Stasi employees or officials often working as cashiers. In some stores, security cameras were present, and in the beginning, passports were even checked. The transport of these goods was closely monitored as well. Even so, there were numerous thefts and even some armed robberies of Intershop stores. The investigations of these crimes always involved the Stasi as well as the regular police. In many cases, store managers and employees were involved in the crimes. Beginning in the 1980s, a portion of the salary of Intershop workers was paid in hard currency and additionally employees had to surrender their tips, according to regulations, in order to curb these problems.

The Intershops were dissolved upon the reunification of Germany in 1990. 

Because photographing in Intershops was not allowed, there are few photographs of the inside of the stores. Most of those that do exist are from the Stasi archives. A West German photographer, Günter Schneider, collected numerous photos of Intershops while working on a larger report about the transit corridors in East Germany.

<text>Wally Heider Studios was a recording studio founded in San Francisco in 1969 by recording engineer and studio owner Wally Heider. Between 1969 and 1980, numerous notable artists recorded at the studios, including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jefferson Airplane, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and The Grateful Dead. The studio changed ownership in 1980 and was renamed Hyde Street Studios, which is still in operation today.

==History==
===Background===
Wally Heider had apprenticed with as an engineer and mixer at Bill Putnam&#x27;s United Western Recorders studio complex in Hollywood in the early 1960s, after which he founded Wally Heider Recording with the opening of Studio 3 at 1604 N. Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. Heider and his crew garnered a high reputation for top notch engineering that resulted in excellent studio and remote location recordings, including sessions with the Beach Boys and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

In 1967, Heider assisted in the live recording of the Monterey Pop Festival. Artists from the Bay Area such as Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Grateful Dead had been recording in Los Angeles and New York, and Heider saw the need for musicians involved in the nascent San Francisco sound to have their own well-equipped and staffed recording studio close to home.

===Hyde Street===
In March 1969, Heider opened Wally Heider Studios at 245 Hyde Street, San Francisco, between Turk and Eddy Streets, across the street from Black Hawk jazz club, in a building that had previously been used by 20th Century Fox for film offices, screening rooms and storage. The studios were built by Dave Mancini.

Heider planned four studios—A and B on the ground floor and C and D upstairs. However, studio B was never finished and instead became a game room. The studio commenced operations in May 1969 upon completion of Studio C, with staff that included General Manager Mel Tanner, Booking Agent Ginger Mews, Technician Harry Sitam, and Staff Engineer Russ Gary. Studio C&#x27;s dimensions were similar to Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood—though its control room, instead of being at the end the room, was parallel to Studio C&#x27;s long side. The walls were kept from being parallel with square gypsum devices that were used as mid-range sound diffusers and absorbers. At the Grateful Dead&#x27;s request, its studio doors were covered with airbrushed paintings. Studios A and D became operational a few months later.

Frank DeMedio, who had designed the 24-channel mixing console and an 8-channel monitor and cue—replicated for Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 and remote truck in Hollywood, built all of the custom equipment and mixing console for Heider&#x27;s new Hyde Street studios, using Universal Audio (UA) console components, military grade switches and level controls, and a simple audio path that used one preamp for everything in a channel. Monitor speakers were Altec 604-Es with McIntosh 275 tube power amps.

The first release out of Studio C was Jefferson Airplane’s &quot;Volunteers&quot;, which was also the first album they recorded in their hometown. Between 1969 and 1970, many other high-profile acts followed, including Harry Nilsson, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the Steve Miller Band. Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded several albums in that room, and named their record, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; after the &quot;factory&quot; at Studio C (Cosmo&#x27;s Factory was CCR&#x27;s rehearsal area). Engineers and staff at the studio during that time included Bill Halverson, Stephen Barncard, and Glyn Johns, and Allen Zentz.

While CSNY were recording, Studio D – an exact replica of Heider&#x27;s Studio 3 in Hollywood – opened. Among the first things to be recorded in Studio D was Jerry Garcia&#x27;s pedal steel guitar overdub for &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;, while the live recording setup was kept intact in Studio C where CSNY recorded. In that same period, Deane Jensen supervised installation of a new Quad Eight console in Studio A. Santana and John Hall used Studio D a few times. CBS Records had a priority lease on Studio D for a year, before eventually taking over Coast Recorders as their west coast recording facility. Many other artists followed.

In 1978, Heider sold the studio and its name to Filmways, but remained as manager until 1980 when Filmways sold it to a partnership composed of Dan Alexander, Tom Sharples, and Michael Ward. The three partners renamed the business Hyde Street Studios, which is still an operating recording studio as of 2019, now owned solely by Michael Ward.

<doc id="433009" wikidata="Q1320237" url="?curid=433009" title="Otway–Rees protocol">
<text>The Otway–Rees protocol is a computer network authentication protocol designed for use on insecure networks (e.g. the Internet). It allows individuals communicating over such a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks and allowing for the detection of modification.

The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation, where Alice is authenticating herself to Bob using a server S (M is a session-identifier, NA and NB are nonces):

# formula_1
# formula_2
# formula_3
# formula_4

Note: The above steps do not authenticate B to A.

This is one of the protocols analysed by Burrows, Abadi and Needham in the paper that introduced an early version of Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic.

== Attacks on the protocol ==
There are a variety of attacks on this protocol currently published.

=== Interception attacks ===
These attacks leave the intruder with the session key and may exclude one of the parties from the conversation.

Boyd and Mao observe that the original description does not require that S check the plaintext A and B to be the same as the A and B in the two ciphertexts. This allows an intruder masquerading as B to intercept the first message, then send the second message to S constructing the second ciphertext using its own key and naming itself in the plaintext. The protocol ends with A sharing a session key with the intruder rather than B.

Gürgens and Peralta describe another attack which they name an arity attack. In this attack the intruder intercepts the second message and replies to B using the two ciphertexts from message 2 in message 3. In the absence of any check to prevent it, M (or perhaps M,A,B) becomes the session key between A and B and is known to the intruder.

Cole describes both the Gürgens and Peralta arity attack and another attack in his book Hackers Beware. In this the intruder intercepts the first message, removes the plaintext A,B and uses that as message 4 omitting messages 2 and 3. This leaves A communicating with the intruder using M (or M,A,B) as the session key.

=== Disruptive attacks ===
This attack allows the intruder to disrupt the communication but does not allow the intruder to gain access to it.

One problem with this protocol is that a malicious intruder can arrange for A and B to end up with different keys. Here is how: after A and B execute the first three messages, B has received the key formula_5. The intruder then intercepts the fourth message. He resends message 2, which results in S generating a new key formula_6, subsequently sent to B. The intruder intercepts this message too, but sends to A the part of it that B would have sent to A. So now A has finally received the expected fourth message, but with formula_6 instead of formula_5.

<doc id="433010" wikidata="Q5097851" url="?curid=433010" title="Child labor laws in the United States">
<text>Child labor laws in the United States address issues related to the employment and welfare of working children in the United States. The most sweeping federal law that restricts the employment and abuse of child workers is the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), which came into force during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Child labor provisions under FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. FLSA restricts the hours that youth under 16 years of age can work and lists hazardous occupations too dangerous for young workers to perform.

==Federal law==
The main law regulating child labor in the United States is the Fair Labor Standards Act. For non-agricultural jobs, children under 14 may not be employed, children between 14 and 16 may be employed in allowed occupations during limited hours, and children between 16 and 17 may be employed for unlimited hours in non-hazardous occupations. A number of exceptions to these rules exist, such as for employment by parents, newspaper delivery, and child actors. The regulations for agricultural employment are generally less strict.

==State laws ==
States have varying laws covering youth employment. Each state has minimum requirements such as, earliest age a child may begin working, number of hours a child is allowed to be working during the day, number of hours a child is allowed to be worked during the week. The United States Department of Labor lists the minimum requirements for agricultural work in each state. Where state law differs from federal law on child labor, the law with the more rigorous standard applies.

Individual states have a wide range of restrictions on labor by minors, often requiring work permits for minors who are still enrolled in high school, limiting the times and hours that minors can work by age and imposing additional safety regulations.

By 2023, states such as New Jersey and Arkansas had loosened child labor restrictions following the lessening of the COVID-19 pandemic severity, with violations increasing nationwide as a tight labor market increased worker demand. Modifications included lowering the age in which children could work certain jobs, expanding the number of and timing of hours they could be required to work, often to include school time, and shielding businesses from civil liability for work-related injuries, illnesses, or deaths sustained by such workers.

==History of children&#x27;s labor for wages==
== Employment certificates ==
The federal legal system had limited powers to pass child labor laws primarily due to the constitution that gave parents the right to raise their children as they pleased. It was a matter for the states to deal with and created their own child labor laws including age and schooling requirements. For regular, full-time work, &quot;age and schooling certificates&quot;, &quot;work permits&quot;, or &quot;employment certificates&quot; were issued in States to children, usually 14 or 15, before they may go to work in certain occupations, generally manufacturing, and mercantile. No certifications were required for agriculture, street trades, and work in private households.

==Reformation of child labor laws==
The start of the 20th century was the time when reform efforts became widespread. The National Child Labor Committee, an organization dedicated to the abolition of all child labor, was formed in 1904. By publishing information on the lives and working conditions of young workers, it helped to mobilize popular support for state-level child labor laws. These laws were often paired with compulsory education laws which were designed to curtail child labor to an extent, keep children in school, and out Of the paid labor market until a specified age (usually 12, 14, or 16 years.) In 1906 Republican Senator Albert J. Beveridge introduced the first child labor bill at the national level that brought heightened attention to the topic. The bill was later turned down by President Theodore Roosevelt.
In 1916, under pressure from the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) and the National Consumers League, the United States Congress passed the Keating–Owen Act, outlawing interstate commerce involving goods produced by employees under the ages of 14, 15 or 16, depending on the type of work. Southern Democrats were opposed but did not filibuster the bill. President Woodrow Wilson had ignored the issue but now endorsed the bill at the last minute under pressure from party leaders who stressed how popular the idea was, especially among the emerging class of women voters. He told Democratic Congressmen they needed to pass this law and also a workman&#x27;s compensation law to satisfy the national progressive movement and to win the 1916 election against a reunited GOP. Child labor had officially become an issue of concern to the federal government and it was the first federal child labor law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law in &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; (1918) because it regulated commerce that did not cross state lines. Congress used its taxing power by passing a 10-percent tax on businesses that used child labor, but that was struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;Bailey v. Drexel Furniture&quot; (1923). Child labor was significantly reduced by the 1930s.

In response to these setbacks, Congress, on June 2, 1924, approved a Constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to regulate &quot;labor of persons under eighteen years of age&quot;, and submitted it to the states for ratification. Only five states ratified the amendment in the 1920s. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration supported it, and another 14 states signed on in 1933 (his first year in office); 28 states in all had given their approval by 1937. An additional 8 states were needed at the time to ratify the proposed amendment.

The common legal opinion on federal child labor regulation reversed in the 1930s. Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 regulating the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age, and the Supreme Court upheld the law. After this shift, the amendment has been described as &quot;moot&quot; and effectively part of the Constitution.

==Agricultural child labor==

However, while the 1938 labor law placed limits on many forms of child labor, agricultural labor was excluded. As a result, approximately 500,000 children pick almost a quarter of the food currently produced in the United States.

According to a 2010 petition by Human Rights Watch:Hundreds of thousands of children are employed as farm workers in the United States, often working 10 or more hours a day. They are often exposed to dangerous pesticides, experience high rates of injury, and suffer fatalities at five times the rate of other working youth. Their long hours contribute to alarming drop-out rates. Government statistics show that barely half ever finish high school. According to the National Safety Council, agriculture is the second most dangerous occupation in the United States. However, current US child labor laws allow child farm workers to work longer hours, at younger ages, and under more hazardous conditions than other working youths. While children in other sectors must be 12 to be employed and cannot work more than 3 hours on a school day, in agriculture, children can work at age 12 for unlimited hours before and after school.

<text>Hippuris vulgaris (from – &quot;horse&quot; and – &quot;tail&quot;), known as mare&#x27;s-tail or common mare&#x27;s-tail, is a common aquatic plant of Eurasia and North America ranging from Greenland to the Tibetan Plateau to Arizona. It prefers non-acidic waters.

==Description==

The common mare&#x27;s tail is a creeping, perennial herb, found in shallow waters and mud flats. It roots underwater, but most of its leaves are above the water surface. The leaves occur in whorls of 6–12; those above water are 0.5 to 2.5 cm long and up to 3 mm wide, whereas those under water are thinner and limper, and longer than those above water, especially in deeper streams. The stems are solid and unbranched but often curve, and can be up to 60 cm long. In shallow water they project 20–30 cm out of the water. It grows from stout rhizomes. The flowers are inconspicuous, and not all plants produce them. Studies of &quot;H. vulgaris&quot; in the Tibetan Plateau have shown that it is a prolific methane emitter. The roots of &quot;H. vulgaris&quot; extend into the anoxic zone of wetland soils and create a conduit for methane produced in the anoxic zone to travel to the atmosphere.

==Uses==
It can also be a troublesome weed, obstructing the flow of water in rivers and ditches.

<text>Kevin Michael &quot;GG&quot; Allin (born Jesus Christ Allin; August 29, 1956 – June 28, 1993) was an American punk rock musician who performed and recorded with many groups during his career. His live performances often featured transgressive acts, including self-mutilation, defecating on stage, and assaulting audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions. AllMusic called him &quot;the most spectacular degenerate in rock n&#x27; roll history&quot;, while G4TV&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Tough&quot; labelled him the &quot;toughest rock star in the world&quot;.

Known more for his notorious stage antics than his music, Allin recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in spoken word, country, and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics often expressed themes of violence and misanthropy.

Allin&#x27;s music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and met with mostly negative reviews from critics, although he maintained a cult following throughout and after his career. Allin promised for several years that he would commit suicide on stage during one of his concerts, but he instead died from a drug overdose on June 28, 1993, at age 36.

==Early life==
Allin was born Jesus Christ Allin at Weeks Memorial Hospital in Lancaster, New Hampshire, the younger of two sons born to Merle Colby Allin Sr. (1923–2001) and Arleta Gunther (1936–2019). He was given this name because his father told his wife that Jesus Christ had visited him, and told him that his newborn son would be a great man in the vein of the Messiah. During early childhood, Allin&#x27;s older brother Merle Jr. was unable to pronounce &quot;Jesus&quot; properly and called him &quot;Jeje&quot;, which became &quot;GG&quot;.

Allin&#x27;s family lived in a log cabin with no running water or electricity in Groveton, New Hampshire. His father was an abusive religious fanatic who threatened his family with death, digging graves in their cellar and threatening to fill them in the near future. In an essay titled &quot;The First Ten Years&quot;, Allin wrote that Merle Sr. wanted to kill his family in a murder–suicide. He &quot;despised pleasure&quot; and allowed his family &quot;very little contact with others&quot;. They lived a &quot;primitive existence&quot; and &quot;were more like prisoners than a family&quot;. Allin also stated that his mother attempted to escape before she filed for divorce, but Merle Sr. thwarted the attempt by kidnapping Allin. Allin said that he was glad to experience such an upbringing, and that it &quot;made [him] a warrior soul at an early age.&quot;

In 1961, Arleta filed for divorce from Merle Sr., as his mental instability was worsening. Allin and his brother were from that time raised by their mother and stepfather, and settled in East St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in 1966. Allin, a poor student, was placed in special education classes and required to repeat the third grade. According to his older brother, he experienced bullying by fellow students for nonconformity. In his second year of high school, he began attending school cross-dressed, which he said was inspired by the New York Dolls. When asked about his childhood, Allin said that it was &quot;very chaotic. Full of chances and dangers. We sold drugs, stole, broke into houses, cars. Did whatever we wanted to for the most part – including all the bands we played in. People even hated us back then.&quot;

==Recording career==

===Early years===
Allin&#x27;s earliest musical influences were 1960s British Invasion bands including Mott the Hoople and the Dave Clark Five. In the early 1970s, Alice Cooper became an important influence on Allin. Allin&#x27;s earliest recorded musical endeavors were as a drummer. He also wrote most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays bass guitar, formed their first band, Little Sister&#x27;s Date, which lasted a little over a year. The group covered songs by Aerosmith, Kiss, and other popular rock bands of the time period. Both Allin and Merle gained a strong interest in punk rock. The MC5 and the Stooges were major influences on Allin.

He graduated from Concord High School in Concord, Vermont, in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penney, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977.

From September 1977 to April 1984, he fronted the Jabbers. Allin&#x27;s 1980 debut album was &quot;Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be&quot; for Orange Records. In addition to singing, he played drums on most tracks. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint. At one point, industry veteran and the Dead Boys producer Genya Ravan served as his manager. Tension within the Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising, and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded the spring of 1984. Their second to last show was opening for Charged GBH.

===Mid-period and more extreme live performances===

Allin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in Peoria, Illinois. According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, &quot;I was with him when he bought the Ex-Lax. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would&#x27;ve shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking &quot;nuts&quot;!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was &quot;incredible&quot;.&quot; Defecation became a regular part of his stage act.

Allin idolized country music legend Hank Williams and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few (if any) possessions, and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin&#x27;s acoustic output, documented on the EP &quot;The Troubled Troubador&quot;, was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Family Tradition&quot; and David Allan Coe&#x27;s &quot;Longhaired Redneck&quot;, calling his own versions &quot;Scumfuc Tradition&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Scumfuc&quot;, respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, &quot;Carnival of Excess&quot;, his most refined set of recordings.

Another attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; stating that he would commit suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, &quot;With GG, you don&#x27;t get what you expect—you get what you deserve.&quot; He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached one&#x27;s peak, meeting the afterlife at one&#x27;s strongest point and not at one&#x27;s weakest.

In June 1993, Allin made an appearance on &quot;The Jane Whitney Show&quot;. This interview is infamous for being his last, and for his aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would commit suicide and take his fans with him. When questioned by Jane, he clarified that he would make them commit suicide as well or he would kill them. Allin also stated that, at 35, he could sleep (have sex) with 12-, 13- and 16-year-old girls, boys, and animals, and claimed that he raped both women and men at his concerts.

===1989 trial and imprisonment===

In late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with &quot;assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder&quot; of a female acquaintance in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Allin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted that she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman&#x27;s statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman&#x27;s account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989, to March 26, 1991.

It was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and &quot;mission&quot;. He wrote &quot;The GG Allin Manifesto&quot; during this period.

===Final days===

Allin&#x27;s growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: &quot;Geraldo&quot;, &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; and &quot;The Jane Whitney Show&quot;. At the time of his death, Allin was making plans for a spoken-word album. He also mentioned a somewhat unlikely European tour, enthusiastically talking about it in the hours before his death.

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
GG Allin married Sandra Farrow on October 6, 1978. They divorced in 1985.

In the mid-1980s, Allin became involved with a teenage girl from Garland, Texas named Tracy Deneault. She became pregnant, and their daughter, Nico Ann Deneault, was born on March 13, 1986. Nico chose to distance herself from her family. Allin and Tracey Deneault never married. At the time of his death, Allin&#x27;s partner was Liz Mankowski. They appeared together on &quot;The Jane Whitney Show&quot;, in 1993, with another Allin fan called Wendy.

GG Allin&#x27;s older brother Merle Allin served as bassist for his last band, the Murder Junkies.

===Beliefs===
Allin was a self-identified extreme individualist, misanthrope, and anti-authoritarian, promoting lawlessness and violence against police officers in many of his lyrics; his essay, &quot;The GG Allin Manifesto&quot;, was intended to summarize his personal philosophy. He revealed on &quot;Geraldo&quot; that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and &quot;a society that&#x27;s going crazy with violence&quot;. He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a serial killer or a mass murderer.

Allin believed in some form of afterlife. He planned to kill himself onstage on Halloween many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film &quot;&quot;, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It&#x27;s too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence.&quot;

==Death==

GG Allin&#x27;s last show was on June 27, 1993, at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside a former gas station at 194 East 2nd Street in Manhattan. In a first-hand account by Michael Bowling, the show ended after three songs, when a melee broke out. Allin ended up outside, leading a group of fans through the neighborhood.

According to Bowling, after walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to Johnny Puke&#x27;s apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Along with Johnny Puke, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he overdosed and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. Later that morning, Puke noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where he had left him and posed for Polaroids with the corpse before calling for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene. He was two months short of his 37th birthday.

===Funeral===
Allin&#x27;s funeral took place on July 3, 1993, in his native New Hampshire, at the St. Rose Cemetery in Littleton. At his funeral, Allin&#x27;s bloated corpse was dressed in his black leather jacket and trademark jock strap. Allin&#x27;s funeral became a low-level party.

==Legacy==
Video footage of the soundcheck, concert, and aftermath from Allin&#x27;s final concert on the day of his death was appended to the 1997 DVD release of &quot;Hated&quot;.

GG Allin&#x27;s grave was frequently vandalized with urine, feces, cigarette butts, and alcohol by fans, an act that was greatly discouraged by GG&#x27;s mother Arleta and his brother. His tombstone was removed in 2010 after it was knocked off its base by a fan.

Hank Williams III&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Damn Right, Rebel Proud&quot; features the song &quot;P.F.F.&quot;, which features the line &quot;This song is written and dedicated for GG Allin&quot; spoken at the beginning, and contains samples of Allin dialogues in the song&#x27;s middle section.

On December 13, 2018, Showtime premiered the 2017 documentary &quot;GG Allin: All in the Family&quot; which documented Allin&#x27;s life, career and death and how his brother and mother were coping with his death 20 years later.

Wrestler Darby Allin&#x27;s ring name is derived from the names of GG Allin and Darby Crash.

<text>Ned Lagin (born March 17, 1948) is an American artist, photographer, scientist, composer, and keyboardist.

Lagin is considered a pioneer in the development and use of minicomputers and personal computers in real-time stage and studio music composition and performance.

He is known for his electronic music composition &quot;Seastones&quot;, for performing with the Grateful Dead, and for his photography and art.

==Early years==
Ned Lagin was born in New York City and raised on Long Island in Roslyn Heights, New York. Growing up, Lagin was influenced by classical and jazz music, and the modern music and art cultures of New York City in the 1960s. He started photography with a Kodak Baby Brownie Special at the age of five, and piano lessons and science, natural history, and electronic projects at the age of six.

He attended the Wheatley School in Old Westbury, New York, was awarded two National Science Foundation Scholarships, and attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the intention of becoming an astronaut. Lagin received a degree in molecular biology and humanities from MIT in 1971, where he studied with John Harbison, Gregory Tucker, David Epstein, Noam Chomsky, Gian-Carlo Rota, Salvador Luria, and Jerome Lettvin. Chomsky&#x27;s generative grammar concepts inspired Lagin&#x27;s thinking about creating generative music forms (1968), and Lettvin connected him to the writings of Norbert Wiener and Warren McCulloch, and more generally to cybernetics.

While at MIT, Lagin also completed jazz coursework at the Berklee School of Music. He was deeply influenced by the jazz world in New York City, particularly pianist Bill Evans, whom he met in Boston and saw perform many times in New York and Boston in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After becoming acquainted with each other, Evans wrote out some of his tunes for Lagin. During this period, his piano teachers included Dean Earl (a former Charlie Parker sideman) and Ray Santisi (a sideman with Parker, Stan Getz and Dexter Gordon). He also studied jazz improvisation with saxophonist Lee Konitz. Throughout his studies, Lagin played piano in the MIT Concert Jazz Band and the MIT Jazz Quintet; both groups were led by Herb Pomeroy, a former sideman with Duke Ellington and Stan Getz.

In the autumn of 1971, Lagin began graduate study in composition as an Irving Fine Fellow at Brandeis University, where he studied with Josh Rifkin and Seymour Shifrin. He completed a symphony, a string quartet, jazz big band pieces, and electronic pieces before dropping out and permanently relocating to Marin County in the Bay Area.

==Performing with the Grateful Dead==
In early 1970, Lagin initiated a correspondence with Jerry Garcia after seeing the Grateful Dead at the Boston Tea Party in 1969. In May 1970, he helped facilitate a concert and free live outdoor performance featuring the band at MIT that coincided with the Kent State shootings. That summer, Lagin, at Garcia&#x27;s invitation, visited San Francisco and contributed piano to &quot;Candyman&quot; during the &quot;American Beauty&quot; album sessions, played in several jams, and started what would become close friendships with Garcia, bassist Phil Lesh, and David Crosby.

From 1970 to 1975, Lagin contributed Hammond B3 organ, electric piano, and clavichord to material of his choice (primarily—but not exclusively—songs with long instrumental passages) at several Grateful Dead concerts. His first performances with the Grateful Dead were on November 5 and November 8, 1970 at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York; his first complete concert was at Boston University&#x27;s Sargent Gym on November 21, 1970.

During many 1974 Grateful Dead concerts over several tours, including Europe, he performed a middle set of electronic music, including parts of his composition &quot;Seastones&quot;, on computer-controlled analog synthesizers with Phil Lesh on electronically processed bass. Some sets included Jerry Garcia playing guitar filtered through effects processors and Bill Kreutzmann on drums; these sets occasionally segued into the final Grateful Dead set, with Lagin performing with the Dead, including an appearance in &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot;.

During the 1974 tours, he played through the quadraphonic vocal system of the Wall of Sound PA, with 9600 watts routed through more than two hundred speakers.

The March 17, 1975 cancelled Grateful Dead studio session became a &quot;Seastones&quot; session with Crosby and included &quot;Ned&#x27;s Birthday Jam.&quot;

Lagin and Lesh&#x27;s 1974 interstitial performances are included in these live Grateful Dead albums:
* &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 12&quot;
* &quot;Dave&#x27;s Picks Volume 17&quot;
* &quot;Dave&#x27;s Picks Volume 34&quot;
* &quot;30 Trips Around The Sun: The Definitive Story (1965-1995)&quot;

==&quot;Seastones&quot;==

In 1975 Lagin released &quot;Seastones&quot;, a quadraphonic album of electronic music (composed between 1970–1974 and constituting a small part of the complete &quot;Seastones&quot; composition) on Round Records and then United Artists Records.

A new, two CD album of &quot;Seastones&quot; was released on March 8, 2018. This album, not a re-issue, presents most but not all of the composition as originally composed but never released or heard before. For this release, &quot;Seastones&quot; was re-mixed and re-mastered in stereo. It includes most of the original 1970–1974 studio forms, those parts of Lagin&#x27;s concurrent but unfinished composition &quot;L&quot; that are shared with &quot;Seastones&quot;, as well as some of the moment forms generated and incorporated into the composition from live performances that took place from 1973 to 1975. This two CD album contains 83 tracks (54 tracks on CD One and 29 tracks on CD Two) and altogether is 111 minutes long.

==Science career==
During his professional career in science and engineering R&amp;D (1976–2011) he worked on the earliest home computing technology with an Altair 8800; was a pre-release Apple Macintosh software seed developer; developed real time digital video and image processing systems; biotechnology and immunology instrumentation; DNA, RNA, and peptide synthesis and sequencing hardware and artificial intelligence software; early wireless network routing systems; and consulted in ecological planning, design and habitat restoration, including aerial and ecological photography for environmental studies.

==Photography and art==
Lagin began photography at the age of five, first with a Baby Brownie camera, and subsequently with other small format cameras. From childhood and continuing through to the beginning of college, photography was for him part of being an amateur naturalist and scientist. Beginning in 1978, and continuing for the next 40 years, Lagin&#x27;s primary media for creativity has been photography and art. First in small, medium (6x6cm, 6x7cm), and large (4x5) format film photography (using 1928 and 1950&#x27;s Speed Graphic cameras), and subsequently using film scanners and Photoshop (1992), and digital cameras (2003). His photography and art influences include Ansel Adams, Elliot Porter, Walker Evans, Edward Weston, &quot;Life&quot; magazine and &quot;The World We Live In&quot;, and &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

Lagin&#x27;s images, as single photographs and paintings, and in compositions of multiple images, include nature, landscapes, sand drawings, nudes, erotica, and self-portraits. His creation of sand drawings and multi-image forms to create &quot;fields of meaning(s)&quot; was influenced by the rock art and imagery (petroglyphs, pictographs) of Native Americans, Australian Aboriginals, and prehistoric Europeans. Lagin&#x27;s photographic, sand drawing, and painting collections and artist&#x27;s books, spanning 1981–2017, include: &quot;Our Love&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;Light in the Silence&quot;, &quot;Artifacts of Desire&quot;, &quot;Reflections of Solitude&quot;, and &quot;Light Time Geographies&quot;. Additionally, Lagin has written a collection of writings titled &quot;Notes&quot; about art, metaphysics, natural history, photography, pictures and &quot;the natural history of picture world&quot;. From his &quot;Notes&quot;: 

&quot;when you look at a picture&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="433024" wikidata="Q4922328" url="?curid=433024" title="Black fax">
<text>A black fax is a prank fax transmission consisting of one or more pages entirely filled with a uniform black tone. The sender&#x27;s intention is generally to use up as much of the recipient&#x27;s fax ink, toner, or thermal paper as possible, thus costing the recipient money, as well as denying the recipient use of their own machine (similar to computer-based denial of service attacks). This is made easier because fax transmission protocols compress the solid black image very well, so a very short fax call can produce many pages.

== Use ==
Black faxes have been used to harass large institutions or government departments, to retaliate against the senders of junk faxes, or merely as simple pranks.

The basic principle of a black fax can be extended to form a &quot;black fax attack.&quot; In this case, one or more sheets are fed halfway through the sender&#x27;s fax machine and taped end to end, forming an endless loop that cycles through the machine. Not only can solid black be used, but also images that will repeat endlessly on the receiver&#x27;s machine until its toner runs out.

== History ==
The introduction of computer-based facsimile systems (combined with integrated document imaging solutions) at major corporations now means that black faxes are unlikely to cause problems for them. On the other hand, the ability of computer modems to send faxes offers new avenues for abuse. A program could be used to generate hundreds of pages of highly compressed, pure black – or huge volumes of relevant-looking, original, non-repeating high-black-density junk, just as effective but far more difficult to counteract – and send them very quickly to the target fax machine.

Black faxes are similar (in both intention and implementation) to lace cards.

<text>Forum checks () were a form of hard currency in East Germany. From April 1979, all East Germans were required by law to convert any Deutsche Marks (and other western currencies) they possessed into Forum checks at a branch of the Staatsbank der DDR immediately. A Forum check mark was worth 1 West German Deutsche Mark, the smallest denomination was 50 Pfennigs and the highest was for 500 West German Deutsche Mark. Forum checks were accepted in Intershops as payment for western consumer goods and other products which were available in these shops only.

<doc id="433028" wikidata="Q1252417" url="?curid=433028" title="Workingman's Dead">
<text>Workingman&#x27;s Dead is the fourth studio album (and fifth overall) by American rock band the Grateful Dead. It was recorded in February 1970 and originally released on June 14, 1970, by Warner Bros. Records. The album and its studio follow-up, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, were recorded back-to-back using a similar style, eschewing the psychedelic experimentation of previous albums in favor of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter&#x27;s Americana-styled songcraft.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 262 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 264 in a 2012 revised list, and 409 in the 2020 list. It was voted number 371 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Recording==
The band again recorded at Pacific High Recording Studio in San Francisco, spending just nine days there. After the protracted sessions required for the previous two studio albums, Garcia suggested &quot;Let&#x27;s do it all in three weeks and get it the hell out of the way&quot;. Besides trying to avoid the debt that had accumulated while recording &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;, the band was dealing with the stress of a recent drug bust in New Orleanswhich could have resulted in jail time. Additionally, they returned from a tour to find their soon-to-be-fired manager, Lenny Hart (father of drummer Mickey Hart), refusing to show the books to anyone else in the organization. &quot;In midst of all this adverse stuff that was happening ... [recording the album] was definitely an upper,&quot; said Garcia in an interview.

Lyricist Robert Hunter had joined the band on the road for the first time, resulting in a period of faster song development. Unlike the psychedelic, electrified music for which the band had become known, the new songs took a new direction, reviving their folk-band roots. Bassist Phil Lesh stated &quot;The song lyrics reflected an &#x27;old, weird&#x27; America that perhaps never was ... The almost miraculous appearance of these new songs would also generate a massive paradigm shift in our group mind: from the mind-munching frenzy of a seven-headed fire-breathing dragon to the warmth and serenity of a choir of chanting cherubim. Even the album cover reflects this new direction: The cover for &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; is colorful and psychedelic, and that of &quot;Workingman’s Dead&quot; is monochromatic and sepia.&quot; In recent years, a search revealed that the photograph was taken at 1199 Evans Avenue in San Francisco.

&quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, the companion album that followed months later, were, according to drummer Bill Kreutzmann, both influenced by the Bakersfield sound. He explained &quot;We tried to be like a Bakersfield bandbut one that still sounded like we were from 300 miles north of that town ... we held to our psychedelic roots. &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; was all about discovering &quot;the song&quot; ... &quot;American Beauty&quot; became all about having the harmonies to do that&quot;.

While on tour in Boulder, Colorado, the previous year, Garcia had purchased a steel guitar and was now keen to use it on the new batch of songs. Lesh explained, &quot;Just as with any other instrument he picked up, he made it sing. The main impetus for this development was the nature of the new songs Hunter and Jerry had been writing; many of them had a decidedly country flavor (&#x27;Dire Wolf,&#x27; &#x27;Friend of the Devil,&#x27; &#x27;High Time,&#x27; &#x27;Casey Jones,&#x27; &#x27;Ripple&#x27;), and Jerry began using the new axe on these as they were slotted into the set lists. Bobby [Weir] also began bringing in covers of his favorite country tunes and some originals in that vein, so we were starting to see a trend developing. Personally, I was thrilled that the band could make such a complete musical about-face while still maintaining the flat-out weirdness that I’d come to know and love.&quot;

Songs such as &quot;Uncle John&#x27;s Band&quot;, &quot;High Time&quot;, and &quot;Cumberland Blues&quot; were brought to life with soaring harmonies and layered vocal textures that had not previously been a part of the band&#x27;s sound. According to the 1992 Dead oral history, &quot;Aces Back to Back&quot;, in the summer of 1968, Stephen Stills vacationed at Mickey Hart&#x27;s ranch in Novato. &quot;Stills lived with me for three months around the time of CSN&#x27;s first record,&quot; recalls Hart, &quot;and he and David Crosby really turned Jerry and Bobby onto the voice as the holy instrument. You know, &#x27;Hey, is this what a voice can do?&#x27; That turned us away from pure improvisation and more toward songs.&quot;

Garcia commented that much of the sound of the album comes both from his pairing with Hunter, as well as the band&#x27;s friendship with Crosby, Stills and Nash: &quot;Hearing those guys sing and how nice they sounded together, we thought, &#x27;We can try that. Let&#x27;s work on it a little&#x27;.&quot;

==Release==
The album title came about when Jerry Garcia commented to lyricist Robert Hunter that the album was &quot;turning into the &#x27;workingman&#x27;s Dead&#x27; version of the band&quot;. Having both worked on all of the album&#x27;s songs and gone out on the road with the band, Hunter appears as a seventh member on the front cover photograph.

Warner Bros. released &quot;Uncle John&#x27;s Band&quot; (backed with &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot;) as a single to promote the album. It received limited airplay, even though it was edited to a radio-friendly three-minute length and the lyric &quot;goddamn&quot; removed.

Readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; the best album of 1970, followed by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young&#x27;s &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; and Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot;.

The album was remastered and expanded in 2001 as part of &quot;The Golden Road (1965–1973)&quot; 12-CD box set. This version, given separate release in 2003, includes eight bonus tracks. A DVD-Audio version was also released in 2001, without the bonus material. In 2014 it was issued as a two-LP set, mastered at 45 rpm by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.

On July 10, 2020 Rhino Records released the &quot;50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition&quot; of Workingman&#x27;s Dead. Disc one contains a newly remastered mix of the album. Discs two and three contain a previously unreleased complete concert from the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York, recorded on February 21, 1971.

<doc id="433030" wikidata="Q4871755" url="?curid=433030" title="Battle of Moerbrugge">
<text>The Battle of Moerbrugge was a three-day battle during the Liberation of Belgium.

The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was tasked to cross the Ghent Canal about five kilometers south of Bruges at the small village of Oostkamp in early September 1944. Directly across the canal from Oostkamp was another small village named Moerbrugge. The canal is about 20 metres wide and very deep. Opposition was not expected so only one battalion was chosen for the crossing: the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#x27;s), the Argylls.

Two batteries of the 15th Field Regiment, RCA were placed in support but due to the rapid advance of the allied armies, supply lines were hundreds of miles long and not much ammunition was available for the guns. As a result, no preparatory fire was laid on. Fire would be provided on an &quot;as required&quot; basis.

The South Alberta Regiment (SARs) would place its tanks on the friendly side of the canal at either side of the crossing point and hold the flanks of the crossing with their fire along with the Vickers machine guns of The New Brunswick Rangers. The 3-inch mortars of the Argylls and the 4.2-inch mortars of the Rangers were in support but as low on ammunition as the artillery.

Finally, &quot;A&quot; Company of the Argylls, the Argyll scout platoon and one squadron of the SARs were moved to a point north of the crossing along the canal to provide a diversion and to test German defences in that area.

At that time, the Argyll Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Stewart, was away from the unit which was left under command of the Deputy Commanding Officer, Major B. Stockloser. Major Stockloser ordered &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; companies to cross the canal but had not arranged for assault boats, stating that the operation would be &quot;a crossing of opportunity&quot;.

==Crossing==

At 15:30 on 8 September 1944, the three assault companies moved to Oostkamp. Luckily, the &quot;opportunity&quot; to which Major Stockloser had alluded came about in the form of two civilian boats which were discovered by Major Mackenzie, Officer Commanding &quot;D&quot; Company. These boats would eventually ferry all three companies across the canal. Some boats sank during the crossing and heavily laden soldiers were drowned. At 17:30, &quot;D&quot; Company started to cross and soon the Germans responded with 88 mm and mortar fire. Casualties started to mount even before the companies reached the other side. In two hours, &quot;C&quot; Coy would drop in strength from 63 men to just 46. By midnight, all three companies were across and holding a narrow bridgehead on the far side.

Major Mackenzie was wounded and &quot;D&quot; Company was driven back to the canal by German counter-attacks. &quot;C&quot; Company was cut off from the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot; Companies by German infiltration. The day ended with 5 Argylls killed and 26 wounded.

==Holding action==
The 9 September 1944 would see The Lincoln and Welland Regiment cross the canal and take up a position on the right flank of the Argylls. The situation would remain serious throughout the day, with several German counter-attacks launched against the bridgehead. Cpl. James Alexander of &quot;A&quot; Company would be awarded the Military Medal for his actions that day. The citation reads in part, &quot;Opposition was particularly fierce, with the enemy artillery and mortar fire as well as a large volume of small arms fire from well dug-in positions. Cpl. Alexander was wounded about 10:00 a.m. and after having his wounds dressed, requested and was allowed to return to his company.&quot; &quot;An enemy counter-attack rapidly and Cpl. Alexander was wounded was wounded by a 20mm shell which struck a wall close by his head and knocked him down. Ignoring both the wound of the morning and the one he had just received Cpl Alexander rallied his section, seized a Bren gun and propping himself against a wall, stood-up fully exposed to fire and the enemy and to cover the movement of a party of his men, which had become detached from the remainder.&quot;

&quot;C&quot; Company was in a particularly difficult position being cut off from the other companies. In addition, their radios failed leaving them out of contact with all support. However, the company hung on and repulsed all counter-attacks. Company Sergeant Major George Mitchell deserves much credit for holding the defence together. He personally led a party that brought up much needed supplies and ammunition. After the battle, he would be awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

Lance Corporal Lorne A. Webb and Private Arthur Bridge held their position in an upstairs window and returned fire with their Bren gun despite German machine gun and 20 mm cannon fire directed at them, some of which passed through the window opening but missed hitting them. As ammunition ran low, the riflemen loaded their remaining rounds into Bren magazines and kept feeding them to the Bren gunners. At one point, Webb inflicted 15 to 20 casualties on the attacking Germans in the matter of a few minutes. Three heavy counter-attacks on &quot;C&quot; Company were driven off with extremely heavy losses visited upon the Germans. However, one Argyll platoon was overrun by sheer weight of numbers and the platoon commander killed.

Because of the incessant German shelling and mortaring of the crossing site, the engineers found it impossible to construct a Bailey bridge so supplies and ammunition had to be ferried across the canal in boats. Slowly, more artillery ammunition was finding its way forward to the Canadian guns and supporting fire increased. The SARs and New Brunswick Rangers continued to hold the flanks of the assault force.

At 14:00, &quot;A&quot; Company and the Scout Platoon were recalled from their diversionary task and moved to a supporting position on the friendly side of the crossing. It was feared that the bridgehead might collapse and the six Argyll and Lincoln and Welland companies in Moerbrugge might have to be evacuated.

At 15:00, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart returned to the unit. The brigade commander placed him in charge of the crossing with the Lincoln and Welland under command. He immediately set about reorganising the positions on the bridgehead.

At 19:00, the Germans blanketed both sides of the crossing with a hail storm of mortar fire as a prelude to their final counter-attack. However, their attempt was thwarted and the counter-attack was beaten back. Due to the fire, the engineers had to halt bridge construction yet again. However, by midnight, Canadian counter battery fire finally suppressed the German shelling of the bridge site. The Argylls lost 7 killed, 22 wounded and 12 captured during the day.

By the morning of the 10 September 1944, the engineers finally completed the bridge. SAR tanks moved across and established contact with the cut off &quot;C&quot; Company. About 150 German prisoners were sent back over the new bridge.

==Aftermath==
An estimated 700 Germans were killed, wounded or captured during the Moerbrugge battle. Twenty of their 20 mm FLAK (anti aircraft) cannons were captured along with six 81 mm mortars. German shelling and mortaring would continue sporadically all day but ownership of the crossing site was no longer an issue. One Argyll died and two were wounded on the 10th.

<doc id="433034" wikidata="Q4053131" url="?curid=433034" title="Wide Mouth Frog protocol">
<text>The Wide-Mouth Frog protocol is a computer network authentication protocol designed for use on insecure networks (the Internet for example). It allows individuals communicating over a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks, and provides for detection of modification and the prevention of unauthorized reading. This can be proven using Degano.

The protocol was first described under the name &quot;The Wide-mouthed-frog Protocol&quot; in the paper &quot;A Logic of Authentication&quot; (1990), which introduced Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic, and in which it was an &quot;unpublished protocol ... proposed by&quot; coauthor Michael Burrows. The paper gives no rationale for the protocol&#x27;s whimsical name.

The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation:
* A, B, and S are identities of Alice, Bob, and the trusted server respectively
* formula_1 and formula_2 are timestamps generated by A and S respectively
* formula_3 is a symmetric key known only to A and S
* formula_4 is a generated symmetric key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B
* formula_5 is a symmetric key known only to B and S

: formula_6

: formula_7

Note that to prevent active attacks, some form of authenticated encryption (or message authentication) must be used.

The protocol has several problems:
* A global clock is required.
* The server S has access to all keys.
* The value of the session key formula_4 is completely determined by &quot;A&quot;, who must be competent enough to generate good keys.

<text>Farrell Dobbs (July 25, 1907 – October 31, 1983) was an American Trotskyist, trade unionist, politician, and historian.

==Early years==
Dobbs was born in Queen City, Missouri, where his father was a worker in a coal company garage. The family moved to Minneapolis, and he graduated from North High School in 1925. In 1926, he left for North Dakota to find work, but returned the following fall. At this point, young Farrell Dobbs was a Republican, and supported Herbert Hoover for president in 1928 and 1932.

==Politics==
Dobbs&#x27;s political viewpoints changed during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Seeing the plight of workers in that situation (including himself), he became politically radicalized to the left.

In 1933, while working for the Pittsburgh Coal Company in Minneapolis, Dobbs joined the Teamsters. After getting to know the three Trotskyist Dunne brothers, (Miles, Vincent and Grant) and Swedish socialist Carl Skoglund, he joined the Communist League of America. Dobbs was one of the initiators of a general strike in Minneapolis, and for a while worked full-time as a union organizer.

He was influential in the Teamsters&#x27; shift from emphasis on local delivery work to over-the-road traffic, which keyed their great expansion towards becoming the largest union in the United States.

Dobbs quit in 1939 to work for the new Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Dobbs met the Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky when he visited Mexico shortly before Trotsky&#x27;s death in 1940.

Dobbs served as mentor and advisor to a young Jimmy Hoffa, while Hoffa was making his rise within the Teamsters, eventually becoming its president in 1957. Dobbs primarily inspired Hoffa with his view that the capitalist system was a Darwinian struggle, where power, rather than morality, was the primary factor determining the eventual outcome.

For opposing World War II, he and other leaders of the SWP and the Minneapolis Teamsters were convicted of violating the Smith Act, which made it illegal to &quot;conspire to advocate the violent overthrow of the United States Government&quot;. He served over a year of a 16-month sentence in Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone, from 1944 to 1945.

==Presidential candidacy==
After his release, he became the editor of the SWP&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Militant&quot;. From 1948 to 1960 he was the SWP&#x27;s candidate for President of the United States, running in four elections. He succeeded James P. Cannon as national secretary of the party in 1953, serving until 1972.

In 1960, Farrell Dobbs and Joseph Hansen, Trotsky&#x27;s former secretary in Mexico, went to Cuba to experience the revolutionary movement there. The two American Trotskyists decided to fully support the Cuban Revolution and the leadership of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara.

==Later life==
Farrell Dobbs retired in 1972, but remained in the party until his death in 1983. He devoted the later part of his life to historical documentation of the American leftist movement and the Minnesota Teamsters. Dobbs was the author of a four-volume history / memoir of the Minneapolis struggles: &quot;Teamster Rebellion&quot;, &quot;Teamster Power&quot;, &quot;Teamster Politics&quot; and &quot;Teamster Bureaucracy&quot;. He had completed two volumes of a planned history of the Marxist movement in the United States at the time of his death, titled: &quot;Revolutionary Continuity: The Early Years, 1848-1917&quot; and &quot;Birth of the Communist Movement, 1918-1922&quot;.

<doc id="433041" wikidata="Q10692151" url="?curid=433041" title="Technocapitalism">
<text>Technocapitalism refers to a contemporary economic and social system characterized by the dominance of technology-driven capital, where technological innovation becomes a central component of economic growth and wealth accumulation. This term encapsulates the interplay between technology and capitalism, highlighting how advancements in technology influence economic structures, labor markets, and social relations. A significant aspect of technocapitalism is the rise of the intangible economy, which is marked by the increasing importance of non-physical assets such as intellectual property, brand value, and digital services. This shift has led to new forms of economic centralization, where a few tech giants dominate markets due to their ability to scale rapidly and leverage synergies across different sectors.

== Corporate power and organization ==
Luis Suarez-Villa, in his 2009 book &quot;Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism&quot; argues that it is a new version of capitalism that generates new forms of corporate organization designed to exploit intangibles such as creativity and new knowledge. The new organizations, which he refers to as &quot;experimentalist organizations&quot; are deeply grounded in technological research, as opposed to manufacturing and services production. They are also heavily dependent on the corporate appropriation of research outcomes as intellectual property.

This approach is further developed by Suarez-Villa in his 2012 book &quot;Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination&quot;, in which he relates the emergence of technocapitalism to globalization and to the growing power of technocapitalist corporations. Taking into account the new relations of power introduced by the corporations that control technocapitalism, he considers new forms of accumulation involving intangibles—such as creativity and new knowledge—along with intellectual property and technological infrastructure. This perspective on globalization—and the effect of technocapitalism and its corporations—also takes into account the growing global importance of intangibles, the inequalities created between nations at the vanguard of technocapitalism and those that are not, the increasing importance of brain-drain flows between nations, and the rise of what he refers to as a techno-military-corporate complex that is rapidly replacing the old military-industrial complex of the second half of the 20th century. 

The concept behind technocapitalism is part of a line of thought that relates science and technology to the evolution of capitalism. At the core of this idea of the evolution of capitalism is that science and technology are not divorced from society—or that they exist in a vacuum, or in a separate reality of their own—out of reach of social action and human decision. Science and technology are part of society, and they are subject to the priorities of capitalism as much as any other human endeavor, if not more so. Prominent scientists in the early 20th century, such as John Bernal, posited that science has a social function, and cannot be seen as something apart from society. Other scientists at that time, such as John Haldane, related science to social philosophy, and showed how critical approaches to social analysis are very relevant to science, and to our understanding of the need for science. In our time, this line of thought has encouraged philosophers such as Andrew Feenberg to adopt and apply a critical theory approach to technology and science, providing many important insights on how scientific and technological decisions—and their outcomes—are shaped by society, and by capitalism and its institutions.

The term &quot;technocapitalism&quot; has been used by one author to denote aspects and ideas that diverge sharply from those explained above. Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, writing about Silicon Valley in an article, used the term to describe the corporate environment and venture capital relationships in a high tech-oriented local economy. His approach to the topic was consonant with that of business journals and the corporate management literature. Some newspaper articles have also used the term occasionally and in a very general sense, to denote the importance of advanced technologies in the economy.

== Forms of tech capitalism ==
Tech capitalism can take many forms such as IP based financing where patents and registered IP of new technology is an instrument for building capitalism, debt based equity where new and innovative technology is used as the security interest for securing financing or leasing, and ICOs such as Blockchain capital.

<doc id="433043" wikidata="Q1755600" url="?curid=433043" title="N scale">
<text>N scale is a popular model railway scale. Depending upon the manufacturer (or country), the scale ranges from 1:148 to 1:160. Effectively the scale is 1:159, 9 mm to , which is the width of standard gauge railway. However the scale may vary to simulate wide or narrow-gauge rail. In all cases, the &quot;gauge&quot; (the distance between the rails) is . The term N &quot;gauge&quot; refers to the track dimensions, but in the United Kingdom in particular British N gauge refers to a 1:148 scale with 1:160 () track gauge modelling. The terms N scale and N gauge are often inaccurately used interchangeably, as scale is defined as ratio or proportion of the model, and gauge only as a distance between rails. The scale 1:148 defines the rail-to-rail gauge equal to 9 mm exactly (at the cost of scale exactness), so when calculating the rail or track use 1:160 and for engines and car wheel base use 1:148.

All rails are spaced 9 mm apart but the height can differ. Rail height (in thousandths of an inch) is expressed as a &quot;code&quot;: thus, Code 55 rails are high while Code 80 rails have a height of . Common real railroad rails are at least tall and can be taller on some roads, so at true scale the rails would be about high. Many older N-scale models may not run well on Code 55 track as their flanges are often unrealistically large, causing the wheels to bounce along the ties instead of ride along the railhead. Wheelsets with these large flanges are colloquially known as &#x27;pizza cutters&#x27; due to a resemblance to the kitchen utensil.

An advantage of N scale is that it allows hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into the same amount of space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they are in HO scale (1:87). While N scale is quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as Z scale is smaller yet at 1:220 and T scale is 1:450 or 1:480. N scale is considered generally compatible with 1:144 scale for miniature wargaming.

== History ==

Although trains and accessories of similar gauge or scale existed as early as 1927, modern commercially produced N-scale models were first launched by the Arnold company of Nuremberg in 1962. Unlike other scales and gauges, which were &quot;de facto&quot; standards at best, within two years N-scale manufacturers defined the gauge and voltage, as well as the height and type of couplers. For example, Arnold developed the now ubiquitous &quot;Rapido&quot; coupler to provide a simple and robust releasable coupler design. Although the original Arnold coupler has been joined by more functional and aesthetically pleasing designs, Arnold allowed use of the Rapido design by other manufacturers, so established a common standard to couple together rolling stock from different sources.

N scale has a large worldwide following. Models are made of very many standard gauge prototypes from every continent. N scale&#x27;s popularity is second only to that of HO. In Japan, where space in homes is more limited, N scale is the most popular scale, and HO scale is considered large. Not all modellers select N because they have small spaces; some use N scale to build more complex or more visually expansive models.

N scale in Australia has become more popular over the years. Modellers use mainly US, British, and European prototypes because for a long time, the Australian market had no N-scale models of local prototypes. The creation of local prototypes is now a flourishing &quot;cottage&quot; industry, making Australia N-scale modelling more popular each year.

N-gauge track and components are also used with larger scales, in particular H0e (or &quot;HOe&quot;) and 00-9 scale for modelling narrow-gauge railways. N-scale models on Z-scale track are used to model metre gauge (Nn3). A small amount of 2-foot (Nn2) industrial narrow-gauge modelling in N scale using custom track is done, but suppliers of parts are few. Nn18 layouts use T-scale track and mechanisms to represent minimum-gauge railways. N-scale trains and structures are often used on HO or larger layouts to create forced perspective, or the illusion that an object is further away than it actually is.

== Standards ==

Standards useful to both manufacturers and modellers are maintained by MOROP in Europe and the NMRA in North America. These standards are generally the same for such elements as track gauge, scale ratio, couplings, and electrical power, and differ for clearances and other factors that are specific to the prototype being modelled. The wheel and track standards are, however, slightly incompatible and most vendors follow neither standard in part because of this.

N scale locomotives are powered by DC motors which accept a maximum of 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, the speed of the train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular digital control systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.

The initial agreed-to standard coupling was known as a &#x27;Rapido&#x27; coupler from the manufacturer (Arnold); this coupler had been produced under a license from TT-manufacturer Rokal. Most companies developed their own variants of this coupler to avoid Arnold patents on the spring system. Graham Farish initially adopted a plastic flexible U rather than a spring, Peco used a compatible weighted coupler system (Elsie), and Fleischmann cunningly sidestepped the problem by using a sprung plate. All were compatible, though.

The Rapido coupler system works well, but is difficult to use for automatic uncoupling and also relatively large. In the US, Canada, and Australia, it has been largely superseded by a more realistic-looking magnetic knuckle coupler, originally made by Micro-Trains and branded Magne-Matic. The MT couplers (as they are known) are more delicate and closer to scale North American appearance than Rapido couplers. Also, they can be opened by a magnet placed under the track. Other manufacturers, such as Atlas, McHenry and Kato, are now making couplers that mate with Micro Trains couplers.

European modellers have the option to convert the couplings on their rolling stock to the Fleischmann Profi-Coupler system for more reliable operation should they wish to do so, but most N scale rolling stock continues to be manufactured with Rapido couplers - a design which is fairly robust and easy to mold. Modern N scale stock uses a standard NEM socket for couplers which allows different coupling designs to be used by simply pulling out the old coupler and fitting a new one of a different design. In the UK, vendors are increasingly shipping both NEM sockets for couplers and buckeye (knuckle) couplers. It is also very easy to use for coupling and uncoupling.

== Variants ==
In the United States and Europe, models of standard gauge [] trains are built to 1:160 scale and made so that they run on N gauge track, but in some other countries changes are made. Finescale modellers also use variants of normal N scale.

=== United Kingdom === 
In the United Kingdom, a scale of 1:148 is used for commercially produced models.

In Britain, some N-scale models are built to &quot;2 mm scale&quot; for &quot;2 mm to the foot&quot; which calculates to a 1:152 proportion. Early N scale was also known as &quot;OOO&quot; or &quot;treble-O&quot; in reference to O and OO and was also 1:152, though for an entirely different reason.

=== 2 mm to the foot scale ===
A number of modellers in the United Kingdom use 2 mm scale, a closer-to-scale standard than N scale. 2 mm scale is scaled at 2 mm to the foot (1:152) with a track gauge. Nearer to scale appearance is achieved by finer rail, flange, and crossing dimensions than commercial N gauge () components.
A variation of the 2 mm standards is used by the FiNe group for 1:160 scale. It uses the same rail, flange, and crossing dimensions as 2 mm (1:152) standards, but with a track gauge of , and corresponding reduction in back-to-back. FiNe is dominated by European modellers.

=== OOO models ===
In 1961, Lone Star introduced some of the first (1:160) N scale models branded as Treble-0-Lectric (OOO) into the United Kingdom. The original die-cast metal models were push along and gauged to run on a die-cast trackwork having a gauge that was closer to . Coupling was by a simple loop and pin arrangement. The novelty of the &quot;Lone Star Locos&quot; line was such that they even found their way to the United States and were sold in the toys area of major department stores like J.J. Newberry.

Electrified models followed soon after. The track gauge was widened to a nominal and rails were isolated with nonconductive ties (sleepers) for DC operation. Gearing between the motor and the axles at such a small scale was done by rubber bands, rather than the usual worm gear. A different coupling based on a shrunken OO scale coupling was fitted. The OOO couplings and specifications have long since been replaced by commercial N scale manufacturers.

=== Australian N scale ===
Australian railways use several gauges across the states, although in most cases 9 mm gauge track is used. Some modellers have used Z gauge track for Nn3 models of Queensland Railways. N scale modelling in Australia has been a cottage-industry affair, with typically small runs of resin-based models being produced. Some etch-brass kits have also been released. In most cases, the kits have been bodies designed to run on mechanisms or bogies available from overseas. Some very fine models are starting to emerge from various Australian manufacturers with many kits now available.

Manufacturers have started to engage Chinese manufacturers to produce very high quality wagons and locomotives. The Victorian producer Aust-N-Rail pioneered this approach, while in 2011, BadgerBits released Australia&#x27;s first ready-to-run N gauge locomotive, a 48 class retailing for around A$240. A new manufacturer has arrived on the scene (November 2011) with Australia-N Railways using both Australian locally manufactured detail accessories and top end Chinese factories to produce their new locomotives and rolling stock. Other kits continue to be released using the more usual method of resin-based castings and it is now possible obtain models of railways running in most states, although the coverage is highly variable.

=== Japanese N scale ===

Since the former Japanese National Railways and other major private railways adopted a track gauge of , Japanese N-scale models of conventional railways adopted 1:150 scale with 9 mm gauge. But, in the case of Shinkansen, which adopted a track gauge, models are scaled down to 1:160. A small number of modelers adopted a model scale of 1:120 using 9 mm gauge tracks to represent the narrow-gauge railway gauge lines common in Japan. This is a different prototype gauge and scale to standard N scale with the narrower prototype gauge and called TT-9.

== Notable layouts ==
*In Germany, Wolfgang Frey started to build an N-scale layout of the Stuttgart main railway station in 1978. Thirty years later, the project grew to more than . Frey&#x27;s &quot;Stuttgart Hbf&quot; layout is an exact replica of the Stuttgart main railway station with its related railyards in the 1970s. The layout is based on extensive background research of the prototype. The layout is computer controlled by 27 PCs running software developed by the owner of the layout and features very detailed and prototypical signalling systems. The layout was kept private until his untimely death in October 2012, but in 2017 should be opened as a public exhibition.
* One of the largest N-scale layouts in the world is at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum in California, United States. Pacific Desert Lines is a layout featuring hand-laid code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About (scale miles, actually ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego&#x27;s Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge&#x27;s Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building&#x27;s blueprints and was featured on the cover of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine. The Spanish Revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres&#x27; Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype&#x27;s railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner café. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.
*In the United States, a landmark N scale project layout, the Clinchfield, was built in 1978 by Gordon Odegard and featured in a series of articles for &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine. The article series was also reprinted in the book &quot;Modelling the Clinchfield in N Scale&quot; by Kalmbach Publishing. The Clinchfield layout measured and was noteworthy for a number of reasons: 1) it was highly portable because of its modular construction, 2) it showed the potential of high scenery to track ratios possible in 1:160, 3) it used a unique aluminum frame and (at the time revolutionary) styrofoam construction to cut down on weight and 4) it was highly prototypical for the era. The Clinchfield layout is one of the most famous American N-scale layouts ever constructed and was awarded as the grand prize in a 1984 sweepstakes. The layout was also displayed at a number of train shows and has traded ownership several times by private collectors. The prototype Clinchfield Railroad was an operating and holding company for the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway. The layout has been refurbished, outfitted for DCC, and was shown at the 2008 N Scale Collectors National Convention in Louisville, Kentucky.

<text>The Holy Sisters of the Gaga Dada were an eclectic band originally from Santa Cruz, California, US, formed in 1981. They were voted &quot;Best Alternative Rock Band of the Year&quot; by &quot;LA Weekly&quot;. The collaboration of keyboardist Mary Jean Shaffer and guitarist Blancah Black, the Holy Sisters included quasi-religious imagery and feminist politics. Other original members included Heidi Puckett (bass) and Jeff Grubic (tenor sax). As the band morphed from conceptual entity to frequent club performers, Black left and two new members were added, Jill Fido (bass) and Charles Bingham (drums). Kim Sockit later replaced Puckett, and Zero Jessephski Jr. replaced Bingham, making the Holy Sisters of the Gaga Dada an all-female band. The group would later move to Hollywood, California, where they were featured in &quot;Once Upon Her Time&quot;, a TV program about women in the 1980s which aired on the Lifetime Cablevision Network.

<doc id="433052" wikidata="Q1500192" url="?curid=433052" title="Nasum">
<text>Nasum (pronounced &#x27;nah-zumm&#x27;) was a Swedish grindcore band from Örebro, formed in 1992. The band released four studio albums and developed into &quot;one of that country&#x27;s premier metal acts&quot;. They disbanded after the December 2004 tsunami killed the band&#x27;s frontman, Mieszko Talarczyk.

In 2012, Nasum reunited with Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa taking the place of Talarczyk, for a one-off tour to celebrate the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

==Biography==
Nasum was formed in 1992 by Anders Jakobson (guitar) and Rickard Alriksson (drums/vocals), two former members of the band Necrony. The band&#x27;s name, Latin for &quot;nose&quot;, was taken from the horror film &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein.&quot; The record label of Necrony offered Nasum a slot on a split 7-inch. After Mieszko Talarczyk joined the band as a guitarist in 1993, the band was featured on Blind World split EP with Agathocles. After several more splits, Nasum released an MCD (mini compact disc) of their own with Poserslaughter Records in 1995.

As the band started touring, Alriksson departed from Nasum. Guitarist Jakobson moved into the drummer&#x27;s position and Talarczyk handled guitars and vocals. More EPs and splits followed over 1996 and 1997; and in 1998 Nasum released their first full-length album, &quot;Inhale/Exhale&quot;, on Relapse Records. As the band expanded their audience and touring, they recruited a full-time bassist, Jesper Liveröd (from Burst) in early 1999. The second album, &quot;Human 2.0&quot;, was released in April 2000 to critical acclaim and followed by two years of touring and performing in support of the work, including a stop in Japan.

The third album, &quot;Helvete&quot;, was released in 2003 and featured Napalm Death&#x27;s Shane Embury. It was well received and led to even more high-profile appearances, especially on the European festival circuit. At that time, Nasum were joined by second guitarist Urban Skytt and bassist Jon Lindqvist, who replaced the departing member Liveröd. In 2004, Nasum released &quot;Shift&quot; and continued with touring.

Talarczyk went on vacation to Thailand shortly before the 26 December, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. His death was officially confirmed on 17 February 2005, and Nasum disbanded. A compilation, &quot;Grind Finale&quot;, was released in 2006 and a live album featuring a 2004 show from Osaka, &quot;Doombringer&quot;, was released in early 2008.

In October 2011, Nasum announced a special one-off tour to celebrate the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary the following year. Filling in for late singer Talarczyk was Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa. The band played their final show on October 6, 2012, in Stockholm; a concert film documentary called &quot;Nasum: Blasting Shit to Bits – The Final Show&quot; chronicling the show was premiered in 2017 and released on DVD in 2020.

Anders Jakobson has since stated that Nasum will never reunite again.

<doc id="433054" wikidata="Q13336" url="?curid=433054" title="Moghol language">
<text>Moghol (or Mogholi; ) is a critically endangered and possibly extinct Mongolic language spoken in the province of Herat, Afghanistan, in the villages of Kundur and Karez-i-Mulla. The speakers were the Moghol people, who numbered 2,000 members in the 1970s. They descend from the remnants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s Mongol army stationed in Afghanistan in the 13th century.

In the 1970s, when the German scholar Michael Weiers did fieldwork on the language, few people spoke it, most knew it passively and most were older than 40. It is unknown if there are still speakers of the language, and it is listed as dormant by Ethnologue.

The language has been strongly influenced by Persian in its phonology, morphology and syntax, causing Weiers to state that it has the appearance of a &quot;true Inner Asian creole language&quot;.

== Phonology ==
Moghol&#x27;s phonology is influenced by Persian. It has a system of six vowel qualities with no length contrast: .
/ɦ/ may range between voiced [ɦ] and voiceless [h].

== Script ==
Historically, the Moghol language was written using the Perso-Arabic script. Extant Moghol literature included Islamic texts, poetry, Mogholi-Persian vocabularies, and Mogholi grammars.

==Grammar==
Moghol grammar shows substantial influence from Persian languages, having borrowed even word classes not found in other Mongolic languages: the parts of speech are nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs and conjunctions.

Nouns are marked for number and case. Verbs are marked for person, number, tense-aspect and mode. Adjectives inflect for the comparative and superlative degree with the Persian suffixes -&quot;tar&quot; and -&quot;tariin&quot;, but not for number and case.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Pronouns ===
The Moghol personal pronouns are:
The demonstrative pronouns are:
* ~ ‘this’
*inat ~ enad ‘these’
*mun ~ munah ‘that’
*munat ~ mutah ~ mutat ‘those’

The interrogative pronouns are:
*emah ~ imah ~ imas ‘what’
*ken ~ kiyan ‘who’
*kenaiki ‘whose’
*emadu ~ imadu ~ emaji ~ imaji ~ emagalah ‘why’
*emaula- ‘to do what’
*ked ~ keddu ‘how much’
*keja ‘when’
*oshtin ‘how’

The reflexive pronouns are:
* ‘self’ 
* ‘for oneself’
* ‘self’

=== Numerals ===
The Moghol numerals are Janhunen (2003):
== Sample ==
Weiers noted down the following poem by the Moghol poet Abd Al-Qadir. 


Another Moghol poem or song of Abd Al-Qadir written in Arabic alphabet (from Weiers):

<doc id="433056" wikidata="Q1232548" url="?curid=433056" title="Zooming user interface">
<text>In computing, a zooming user interface or zoomable user interface (ZUI, pronounced zoo-ee) is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) where users can change the scale of the viewed area in order to see more detail or less, and browse through different documents. Information elements appear directly on an infinite virtual desktop (usually created using vector graphics), instead of in windows. Users can pan across the virtual surface in two dimensions and zoom into objects of interest. For example, as you zoom into a text object it may be represented as a small dot, then a thumbnail of a page of text, then a full-sized page and finally a magnified view of the page.

ZUIs use zooming as the main metaphor for browsing through hyperlinked or multivariate information.
Objects present inside a zoomed page can in turn be zoomed themselves to reveal further detail, allowing for recursive nesting and an arbitrary level of zoom.

When the level of detail present in the resized object is changed to fit the relevant information into the current size, instead of being a proportional view of the whole object, it&#x27;s called semantic zooming.

Some consider the ZUI paradigm as a flexible and realistic successor to the traditional windowing GUI, being a Post-WIMP interface.

== History ==
Ivan Sutherland presented the first program for zooming through and creating graphical structures with constraints and instancing, on a CRT in his Sketchpad program in 1962.

A more general interface was done by the Architecture Machine Group in the 1970s at MIT. Hand tracking, touchscreen, joystick, and voice control were employed to control an infinite plane of projects, documents, contacts, video and interactive programs. One of the instances of this project was called Spatial Dataland.

Another GUI environment of the 70&#x27;s, which used the zooming idea was Smalltalk at Xerox PARC, which had infinite &quot;desktops&quot; (only later named such by Apple Computer), that could be zoomed in upon from a birds eye view after the user had recognized a miniature of the window setup for the project.

The longest running effort to create a ZUI has been the Pad++ project begun by Ken Perlin, Jim Hollan, and Ben Bederson at New York University and continued at the University of New Mexico under Hollan&#x27;s direction. After Pad++, Bederson developed Jazz, then Piccolo, and now Piccolo2D at the University of Maryland, College Park, which is maintained in Java and C#. More recent ZUI efforts include Archy by the late Jef Raskin, ZVTM developed at INRIA (which uses the Sigma lens technique), and the simple ZUI of the Squeak Smalltalk programming environment and language. The term ZUI itself was coined by Franklin Servan-Schreiber and Tom Grauman while they worked together at the Sony Research Laboratories. They were developing the first Zooming User Interface library based on Java 1.0, in partnership with Prof. Ben Bederson, University of New Mexico, and Prof. Ken Perlin, New York University.

GeoPhoenix, a Cambridge, MA, startup associated with the MIT Media Lab, founded by Julian Orbanes, Adriana Guzman, Max Riesenhuber, released the first mass-marketed commercial Zoomspace in 2002–03 on the Sony CLIÉ personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld, with Ken Miura of Sony

In 2002, Pieter Muller extended the Oberon System with a zooming user interface and named it &quot;Active Object System&quot; (AOS). In 2005, due to copyright issues, it was renamed to &quot;Bluebottle&quot;, and in 2008, to &quot;A2&quot;.

In 2006, Hillcrest Labs introduced the HoME television navigation system, the first graphical, zooming interface for television.
In 2007, Microsoft&#x27;s Live Labs released a zooming UI for web browsing called Microsoft Live Labs Deepfish for the Windows Mobile 5 platform.

Apple&#x27;s iPhone (premiered June 2007) uses a stylized form of ZUI, in which panning and zooming are performed through a touch user interface (TUI). A more fully realised ZUI is present in the iOS home screen (as of iOS 7), with zooming from the homescreen in to folders and finally in to apps. The photo app zooms out from a single photo to moments, to collections, to years, and similarly in the calendar app with day, month and year views. It is not a full ZUI implementation since these operations are applied to bounded spaces (such as web pages or photos) and have a limited range of zooming and panning.

Franklin Servan-Schreiber founded Zoomorama, based on work he did at the Sony Research Laboratories in the mid-1990s. The Zooming Browser for Collage of High Resolution Images was released in Alpha in October 2007. Zoomorama&#x27;s browser is all Flash-based. In 2010, project development ended, but many examples are still available on the site.

From 2008 to 2010, GNOME Shell used a zooming user interface for virtual workspaces management. This ZUI was eventually replaced by a different, scrolling-based design.

In 2017, bigpictu.re offers an infinite (pan and zoom) notepad as a web application based on one of the first ZUI open-source libraries.

In 2017, Zircle UI was released. It is an open source UI library that uses zoomable navigation and circular shapes.

In 2022, the Miro collaboration platform, what is a zooming user interface, reported 40 million users. It was released in 2011 as RealtimeBoard and in 2019 rebranded as Miro.

<text>Theodosius Andreas Harnack (; , St. Petersburg – , Dorpat (now )) was a Baltic German theologian.

A professor of Divinity, he started his career as a Privatdozent for church history and homiletics at the University of Dorpat (in what is today Tartu, Estonia) in 1843, he was further appointed university preacher in 1847. Since 1848 he held an ordinary chair (tenure) as professor for practical and systematic theology. Between 1853 and 1866 Harnack was professor at Frederick Alexander University (merged in the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg since 1961) in Erlangen, Bavaria, German Confederation (now Germany).

Harnack was a staunch Lutheran and a prolific writer on theological subjects; his chief field of work was practical theology, and his important book on that subject summing up his long experience and teaching appeared at Erlangen (1877–1878, 2 vols.). The liturgy of the then Lutheran church in Russia has, since 1898, been based on his &quot;Liturgische Formulare&quot; (1872).

His twin sons were the German theologian Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930) and mathematician Carl Gustav Axel Harnack (1851–1888). His other two sons were also successful scientists, with the pharmacology and physiological chemistry professor Erich Harnack (1853–1914) and the history of literature professor Otto Harnack (1857–1914), father of Arvid Harnack and Falk Harnack.

<doc id="433062" wikidata="Q2925977" url="?curid=433062" title="Broken (1993 film)">
<text>Broken (informally known as The Broken Movie) is a 1993 horror musical short film and long-form music video filmed and directed by Peter Christopherson. It is based on an idea by Trent Reznor, founder of industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, and is a companion piece to the 1992 Nine Inch Nails EP &quot;Broken&quot;.

The film features songs from &quot;Broken&quot; and is essentially a compilation of its music videos (the exception being &quot;Last&quot; and the two hidden tracks). The film, just 20 minutes in length, weaves the album&#x27;s four music videos together via a violent &quot;snuff film&quot; framing sequence, concluding with an otherwise unreleased video for the EP&#x27;s final song &quot;Gave Up&quot; to set the conclusion of the film&#x27;s frame story to the song.

Due to its extremely graphic content, &quot;Broken&quot; was never officially released, but was leaked as a bootleg which became heavily traded on VHS in the 1990s and more recently online. Reznor said that &quot;Broken&quot; makes the music video for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, one of the tracks on the album, &quot;look like a Disney movie&quot;.

While Reznor&#x27;s comments about the film have been cryptic at best, he makes no secret of its existence, and the entire uncensored film is available to view when accessed by a hidden link on the discography page of the official Nine Inch Nails website.

==Plot==

The film begins with a scene of a person being executed by hanging. The trap door opens and the person drops with a serene smile on his face. The movie then cuts to footage of an amateur video taken from inside a car going through various parts of a city, from the middle-class suburbs to, literally, the other side of the tracks into a shoddy industrial area. The car approaches a young man on the sidewalk. Almost immediately, he is suddenly seen in a basement, tied with a seatbelt to a chair and cleave-gagged while being forced to watch a television.

The music video for &quot;Pinion&quot; begins to play. It begins in a bathroom. The camera zooms in on a toilet flushing, and a network of pipes is shown leading to a contraption with a large gear system and a pressure gauge on it. As the camera zooms out, a tight plastic bodybag-like suit suspended in a padded cell with six rods by the side is shown, with the end of the pipes attached to the mouth portion with water gushing in, presumably to drown the person inside. An alternative interpretation is that the person bound inside is being fed the &quot;waste of the world&quot; coming through the pipes.

Cutting back to the amateur video, the killer, wearing some sort of leather mask, pulls the victim&#x27;s head back and forces him to drink some sort of liquid from a jerrycan. The middle of the music video for &quot;Wish&quot; is again interrupted by amateur footage, showing the victim chained to a table with a large wad of a dark substance on his face. As the killer is then seen putting his pants on, it is usually assumed that the substance is feces. After the video ends, the killer repeatedly rewinds to the part of the music video where Trent Reznor screams &quot;fist fuck!&quot; and begins to rub his fist.

The video for &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot; shows a middle-aged man in a room filled with flies. He ignores them while eating steak and drinking wine, despite the fact that the flies enter his mouth while he eats. The video cuts away several times to show the same man in bondage gear. This video was blacked out in the most prominent leak, and is now generally believed (although not proven) to be part of the complete film, but was blacked out by Reznor in the bootlegged copy. Reznor later admitted to distributing different copies of &quot;Broken&quot; to his friends, each with a different part of the video blacked out so that he would be able to identify the culprit if it were to be leaked.

Following the music video, the victim is shown still tied to a table as the killer proceeds to rip his teeth out. The video for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;, which was banned by music video channels worldwide, begins. The most widely known part of the movie, it features performance artist Bob Flanagan stripping off his clothes and settling down on a machine that tortures, rapes, and kills him before grinding him up to fertilize a patch of soil beneath the machine.

The film ends with the music video for &quot;Gave Up&quot;, which is a different video from the one on &quot;Closure&quot; as it is not an actual Nine Inch Nails video but rather the band&#x27;s music dubbed over the storyline of the movie. At this point, the victim is suspended from the ceiling and is repeatedly attacked by the perpetrator, first with a blade and then a blowtorch, after which the killer slices off the victim&#x27;s penis with a straight razor, while footage of police searching through the basement and finding remains of previous victims is shown.

Finally, the film cuts back to the victim strapped on a table, as the murderer hacks his limbs off with a chainsaw, rapes him, and slices his chest open to eat his heart. The film then cuts back to the execution scene, again showing the killer being dropped through the trap door with a smile on his face. He falls through an immensely long tunnel until the rope suddenly tightens. 30 seconds after the film ends, with no audio and a black screen, the severed head of the killer flies across the screen.

==Cast and crew==
Much of the cast, aside from Bob Flanagan in &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; and the band itself in &quot;Wish&quot;, is unknown. The film and the &quot;Wish&quot; video was directed by industrial music pioneer Peter Christopherson of the band Throbbing Gristle and co-founder of Industrial Records, although the other music videos were directed by various other people: &quot;Pinion&quot; and &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot; is credited to Eric Goode and Serge Becker, while &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; is credited to Jon Reiss.

==Production==
&quot;Broken&quot; was created as a companion piece to the EP of the same name after Reznor wanted to create an art project based on the EP with Christopherson, who intended the piece to be &quot;a comment on the existence of snuff movies and people&#x27;s obsession with them&quot;. At the time, however, Reznor was recording in the house where the Tate murders were committed; seeing the video made him uneasy, so the project was shelved, though not before Reznor circulated a few copies on VHS. Christopherson himself has expressed regret in the film&#x27;s eventual popularity: while he intended the film to be obviously fake, the degradation in quality as the tapes got copied over and over have made the distinction and his &quot;pretty obvious clues,&quot; such as the use of a fake head during the tooth removal sequence, harder and harder to spot.

==Availability==
The film has not been given an official commercial release because Reznor wanted to stop it from overshadowing the prominence of the music, thus adding to its mythological status in alternative culture. The original hand-dubbed tapes were distributed by Reznor to various friends with technological glitches implemented at certain points, in order to identify the leaker of any copies that might surface. Reznor, commenting in the &quot;Access&quot; section of the Nine Inch Nails website in 2007, implied that Gibby Haynes was responsible for the most prominent leak. This copy was traded on VHS tapes for years (resulting in many poor-quality, high-generation copies), and was later encoded in MPEG and AVI formats and distributed extensively through peer-to-peer networks and Nine Inch Nails fan websites. These are generally not of the highest quality, as they are not first-generation copies.

The music videos (without the interstitial footage between songs) for &quot;Pinion&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;, and &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; were made officially available on &quot;Closure&quot; and on the official Nine Inch Nails website.

On &quot;Fixed&quot; (the 1992 remix CD for the &quot;Broken&quot; EP), remixers employed a heavily processed sample of Flanagan&#x27;s screaming from the &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; video as part of the rhythm in the tracks &quot;Screaming Slave&quot; and a remix of the &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; song (although the sample is very obscure on the latter). On the &quot;Collected&quot; DVD that was sent out in promotion of the album &quot;With Teeth&quot; in 2005, portions of the movie are shown for a few seconds in crystal-clear quality.

In August 2005, a new copy of the movie was distributed via BitTorrent as a remastered DVD image. The remaster, titled &quot;Broken 2.0&quot;, was primarily sourced from a low-generation copy of the tape that was anonymously sent to a long-time member of the online fan community; however, much of the music video content was replaced with higher-resolution footage sourced from the VHS release of &quot;Closure&quot;. Like all of the copies that existed online prior to that point, this version does not have video footage during &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;, but a blank screen instead. Menu screens, a chapter index, and the option to listen to the audio tracks from the CD without added sound effects are all distinct features of &quot;Broken 2.0&quot;.

On December 30, 2006, an unofficial version of the film was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via The Pirate Bay by the same anonymous user called &quot;seed0&quot;, who had uploaded the leaked DVD version of &quot;Closure&quot;. The DVD image represents a significant upgrade in visual and audio quality from &quot;Broken 2.0.&quot; and includes the oft-missing video for &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell&quot;. Fans have speculated that the footage is from the master tape and that Trent Reznor himself leaked it online along with the &quot;Closure&quot; DVD leak, as implied by a post on his official blog on December 21, 2006, which said: &quot;Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn&#x27;t say that out loud). If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, cool.&quot;

On May 6, 2013, the entire video was made available for streaming on Vimeo via Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Tumblr page. It was removed by Vimeo almost immediately, and the Tumblr post was updated with an allusion to The Pirate Bay. In July 2014, the full video returned to Vimeo, but was once again deleted. As of January 2020, the entire uncensored film is available to view when accessed by a hidden link on the discography page of the official Nine Inch Nails website, leading to a copy in the Internet Archive.

<doc id="433066" wikidata="Q5170878" url="?curid=433066" title="Corktown, Detroit">
<text>Corktown is a neighborhood located in Detroit, Michigan. It is the oldest extant neighborhood in the city. The current boundaries of the district include I-75 to the north, the John C. Lodge Freeway (The Lodge) to the east, Bagley and Porter streets to the south, and Rosa Parks Boulevard (12th Street) to the west. The neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The Corktown Historic District is largely residential, although some commercial properties along Michigan Avenue and Trumbull Avenue are included in the district. The residential section is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated as a City of Detroit Historic District. The neighborhood contains many newer homes and retains some original Irish businesses.Ford&#x27;s 2018 acquisition of Michigan Central Station has spurred significant development and revitalization efforts in Corktown, transforming it into a burgeoning hub of innovation and urban renewal.

==History==
The Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s resulted in extensive Irish migration to the United States and Canada. By the middle of the 19th century, they were the largest ethnic group settling in Detroit. Many of these newcomers settled on the west side of the city; they were primarily from County Cork, and thus the neighborhood came to be known as Corktown. By the early 1850s, half of the population of the 8th Ward (which contained Corktown) were of Irish descent. Historically, the neighborhood was roughly bounded by Third Street to the east, Grand River Avenue to the north, 12th Street to the west, and Jefferson Avenue/Detroit River to the south.

By the Civil War, German immigrants had begun making inroads into the Corktown neighborhood. Many immigrants had come from German provinces after the revolutions of 1848. By the turn of the century, the original Irish population had diffused through the city, and new immigrants, notably Mexican and Maltese, moved into this older housing. As the century progressed, migrants from the American South and Appalachia, both black and white, were lured by the jobs in the automobile industry and also went to the city. By the middle of the 20th century, the area of Corktown was reduced through urban renewal schemes, the building of light industrial facilities, and the creation of the Lodge Freeway and Fisher Freeway.

==Revitalization==
Corktown has seen a number of revitalization projects since 2005. These include the United Irish Societies Irish Plaza, dedicated in 2006; the 66,000-square foot (6,100 m2) Quicken Loans Technology Center, opened in 2015; and the Detroit Police Athletic League (PAL) headquarters, and youth sports facility at the old Tiger Stadium site at Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, developed in 2016. Opposite the PAL facility, a $37-million mixed-use development, &quot;The Corner&quot;, with 111 apartments, and 34 townhomes for sale, broke ground in early 2018. Also in 2016, the new Trumbull &amp; Porter boutique hotel opened after a $10 million renovation; and in 2017, Soave Enterprises broke ground on Elton Park, a multi-phase, multi-year $150 million, 420 apartment mixed-used development.

In 2024, Detroit City FC announced the acquisition of the site of the former Southwest Detroit Hospital with plans to build a new soccer-specific stadium. The goal is to have the stadium ready by the 2027 season. 

===Ford Corktown Campus===
A major redevelopment push in the area was started by the Ford Motor Company, which began development on an urban campus in Corktown in 2017 with its purchase, renovation and occupation of The Factory building at Michigan Ave. and Rosa Parks Blvd. Ford later bought other parcels of land in Corktown, including the Michigan Central Station and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse. Ford plans a new $740 million Corktown campus, including 1.2 million square feet of mixed-use development spread over the Michigan Central Station, Roosevelt Warehouse, the Factory building at 1907 Michigan Avenue, and build a new mixed-use 290,000-square foot (27,000 m2), four-story building on the vacant brass factory building site, known as &quot;The Alchemy&quot;, at 2051 Rosa Park Blvd. Ford also announced plans to build two new parking structures.

The focus of the Corktown campus will be on autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners related to Ford&#x27;s expansion into Autos 2.0. Ford is also seeking $104 million in tax breaks from the city as part of a $250 million incentive package over 34 years.

In 2020, Ford revealed a new site plan for its 30-acre Corktown Campus, a walkable Mobility Innovation District built around the Michigan Central Station that includes green spaces, new buildings, and community involvement.

== Architecture ==
The original buildings in Corktown are Federal-style detached homes and rowhouses built by Irish settlers. A worker&#x27;s row house circa 1840 is located on Sixth Street and is one of the oldest existing structures in the city of Detroit. In later years, modestly sized Victorian townhouses with Italianate, Gothic, and Queen Anne elements were constructed in the district.

Michigan Avenue in Corktown is notable for its historic red brick pavers, which have been a defining feature of the neighborhood for decades. These bricks, originally laid in the 1890s, are a remnant of Detroit’s early efforts to improve road quality and have been preserved to maintain the area’s historic charm. Recent development plans aim to restore and reuse these historic pavers as part of the ongoing revitalization of the Michigan Avenue corridor.

==Education==

Residents are zoned to Detroit Public Schools. Residents are zoned to Owen at Pelham and King High School.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit operates the Most Holy Trinity School in Corktown. It is one of the four remaining Catholic grade schools in the city.

<text>Dia ( ), also pronounced locally Ntia ( ), is an uninhabited island off the northern coast of the Greek island of Crete. The island is 5 km long, 3 km wide and is located approximately 13 km north of Heraklion. Administratively, Dia is part of the community of Elia within the municipal unit of Gouves, Hersonissos municipality in Heraklion.

In the south coast of Dia there are four coves, from west to east Agios Georgios, Kapari, Panagia (Madonna) and Agrielia. One more cove, Aginara, is to the east.

==History==
The island was formerly known as Standia, by juncture loss in the phrase (Greek for &#x27;on Dia&#x27;).

It was the principal port of Crete for centuries. Its four south coves have been used as anchorages since the Minoan period.

==Mythology==
The islet looks like a giant lizard when viewed from the city of Heraklion. Greek mythology tells of a giant lizard that tried to destroy the island of Crete, however, Zeus turned it into stone with a thunderbolt, thus creating the island.

The island is visible from Crete&#x27;s capital city of Heraklion, as it would have been in the time of the Minoans, from Knossos. Because of this, it was sometimes identified as the island that Theseus escaped to after killing the minotaur.

==Environment==
On Dia there are a number of protected wildlife species including the snail Albinaria retusa, the lizard &quot;Podarcis erchardii schiebeli&quot;, a wild subspecies of the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus cnossius&quot;), and Eleonora&#x27;s falcon, known as in Greek. The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding population of 300–380 pairs of the Eleonora&#x27;s falcons.
Dia is part of the European Network of Nature (Natura 2000) and is a protected hunting ground. There are also a number of protected plants such as &quot;Carlina diae&quot;.

==Ancient port==

In 1976, Jacques Cousteau carried out underwater exploration around Dia and found the remains of an ancient port in the waters between Heraklion and Dia.

==Visiting==
Day trips, but no camping, is allowed to Dia. Swimming, snorkeling and walking along the beach are popular activities. No cars are allowed.

<doc id="433071" wikidata="Q5367201" url="?curid=433071" title="Elora, Ontario">
<text>The Historic Village of Elora is a community in the township of Centre Wellington (Wellington County) in the Province of Ontario, Canada. It is well known for its 19th-century limestone architecture and its geographically, historically, and culturally significant limestone gorge.

Elora is no longer an incorporated municipality in its own right, although it is the seat of the municipal government which succeeded it. The Township of Centre Wellington was formed in 1999 when, on the advice of the Province, the County amalgamated the Town of Fergus; the Village of Elora; and the surrounding townships of Nichol, Pilkington, and West Garafraxa (along with the northwestern part of Eramosa.) The decision — along with the Ontario government’s role therein — remains highly controversial among Elora’s inhabitants.

In 2011, the Village was estimated to have had a population of approximately 7,756.

==History==
Roman Catholic missionaries first visited the area in the early to mid 1600s attempting to Christianize the indigenous people, particularly the Neutral Nation on the Attiwandaronk Lands. The first European settlers arrived in 1817, and Roswell Matthews built a home here the next year.

Captain William Gilkison (1777–1833) was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, and emigrated to North America in 1796. He served with the British forces in the War of 1812 as an assistant quartermaster-general, and in 1832 purchased some 14,000 acres of land in Nichol Township. He selected this area near the falls of the Grand River as a town site for his proposed settlement and named it Elora. It was laid out by Lewis Burwell, deputy provincial land surveyor, late in 1832, and the following year Gilkison established a sawmill and a general store. The founder of Elora died in April, 1833, before the full results of his foresight and enterprise were achieved.
Elora was founded in 1832 by Captain William Gilkison, originally from Scotland, who was a British officer recently returned from India. He had also served in the War of 1812, fighting the nascent United States. He bought 14,000 acres of land on the Grand River and settled on the east side of the river. The plan for the settlement was laid out by Lewis Burwell, in late 1832, when it was called Irvine Settlement. By 1833, Gilkison had opened a sawmill and a general store. Gilkison named the community after his brother&#x27;s ship, which was itself inspired by the Ellora Caves near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India.

Charles Allan and Andrew Geddes laid out a town site on the west side of the river. By 1848, village lots were being sold and the settlement was incorporated into a village in 1858. The commercial area was near the grist mill, by the waterfalls (Mill St.) and eventually moved further up the hill.

The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 describes Elora as having a beautiful waterfalls and a deep channel carved by the river in the limestone rock. At the time there were only 100 inhabitants but two churches, three mills and a post office. Otherwise there were a few tradesmen and a single tavern.

In the 1850s and 1860s, Elora was a major agricultural marketplace. Stores in the downtown area sold many types of goods. The flour mill and saw mill were powered by the Grand River. In 1869 the population was 1,500. By 1870, several other mills, two distilleries, a carpet factory, tannery and two furniture factories were operating. While there were some earlier private providers of electricity on a small scale, more extensive provision of power, by Ontario Hydropower, began in 1914.

=== Elora Mill ===
The extant five-storey Elora grist mill was built in 1832, and through its history housed a sawmill, distillery and flour mill. In the 1970s, it became a hotel called the Elora Mill Inn, which closed in 2010. Plans were submitted to convert the building to condominiums and a hotel, and in 2017 a report stated &quot;Elora Mill Inn and Spa, a $120 million project expected to bring a world class resort and 250 jobs to the area when it opens in Spring 2018. Following a $27 million renovation, the Elora Mill Hotel and Spa, owned by Pearle Hospitality, opened in July 2018, employing 170 people and featuring 30 rooms and a restaurant. Construction of the condominium section of the property was to begin in 2019.

In February 2020, the property was awarded a Heritage Recognition Award by Heritage Centre Wellington.

=== David Street (Irvine Creek) bridge ===

In 2002 the Township of Centre Wellington announced that, for safety reasons, it would be necessary to demolish the historically important David Street Bridge over Irvine Creek. The structure and its pier had been built in 1868 by Charles Lawrence, a stonemason. The structure was &quot;the first cantilever bridge in North America&quot;. (A more modest earlier bridge had been built over the Irvine Creek in 1848.) It is described as one of the few remaining open-spandrel concrete arch bridges and is listed in the Ontario Heritage Bridge Program. Concerned about the preservation of Elora&#x27;s culturally significant architecture, the group Elora Heritage was founded. They received over 1,000 names on a petition. They met with representatives from town council as well as the provincial and federal governments.

It became apparent that the bridge was beyond preservation; however council agreed to preserve the pier and build a replica bridge in 2004. The project presented numerous engineering challenges but was successfully completed. The current structure is similar to the 1921 bridge; the 1867 stone pier was retained as had been planned.

====Victoria Street Bridge====

Most parts of another bridge over the river known as the Victoria Street Pedestrian Bridge, had been demolished years ago but it was being rebuilt in 2019 as part of the downtown re-development.

The first Victoria Street Bridge over the Grand River was built in 1843, again in 1871 and lastly the as a Pratt struss bridge in 1899. The latest structure, a non truss concrete beam pedestrian bridge with decorative railings and stone cladding mimicking arch below, replaced the previous structure which was demolished in 2006. Named for Jack R. MacDonald, the new bridge opened in November 2019 and allows for increased pedestrian access into the core.!

====Metcalfe Badley Bridge====

The Metcalfe Street (Badley) Bridge (c. 1952-1953) is the main vehicular bridge with direct access into town. The Parker Through truss bridge has been assessed as in poor state and would be closed for repairs or replacement. The new bridge will not be a truss bridge in order to accommodate vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. The scope of the Victoria St. project was described as:Construction of the bridge deck concrete topping and side curbs, masonry pilasters, steel framing and arched masonry stone side skirts along the bridge, steel railings, electrical, lighting and the finished piazza concrete slab, retaining wall, storm sewer extension and planting beds.

A report in April 2020 indicated that benefits included &quot;wider traffic lanes and sidewalks, two new bike lanes, an expanded observation deck, enhanced lighting, limestone gateway piers&quot;. The reconstructed bridge opened on 18 December 2020.

=== From &quot;poorhouse&quot; to museum ===
In 1877, the County opened the Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge, or Poorhouse as it was called, on Wellington Road 18 between Fergus and Elora. Over the years, approximately 1500 &quot;deserving&quot; poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm or suffering from disabilities were housed here. The sixty bed house for &quot;inmates&quot; was surrounded by a 30-acre &quot;industrial&quot; farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. According to a 2009 report by the Toronto Star, &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;. A hospital was added in 1892. A nearby cemetery has 271 plots for those who died. In 1947 the House was converted into the Wellington County Home for the Aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.

A historic plaque was erected at the museum, indicating that the &quot;government-supported poorhouse&quot; was &quot;the shelter of last resort for the homeless and destitute, who traded spartan accommodations for domestic or agricultural labour&quot;.

==Raceway and slots controversy==

In 2000 a proposal was made to bring a standardbred horse racing track with slot machines to Elora, by creating the Grand River Raceway. The plan became the subject of much debate. The Centre Wellington Citizens Coalition was formed in opposition to the race track, primarily because of the inclusion of gambling facilities. A 4–3 decision to approve the opening was made by township council. It came down to a 3–3 decision and the mayor at the time voted in favour of it. The Grand River Raceway eventually opened in Elora in 2002, with Slots At Grand River Raceway offering 200 slot machines operated by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).

Grand River Raceway is owned and operated by the Grand River Agricultural Society (G.R.A.S.), a not-for-profit corporation, incorporated under the Agricultural Societies Act of Ontario and operated by a volunteer board of directors. The Society operates the racetrack and other facilities. It leases space to the OLG for the slot machines; the OLG is the operator and employer for the slots operation. In 2009, the business paid $1.6 million in taxes and the OLG paid the Township an additional $1.78 million, being a share of the profits.

A plan for substantial expansion, approved by Township Council in February 2017, will include gaming tables (up to 52) and many additional slot machines (up to 1,200 in total). Some councillors were strongly opposed to the plan. The rationale for the majority decision was the revenue benefit; since the slots opened, the Township has received over $22 million from the currently small operation.

==Tourism==
Many tourists visit Elora on day trips, attracted by the historic nature of the town or the Grand River Raceway with horse racing and slot machines. It has many small shops, pubs, cafés, restaurants and art galleries. These are often in buildings built during the mid 19th century. The Gorge Cinema is Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously running repertory theatre. The annual Elora Festival &amp; Singers event is particularly popular.

The Elora Gorge and its Conservation Area are at the edge of town. The park offers canoeing, paddleboat rentals, hiking, camp-grounds, fishing and picnicking. Some of the limestone cliffs are 12 metres (40 feet) high. At the eastern end of the village is the Elora Quarry Conservation Area, a scenic former limestone quarry, and is now a popular swimming area.

In 2001, a group of citizens organized an arts and cultural centre, the Elora Centre for the Arts, at the site of a century school whose headmaster had been at one time David Boyle, who was well known as an educator in the late 1800s.

The township of Centre Wellington has an active historical society and operates the Wellington County Museum and Archives in a historic stone building in Aboyne, halfway between Elora and Fergus, Ontario. This two-storey Italianate-style stone building was the oldest known state-supported poorhouse or almshouse in Canada, called the House of Industry and Refuge when it opened in 1877. The museum opened in 1975 and the building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.

==Climate==
Elora has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification with cold winters and warm summers.
==Geography==
Elora is situated on the Grand River, approximately north of Guelph, and northeast of Kitchener-Waterloo.

==Demographics==
The Canada 2001 Census was the last Canadian census to record Elora as a separate community. In the Canada 2006 Census, demographic statistics were published only for Centre Wellington.

According to the Canada 2001 Census:
Data extrapolated from the 2011 Canada Census report indicates that at the time, Elora had a population of about 7,756.

No data for this community was available in the 2016 census, but the population of the entire Centre Wellington Township was 28,191, and this included the population of Fergus which was 20,767 at that time.

==Local government==
The Centre Wellington Township council includes a Mayor (Shawn Watters) and six councillors. Three of the latter live in Fergus while one lives in Elora.
The Township is also represented on the County of Wellington Council which is made up of seven mayors and nine councilors.

==Economy==
Centre Wellington is heavily agricultural but is also the home to industries, manufacturers, retailers, health care services and trades people. The local economy also benefits greatly from tourism. Data is not available for Elora alone but at the time of the 2011 Census, 6.4% of the workforce of Centre Wellington was involved in agriculture and other resource-based industries/utilities, 24.8% in manufacturing and construction, 19.8% in health and education and 13.2% in wholesale and retail trade. The top three categories for employment (in order of importance) were in manufacturing, Healthcare and Agriculture. The major employers in the township include Jefferson Elora Corp., Nexans Canada, Polycorp Ltd., Groves Memorial Hospital, Wellington Terrace and PR Donnelly.

Centre Wellington encourages the filming of movies and TV shows; quite a few productions have taken advantage of the historic look of Fergus, and especially Elora, for location work. In 2016, parts of the 10-part miniseries, &quot;Canada: The Story of Us&quot;, were filmed in Elora which was a stand-in for scenes of WW II skirmishes in Holland and France.

The Elora Quarry was used to film a couple of scenes in the movie &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, and for a scene for the 2017 movie &quot;It&quot;. The Elora Quarry and nearby West Montrose Covered Bridge were also featured in &quot;It&quot;. Parts of the Grand River in both Elora and Fergus were the site for some of the scenes filmed for the 1994 movie &quot;Trapped in Paradise&quot;. Other productions have also done filming in Elora, including the 1979 TV movie, &quot;An American Christmas Carol&quot;&quot;,&quot;According to Centre Wellington, Elora or Fergus was also featured in: Lars and the Real Girl (2007), Dead Silence (2007) and Mrs. Soffel (1984).

==Sports==

Elora has a very active lawn bowling club that offers programs for all ages. The Elora Rocks Lawn Bowling Club is a member of District 7 of the Ontario Lawn Bowling Association, and more information about the club may be found on the District website.

Elora is also home to the Elora Mohawks lacrosse team, the Elora Rocks hockey team.

At the community level, Elora also has a skating club, a curling club, a girls&#x27; hockey team (Grand River Mustangs), minor hockey team (Centre Wellington Fusion), soccer (Fergus-Elora District Soccer), a ringette team, and a few baseball teams, as well as several other sports clubs and organizations.

Lorestan is located close to the border with Iraq. Situated in a scenic valley surrounded by mountains, Lorestan lies approximately 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) east of the Iraqi border.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Lorestan&quot; means &quot;land of the Lurs.&quot;

== History ==

The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The Kassites, an ancient people who spoke neither an Indo-European nor a Semitic language, originated in Lorestān. They would control Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.

Parts of Luristan were invaded and settled by the Iranian Medes in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the Kassites as well as the Gutians, by the time the area was conquered by the Persians in the 1st millennium BC. In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the Achaemenid era were made in Lorestan for the first time.

===Luristan bronze===

Small Luristan bronze artworks, usually dated about 1000 to 650 BC, reached the outside world from the late 1920s and are found in museums all over the world, where they are valued for their vigorous style, with many representations of animals. But actually, the beginning of this bronze-making tradition goes back to the mid–3rd millennium BC.

Archaeologists characterized these techniques by the metallurgical analysis of different artifacts,
We have characterized these practices by the compositional and metallurgical analysis of grave goods from several cemeteries in the region including six dating to different phases of the Bronze Age (Early Dynastic I to Ur ED III, circa 2900–2000 BC)—Kalleh Nisar, Bani Surmah, Chigha Sabz, Kamtarlan, Sardant, and Gulal-i Galbi—and four dating to different phases of the Iron Age (circa 1300 B.C.–600 B.C.)—Bard-i Bal, Kutul-i Gulgul, Sar Kabud, and War Kabud.
Technically, the term &#x27;Luristan bronze&#x27; usually refers only to the later bronze objects, although they have many similarities. The earlier bronze objects were made during the Elam period.

Lorestan was successfully integrated into the Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian empires. Parts of the region managed to stay independent during the Arab, Seljuk and Mongol invasions.
=== Kurdish rule (959–1597) ===

=== Zand era (1751–1794) ===
=== Qajar era (1794–1925) ===
Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar of the Qajar dynasty was an ardent antagonist of the people of Lorestan and the dynasty applied a policy of divide and rule (nefāq afkanī) for the region where they would pit tribes against each other. When Agha Mohammad Khan took over Iran by defeating the Zand dynasty, he instated non-local governor-generals, princes and other personalities who were never native to Lorestan. Moreover, the governor-generals of Lorestan never had sufficient armed forces to their disposal to maintain order and collect taxes.

The Qajar dynasty would ultimately have a devastating impact on Lorestan including on its territorial integrity, economic decline, political instability, reduction of settled communities and increased pastoral nomadism. Pastoral nomadism increased because the Qajars were unable to maintain law and order, which in turn strengthened tribal autonomy and tribal self-determination, while it meant that the settled population had to protect their lives and property themselves. During this period, the nomadic pastoralist tribes would take over crown land and lands owned by urbanists, pushing the settled rural population who had no control over their properties or farm products to either join the pastoral nomads or leave their villages. The Khorrambad plains were taken by the Baharvand tribe.

Visiting the region in 1917, Cecil J. Edmonds noted that Khorramabad was the only city in the province and that all villages had been ruined or deserted. When Rawlinson had visited the area in 1836, he contrarily noted: &quot;After breakfast I rode into Khorramabad, a distance of 5 miles from the foot of the hills, through a richly cultivated district thronged with villages and garden&quot;.

=== Pahlavi Iran (1920s-1979) ===

==== Conquest of Lorestan ====
The establishment of Pahlavi Iran by Reza Shah in the 1920s demanded a change in the traditional relationship between the state and the locals. This demand for change resulted in a war in the spring of 1922 and subsequently the subjugation of the locals. While having support among the urban population along with the leaders of the Sagvand and Baharvand tribes, many tribal leaders were skeptical of a returning state power to Lorestan.

In a statement to the tribesmen in Lorestan in 1924, the Shah stated that he equated nomadic pastoralism to savagery and the tribal way of life as an obstacle to modernization and progress. Conquering the anarchic Lorestan was important to the Shah economically, politically, militarily and symbolically and is also paved the way for the state to conquer Khuzestan. No reliable sources exist on the capture of Lorestan and no mention of the atrocities against the local population nor the assistance of some tribes for the Shah.

The Laki-speaking Beiranvand was the most troublesome tribe for the state and confrontations between the tribe and state took place in the Silakhor Plain near Borujerd in late spring of 1922. Other tribes did not confront the Pahlavi forces due to disunity, while the governor of Lorestan believed it was inappropriate for him to confront the Shah because he was a state representative. Nevertheless, he did not support Shah rule over Lorestan who he considered a debased Cossack.

In December 1923, the small army of the Shah (around 2,500 men) advanced toward Khorramabad but its first column was fully wiped out by the Beirvanvand tribe and their arms and ammunition was looted. The second column succeeded in breaking the siege on Khorramabad and was welcomed by the local population as the tribes were at their winter territories faraway from the city. The new state would appoint local people as officials including the most powerful man in Lorestan who was appointed governor of Tarhan District and Shir Mohammad Khan of the Sagvand tribe was asked to be advisor for the governor and the army.

The Baharvand leaders worked hard to prevent any confrontation between the army and the tribes but General Ahmadi went ahead with executions resulting in bloodshed and a continuation of hostilities. Both leaders from the rebellious Beiranvand and tribal leaders who had supported the Shah against the Beiranvand were executed. The Beiranvand tribe would consequently rebel again while other tribes avoided continued confrontation despite being distrustful to the new state. Other tribes who did rebel were the Kurdish Chegini tribe and the Romani. They were successful as they fought, defeated and looted the army.

The news angered General Shah Bakhti who chose to send his own force to the region, but his men never reached Khorramabad as the Chegini caught and beat him, and moreover killed around 120 of his men. The defeat and humiliation of the army reached the Beiranvands who then urged for a unified tribal attack against the army and received support from the Papi, Baharvand, Chegini tribes and half of the Judaki tribe.

These tribes collectively attacked Khorramabad in late May 1924 and drove the army into the fortresses in the city as they suffered large casualties again with ammunitions taken by the tribes. The tribes then sieged the city for 38 days which forced General Shah Bakhti to retreat to Borujerd with the blessing of the Shah. However, the leader of the Sagvands persuaded the General to not retreat as the army would be wiped out and noted that the tribes could not fight for a long time because of the shortage of ammunition and lack of provisions. During this period, the army received endless support from the population of Khorramabad.

By June 1924, General Ahmadi was dispatched with his army to Khorramabad and began fighting the tribes but with no results. During the siege, consultations were taking place between tribe and the state to end the conflict and the Baharvand tribe was the first tribe to withdraw from the tribal alliance due to a dispute over captured cannon and other matters. The Judaki, Papi and Chegini would follow suit forcing the Beiranvand tribe to withdraw as well. The subsequent conquest of Lorestan is attributed to the alliance of the Shah with some dedicated tribes. Reza Shah visited Lorestan in the summer of 1924 as he was planning on attacking Khuzestan and some tribes including the Sagvand would enter Dezful with the army without any incident.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
Linguistic composition of the province in 2023:

==== Lurs ====
Lorestan province is one of the main settlements of the Lur people and the Northern variety Luri language is the main language of the province. Northern Luri is also spoken in southern Ilam and Khuzestan provinces.

Lurs form the majority of the population of Khorramabad, the largest city and the capital of the province, Borujerd and Dorud, the second and the third largest cities of the province respectively. Khorramabad is also the largest Luri-speaking city in Iran and the world.

==== Kurds ====
The northern part of Lorestan is populated by the Kurds of the Lak tribe who were estimated to constitute over 65% of the population in the province in 1980. Laks live in the Delfan, Dowreh and Selseleh counties which are populated by various subtribes including the Chegini, Itivand, Kakavand, Nurali and Papi. Oshtorinan District in Borujerd County is moreover populated by the Hasanvand tribe.

Aligudarz County, Azna County, Kuhdasht County, Khorramabad County and Pol-e Dokhtar County are ethnically mixed and populated by both Kurdish and Luri tribes.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 1,689,650 in 382,805 households. The 2011 national census counted 1,754,243 residents in 462,260 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,760,649 inhabitants in 509,025 households.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The population history and structural changes of Lorestan province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===

According to the 2016 census, 1,134,908 people (over 64% of the population of Lorestan province) live in the following cities:

== Geography ==
In the wider sense it consists of that part of western Iran coinciding with the Ilam province and extending for about 650 km on a northwest to southeast axis from Kermanshah to Fars, with a breadth of 150–180 km. The terrain consists chiefly of mountains, with numerous ranges, part of the Zagros chain, running northwest to southeast. The central range has many summits that almost reach the line of perpetual snow, rising to 4000 m and more. It feeds the headwaters of Iran&#x27;s most important rivers, such as the Zayanderud, Jarahi, Karun, Diz, Abi, Karkheh. Between the higher ranges lie many fertile plains and low hilly, well-watered districts.

The highest point of the province is the Oshtorankuh peak at 4,050 m. The low-lying areas being in the southernmost sector of the province are approximately 500 m above sea level. Oak forest covers the outer slopes, together with elm, maple, walnut, and almond trees.

Western Luristan comprises a series of parallel fertile valleys running high in the Zagros mountains. The Pusht-i Kuh region is in the western foothills of the Kabir Kuh range. The Pish-i Kuh region lies to the east of Kabir Kuh. This area had human settlements during the Bronze Age as early as the mid–3rd millennium B.C.

=== Climate ===

Climatically, the province can be divided into three parts. The mountainous regions, such as Borujerd, Dorud, Azna, Nurabad, and Aleshtar, experience cold winters and moderate summers. In the central region, the spring season begins in mid-February and lasts till mid-May. The city of Khorramabad is in this realm.
However, southern areas such as Pol-e-Dokhtar and Papi, are under the influence of the warm air currents of Khuzestan, and have hot summers and relatively moderate winters.

It is set in the year 2027, 7 years after the events in &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;. The game&#x27;s timeline doesn&#x27;t correspond with that of the later third edition of Cyberpunk, which makes no mention of any of its contents or setting elements.

The game was licensed out in 2004 to Firestorm Ink under freelance writer Jonathan Lavallee though they are no longer the license holders.

==Overview==
&quot;Cybergeneration&quot; (1993), published by R. Talsorian featured a new setting for &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; in an alternate version of the year 2027 with a world where the corporations are now the new governments, and where player characters are young adults that have more heroic motives in opposing the Machine.

In terms of tone, &quot;CyberGeneration&quot; differs from its predecessor somewhat, as the player characters take the part of nanotech-enhanced youngsters in an oppressive world ruled by adults who fear and seek to control them. The special powers of the CyberEvolved children give the game a definite superhero flavor. The players can be many different roles such as actors, inventors or motorbike races but they can be many more. 

A second edition of &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; was published in 1995.

Firestorm Ink licensed the rights to &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; in 2004. They published several products including &quot;Generation Gap&quot; (2005) – which R. Talsorian produced a decade earlier but never published - and &quot;Researching Medicine&quot; (2005) - a MedTech update set in 2027, ending the line with the PDF-only &quot;Mile High Dragon&quot; (2009).

== Background ==
The back story revolves around the &quot;Fox Run&quot; incident of 2025, in which a transport of supposed scientific equipment crashed and accidentally released a weaponized nano-virus called the &quot;Carbon Plague&quot;. 

Adult humans infected by it died horribly after the virus rewrote the victims&#x27; genetic code and warped their bodies. However, the virus had a different effect on children and teenagers. Since they haven&#x27;t fully matured, it altered their bodies. This granted them nanotech-enhanced powers, and made them immune carriers if they survived the illness. Society dramatically fears the capabilities of these &quot;CyberEvolved&quot; children, which drives them underground.

CyberEvolved, also called the &quot;Changed&quot;, also belong to &quot;yogangs&quot; or youth gangs, subcultures that have distinct philosophies, styles, and special skills. 

The oppressive mega-corporation Arasaka manages to dominate the US Government and gets its candidate David Whindam elected President of the new Incorporated States of America (ISA). Its laissez-faire government works with the corporations directly, becoming their puppet. The &quot;Bureau of Relocation&quot; (BuReloc) is a paramilitary force that runs prison camps for &quot;unproductive&quot; citizens and hunts down the Changed.

Multiple groups oppose, fear, and hunt the Changed, but one group stands out as protectors: the Edgerunners of old. The sourcebook describes them as wiser, more experienced and, ultimately rebels-&quot;with&quot;-a-cause (&quot;CyberGeneration&quot; offers the rules to convert old &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; characters into adults for the &quot;CyberGeneration&quot; setting).

To oppose this oppressive dictatorship, several major &quot;Edgerunner&quot; non-player characters from Cyberpunk 2020 run the Eden Cabal, a revolutionary movement that seeks to overthrow the ISA and BuReloc.

===The CyberEvolved===
So-called &quot;CyberEvolved&quot; children have special powers and abilities. They fit in one of several archetypes: 

;Original CyberEvolved
: Alchemist (&quot;Manipulation&quot;) - Uses nanites to reshape matter at the molecular level.
: Bolter (&quot;Bolt Throwing&quot;) - Project taser-like charged hexite metal cables or chains at a target.
: Scanner (&quot;Interpretation&quot;) - Sense the brainwave patterns of others, allowing for telepathic-like abilities.
: Tinman (&quot;Shaping&quot;) - Liquid metal skin formed from hexite. Limbs shape into tentacles or solid weapons and can extend; flesh provides &quot;natural&quot; body armor
: Wizard (&quot;Arcane&quot;) - Augmented computer-hacking powers, particularly with the Virtuality augmented reality technology that has largely supplanted the Virtual Net. 

;Later Additions
: Jammer (&quot;Holler&quot;) - Can jam media transmissions by generating electromagnetic force-fields. [&quot;MediaFront&quot;]
: Medic (&quot;Sympathetic Healing&quot;) - Heals others through biokinesis. [&quot;Researching Medicine&quot;]
: Scout (&quot;Probe Ops&quot;) - Creates hexite remote probes for reconnaissance. [&quot;EcoFront&quot;]

===YoGangs===
Members of a YoGang have unique Special Abilities, like Roles in &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;.

==Rules==
&quot;Cybergeneration&quot; uses R. Talsorian&#x27;s Interlock System. They are similar to &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; except the skills are fewer, broader and less specialized. This was due to the characters being younger and less experienced than their elders. A group of CP2020 skills would be equivalent to one CG2027 skill. This unfortunately made experienced &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; characters (especially the CyberEvolved) potentially more versatile and powerful than &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; characters.

===Character Generation===
The Attributes are the same as in &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;: Intelligence, Reflexes, Cool, Technical Ability, Luck, Attractiveness, Movement, Empathy, and Body. The player must divide 50 points between them and levels range from a minimum of 2 to a starting maximum of 8. Skill levels range from 0 (no experience at all) to 10 (top of their field). The player must divide 40 points between them.

The character&#x27;s age ranges between 8 and 18 years old and is either chosen by the player or can be randomized (2d6 + 6 for children or 1d6 + 12 for teens).

==Supplements==
R. Talsorian supported &quot;CyberGeneration Revolution 2.0&quot; with a quartet of supplements. Each supplement expanded on the world of 2027 as well as new Yogangs and CyberEvolved. Later, licensee Firestorm Ink would release another pair of supplements in support of the game.

;The &quot;Documents of the Revolution&quot; Supplements (published by R. Talsorian)
* &quot;EcoFront&quot;, impact of corporate America on the environment.
* &quot;MediaFront&quot;, state of news agencies, Braindance, and Virtuality.
* &quot;VirtualFront&quot;, state of the Net post-ISA occupation.

;Scenario supplements (published by R. Talsorian)
* &quot;Bastille Day&quot;, the characters are recruited by Rache Bartmoss to find and rescue Spider Murphy.

;Other supplements (published by Firestorm Ink)
* &quot;Generation Gap&quot; (2004) - running and playing CyberGeneration. This was a polished and edited version of R. Talsorian&#x27;s rough draft.
* &quot;Researching Medicine&quot; (2005) - the state of medicine and MedTechies in 2027.
* &quot;Mile High Dragon&quot; (2009) - a city sourcebook about Denver, Colorado.

==Reception==
Derek Pearcy reviewed &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; for &quot;Pyramid&quot; #4 (Nov./Dec., 1993) and stated that &quot;The whole thing was written to be seriously non-linear, but a cleaner design might have helped organize things better for players who don&#x27;t want to memorize the contents of the book - the type of players who will love &quot;Cybergeneration&quot;.&quot;

Andy Butcher reviewed &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that &quot;A lot of people talk about systems that encourage roleplaying over &#x27;roll playing&#x27;, &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; is one of the few games I&#x27;ve encountered that actually manages to do so, not by using a heavy-handed or pretentious approach, but by the very nature of the game environment.&quot;

<text>The Beat (known in the United States and Canada as the English Beat and in Australia as the British Beat) are an English band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1978. Their music fuses Latin, ska, pop, soul, reggae and punk rock.

The Beat, consisting of Dave Wakeling (vocals, guitar), Ranking Roger (vocals), Andy Cox (guitar), David Steele (bass), Everett Morton (drums), and Saxa a.k.a. Lionel Augustus Martin (saxophone), released three studio albums in the early 1980s: &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop It&quot; (1980), &quot;Wha&#x27;ppen?&quot; (1981) and &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; (1982), and a string of singles, including &quot;Mirror in the Bathroom&quot;, &quot;Save It for Later&quot;, &quot;I Confess&quot;, &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, &quot;Hands Off...She&#x27;s Mine&quot;, and &quot;All Out to Get You&quot;.

==Career==

===1978–1983===
The Beat formed in Birmingham, England, in 1978, during a period of high unemployment and social upheaval in the United Kingdom. Ranking Roger, one of the band&#x27;s vocalists, added a Jamaican vocal flavour to the band&#x27;s sound with his toasting style. Jamaican saxophonist Saxa added a Jamaican ska instrumental sound. Saxa (born Lionel Augustus Martin in 1930) had played saxophone with Prince Buster, Laurel Aitken, and Desmond Dekker in the first wave of ska. He joined the Beat to record their first single, &quot;Tears of a Clown&quot;, a cover version of the Motown hit by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.

The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop It&quot;, was released in May 1980, entering the UK albums chart at No. 3. Notable singles from the album included &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Used to Losing You&quot;, &quot;Mirror in the Bathroom&quot;, &quot;Hands Off...She&#x27;s Mine&quot; and &quot;Best Friend&quot;. The second Beat album, &quot;Wha&#x27;ppen?&quot; was supported by extensive touring, including a United States tour with the Pretenders and Talking Heads. The album yielded more UK hits, with &quot;All Out to Get You&quot;, &quot;Drowning&quot; and &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot;, all of which broke into the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The Beat received support from modern rock radio stations such as KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, the now defunct KQAK The Quake 99FM (98.9) &amp; KITS Live 105 (105.3) in San Francisco and KYYX in Seattle.

Although the Beat&#x27;s main fan base was in the UK, the band was also popular in Australia, partly due to exposure on the radio station Triple J and the TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;. The Beat had a sizable following in the US and Canada, where the band were known as &quot;the English Beat&quot; for legal reasons (to avoid confusion with the American band the Beat). The Beat toured the world with well-known artists including David Bowie, the Clash, the Police, the Pretenders, R.E.M., the Specials and Talking Heads. Members of the band often collaborated on stage with the Specials.

During their early career, the band were associated with Birmingham-based cartoonist Hunt Emerson, who designed their &#x27;Beat Girl&#x27; icon and painted the mural that was used on the cover of &quot;Wha&#x27;ppen?&quot;

===Post-breakup===
After the break-up of the Beat in 1983, Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger went on to form General Public and had a couple of hit singles in the US and Canada including &quot;Tenderness&quot;, while Andy Cox and David Steele formed Fine Young Cannibals with vocalist Roland Gift from the ska band Akrylykz. Drummer Everett Morton and Saxa formed the International Beat along with the Birmingham-based singer, Tony Beet, and the band released an album titled &quot;The Hitting Line&quot; on Blue Beat Records in 1990. The album was produced by Ranking Roger and he often guested with the band at some of their shows. The International Beat toured the UK and United States until 1992.

Ranking Roger also briefly joined Mick Jones&#x27; post-Clash band Big Audio Dynamite and performed at several live shows with the band. However, the band broke up shortly after he joined when its last album was shelved by the record company. Meanwhile, &quot;March of the Swivelheads&quot;, an instrumental version of the Beat&#x27;s song &quot;Rotating Head&quot;, was used in the climactic chase scene of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;; the band was listed in the end credits as &quot;The (English) Beat&quot;. &quot;Save It for Later&quot; was featured on the soundtrack album to 1996&#x27;s &quot;Kingpin&quot;, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; and 2017&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;.

Everett Morton formed Beat Goes Bang and recruited vocalist Ross Lydon from 360, bass player Faisal Rashid, and Lukasz Machometa on sax, former member of Citybeats and Urban Groove Syndicate.

Roger released his solo debut, a reggae-oriented album entitled &quot;Radical Departure&quot;, in 1988. In the early 1990s, Roger joined members of the Specials to form Special Beat, which toured and released two live albums. They supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). In 2001, Roger released another solo album, &quot;Inside My Head&quot;, which included traditional reggae and ska with influences of electronica, jungle and dub. Ranking Roger&#x27;s son, Ranking Junior, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps. In 2005, he appeared on the Ordinary Boys&#x27; single &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;.

Pete Townshend performed his song &quot;Save It for Later&quot; numerous times between 1985 and 1998. The Who performed the song twice on their 1989 Reunion Tour.

Brazilian rock group Paralamas do Sucesso, strongly influenced by ska and world music, inspired by the vibraphone chords from &quot;Hand&#x27;s Off... She&#x27;s Mine&quot; to make the intro chords of their song &quot;Oculos&quot;, recorded in 1984.

The Wonder Stuff also played &quot;Save It for Later&quot; featuring Ranking Roger on their &quot;From the Midlands with Love&quot; series in June 2012.

Pearl Jam also began playing &quot;Save It for Later&quot; in 1996, blending it (a practice often known as &quot;tagging&quot;) into the end of &quot;Better Man&quot;, and it remained in the set list of their 2023 tour. In June 2024, lead singer Eddie Vedder released a full, solo version of the track.

===21st century===
In 2003, the Beat&#x27;s original line-up, minus Cox and Steele, played a sold-out one-off gig at the Royal Festival Hall. In 2004, the VH1 show &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; tried unsuccessfully to reunite the original line-up.

In 2006, the UK version of the Beat, featuring Ranking Roger, recorded a new album that was mixed by Adrian Sherwood, but it remains unreleased. The band also featured Everett Morton and Mickey Billingham on keyboards, formerly a member of Dexys Midnight Runners and General Public.

Dave Wakeling fronts the US version of the group as the English Beat, which usually adds a couple of General Public songs to the setlist. The singer and his band flew over to the UK in April 2011, to perform at the London International Ska Festival at the Clapham Grand music venue. They played the Great Dorset Steam Fair show 2011 on 31 August 2011. At this point, both the UK and US versions of the band continued to tour frequently on either sides of the Atlantic.

In mid-2012, the Beat released a box set, titled &quot;The Complete Beat&quot;, comprising their three albums along with non-album singles, remixes and live material. Additional bonus tracks were included on re-released, double-CD versions of each studio album.

The English Beat recorded two new songs that feature prominently in the Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated episode &quot;Dance of the Undead&quot; which aired 26 March 2013. It features a zombie ska group called Rude Boy and the Ska-Tastics who come back to life in order to turn people into zombies and make them dance to ska music forever. According to an interview Dave Wakeling conducted with the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, he said: &quot;This was my first opportunity to do anything for television as a gun for hire, and I actually managed to record and mix two songs in 12 hours. It was like running at double speed with no brakes, but it was exciting, and Warner Bros. really loved them. So the zombies have a song called &#x27;You’re Dead Right, Mate,&#x27; and the Hex Girls have one called &#x27;We&#x27;re the Good Bad Girls,’ which has a definite Ramones-Runaways vibe to it, but frankly, I&#x27;m really happy I did it, because I’ve always loved ‘Scooby-Doo.&quot;

In late 2013, the Beat with Ranking Roger released the live album, &quot;Live in London&quot; which featured a new song titled &quot;How Do You Do (Side to Side)&quot; and also a song previously released solo by Ranking Roger, entitled &quot;Dangerous&quot;, among many other songs.

The Beat feat. Ranking Roger released &quot;Bounce&quot;, a studio album, on 30 September 2016, on CD, Vinyl and Digital on DMF Records. The first single from the album, &#x27;Walking on the Wrong Side&#x27; was released in July 2016, whilst the album reached No. 49 on the UK Albums Chart.

Saxa (born Lionel Augustus Martin) died on 3 May 2017 at the age of 87.

In 2018 the Beat feat. Ranking Roger released &quot;The Beat – Live at the Roundhouse&quot; a live album with accompanying DVD, while the (English) Beat starring Dave Wakeling released an album called &quot;Here We Go Love&quot;. This album was announced by Wakeling in 2014, with the project funded through the PledgeMusic website (which was a direct-to-fan music platform where fans could donate money to a group to complete an album project).

On 26 January 2019 the Beat feat. Ranking Roger released a new studio album, &quot;Public Confidential&quot;. The first single from the album &#x27;Maniac&#x27; was playlisted on BBC Radio 6 Music.

Weeks after undergoing surgery for two brain tumours, and while undergoing treatment for lung cancer, Ranking Roger died at home on 26 March 2019, aged 56.

In March 2021, Mini Murphy (Ranking Junior from the Special Beat and the version of the Beat signed to DMF Music in 2016) teamed up with indie rock band the Ordinary Boys to record a tribute to his late father, Ranking Roger. The resulting double-A side single, with &quot;Legacy&quot; on one side and &quot;Jump and Skank&quot; on the other, was released as a download, vinyl and CD single by United Sound Records/Proper.

In October 2021, drummer Everett Morton died at the age of 71.

<doc id="433080" wikidata="Q1072963" url="?curid=433080" title="Chill (role-playing game)">
<text>Chill is an investigative and modern horror role-playing game originally published by Pacesetter Ltd in 1984 that captures the feel of 20th-century horror films.

==Setting==
&quot;Chill&quot; is inspired by, and attempts to capture the feel of, 20th-century horror films, where usual foes are vampires, werewolves, mummies, ghosts, and ghouls. Players take on the role of envoys, members of a secret organization known as S.A.V.E. (&quot;Societas Argenti Viae Eternitata&quot;, or, The Eternal Society of the Silver Way) that tracks down and eliminates evil in the world.

==Pacesetter (First Edition)==
The game was introduced by Pacesetter Ltd in 1984. The following year, Target Games released a Swedish version under the name &quot;Chock&quot; (Swedish for &quot;shock&quot; or &quot;fright&quot;), and in 1985, Schmidt Spiele released a French version. Pacesetter also launched the board game &quot;&quot;, also translated into French (&quot;Le Manoir des Ténèbres&quot;) by Schmidt Spiele.

The game components include an introductory folio, a Campaign book, a book of monsters, a map of the world, 140 die-cut double-sided counters, a range stick, and dice. The boxed set also includes a 16-page adventure, &quot;Terror in Warwick House&quot;.

===Other Pacesetter publications===
* &quot;Chill Master&#x27;s Screen&quot; (includes &quot;Castle Dracula&quot; scenario)
* &quot;Blood Moon Rising&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Creature Feature&quot; (sourcebook)
* &quot;Death on Tour&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Deathwatch on the Bayou&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Evenings of Terror with Elvira&quot; (book of adventures hosted by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark)
* &quot;Haunter of the Moor&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Highland Terror&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Things&quot; (sourcebook)
* &quot;Thutmose&#x27;s Night&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Vampires&quot; (sourcebook)
* &quot;Vengeance of Dracula&quot; (adventure)
* &quot;Village of Twilight&quot; (adventure)

Pacesetter ceased operations in 1986, bringing the publication of the First Edition of &quot;Chill&quot; to an end.

===Reception to First edition===
In the October 1984 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 90), Jerry Epperson had a few quibbles with various game mechanics. He questioned the economics rules that essentially gave characters access to unlimited amounts of cash. Epperson also wondered why a range stick was included, since there were no regulated combat maneuvering rules that would make use of the stick. And he found the introductory adventure included in the game was overly simplistic: &quot;&quot;Terror in Warwick House&quot; is much like a guided tour of a national monument. While it portends to be a dangerous place, one gets the feeling that those who fell victim to the sinister occupants before the player characters were called to the scene were either idiots or invalids. The clues required by the characters to dispose of the evil are practically spoon-fed to the players.&quot; But Epperson concluded that &quot;these problems are not major flaws in the game’s design; any GM should be able to alter them with little effort. All things considered, the &quot;Chill&quot; game does just what it sets out to do. It doesn’t stall play with unwieldy rules or sub-systems, and it allows the GM to pace the storyline and preserve the intensity of a situation thanks to the game’s elegant simplicity. As an alternative to dungeon delving, superheroing, or chasing after Cthulhu, the &quot;Chill&quot; game is something you can really sink your teeth into.&quot;

Two reviews of &quot;Chill&quot; appeared in issues of &quot;Space Gamer&quot;. In the November–December 1984 edition (Issue No. 71), William Barton admired &quot;Chill&quot; for being less violent and less weird than other horror roleplaying games, saying, &quot;&quot;Chill&quot; is a viable alternative in supernatural gaming for those who desire less gunplay than is typical in &quot;Stalking&quot; or prefer more conventional creatures than the sanity-blasting horrors of &quot;CoC&quot;.&quot; In the July–August 1985 edition (Issue 75), Warren Spector thought that &quot;Though superficially simpler than &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, the clear leader in the horror field, &quot;Chill&quot; falls somewhat short of the mark.&quot;

In the January 1985 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue 61), Angus McLellan gave &quot;Chill&quot; an average rating of 7 out of 10. McLellan felt the gameplay was fairly slow and lacking in scares; furthermore, &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; had already paved the way for horror-based role-playing games.

Paul Mason reviewed &quot;Chill&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;if you fancy a game of investigation with gothic horror overtones, and you don&#x27;t much care for H P Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu mythos, then Chill would be the game to buy.&quot;

In the December 1988 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 140), Ken Rolston reviewed two supplements published by Pacesetter just before it went out of business, &quot;Vampires&quot; and &quot;Creature Feature&quot;. Rolston had a more favourable opinion of &quot;Vampires&quot;, calling it an &quot;excellent book... The graphic presentation is top-notch.&quot; Rolston was particularly enthusiastic about the writing, which he called, &quot;exceptional&quot; and concluded, &quot;I highly recommend this supplement.&quot; He was less enthusiastic about &quot;Creature Feature&quot;, saying, &quot;This supplement lacks the graphic quality or refined presentation of the finer &quot;Chill&quot; supplements.&quot; Rolston thought the concept of allowing players to become monsters and prey on humans did have &quot;an oddly redeeming appeal&quot;, but felt that &quot;the replay value [is] negligible.&quot; He gave this supplement a thumbs down, saying, &quot;&quot;Creature Feature&quot; will not be of use to most GMs, but students of the hobby may find it interesting for a brief diversion or as a curiosity.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan was not impressed by &quot;Chill&quot;, calling it &quot;A horror game for the easily frightened.&quot; Swan could not find anything to like in the game system, commenting, &quot;The feat rules are puzzling ... the combat rules are stiff ... and the economic system is ridiculous.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a below average rating of 2 out of 4, saying, &quot;&quot;Chill&quot; is too shallow for extended campaigns, and lacks the depth to please anyone but the most undemanding players.&quot;

==Mayfair Games (Second Edition)==
In 1990, Mayfair Games inc. purchased the rights, and the following year published a second edition of the game system called &quot;Chill Core Rulebook&quot;. Over the next three years, Mayfair published fourteen sourcebooks for the setting and a collection of short stories:

* &quot;Chill Accessory Pack&quot; (included &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; scenario)
* &quot;Apparitions&quot; (sourcebook with scenario) &quot;The Visitation&quot; pg.96
* &quot;The Beast Within&quot; (standalone RPG compatible with Chill where you play monsters)
* &quot;Chill Companion&quot; (sourcebook)
* &quot;Horrors of North America&quot; (sourcebook with scenario) &quot;Once Bitten&quot; pg.81
* &quot;Lycanthropes&quot; (sourcebook with 2 scenarios) &quot;The Beast of Exmoor&quot; pg.84, &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; pg.111
* &quot;Things&quot; (sourcebook)&quot;
* &quot;Undead &amp; Buried&quot; (scenario)
* &quot;Unknown Providence: SAVE in New England&quot; (sourcebook with 4 scenarios) &quot;Weekend in New England&quot; pg.30, &quot;Death&#x27;s Head Revisited&quot; pg.47, &quot;Bitter Remnants&quot; pg.81, &quot;Dark Providence&quot; pg.93
* &quot;Vampires&quot; (sourcebook with scenario) &quot;Vengeance of Dracula&quot; pg.97
* &quot;Veil of Flesh&quot; (scenario)
* &quot;Voodoo&quot; (sourcebook with scenario) &quot;Drums in the Night&quot; pg.93
* &quot;Chilled to the Bone&quot; - anthology of short stories

Mayfair&#x27;s game was translated into French by Oriflam in 1994.

===Reception to Second Edition===
In Issue 47 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Lester W. Smith reviewed the Mayfair edition and noted the abundance of new material. Smith also liked the revamped game mechanics, and concluded, &quot;Problems? None that I&#x27;ve found so far. If you liked the old &quot;Chill&quot;, I suspect you&#x27;re going to like the new one even better.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Chill&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #23 (Oct./Nov., 1990), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Chill&quot; is a good, solid horror game, but the terror is not quite real enough.&quot;

In the October 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 186), Rick Swan reviewed three supplements that had been published by Mayfair Games: &quot;Apparitions Sourcebook&quot;, &quot;Lycanthropes Sourcebook&quot;, and &quot;Vampires Sourcebook&quot;. Overall, Swan thought the material was not very original: &quot;The designers have hardly let their imaginations run wild; the approach draws primarily from legends and movies, meeting the expectations of conservative horror buffs but rarely exceeding them. Dracula and the Wolfman are welcome; vampiric Martians and lycanthropic cattle need not apply.&quot; However, Swan found the books &quot;consistently entertaining and filled with interesting material that is intelligently presented.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Players and referees alike should get a kick out these engaging books... I would’ve liked stronger scenarios and a few more adventure hooks, but all in all, the fastidious research, evocative writing, and enthusiasm for the material makes for a winning combination. I’m looking forward to future volumes.&quot;

Christian Lindke compared the First and Second Editions in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, saying &quot;There are many games from the 80s that — mechanically and tonally — seem extremely dated by modern gaming standards. &quot;Chill&quot; — the first Pacesetter edition — isn&#x27;t one of them. It has a kind of classic feel to it, just like all the Hammer and AIP movies it was inspired by. It isn&#x27;t a dark and serious horror game, but it is an adventurous one. If you wanted to pretend to be Peter Cushing&#x27;s Van Helsing hunting Christopher Lee&#x27;s Dracula, there was no better game than &quot;Chill&quot; during the early Pacesetter era. The later Mayfair game never captured the charm of the original and for a time it looked like fans of non-Lovecraftian horror were going to be left without a high quality horror RPG.&quot;

===Other reviews of the Second Edition===

==Third edition==
In 2012, Mayfair Games sold &quot;Chill&quot;″s intellectual property rights to Martin Caron and Renée Dion. Two years later, Growling Door Games announced they had entered into a licensing agreement with Caron and Dion to publish &quot;Chill&quot;. The following year, Growling Door Games published the third edition of the game. They subsequently published three sourcebooks and several scenarios from 2016 until Growling Door ceased operations in 2019.

Games also translated the &quot;Chill Master&#x27;s Screen&quot;, &quot;SAVE: The Eternal Society&quot; and &quot;Monsters&quot; into French. The third edition rulebook and supplements remain for sale directly from Martin Caron.

In 2019, Salt Circle Games signed an agreement with Caron and Dion to release new material for third edition to be sold via the crowd-sourcing website Patreon. In 2020, Salt Circle Games began closed playtesting of an unannounced Fourth Edition of &quot;Chill&quot; and published a supplement for the third edition titled &quot;Horrors of the Unknown: Volume 1&quot;. Salt Circle Games made new third edition character sheets available in 2021 and announced an upcoming setting supplement, &quot;Unknown Atlanta&quot;, with no expected publication date.

<doc id="433083" wikidata="Q748106" url="?curid=433083" title="Glasgow School of Art">
<text>The Glasgow School of Art (GSA; ) is a higher education art school based in Glasgow, Scotland, offering undergraduate degrees, post-graduate awards (both taught and research-led), and PhDs in architecture, fine art, and design.

The school is housed in a number of buildings around Renfrew Street in the centre of Glasgow, upon Garnethill, an area first developed by William Harley of Blythswood Hill in the early 1800s. The most famous of its buildings was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in phases between 1896 and 1909. The eponymous Mackintosh Building soon became one of the city&#x27;s iconic landmarks, of international fame. It is a pioneer of the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style). The building was severely damaged by fire in May 2014 and destroyed by a second fire in June 2018, with only the burnt-out shell remaining. Plans are in place for its rebuilding in accordance with Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#x27;s style and content.

==History==

Founded in 1845 as the Glasgow Government School of Design, the school changed its name to the Glasgow School of Art in 1853. Originally located at 12 Ingram Street the school moved to the McLellan Galleries in Sauchiehall Street in 1869.

In 1897, work began on a new building nearby to house the school on Renfrew Street, funded by a donation of £10,000 from the Bellahouston Trust, left from the will of Moses Stevens of Bellahouston. The building was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, chosen for the commission by the school&#x27;s director, Francis Newbery, who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909.

The School&#x27;s campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based Steven Holl Architects working with Glasgow-based JM Architects. The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the Mackintosh Building. It is a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.

The school has produced most of Scotland&#x27;s leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of Turner Prize nominees and five recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009, Martin Boyce in 2011, Duncan Campbell in 2014, and Charlotte Prodger in 2018.

The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession and the School of Design has been described by Design Week as &quot;leaders in design education&quot;.

The School is organised into four academic schools:

* The Mackintosh School of Architecture 
* The School of Design
* The School of Fine Art
* The School of Innovation and Technology 

GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA &quot;Open Studio&quot;.

Disciplines within the four schools include fine-art photography, painting and printmaking, sculpture and environmental art, product design, product-design engineering, textile design, fashion design, silversmithing and jewellery design, interior design, communication design, interaction design, and architecture.

==Governance==

Governance of the Glasgow School of Art is the responsibility of its Board of Governors. The Board of Governors has ultimate responsibility for all the affairs of the School. GSA has four standard Board Meetings in its academic year, held in September, November, March and June.

==Fires and Restoration==
===2014 fire===

The original Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on 23 May 2014. An initial fire service estimate was that 90 per cent of the building and 70 per cent of its contents had been saved. The fire, which began in the basement, quickly spread upwards and, although it was brought under control quite quickly, significant damage was done to the historic studios and stairways. The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no casualties.

The fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:40 pm. Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but &quot;a canister of expanding foam&quot; used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite. According to &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: &quot;the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building&quot; as well as &quot;a vertical service void&quot;, which &quot;ran the entire height of the building … [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel&quot;. Fire and smoke dampers, which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been retrofitted. In addition, an intended fire suppression system for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames.

====Restoration====
A careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016. The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as longleaf pine and tulipwood.

===2018 fire===
A large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. The fire also caused severe damage to the nearby O2 ABC music venue. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19 pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire. No casualties were reported. the cause of the fire was not known.

Alan Dunlop, visiting professor of architecture at Robert Gordon University who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: &quot;I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself. It looks totally destroyed.&quot; This point of view was not supported by the early external building surveys, which appeared to indicate that much of the exterior had survived, though extensively damaged. Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation. A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: &quot;There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES (Historic Environment Scotland) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable.&quot; It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that &quot;It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire.&quot;

The first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. Muriel Gray, chair of the Board of Governors, stated: &quot;This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh’s masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration.&quot; In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that &quot;This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form.&quot; He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum.

On 28 June 2018 it was announced that work was being planned to take down parts of the building that were in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses was to be made available by the Scottish Government.

The same day, Glasgow School of Art terminated its £25 million restoration contract with Kier Group following the fire.

At the time of the fire, sprinklers had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing.

In August 2020, Glasgow School of Art took legal action against Page\Park Architects, the Glasgow-based architectural practice responsible for the Mackintosh Building restoration work.

Between August 2018 and July 2020 over £12 million had been spent on Mackintosh Building debris clearance and stabilisation work.

In November 2020, Glasgow School of Art announced that work to clear debris from the Mackintosh Building would not be completed until 2021 and that work to repair fire damaged glazing and cladding on the Reid Building would not be completed until 2022.

In March 2021, the Board of Glasgow School of Art announced that a Project Development Board had been established for the restoration of the Mackintosh Building. This is chaired by the Director of the Art School who has assumed the role of project sponsor, is leading the works and is directly responsible for delivery. A Strategic Outline Business Case for the restoration was due to be drafted by late spring 2021 and completed by summer 2021. This would determine the programme to complete the works.

On 25 January 2022, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service published the results of their three-and-a-half-year investigation in to the cause of the fire. No cause could be determined.

===Future===

Following a &quot;faithful reinstatement&quot;, the Mackintosh building is due to fully reopen as a graduate school in 2030.

==Scottish Campuses==
===Glasgow Campus===

The school has a large footprint across Glasgow. From the date of the first fire of May 2014, until September 2019 the School of Fine Art was temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, Merchant City, Glasgow. The School of Design, The Innovation School and The Mackintosh School of Architecture, along with the GSA Library are all located in and around the Garnethill area, where the Mackintosh Building sits.

The Stow Building, bought from Kelvin College (hence retaining the name, Stow) - has been refurbished and fitted out. Stow opened to the general public for the first time for the 2019 degree show, and opened as a functioning academic building, housing all of the Fine Art courses, in September 2019.

The School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio (DDS)) is based on the southside of Glasgow in The Hub, at Pacific Quay by the River Clyde.

The Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the Fine Art Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour. An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year&#x27;s final artworks. while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.

An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase. The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects, working in partnership with Glasgow&#x27;s JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013.
The new building was named the Reid Building after the Director who was in post at the time of the commissioning: Dame Seona Reid, and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architects&#x27; Journal awards – the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the IStructE&#x27;s 2014 Structural Awards. It was awarded the Sir Hugh Casson Award in 2014 for the worst new building of the year, being described as a &quot;crude and insufferably arrogant essay in minimalist neo-modernism&quot;.

===Forres - Altyre Estate Campus===
The Innovation School also has a base in Forres, Morayshire, focusing on research-led teaching at post-graduate level.

==Singapore Campus==
From September 2012 until June 2021, the GSA delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), based at the Temasek Polytechnic Campus in Tampines. In 2019, it was mutually agreed to end the partnership one year early; the final cohort of Glasgow School of Art Singapore students graduated in June 2021.

The programmes enabled Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to articulate from a Singapore Diploma to a GSA BA(Hons) degree.

Students who studied in Singapore benefited from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications.

==Students==
The GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in &quot;The Guardian&quot; University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK. Its degrees are validated by the University of Glasgow. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate. The GSA is placed 8th in the 2019 QS World Rankings for Art and Design and 2nd in the nationally ranking 2016 Complete University Guide league table for Art and Design. HESA statistics show the GSA to have one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the UK.

In May 2020 Glasgow School of Art undergraduate students wrote to the Scottish Government and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) to raise concerns about academic provision at Glasgow School of Art. That August, this was followed up by a group of Post-graduate students. The QAA investigated the situation and published a report in February 2021 making a series of recommendations to Glasgow School of Art and the University of Glasgow who award degrees at the Art School.

Despite high positions in the QS rankings, the quality of Glasgow School of Art&#x27;s academic provision was criticised in a 2021 Enhancement Led Institutional Review. In April 2021 the UK&#x27;s Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) wrote:

Subsequently in August 2022 the QAA published a re-review of the school in which they stated that &quot;the School has effective arrangements for managing academic standards, and the student learning experience&quot;, commending the school for improving in a number of areas and making recommendations for further improvements.

In March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second-highest in Scotland, according to CoWA&#x27;s report, with only University of the West of Scotland having more. The most recent Scottish Funding Council report on widening participation highlighted the GSA continued to perform well in widening participation.

==Students&#x27; Association==

The Glasgow School of Art Students&#x27; Association (GSASA) was formed in 1908 and was officially recognised by the GSA in 1948. The Association is a charitable non-profit organisation and is funded in part by GSA; it is not part of the National Union of Students.

At the start of each academic year, all students have the option of joining the Students&#x27; Association during enrolment. There are two full-time sabbatical officers, the Student President and the Events Convenor, and the Association has a students&#x27; representative council.

The Students&#x27; Association building was constructed in 1927, originally known as the Assembly Building, it later was renamed The Art School despite the obvious confusion this would cause. The whole building was handed over by the GSA to the Association in the late 20th century. The Art School contained a bar and a club and over the decades established itself as a well-renowned venue in the local music scene. In November 2019, the venue was permanently closed by the Association over financial difficulties which resulted in the redundancy of 30 staff.

== Glasgow School of Art Choir ==
The GSA Choir is a non-auditioned amateur musical ensemble, established in 2012. The choir has over 140 singers of all ages and from varied backgrounds.

As a registered charity its aims are to celebrate and encourage greater participation in choral music, and to reach new audiences. Additionally, the choir is dedicated to commissioning and performing new choral works. As well as a recording to raise money for the restoration after the Mackintosh Building fire, the choir&#x27;s recording of a piece commissioned from Sir James MacMillan, &#x27;The Present&#x27; (a setting of words by former Director of the GSA Francis Henry Newbery), was played on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Breakfast in September 2022.

In 2019, the GSA Choir gained funding from Creative Scotland for the &quot;Composeher&quot; project, which aims to address the under-representation of female composers evident across the music industry. Seven leading female composers from Scotland, England, Australia and the USA were commissioned to create a set of new choral works. The world premiere performance of these works took place on 27 May 2023 in City Halls, Glasgow. The Composeher album was released on 19 July 2024.

==Research==
The Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Economic and Social Research Council, although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past.

At the Research Assessment Exercise in 2014, the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation, Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab
In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework exercise 82% of the GSA&#x27;s research was assessed to be internationally excellent. 75% of the GSA’s research outputs were ranked at the two top grades 4* (world-leading in originality, significance and rigour), and 3* (or internationally excellent) with the GSA being one of the leading practice-based research institutions in the UK.

==Notable alumni==

Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art are notable in painters, writers, film directors, photographers, designers, and architects.

<doc id="433085" wikidata="Q2615451" url="?curid=433085" title="Atmospheric circulation">
<text>Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air and together with ocean circulation is the means by which thermal energy is redistributed on the surface of the Earth. The Earth&#x27;s atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant. The smaller-scale weather systems – mid-latitude depressions, or tropical convective cells – occur chaotically, and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, or a month in theory (see chaos theory and the butterfly effect).

The Earth&#x27;s weather is a consequence of its illumination by the Sun and the laws of thermodynamics. The atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun&#x27;s energy and whose energy sink, ultimately, is the blackness of space. The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air, and in that process it redistributes the energy absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s surface near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and thence to space.

The large-scale atmospheric circulation &quot;cells&quot; shift polewards in warmer periods (for example, interglacials compared to glacials), but remain largely constant as they are, fundamentally, a property of the Earth&#x27;s size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little. Over very long time periods (hundreds of millions of years), a tectonic uplift can significantly alter their major elements, such as the jet stream, and plate tectonics may shift ocean currents. During the extremely hot climates of the Mesozoic, a third desert belt may have existed at the Equator.

==Latitudinal circulation features==
The wind belts girdling the planet are organised into three cells in each hemisphere—the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, and the polar cell. Those cells exist in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The vast bulk of the atmospheric motion occurs in the Hadley cell. The high pressure systems acting on the Earth&#x27;s surface are balanced by the low pressure systems elsewhere. As a result, there is a balance of forces acting on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The horse latitudes are an area of high pressure at about 30° to 35° latitude (north or south) where winds diverge into the adjacent zones of Hadley or Ferrel cells, and which typically have light winds, sunny skies, and little precipitation.

=== Hadley cell ===
The atmospheric circulation pattern that George Hadley described was an attempt to explain the trade winds. The Hadley cell is a closed circulation loop which begins at the equator. There, moist air is warmed by the Earth&#x27;s surface, decreases in density and rises. A similar air mass rising on the other side of the equator forces those rising air masses to move poleward. The rising air creates a low pressure zone near the equator. As the air moves poleward, it cools, becomes denser, and descends at about the 30th parallel, creating a high-pressure area. The descended air then travels toward the equator along the surface, replacing the air that rose from the equatorial zone, closing the loop of the Hadley cell. The poleward movement of the air in the upper part of the troposphere deviates toward the east, caused by the coriolis acceleration. At the ground level, however, the movement of the air toward the equator in the lower troposphere deviates toward the west, producing a wind from the east. The winds that flow to the west (from the east, easterly wind) at the ground level in the Hadley cell are called the trade winds.

Though the Hadley cell is described as located at the equator, it shifts northerly (to higher latitudes) in June and July and southerly (toward lower latitudes) in December and January, as a result of the Sun&#x27;s heating of the surface. The zone where the greatest heating takes place is called the &quot;thermal equator&quot;. As the southern hemisphere&#x27;s summer is in December to March, the movement of the thermal equator to higher southern latitudes takes place then.

The Hadley system provides an example of a thermally direct circulation. The power of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, is estimated at 200 terawatts.

=== Ferrel cell ===
Part of the air rising at 60° latitude diverges at high altitude toward the poles and creates the polar cell. The rest moves toward the equator where it collides at 30° latitude with the high-level air of the Hadley cell. There it subsides and strengthens the high pressure ridges beneath. A large part of the energy that drives the Ferrel cell is provided by the polar and Hadley cells circulating on either side, which drag the air of the Ferrel cell with it. 
The Ferrel cell, theorized by William Ferrel (1817–1891), is, therefore, a secondary circulation feature, whose existence depends upon the Hadley and polar cells on either side of it. It might be thought of as an eddy created by the Hadley and polar cells.

The air of the Ferrel cell that descends at 30° latitude returns poleward at the ground level, and as it does so it deviates toward the east. In the upper atmosphere of the Ferrel cell, the air moving toward the equator deviates toward the west. Both of those deviations, as in the case of the Hadley and polar cells, are driven by conservation of angular momentum. As a result, just as the easterly Trade Winds are found below the Hadley cell, the Westerlies are found beneath the Ferrel cell.

The Ferrel cell is weak, because it has neither a strong source of heat nor a strong sink, so the airflow and temperatures within it are variable. For this reason, the mid-latitudes are sometimes known as the &quot;zone of mixing.&quot; The Hadley and polar cells are truly closed loops, the Ferrel cell is not, and the telling point is in the Westerlies, which are more formally known as &quot;the Prevailing Westerlies.&quot; The easterly Trade Winds and the polar easterlies have nothing over which to prevail, as their parent circulation cells are strong enough and face few obstacles either in the form of massive terrain features or high pressure zones. The weaker Westerlies of the Ferrel cell, however, can be disrupted. The local passage of a cold front may change that in a matter of minutes, and frequently does. As a result, at the surface, winds can vary abruptly in direction. But the winds above the surface, where they are less disrupted by terrain, are essentially westerly. A low pressure zone at 60° latitude that moves toward the equator, or a high pressure zone at 30° latitude that moves poleward, will accelerate the Westerlies of the Ferrel cell. A strong high, moving polewards may bring westerly winds for days.

The Ferrel system acts as a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of 12.1, consuming kinetic energy from the Hadley and polar systems at an approximate rate of 275 terawatts.

=== Polar cell ===

The polar cell is a simple system with strong convection drivers. Though cool and dry relative to equatorial air, the air masses at the 60th parallel are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo convection and drive a thermal loop. At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8 km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper-level air mass deviates toward the east. When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled by radiation to space and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven away from the pole toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates westwards, again as a result of the Coriolis effect. The air flows at the surface are called the polar easterlies, flowing from northeast to southwest near the north pole and from southeast to northwest near the south pole.

The outflow of air mass from the cell creates harmonic waves in the atmosphere known as Rossby waves. These ultra-long waves determine the path of the polar jet stream, which travels within the transitional zone between the tropopause and the Ferrel cell. By acting as a heat sink, the polar cell moves the abundant heat from the equator toward the polar regions.

The polar cell, terrain, and katabatic winds in Antarctica can create very cold conditions at the surface, for instance the lowest temperature recorded on Earth: −89.2 °C at Vostok Station in Antarctica, measured in 1983.

===Contrast between cells===
The Hadley cell and the polar cell are similar in that they are thermally direct; in other words, they exist as a direct consequence of surface temperatures. Their thermal characteristics drive the weather in their domain. The sheer volume of energy that the Hadley cell transports, and the depth of the heat sink contained within the polar cell, ensures that transient weather phenomena not only have negligible effect on the systems as a whole, but — except under unusual circumstances — they do not form. The endless chain of passing highs and lows which is part of everyday life for mid-latitude dwellers, under the Ferrel cell at latitudes between 30 and 60° latitude, is unknown above the 60th and below the 30th parallels. There are some notable exceptions to this rule; over Europe, unstable weather extends to at least the 70th parallel north.

== Longitudinal circulation features==
While the Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells (whose axes are oriented along parallels or latitudes) are the major features of global heat transport, they do not act alone. Temperature differences also drive a set of circulation cells, whose axes of circulation are longitudinally oriented. This atmospheric motion is known as zonal overturning circulation.

Latitudinal circulation is a result of the highest solar radiation per unit area (solar intensity) falling on the tropics. The solar intensity decreases as the latitude increases, reaching essentially zero at the poles. Longitudinal circulation, however, is a result of the heat capacity of water, its absorptivity, and its mixing. Water absorbs more heat than does the land, but its temperature does not rise as greatly as does the land. As a result, temperature variations on land are greater than on water.

The Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells operate at the largest scale of thousands of kilometers (synoptic scale). The latitudinal circulation can also act on this scale of oceans and continents, and this effect is seasonal or even decadal. Warm air rises over the equatorial, continental, and western Pacific Ocean regions. When it reaches the tropopause, it cools and subsides in a region of relatively cooler water mass.

The Pacific Ocean cell plays a particularly important role in Earth&#x27;s weather. This entirely ocean-based cell comes about as the result of a marked difference in the surface temperatures of the western and eastern Pacific. Under ordinary circumstances, the western Pacific waters are warm, and the eastern waters are cool. The process begins when strong convective activity over equatorial East Asia and subsiding cool air off South America&#x27;s west coast create a wind pattern which pushes Pacific water westward and piles it up in the western Pacific. (Water levels in the western Pacific are about 60 cm higher than in the eastern Pacific.).

The daily (diurnal) longitudinal effects are at the mesoscale (a horizontal range of 5 to several hundred kilometres). During the day, air warmed by the relatively hotter land rises, and as it does so it draws a cool breeze from the sea that replaces the risen air. At night, the relatively warmer water and cooler land reverses the process, and a breeze from the land, of air cooled by the land, is carried offshore by night.

=== Walker circulation ===

The Pacific cell is of such importance that it has been named the Walker circulation after Sir Gilbert Walker, an early-20th-century director of British observatories in India, who sought a means of predicting when the monsoon winds of India would fail. While he was never successful in doing so, his work led him to the discovery of a link between the periodic pressure variations in the Indian Ocean, and those between the eastern and western Pacific, which he termed the &quot;Southern Oscillation&quot;.

The movement of air in the Walker circulation affects the loops on either side. Under normal circumstances, the weather behaves as expected. But every few years, the winters become unusually warm or unusually cold, or the frequency of hurricanes increases or decreases, and the pattern sets in for an indeterminate period.

The Walker Cell plays a key role in this and in the El Niño phenomenon. If convective activity slows in the Western Pacific for some reason (this reason is not currently known), the climates of areas adjacent to the Western Pacific are affected. First, the upper-level westerly winds fail. This cuts off the source of returning, cool air that would normally subside at about 30° south latitude, and therefore the air returning as surface easterlies ceases. There are two consequences. Warm water ceases to surge into the eastern Pacific from the west (it was &quot;piled&quot; by past easterly winds) since there is no longer a surface wind to push it into the area of the east Pacific. This and the corresponding effects of the Southern Oscillation result in long-term unseasonable temperatures and precipitation patterns in North and South America, Australia, and Southeast Africa, and the disruption of ocean currents.

Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, fast-blowing upper level Westerlies of the Hadley cell form, which would ordinarily be blocked by the Walker circulation and unable to reach such intensities. These winds disrupt the tops of nascent hurricanes and greatly diminish the number which are able to reach full strength.

==== El Niño – Southern Oscillation ====
&quot;El Niño&quot; and &quot;La Niña&quot; are opposite surface temperature anomalies of the Southern Pacific, which heavily influence the weather on a large scale. In the case of El Niño, warm surface water approaches the coasts of South America which results in blocking the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water. This has serious impacts on the fish populations.

In the La Niña case, the convective cell over the western Pacific strengthens inordinately, resulting in colder than normal winters in North America and a more robust cyclone season in South-East Asia and Eastern Australia. There is also an increased upwelling of deep cold ocean waters and more intense uprising of surface air near South America, resulting in increasing numbers of drought occurrences, although fishermen reap benefits from the more nutrient-filled eastern Pacific waters.

<text>Historical dance (or early dance) is a term covering a wide variety of Western European-based dance types from the past as they are danced in the present. Today historical dances are danced as performance, for pleasure at themed balls or dance clubs, as historical reenactment, or for musicological or historical research.

Dances from the early 20th century can be recreated precisely, being within living memory and after the advent of film and video recording. Earlier dance types, however, must be reconstructed from less reliable evidence such as surviving notations and instruction manuals.

For performance dancing, see History of dance.

==Categories==

===Medieval dance===

Very little evidence survives about medieval dance except what can be gleaned from paintings and works of literature from this time period. Some names of the dances which we know existed during the Middle Ages include Carole, Ductia, Estampie (Istampitta), Saltarello, and the Trotto. The farandole is also frequently presented as a medieval dance, based on surviving iconography.

===Renaissance dance===

The earliest surviving dance manuals come from the Renaissance period, including examples by Italian dance master and composer Fabritio Caroso and French cleric Thoinot Arbeau. Thus we are able to reconstruct the dances with a greater degree of certainty. The large number of dances with Spanish origin reflect the cultural influence of the dominating power of the age.

Dance types:
* Allemande (Almain)
* Basse danse (Bassadance)
* Branle (Bransle)
* Canario
* Coranto
* Dompe
* Galliard
* La volta, variation on the Galliard
* Pavane
* Sarabande
* Spagnoletta
* Tourdion, a fast Galliard

===Baroque dance===

It was during the baroque era that Londoner John Playford published &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;, which, along with similar publications, provides us with a large repertoire of baroque English country dances.

Apart from country dances, the most well-documented baroque dance style was that which was developed at the French court during the 17th century. The term &quot;baroque dance&quot; is often used to refer specifically to this style, reflecting the dominating power of the era.

Dance types include:
* Bourrée
* Canary
* Chaconne
* (French) Courante
* Entrée grave
* Forlana
* Gavotte
* Gigue
* Loure
* Menuet (minuet)
* Musette
* Passacaille (passacaglia)
* Passepied
* Rigaudon
* Sarabande
* Tambourin
The French style was also danced in England where they introduced their own dance type:
* Hornpipe

=== Dance during the English Regency ===

An era of uncertainty in England, with the Napoleonic Wars, periodic riots, and the French Revolution across the Channel. Clothing tended to be light and unrestrictive, encouraging dances with lots of skipping and jumping, such as the English Country Dance, Polonaise, Quadrille, and Scotch Reel.

=== Dance in the mid-19th century ===

Starting with the great international polka craze of 1844 anyone who was anyone was dancing. Women were in hoop skirts, and turning dances helped to keep them out of the way. Dances popular during this period included the polka, schottische, two-step, and the waltz.

=== Dance in the late 19th century to about 1910 ===
The dances popular in mid-century were still being done at the end of the century, but by fewer people. Dance masters, in vain attempts to maintain their place in society and in the economy, invented dances of greater and greater complexity that people followed with less and less enthusiasm. During this period, the bustle replaced the hoop, which necessitated a few changes in dancing. At the same time, ragtime music began to gain mainstream respectability. Some examples of dances popular during this period include the cakewalk, Krakowiak, mazurka, racket, redowa, and the waltz.

=== Dance in the Ragtime era ===
Vernon and Irene Castle brought an air of respectability to couples dancing, and sparked what was arguably the largest U.S. dance craze ever. But by the end of World War I, these were considered old fashioned, and included the foxtrot, maxixe, one-step, tango, and waltz.

=== Dance in the 1920s ===
During the roaring twenties, for the first time, there was a class of children who did not have to work to help support the family. This was an era of highly energetic dances done by the younger generation, represented by the Black Bottom, Charleston, foxtrot, shag, and waltz.

=== Dance in the 1930s and 1940s ===
In the peak of the Swing era, more exotic dance styles became ever more popular among younger generations in America. Dances popular during this period were the Big Apple (dance), foxtrot, swing, waltz, tap, and the jitterbug.

<text>Sabine Bergmann-Pohl (née Schulz; ; born 20 April 1946) is a German doctor and politician. A member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), she was president of the People&#x27;s Chamber of East Germany from April to October 1990. During this time, she was also the interim head of state of East Germany, holding both posts until the state&#x27;s merger into West Germany in October. She was the youngest, only female and the last head of state of East Germany. After the reunification of Germany, she served in the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, first as Minister for Special Affairs, one of five appointed in 1991 to provide representation for the last East German government in the Kohl cabinet, then as Parliamentary State Secretary in the Ministry of Health for the remainder of Chancellor Kohl&#x27;s time in office.

== Early life and education ==

She was born Sabine Schulz in Eisenach, Thuringia. After leaving school in 1964, Bergmann-Pohl was initially not admitted to university and entered a two-year internship at the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Humboldt University in East Berlin. In 1966, she began to study medicine and graduated in 1972 with a diploma in medicine. From 1979, she worked as a lung specialist and in 1980, earned a medical doctorate.

From 1980 to 1985, she was medical director of the polyclinic department for lung diseases and tuberculosis in Berlin-Friedrichshain. From 1985 to 1990, she was medical director at the District Office for lung diseases and tuberculosis in East Berlin.

In 1990, Bergmann-Pohl was made Patron of the General Disabled Persons in Germany (ABID eV). In 2003, she became President of the Berlin Red Cross and a member of the Presidium of the International Federation, where she has served as vice president since 2007.

==Political career==

In 1981, she joined the East German CDU, one of the bloc parties of the GDR, and in 1987 was elected to the district board in East Berlin.

In the general election of March 1990, the only free and fair election ever held in East Germany, she was elected to the People&#x27;s Chamber, which on 5 April elected her its president. On the same day, parliament also abolished the State Council, the country&#x27;s collective presidency. Under the Constitution, the president of the People&#x27;s Chamber was ex officio vice president of the GDR; as such, Bergmann-Pohl assumed the role of interim head of state as well. In that role, she presided over the People&#x27;s Chamber formally petitioning to join the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 August, as well as the overwhelming approval of the unification treaty on 12 September.

After German reunification on 3 October 1990, she became a member of the Bundestag and, along with other leading members of the last East German government, was also appointed Federal Minister for Special Affairs in Chancellor Helmut Kohl&#x27;s cabinet.

After the 1990 all-German election, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Health on 18 January 1991. Following her party&#x27;s defeat in the 1998 election, she departed from the government on 27 October 1998 but remained in the Bundestag until 2002.

==Personal life==

Sabine Bergmann-Pohl was married to Ulrich Pohl from 1972 to 1979. They had two children. Since 1990 she is married to Jürgen Bergmann. She is a Protestant.

<text>Morrison Remick &quot;Mott&quot; Waite (November 29, 1816 – March 23, 1888) was an American attorney, jurist, and politician from Ohio who served as the seventh chief justice of the United States from 1874 until his death in 1888. During his tenure, the Waite Court took a narrow interpretation of federal authority related to laws and amendments that were enacted during the Reconstruction Era to expand the rights of freedmen and protect them from attacks by white supremacy groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.

Born in Lyme, Connecticut, Waite established a legal practice in Toledo, Ohio, after graduating from Yale University. As a member of the Whig Party, Waite won election to the Ohio House of Representatives. An opponent of slavery, he helped establish the Ohio Republican Party. He served as a counsel in the Alabama Claims and presided over the 1873 Ohio constitutional convention.

After the May 1873 death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, President Ulysses S. Grant underwent a prolonged search for Chase&#x27;s successor. With the backing of Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, Grant nominated Waite in January 1874. The nomination of the relatively obscure Waite was poorly received by some prominent politicians, but the Senate unanimously confirmed Waite and he took office in March 1874. Despite some support for his nomination, he declined to run for president in the 1876 election, arguing that the Supreme Court should not serve as a mere stepping stone to higher office. He served on the court until his death of pneumonia in 1888.

Waite did not emerge as an important intellectual force on the Supreme Court, but he was well regarded as an administrator and conciliator. He sought a balance between federal and state power and joined with most other Justices in narrowly interpreting the Reconstruction Amendments. His majority opinion in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; upheld government regulation of grain elevators and railroads and influenced constitutional understandings of government regulation. He also helped establish the legal concept of corporate personhood in the United States. However in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; he sided with a majority to strike down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had prohibited discrimination in access to public services, that was not restored until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

==Early life and education==
Morrison Remick Waite was born on November 29, 1816, at Lyme, Connecticut, the son of Henry Matson Waite, an attorney, and his wife Maria Selden. His father later was appointed as a judge of the Superior Court and associate judge of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, serving 1834–1854; and appointed as chief justice of the latter from 1854 to 1857. Morrison had a brother Richard, with whom he later practiced law. His ancestors hailed from England and were New Englanders.

Waite attended Bacon Academy in Colchester, Connecticut, where one of his classmates was Lyman Trumbull. He graduated from Yale College in 1837, the same class that included Samuel J. Tilden, the 1876 Democratic presidential nominee. As a student at Yale, Waite became a member of the Skull and Bones and Brothers in Unity societies, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa society in 1837. Shortly after graduating, Waite became a law clerk for his father in 1837.

Soon afterward Waite moved to Maumee, Ohio, where he read law in the office of Samuel L. Young. He was admitted to the bar in 1839, and went into practice with Young. The law firm became prominent in business and property law. Waite was elected mayor of Maumee, and served from 1846 to 1847.

==Marriage and family==
He married Amelia Champlin Warner on September 21, 1840 in Hartford, Connecticut. They had three sons together: Henry Seldon, Christopher Champlin, and Edward Tinker; and a daughter Mary Frances Waite.

==Political and legal career==
In 1850, Waite and his family moved to Toledo, Ohio, where he set up a branch office of his law firm with Young. Waite soon came to be recognized as a leader of the state bar. When Young retired in 1856, Waite built a prosperous new firm with his brother Richard Waite. One of his partners in Toledo was George P. Estey, a man from New Hampshire who served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War.

An active member of the Whig Party, Waite was elected to a term in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1849–1850. He made two unsuccessful bids for the United States Senate, and was offered (but declined) a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court. In the mid-1850s, because of his opposition to slavery, Waite joined the fledgling Republican Party and helped to organize it in his home state. By 1870, he was known as one of the best lawyers in Ohio.

In 1871, Waite received an invitation to represent the United States (along with William M. Evarts and Caleb Cushing) as counsel before the Alabama Tribunal at Geneva. In his first national role, he gained acclaim when he won a $15 million award from the tribunal. In 1872, he was unanimously selected to preside over the 1873 Ohio constitutional convention.

==Chief Justice of the United States, 1874–1888==
===Nomination===

President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Waite as Chief Justice on January 19, 1874, after a political circus related to the appointment. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in May 1873, and Grant waited six months before first offering the seat in November to the powerful Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, who declined.

After ruling out a promotion of a sitting Associate Justice to Chief (despite much lobbying from the legal community for Justice Samuel Freeman Miller), Grant was determined to appoint an outsider as Chief Justice and offered the Chief Justiceship to senators Oliver Morton of Indiana and Timothy Howe of Wisconsin, then to his Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish. He finally submitted his nomination of Attorney General George H. Williams to the Senate on December 1. A month later, however, Grant withdrew the nomination, at Williams&#x27; request, after charges of corruption made his confirmation all but certain to fail. One day after withdrawing Williams, Grant nominated Democrat and former Attorney General Caleb Cushing, but withdrew it after Republican Senators alleged Civil War-era connections between Cushing and the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Finally, after persistent lobbying from Ohioans, including Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, on January 19, 1874, Grant nominated the little-known Waite. He was notified of his nomination by a telegram.

The nomination was not well received in political circles. The former Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, remarked of Waite that, &quot;It is a wonder that Grant did not pick up some old acquaintance, who was a stage driver or bartender, for the place,&quot; and the political journal &quot;The Nation,&quot; said &quot;Mr Waite stands in the front-rank of second-rank lawyers.&quot; Nationwide sentiment, however, was relief that a non-divisive and competent choice had been made, and Waite was confirmed unanimously as Chief Justice on January 21, 1874, receiving his commission the same day. Waite took the oaths of office on March 4, 1874.

===Tenure===

As Chief Justice, Waite never became a significant intellectual force on the Supreme Court. But his managerial and social skill, &quot;especially his good humor and sensitivity to others, helped him to maintain a remarkably harmonious and productive court.&quot; During Waite&#x27;s tenure, the Court decided some 3,470 cases. In part, the large number of cases decided and the variety of issues confronted reflected the lack of discretion the Court had at the time in hearing appeals from lower federal and state courts. However, Waite demonstrated an ability to get his brethren to reach decisions and write opinions without delay. His own work habits and output were formidable: he drafted one-third of these opinions.

In matters of regulation over economic activity, he supported broad national authority, stating his opinion that federal commerce powers must &quot;keep pace with the progress of the country.&quot; In the same vein, a primary theme in his opinions was the balance of federal and state authority. These opinions influenced Supreme Court jurisprudence well into the 20th century.

In the cases that grew out of the American Civil War and Reconstruction, and especially in those that involved the interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments, i.e. the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, Waite sympathized with the court&#x27;s general tendency to interpret these amendments narrowly. In &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot;, the court struck down the Enforcement Act, ruling that the states had to be relied on to protect citizens from attack by other private citizens.

The very highest duty of the States, when they entered into the Union under the Constitution, was to protect all persons within their boundaries in the enjoyment of these &#x27;unalienable rights with which they were endowed by their Creator.&#x27; Sovereignty, for this purpose, rests alone with the States. It is no more the duty or within the power of the United States to punish for a conspiracy to falsely imprison or murder within a State, than it would be to punish for false imprisonment or murder itself.

He concluded that &quot;We may suspect that race was the cause of the hostility but is it not so averred.&quot;

Thus, the court overturned the convictions of three men accused of massacring at least 105 blacks in the Colfax massacre at the Grant Parish, Louisiana, courthouse on Easter 1873. Their convictions under the Enforcement Act were thrown out not because the statutes were unconstitutional, but because the indictments under which the men were charged were infirm because they failed to allege specifically that the murders were committed on account of the victims&#x27; race.

Waite believed that white moderates should set the rules of racial relations in the South. But, in reality, those states were not prepared to protect African Americans. They did not prosecute most lynchings or paramilitary attacks against blacks. The majority of the Court and the people outside the South were tired of the bitter racial strife related to Reconstruction. In the 1870s, white Democrats regained power in southern legislatures; they passed Jim Crow laws suppressing blacks as second-class citizens. After years of elections surrounded by fraud and violence to suppress black voting, from 1890 to 1908 (after Waite&#x27;s death) all the Democrat-dominated southern state legislatures passed new constitutions or amendments that disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites in the South. Well into the 1960s, these laws excluded those groups from the political system.

Waite&#x27;s social and political orientation was also apparent in the Court&#x27;s response to claims by other groups. In &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; (1875), using the restricted definition of national citizenship and the 14th Amendment as set forth in the Slaughterhouse Cases (1873), Waite upheld the states&#x27; right to deny women the franchise. Nonetheless, Waite sympathized with the women&#x27;s rights movement and supported the admission of women to the Supreme Court bar.

In his opinion in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; (1877), one of six cases involving Populist-inspired state legislation to fix maximum rates chargeable by grain elevators and railroads, Waite wrote that when a business or private property was &quot;affected with a public interest&quot;, it was subject to governmental regulation. Thus, the Court ruled against charges that Granger laws encroached upon private property rights without due process of law and conflicted with the Fourteenth Amendment. Later, this opinion was often regarded as a milestone in the growth of federal government regulation. In particular, New Dealers in the Franklin Roosevelt administration looked to &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; for guidance in interpreting due process, as well as the Commerce and Contract Clauses.

Waite concurred with the majority in the Head Money Cases (1884), the Ku-Klux Case (&quot;United States v. Harris&quot;, 1883), the Civil Rights Cases (1883), &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot; (1883), and the Legal Tender Cases (including &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot;) (1883). Among the most important opinions he personally wrote were the Enforcement Act Cases (1875), the Sinking Fund Cases (1878), the Railroad Commission Cases (1886) and the Telephone Cases (1887).

In 1876, amid speculation about a third term for President Grant, who had been tainted by scandals, some Republicans turned to Waite. They believed he was a better presidential nominee for the Republican Party. However, Waite refused, announcing &quot;my duty [i]s not to make it a stepping stone to someone else but to preserve its purity and make my own name as honorable as that of any of my predecessors.&quot; In the aftermath of the presidential election of 1876, Waite refused to sit on the Electoral Commission that decided the electoral votes of Florida because of his close friendship with GOP presidential nominee Rutherford B. Hayes as well as being a Yale College classmate of Democratic presidential nominee Samuel J. Tilden.

As Chief Justice, Waite swore in Presidents Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester A. Arthur and Grover Cleveland. After suffering a breakdown, probably due to overwork, Waite refused to retire. Almost to the moment of his death, he continued to draft opinions and lead the Court.

===Role in corporate personhood controversy===

In 1885, S. W. Sanderson, who was the Chief Legal Advisor for the Southern Pacific Railroad, decided to sue Santa Clara County in California because it was trying to regulate the railroad&#x27;s activity. His claim, in part, was that because a railroad was a &#x27;person&#x27; under the Constitution, local governments couldn&#x27;t &#x27;discriminate&#x27; against it by having different laws and taxes in different places.

When &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company&quot;, , came before the Court, Sanderson asserted that &#x27;corporate persons&#x27; should be treated the same as &#x27;natural (or human) persons.&#x27; and although the Court specifically did not rule on it, the Reporter of Decisions, John Chandler Bancroft Davis, inserted the following dictum in the headnotes:

The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.

Before publication, Davis wrote a letter to Waite, dated May 26, 1886, to make sure his headnote was correct, to which Waite replied:

I think your mem. in the California Railroad Tax cases expresses with sufficient accuracy what was said before the argument began. I leave it with you to determine whether anything need be said about it in the report inasmuch as we avoided meeting the constitutional question in the decision.[4]

Hence this &quot;dictum&quot; in the headnote and the Waite reply changed the course of history and how corporations came to have the legal rights of a human person.

Thomas Hartmann, in his book &quot;Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and Theft of Human Rights&quot;, has the following to say:

In these two sentences (according to the conventional wisdom), Waite weakened the kind of democratic republic the original authors of the Constitution had envisioned, and set the stage for the future worldwide damage of our environmental, governmental, and cultural commons. The plutocracy that had arisen with the East India Company in 1600, and been fought back by America&#x27;s Founders, had gained a tool that was to allow them, in the coming decades, to once again gain control of most of North America, and then the world. Ironically, of the 307 Fourteenth Amendment cases brought before the Supreme Court in the years between his proclamation and 1910, only 19 dealt with African Americans: 288 were suits brought by corporations seeking the rights of natural persons.

==Death==
Waite died unexpectedly of pneumonia on March 23, 1888. This created a stir in Washington, as there had been no hint that his illness was serious. His condition had been treated as confidential, in part to avoid alarming his wife who was in California. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; devoted its entire front page to his demise. Large crowds joined in the mourning. Except for Justices Bradley and Matthews, all the justices accompanied his body on the special train that went to Toledo, Ohio. Mrs. Waite traveled by train from California, arriving just in time for the funeral.

Published reports indicated the Chief Justice would be buried in a family plot he had purchased in Forest Hill Cemetery, but he was not interred there. Instead, he was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, in Toledo, Ohio.

Waite, who had financial difficulties during his service as Chief Justice, left a very small estate that was insufficient to support his widow and daughters. Members of the organized Bar in Washington and New York raised money to create two funds for the benefit of Waite&#x27;s family members.

On March 28, 1888 a House Funeral in the capitol building was held for the passing of Morrison Waite. In attendance at the funeral were President Grover Cleveland, First Lady Frances Cleveland, the Cabinet, and fellow Supreme Court justices.

==Legacy==
Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter said of Waite:

He did not confine the constitution within the limits of his own experience. ... The disciplined and disinterested lawyer in him transcended the bounds of the environment within which he moved and the views of the client whom he served at the bar.

Waite High School in Toledo, Ohio is named in his honor.

<text>The Current River is a river in the City of Thunder Bay and Unorganized Thunder Bay District in Thunder Bay District, Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The river is in the Great Lakes Basin and is a tributary of Lake Superior. The river&#x27;s name comes from the French &quot;Rivière aux courants&quot;, referring to the river&#x27;s currents.

==Course==
The Current River begins at Current Lake in Unorganized Thunder Bay District and flows northwest, then turns southeast, passing out of Ray Lake over a dam, then under Ontario Highway 527 and reaches Onion Lake. It continues southwest, passes into geographic Gorham Township, flows past the community of Stepstone, and turns southeast before entering the City of Thunder Bay. It takes in the left tributary North Current River, turns south, passes under Ontario Highway 17, then flows through Boulevard Lake and over Boulevard Lake Dam, and flows into Thunder Bay on Lake Superior.

==History==

The river&#x27;s name is the English version of the name given it by early French explorers: &quot;Rivière aux courants&quot;, referring to the river&#x27;s currents. In 1859 Lindsay Russell, Surveyor-General for Canada, followed the river from its mouth in Lake Superior towards its source, reporting that:
:&quot;Current River, having a general course of north, winds about among steep, rocky hills, which sometimes rise straight up from its edge; from the top of one of these, about 6 miles from its mouth, we could see its course for a long distance through an exceedingly rough country. It is full of rapids and falls pouring through clefts of up-heaved granite and slate. Opposite the second mile of the line it passes through slate, but higher up, granite.&quot;

Two other sizable rivers and a creek — the Neebing River, the McIntyre River and McVicar&#x27;s Creek — run between Current River and the Kaministiquia River to the south, but in 1858 neither of these two rivers were of sufficient interest to be identified by name. From the vantage point of Fort William, the Neebing River was referred to as &quot;First River&quot; and the McIntyre continued for some time to be known as &quot;Second River.&quot; Sometimes, from the vantage point of Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing, the names were reversed, the McIntyre being the First River and the Neebing River the Second River.

Early references to development along the Current River include mention of John McKenzie&#x27;s acquisition of land along it in 1857, and William Petit Trowbridge&#x27;s 400 acre (162 hectare) purchase of patented mineral lands at the river&#x27;s mouth in 1865. About 1867 brothers Peter, John and Donald McKellar discovered silver deposits near the river, and their Thunder Bay Silver Mining Co. operated near its mouth from 1866 to 1870, when fire destroyed the buildings. The Duncan-Shuniah Mine also operated in this area from 1867 to 1881. An 1875 editorial in Prince Arthur Landing&#x27;s satirical newspaper &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; mentions (facetiously) factories and mills on the Current River, but there was no industrial activity on the river until the 20th century.

In 1901 a dam was built near the mouth of the river, resulting in flooding which created an artificial lake known as Boulevard Lake. The land around the lake was developed as a municipal park. Industry has continued to build at the mouth of the river—predominantly pulp, wood and newsprint mills, along with rail and lake shipping facilities—but numerous parklands follow it inland. Eventually it disappears into roadless wilderness, reappearing from time to time near roadsides and at dams constructed along its course.

<text>Dipolog (), officially the City of Dipolog (; Subanen: &quot;Gembagel G&#x27;benwa Dipuleg/Bagbenwa Dipuleg&quot;; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 138,141 people making it the most populous in the province.

Geographically, the city is surrounded by rolling hills to the southeast and the Sulu Sea to the north. Dipolog is known for its wild orchids and its sardine industry which stems from the rich fishing area off its shores. It is known as the &quot;Gateway to Western Mindanao&quot; through the Western Nautical Highway
and has also been called the &quot;Bottled Sardines Capital of the Philippines.&quot;

Dipolog can be reached by plane via Dipolog Airport or by ferry at the Galas Port in Barangay Galas or at nearby Pulauan Port in Dapitan. The development of the Port of Dipolog, a roll-on/roll-off facility at Barangay Galas, will allow for the eventual transfer of the service to Dipolog while retaining inter-island operations at Pulauan, which is a base port.

A popular city attraction is the foreshore Dipolog Boulevard which, though still in its second phase of construction, has become a popular haven for exercise and leisure. It is also the site for various celebrations and festivals in the city. In the third phase of the project, the length of the boulevard will be extended to reach the seaport in Barangay Galas.

==History==

===Spanish regime===
The town appeared in the 1734 Murillo Velarde map as Diporog.

Earliest recorded political history of Dipolog started in 1834 with the re-organization of Spanish Provincial Government of Misamis. At that time, &quot;Tulwanan&#x27;s&quot; political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its &quot;capitán&quot; or town executive.
Sometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its barrio executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; &quot;¿Dónde está el capitán?&quot; or &quot;Where is the captain?&quot;. The native understanding only the word &quot;capitán&quot; pointed to the west and said in Subanen Di-pag, meaning &quot;across the river&quot;. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place &quot;Dipag&quot;.

Technically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent &quot;Dipolog&quot; which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter &#x27;L&#x27; written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan&#x27;s political identity ceased to exist.
By the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now Zamboanga Peninsula region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese pirates, they decided to move their settlements inland.

In the 14th century, Tulwanan was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day &quot;barangay&quot; center of &quot;Lugdungan&quot;.

In the 15th century, settlers from neighboring Negros and Bohol islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a &quot;barangay&quot; of present-day Polanco town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).

It was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in Mindanao and established a coastal settlement in what is now called Dapitan. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya&#x27;s men and Chinese pirates.

===Mindanao&#x27;s first Christian settlement===
In 1565, Don Miguel López de Legazpi who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. Andrés de Urdaneta, an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of Datu Sikatuna. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. Peter Kaerius (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as &quot;Dapito&quot; in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as &quot;Dapite&quot; in Robert Dudley&#x27;s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include &quot;Dapyto&quot; in Sanson&#x27;s map of 1652 and &quot;Dapitan&quot; which can be found in Moll&#x27;s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde&#x27;s map of 1734. After Legazpi&#x27;s visit, the Christianization of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.

In 1581, members of The Society of Jesus came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four religious orders in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acuña S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.

In 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.

Also in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao. Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, Iligan, Basilan and Butuan. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.
By the 18th century, with the Spanish Naval Fleet anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy—now conducted mainly by moro bandits—was under control within the Sulu Sea. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.

From Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.

By 1889, administrative designations reverted to &quot;Capitanes&quot;, and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.

By February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. José Rizal to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.

By 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.

===American regime===
After the transfer of Spanish sovereignty to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the &quot;Capitan&quot; to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.
Martin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.

By 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of Cebu, outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya&#x27;s clan.

By 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its principalía and members of the &quot;Centro Catolico de Dipolog&quot;. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the community to an independent Municipality.

By 1912, Gov. John J. Pershing of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan and reorganize as a municipality again.

By July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual Tan Martinez, who was appointed the Municipal President of Dapitan since 1910, as its first Municipal Mayor.

The first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Corro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.

===Japanese regime and World War II===

Governor Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr. noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor. Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula. Governor Ranillo&#x27;s jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur. During Governor Ranillo&#x27;s term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.

He was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula. President Quezon fondly called him &quot;El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang&quot;. In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the guerrillas, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.

In 1942, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, Zamboanga acting Governor Felipe B. Azcuna moved the capital from Zamboanga City to Dipolog. On March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near Zamboanga City, followed by Sanga Sanga in Sulu, and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. After the defeat of the American-Filipino forces in Corregidor, most of the province went under Japanese control. This designation lasted until June 16, 1948, when the capital was transferred from Dipolog to Molave, Zamboanga del Sur through Republic Act No. 286 signed by President Elpidio Quirino.

===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===
Certain portions of Dipolog were organized into separate municipalities of Polanco and New Piñan, by virtue of &quot;Executive Order No. 467&quot; signed by President Elpidio Quirino on August 22, 1951.

On June 6, 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur through &quot;Republic Act (RA) No. 711&quot;. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.

On June 21, 1969, through the effort of former congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, President Ferdinand Marcos signed into law &quot;RA No. 5520&quot;, making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.
Mayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963–1970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970–1978). On March 8, 1982, the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the Dipolog City March composed by Mrs. Antonina O. Romano as the city&#x27;s official song.

===Martial law era===

Dipolog was the site of at least one major assassination during the Marcos Martial law era - the gunning down of Human Rights lawyers Jacobo Amatong and Zorro Aguilar by two soldiers of the Marcos government, who were never caught. Both lawyers have since been honored by having their names included in at least two streets in the city, inscribed on the wall of remembrance at the Philippines’ Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought against Ferdinand Marcos and his martial law regime.

==Geography==

It is bounded on the north by Dapitan, on the east by the Municipalities of Polanco and Piñan, on the south by the Municipality of Sergio Osmeña Sr. and on the west by the Municipality of Katipunan.

Its land area in 1914 covered an approximate land area of 248,587 hectares under Act No. 302 of the Philippine Islands. It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two barrios of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of Polanco, and Piñan under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.

In 2006, a study by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB) found Dipolog to be the wealthiest city &quot;per capita&quot; in the Zamboanga Peninsula. Within Dipolog, 23.15% of the population was estimated to be living below the poverty line (households with a per capita expenditure of under $1 a day). In comparison, the NCSB estimated Zamboanga City and Pagadian as having poverty incidences of 23.81% and 27.15%, respectively. In startling contrast, the poverty rate for the entire province of Zamboanga del Norte (with individuals in both rural and urban settings) was estimated to be 40.36%.

Dipolog shared much of its cultural history with the ancient town of Dapitan to which it once belonged. It traces its beginnings long before the Spanish conquistadores set foot on the island of Mindanao. Dipolog was previously known as Tulwanan, in native language, literally meaning a &quot;settlement by the river&quot;. Its earliest settlers all belonged to the &quot;Subanen Tribe&quot; called &quot;Subanon&quot; or river people with established religion founded in animism. These descended from the Austronesian peoples who roamed Mindanao and Southeast Asia via land bridges as early as 30,000 years ago Later migrations of other tribes were made by water and took place over several thousand years.

<text>Neil Bartlett (15 September 1932 – 5 August 2008) was a British chemist who specialized in fluorine and compounds containing fluorine, and became famous for creating the first noble gas compounds. He taught chemistry at the University of British Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley.

==Biography==
Neil Bartlett was born on 15 September 1932 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Bartlett&#x27;s interest in chemistry dated back to an experiment at Heaton Grammar School when he was only eleven years old, in which he prepared &quot;beautiful, well-formed&quot; crystals by reaction of aqueous ammonia with copper sulfate. He explored chemistry by constructing a makeshift lab in his parents&#x27; home using chemicals and glassware he purchased from a local supply store. He went on to attend King&#x27;s College, University of Durham (which went on to become Newcastle University) in the United Kingdom where he obtained a Bachelor of Science (1954) and then a doctorate (1958) in the inorganic chemistry research group of Dr. P.L. Robinson. 

In 1958, Bartlett&#x27;s career began upon being appointed a lecturer in chemistry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada where he would ultimately reach the rank of full professor. During his time at the university he made his discovery that noble gases were indeed reactive enough to form bonds. He remained there until 1966, when he moved to Princeton University as a professor of chemistry and a member of the research staff at Bell Laboratories. He then went on to join the chemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969 as a professor of chemistry until his retirement in 1993. He was also a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 1969 to 1999. In 2000, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He died on 5 August 2008 of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. He lived with his wife Christina Bartlett until his death. They had four children.

==Research==
Bartlett&#x27;s main specialty was the chemistry of fluorine and of compounds containing fluorine. In 1962, Bartlett prepared the first noble gas compound, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, Xe+[PtF6]−. This contradicted established models of the nature of valency, as it was believed that all noble gases were entirely inert to chemical combination. His discovery incited other chemists to discover several other fluorides of xenon: XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.

==Honors==
In 1968 he was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal. In 1973, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (United Kingdom). In 1976 he received the Welch Award in Chemistry for his synthesis of chemical compounds of noble gases and the consequent opening of broad new fields of research in the inorganic chemistry. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1979, he was honored as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the prestigious Davy Medal in 2002 for his discovery that the noble gases were not that noble after all. Previous recipients of the Davy Medal had included people as diverse as Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, the inventor of the Bunsen burner, and Albert Ladenburg, who suggested the existence of the compound prismane. In 2006, his research into the reactivity of noble gases was designated jointly by the American Chemical Society and the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC) as an International Historic Chemical Landmark at the University of British Columbia in recognition of its significance, &quot;fundamental to the scientific understanding of the chemical bond.&quot; Bartlett was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Chemistry every year between 1963 and 1966 but did not get the Prize.

==Hospitalization==
In January 1963, Bartlett and his graduate student, P. R. Rao, were hospitalized after an explosion in the laboratory. As they looked at what they thought might be the first crystals of XeF2, the compound exploded, getting shards of glass in the eyes of both men. According to Bartlett, he thought that the compound may have contained water molecules, and he and Rao took off their glasses to get a better look. They were both taken to the hospital for four weeks, and Bartlett was left with damaged vision in one eye. The last piece of glass from this accident was removed 27 years later.

<doc id="433103" wikidata="Q7598242" url="?curid=433103" title="Standard Gauge (toy trains)">
<text>Standard Gauge, also known as wide gauge, was an early model railway and toy train rail gauge, introduced in the United States in 1906 by Lionel Corporation. As it was a toy standard, rather than a scale modeling standard, the actual scale of Standard Gauge locomotives and rolling stock varied. It ran on three-rail track whose running rails were apart.

==Origins==
Lionel dubbed its new standard &quot;Standard Gauge&quot; and trademarked the name. Lionel&#x27;s Standard Gauge is distinct from the standard gauge of real railroads, and the later 1:64 scale S gauge popularized by American Flyer after World War II. Due to the trademark, Lionel&#x27;s competitors mostly called their similar offerings &quot;wide gauge&quot;.

Historians offer two alternative explanations for the creation of Standard Gauge. One is that Lionel misread the specifications for Märklin&#x27;s European Gauge 2, measuring the distance between the inside portion of the rails rather than between the centers of the rails as Märklin did, thus accidentally making a slightly larger and incompatible standard. The other possibility is that the change was a deliberate effort to forestall European competition by creating incompatible trains. While many believe the latter is more likely, since several U.S. companies such as Carlisle &amp; Finch were producing trains to that standard, no definitive proof in favor of either theory has ever surfaced.

Standard Gauge production began in 1906 or 1907. A Lionel catalog exists showing Standard Gauge with a post mark that appears to indicate 1906; however, most collectors feel that production did not begin until 1907, and that Lionel manufactured their 2 7/8 inch gauge line through 1906.

==Lionel&#x27;s competitors==
Whatever the reason for its initial creation, Lionel&#x27;s Standard Gauge caught on at the expense of gauges 1 and 2. No fewer than four American competitors adopted Lionel&#x27;s gauge: Ives in 1921, Boucher in 1922, Dorfan in 1924, and American Flyer in 1925. While all the manufacturers&#x27; track was the same size and the trains and buildings approximately the same scale, the couplers for the most part remained incompatible, making it impossible to mix train cars from different manufacturers without modification.

The increased number of manufacturers seemed to give legitimacy to Lionel&#x27;s gauge. The boom of the 1920s made large toy trains affordable and Standard Gauge had its heyday in the mid-1920s only to virtually disappear during the Great Depression. Ives filed for bankruptcy in 1928 and its offerings were off the market by 1932. American Flyer discontinued its Standard Gauge trains in 1932. Dorfan went out of business in 1934. Lionel discontinued Standard Gauge trains in 1940. Boucher, the last of the wide gauge manufacturers, folded in 1943.

O gauge, was smaller, less expensive to manufacture and it required less space to operate a layout. Thus, it became the most popular scale in the United States almost by default.

==Decline of Standard Gauge==
Lionel did not introduce a new Standard Gauge piece after 1933.

In 1937, there were some Lionel 500 series cars that were created with new trucks that had box couplers. This shows that Lionel invested in tooling to modernize Standard Gauge, but ultimately did not put them into production.

The toy train market evolved into scale modeling. Lionel&#x27;s prized 700e Hudson was cataloged in O-gauge from 1937 as their top-of-the-line train. The larger Standard Gauge no longer symbolized top-of-the-line Lionel. Lionel last showed Standard Gauge in their 1940 catalogs, ultimately only offering rolling stock, which suggests they were selling off existing inventory.

==After 1940==
Standard Gauge managed to survive in South America. Doggenweiler, a firm in Chile, produced a small quantity of trains in Standard Gauge and Gauge 2 from 1933 until about 1960. Standard Gauge was revived in the United States in the 1950s by the small firm McCoy Manufacturing, who produced trains of original design well into the 1990s. In the 1970s, Williams Electric Trains began producing and marketing reproductions of Lionel trains of the 1920s and 1930s. This line was later marketed by Lionel itself, and was produced and marketed by MTH Electric Trains until 2021 when Mike Wolf retired and split up the company. In 2002, Lionel would produce two new Standard Gauge sets, one based on the New York Central&#x27;s Commodore Vanderbilt trainset and the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Hiawatha.

A number of smaller manufacturers, mostly one- and two-person operations, hand-build and marketed reproductions of very early Standard Gauge trains.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Attorney General for England and Wales is the chief legal adviser to the sovereign and Government in affairs pertaining to England and Wales as well as the highest ranking amongst the law officers of the Crown. The attorney general is the leader of the Attorney General&#x27;s Office and currently attends (but is not a member of) the Cabinet. Unlike in other countries employing the common law legal system, the attorney general does not govern the administration of justice; that function is carried out by the secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor. The incumbent is also concurrently advocate general for Northern Ireland.

The position of attorney general has existed since at least 1243, when records show a professional attorney was hired to represent the King&#x27;s interests in court. The position first took on a political role in 1461 when the holder of the office was summoned to the House of Lords to advise the Government there on legal matters. In 1673, the attorney general officially became the Crown&#x27;s adviser and representative in legal matters, although still specialising in litigation rather than advice. The beginning of the 20th century saw a shift away from litigation and more towards legal advice. Today, prosecutions are carried out by the Crown Prosecution Service and most legal advice to government departments is provided by the Government Legal Department, both under the supervision of the attorney general.

Additional duties include superintending the Serious Fraud Office, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, Service Prosecuting Authority, and other government lawyers with the authority to prosecute cases. The attorney general advises the government, individual government departments, and individual government ministers on legal matters, answering questions in Parliament and bringing &quot;unduly lenient&quot; sentences and points of law to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. As per the Law Officers Act 1997, duties can be delegated to the Solicitor General, and any actions are treated as if they came from the attorney general.

The corresponding shadow minister is the Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales, and the work of the attorney general is also scrutinised by the Justice Select Committee.

==History==
The origins of the office are unknown, but the earliest record of an &quot;attorney of the crown&quot; is from 1243, when a professional attorney named Laurence Del Brok was paid to prosecute cases for the king, who could not appear in courts where he had an interest. During the early days of the office the holder was largely concerned with representing the Crown in litigation, and held no political role or duties. Although a valuable position, the attorney general was expected to work incredibly hard; although Francis North (1637–1685) was earning £7,000 a year as attorney general he was pleased to give up the office and become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas because of the smaller workload, despite the heavily reduced pay. The office first took on a political element in 1461, when the holder was summoned by writ to the House of Lords to advise the government on legal matters. This was also the first time that the office was referred to as the office of the &quot;Attorney General&quot;. The custom of summoning the attorney general to the Lords by writ when appointed continues unbroken to this day, although until the appointment of Lord Williams of Mostyn in 1999, no attorney general had sat in the Lords since 1700, and no attorney general had obeyed the writ since 1742.

During the 16th century, the attorney general was used to pass messages between the House of Lords and House of Commons, although he was viewed suspiciously by the Commons and seen as a tool of the Lords and the king. In 1673 the attorney general began to take up a seat in the House of Commons, and since then it has been convention to ensure that all attorneys general are members of the House of Commons or House of Lords, although there is no requirement that they be so. During the constitutional struggle centred on the Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 and 1673 the attorney general officially became the Crown&#x27;s representative in legal matters.

In 1890, the ability of an attorney general to continue practising privately was formally taken away, turning the office-holder into a dedicated representative of the government. Since the beginning of the twentieth century the role of the attorney general has moved away from representing the Crown and government directly in court, and it has become more of a political and ministerial post, with the attorney general serving as a legal adviser to both the government as a whole and individual government departments. Despite this change, until the passing of the Homicide Act 1957 the attorney general was bound to prosecute any and all poisoning cases.

However, in recent times the attorney general has exceptionally conducted litigation in person before the courts, for instance before the House of Lords in &quot;A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot;, where the legality of the government&#x27;s detention of terrorist suspects at Belmarsh was at issue.

==Role and duties==
The attorney general is currently not a Cabinet minister, but is designated as also attending Cabinet. The rule that no attorney general may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and for a short time the attorney general did sit in cabinet, starting with Sir Rufus Isaacs in 1912 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits attorneys general from attending meetings of the Cabinet, and on occasion they have been asked to attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude attorneys general from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the attorney general is directly answerable to Parliament.

The attorney general is also the chief legal adviser of the Crown and its government, and has the primary role of advising the government on any legal repercussions of their actions, either orally at meetings or in writing. As well as the government as a whole, they also advise individual departments. Although the primary role is no longer one of litigation, the attorney general still represents the Crown and government in court in some select, particularly important cases, and chooses the Treasury Counsel who handle most government legal cases. By convention, they represent the government in every case in front of the International Court of Justice. The attorney general also superintends the Crown Prosecution Service and appoints its head, the Director of Public Prosecutions. Decisions to prosecute are taken by the Crown Prosecution Service other than in exceptional cases i.e. where the attorney general&#x27;s consent is required by statute or in cases relating to national security. An example of a consent case is the Campbell Case, which led to the fall of the first Labour government in 1924.

The attorney general also superintends the Government Legal Department and the Serious Fraud Office. The attorney general also has powers to bring &quot;unduly lenient&quot; sentences and points of law to the Court of Appeal, issue writs of &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; to cancel criminal prosecutions, supervise other prosecuting bodies (such as DEFRA) and advise individual ministers facing legal action as a result of their official actions. They are responsible for making applications to the court restraining vexatious litigants, and may intervene in litigation to represent the interests of charity, or the public interest in certain family law cases. They are also officially the leader of the Bar of England and Wales, although this is merely custom and has no duties or rights attached to it. The attorney general&#x27;s duties have long been considered strenuous, with Sir Patrick Hastings saying that &quot;to be a law officer is to be in hell&quot;. Since the passing of the Law Officers Act 1997, any duties of the attorney general can be delegated to the Solicitor General for England and Wales, and their actions are treated as coming from the attorney general.

<text>Samuel Henry Harkwood Livingston (4 February 1831 – 4 October 1897) born in Ireland, he came to Canada following an unsuccessful venture in the Californian gold rush of 1849, and eventually found his way to Jumping Pound, North-West Territories, in 1873 where he opened a trading post. He was going to settle near the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers in 1875 but, when the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) arrived and established Fort Calgary, Livingston and his family moved further up the Elbow River to the current location of the Glenmore Reservoir. When the Glenmore Dam was built and the area flooded, part of the Livingston house was preserved and now stands at Heritage Park. Sam Livingston was an important man to Alberta&#x27;s history. The Glenmore Reservoir gets its name from Sam too; Sam and Jane started a school on their farm that Sam named &#x27;Glenmore School&#x27; after a place in Ireland. Glenmore is a village in County Kilkenny and quite close to his birthplace in County Wicklow.

Sam Livingston married Jane Howse in 1865 and settled at Fort Victoria for a while. He also started a business which included trading for buffalo hides. By 1874 he had relocated his operations southward to be closer to the trade with the plains Indians and was doing business near the Roman Catholic mission, Our Lady of Peace, on the Elbow River. In the summer of 1876 Livingston moved with his family closer to Fort Calgary, the newly established NWMP post on the river. Here, in 1876, he began cultivation and with John Glenn was one of the first farmers in the area.

Livingston was a great innovator who brought the first examples of mechanized equipment to farming in the Calgary area. Some people call Sam Livingston &quot;Calgary&#x27;s first citizen&quot;, but George Clift King is also given that title. In fact John Glenn was the first documented European settler in the Calgary area, in 1873. In 1872, Alexis Cardinal (Métis) had built a shack for Father Constantine Scollen. In March 1873, Scollen moved there and established the first mission to the Blackfoot Confederacy in what would later become Alberta.
In the months before the 1885 North-West Rebellion, Livingston and John Glen helped found the Alberta Settler Rights Association. Livingston spoke at the founding meeting that he was aggrieved because it had been difficult for him to get title to land he had used for years. He said he knew of 40 or 50 settlers who had been driven out of the country because they could not get land and that too much of the land was &quot;all taken up by leases or reserves of some kind.&quot; The Association passed a statement that &quot;we most earnestly impress upon the government the necessity of granting [to NWT Metis the privileges already granted in Manitoba] as the only way of removing the present discontent and of quieting the disturbances that have already arisen in these territories.&quot;

Sam Livingston died in 1897 shortly after the birth of his 14th child. His funeral procession was 40 carriages long.

<doc id="433118" wikidata="Q420831" url="?curid=433118" title="Xenon hexafluoroplatinate">
<text>Xenon hexafluoroplatinate is the product of the reaction of platinum hexafluoride with xenon, in an experiment that proved the chemical reactivity of the noble gases. This experiment was performed by Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia, who formulated the product as &quot;Xe+[PtF6]−&quot;, although subsequent work suggests that Bartlett&#x27;s product was probably a salt mixture and did not in fact contain this specific salt.

==Preparation==
&quot;Xenon hexafluoroplatinate&quot; is prepared from xenon and platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) as gaseous solutions in SF6. The reactants are combined at 77 K and slowly warmed to allow for a controlled reaction.

==Structure==
The material described originally as &quot;xenon hexafluoroplatinate&quot; is probably not Xe+[PtF6]−. The main problem with this formulation is &quot;Xe+&quot;, which would be a radical and would dimerize or abstract a fluorine atom to give XeF+. Thus, Bartlett discovered that Xe undergoes chemical reactions, but the nature and purity of his initial mustard yellow product remains uncertain. Further work indicates that Bartlett&#x27;s product probably contained [XeF]+[PtF5]−, [XeF]+[Pt2F11]−, and [Xe2F3]+[PtF6]−. The title &quot;compound&quot; is a salt, consisting of an octahedral anionic fluoride complex of platinum and various xenon cations.

It has been proposed that the platinum fluoride forms a negatively charged polymeric network with xenon or xenon fluoride cations held in its interstices. A preparation of &quot;XePtF6&quot; in HF solution results in a solid which has been characterized as a polymeric network associated with XeF+. This result is evidence for such a polymeric structure of xenon hexafluoroplatinate.

==History==

In 1962, Neil Bartlett discovered that a mixture of platinum hexafluoride gas and oxygen formed a red solid. The red solid turned out to be dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, Bartlett noticed that the ionization energy for O2 (1175 kJ mol−1) was very close to the ionization energy for Xe (1170 kJ mol−1). He then asked his colleagues to give him some xenon &quot;so that he could try out some reactions&quot;, whereupon he established that xenon indeed reacts with PtF6. Although, as discussed above, the product was probably a mixture of several compounds, Bartlett&#x27;s work was the first proof that compounds could be prepared from a noble gas. Since Bartlett&#x27;s observation, many well-defined compounds of xenon have been reported including XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.

<text>Reginald de Braose (19 September 1182 – June 1228) was one of the sons of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber and Matilda, also known as Maud de St. Valery and Lady de la Haie. Her other children included William and Giles.

The de Braoses were loyal to King Richard I but grew in power under King John of England. The dynasty was in conflict with King John towards the end of his reign and almost lost everything.

Reginald de Braose was a scion of the powerful Marcher family of de Braose, helped manage its survival and was also related by marriage to the Welsh Princes of Wales.

== &quot;Magna Carta&quot; ==

He supported his brother Giles de Braose in his rebellions against King John. Both brothers were active against the King in the Barons&#x27; War. Neither was present at the signing of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; in June 1215 because at this time they were still rebels who refused to compromise.

== Restoration of royal favour ==

King John acquiesced to Reginald&#x27;s claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. Reginald became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and held other Marcher Lordships but was also very much a vassal of the Welsh leader Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd who had become his father-in-law in 1215 when Reginald married Llywelyn&#x27;s daughter, Gwladus Ddu.

King Henry III restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated by King John) in 1217.

== Welsh wars ==

At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald&#x27;s Welsh nephews who were princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and took Builth, except the castle. Llywelyn Fawr also became angry and his forces besieged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinhenydd (Swansea).

By 1221 they were at war again, with Llewelyn again laying siege to Builth. The siege was relieved by King Henry III&#x27;s forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald&#x27;s nephew John de Braose concerning the de Braose lands in Wales.

Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of &quot;Magna Carta&quot; by King Henry III in 1225.

He died two or three years later in 1227 or 1228 in Brecon and was succeeded by his son by his first wife, Graecia Briwere (or Brewer), daughter of William Brewer. He was buried in Brecon Priory Church (now Brecon Cathedral). 

Reginald and Graecia had a son, William de Braose, who was executed by Llewellyn Fawr, King of Gwynedd, upon being caught in the bedchamber of Joan, Lady of Wales. 

It may be that the Matilda de Braose who was the wife of Rhys Mechyll, Prince of Deheubarth was the daughter of Reginald.

<doc id="433124" wikidata="Q376134" url="?curid=433124" title="Automotive aftermarket">
<text>The automotive aftermarket is the secondary parts market of the automotive industry, concerned with the manufacturing, remanufacturing, distribution, retailing, and installation of all vehicle parts, chemicals, equipment, and accessories, &quot;after&quot; the sale of the automobile by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to the consumer. The parts, accessories, etc. for sale may or may not be manufactured by the OEM.

The aftermarket encompasses parts for replacement, collision, appearance, and performance. The aftermarket provides a wide variety of parts of varying qualities and prices for nearly all vehicle makes and models.

Consumers have the option of repairing their vehicles themselves (the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; or &quot;DIY&quot; segment) or can take the vehicle to a professional repair facility (the &quot;do-it-for me&quot; or &quot;DIFM&quot; segment).
The aftermarket helps keep vehicles on the road by providing consumers the choice of where they want their vehicles serviced, maintained, or customized.

==Size of the automotive aftermarket==
The United States automotive aftermarket is estimated to be worth $383 billion (2020), contributing more than 2.3% to GDP. The aftermarket employs 4.4 million people who work at manufacturers, distributors, retailers and repair shops. 

In the United States, online sales of aftermarket accessories have showed year over year increases over traditional brick and mortar stores. In fact, according to Hedges &amp; Company, &quot;Online revenue for automotive parts eCommerce revenue will reach $38 billion in 2022 in the US.&quot; That includes $19.8 billion from first-party 1P eCommerce websites and $18.3 billion from third-party 3P marketplaces.

Singapore, which does not have a domestic automobile industry, is an especially important destination for businesses exporting automotive parts and accessories due to its high automobile turnover stemming from the peculiarities of its driving laws. (In short, car owners are legally required to get rid of their cars after ten years of use and Singapore&#x27;s compensation scheme to offset the registration fee of new cars has incentivized more frequent turnover.)

High automobile turnover and the preference for new parts means that the market for remanufactured and reconditioned auto parts is very small. Combined with a high demand for &quot;accessories, car-care products, prestige items, and new spare parts,&quot; Singapore&#x27;s automotive aftermarket is large. In fact, Singapore has become a major automotive &quot;components&quot; manufacturing base, as several leading multinational corporations (MNCs) have established international procurement offices as well as their Southeast Asia distribution centers.

In Canada, the automotive aftermarket is a C$19.4 billion industry that employs about 420,000 people.

In Australia, the automotive aftermarket industry in 2013 was estimated to generate a AUD$5.2 billion turnover, with 21000 staff, and 1400 manufacturers.

in Europe, the total volume of Independent Aftermarket (IAM) amounted to 127 billion Euros in 2015 (end-user prices without labor and tax). At that moment there were 54 parts traders with annual turnover over 100 mio Euros in Europe, 6 of them exceeded 1 billion Euros.
Meeting platform for the international automotive aftermarket is the B2B trade fair Automechanika which takes place every two years in Frankfurt. At last edition the hot topics were connected cars, autonomous driving, alternative drives and the workshop of the future.

==Online versus brick-and-mortar aftermarket accessory vendors==
Among online retailers, Amazon.com and eBay Motors are the largest sellers of aftermarket parts and accessories in the U.S. by both units sold and revenue, and are expected to grow 25% in 2014, far outstripping traditional chain stores.
As DIY parts sales soften at the retail counter, chain stores have pushed themselves into the DIFM commercial business, eating into distributors’ and wholesalers’ market share. Since 2007, DIY sales at the chain stores have fallen a total of 3% to 5%, while commercial sales have brought in a double-digit sales increase. AutoZone’s DIFM sales in 2013 alone increased over 13%.

Online sales of auto parts and accessories in the United States, excluding online auctions and used parts, have been projected to pass $10 billion in 2018.

==Legal issues==
Automobile manufacturers have attempted to hinder or suppress automotive aftermarket sales by means of copyright or patent infringement litigation. For example, in &quot;British Leyland Motor Corp. v Armstrong Patents Co.&quot; in the UK, the House of Lords decided in 1986 that Leyland could not claim copyright infringement in order to prevent the aftermarket sale of replacement tailpipes to purchasers of those motor cars.

&quot;Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.&quot; is a 1961 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court redefined the U.S. patent law doctrine of repair and reconstruction: &quot;No element, not itself separately patented, that constitutes one of the elements of a combination patent is entitled to patent monopoly, however essential it may be to the patented combination and no matter how costly or difficult replacement may be.&quot;

In 2005 Harley-Davidson filed a patent and trademark infringement lawsuit against two aftermarket engine manufacturers producing drop-in replacements for Harley&#x27;s engines, namely S&amp;S Cycle and Delkron, Inc. Harley accused S&amp;S and Delkron of copying parts for Twin Cam engines and using Harley trademarks without permission. S&amp;S argued that the suit was without any legal basis, and asserted that &quot;a mutually beneficial relationship existed&quot; between them and Harley.

<text>Lothar de Maizière (; born 2 March 1940) is a German former Christian Democratic politician. In 1990, he served as the head of the first and only democratically elected government of East Germany, holding this office during the final months before German reunification. Subsequently he briefly served as a minister in the new government of the unified Federal Republic of Germany until his past as a Stasi informant was revealed.

==Family background==
Maizière belongs to a Huguenot family which takes its name from Maizières-lès-Metz and fled France for asylum in Prussia in the late 17th century; the Maizière family attended French-language schools and Huguenot churches in Berlin until the beginning of the 20th century. He is the son of lawyer Clement de Maizière. His uncle Ulrich de Maizière was Inspector General of the West German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. His cousin Thomas de Maizière was a close advisor to Former Chancellor Angela Merkel and served as the Federal Minister of the Interior from 17 December 2013 to 14 March 2018 in Merkel&#x27;s third cabinet.

==Early life and education==
Lothar de Maizière was born in Nordhausen, Thuringia, and attended the ancient Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, where he was one of the last pupils before the school closed in 1958. He next studied viola at the Hanns Eisler College of Music in East Berlin from 1959 to 1965. He played in the Berlin Symphony Orchestra before studying law by distance learning through the Humboldt University of Berlin from 1969 to 1975.

==Career==
A longtime member of the East German Christian Democratic Union, Maizière helped oust the party&#x27;s pro-Communist leadership after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was elected the party&#x27;s chairman in November 1989. In the first and only free election held in East Germany, which the Christian Democratic Union and its allies won, Maizière was elected to the &quot;Volkskammer.&quot; One month later, he succeeded Hans Modrow as Premier and held this position from 12 April until 2 October 1990, heading the de Maizière cabinet. Having run on a platform of speedy reunification with West Germany, Maizière signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, which ended the World War II Allies&#x27; rights and responsibilities in Berlin and Germany and preceded German reunification. The treaty provided that it would be signed by the four Allies and the two Germanies but ratified following reunification. In accordance with that treaty, East Germany ceased to exist on 3 October, and its territory was annexed by the Federal Republic.

After German reunification, he was appointed Minister for Special Affairs in the CDU government of chancellor Helmut Kohl, until his resignation on 17 December 1990 after it became known that he had worked for the East German Stasi as an informant codenamed &quot;IM Czerni&quot;.

<text>Santa Clara University is a private Jesuit university in Santa Clara, California, United States. Established in 1851, Santa Clara University is the oldest operating institution of higher learning in California. The university&#x27;s campus surrounds the historic Mission Santa Clara de Asís which traces its founding to 1777. The campus mirrors the Mission&#x27;s architectural style and is one of the finest groupings of Mission Revival architecture and other Spanish Colonial Revival styles. The university is classified as a &quot;Doctoral/Professional&quot; university.

The university offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees through its six colleges, the College of Arts and Sciences, School of Education and Counseling Psychology, Leavey School of Business, School of Engineering, Jesuit School of Theology, and School of Law. It enrolls 6,115 undergraduate students and about 3,063 postgraduate students as of Fall 2022.

Santa Clara&#x27;s sports teams are called the Broncos. Their colors are red and white. The Broncos compete at the NCAA Division I levels as members of the West Coast Conference in 19 sports. Broncos have won NCAA championships in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer. Santa Clara&#x27;s student athletes include current or former 58 MLB, 40 NFL, and 12 NBA players and 13 Olympic gold medalists. 

Santa Clara&#x27;s faculty and alumni include U.S. Senators and House representatives, a Pulitzer Prize winner, numerous billionaires and U.S. governors, a director of the CIA, a U.S. secretary of defense, a U.S. secretary of agriculture, a White House press secretary and a United States secretary of homeland security. Santa Clara has Fulbright Scholars as well as 4 Rhodes Scholars.

==History==
=== California mission era ===
Inheriting the grounds of Mission Santa Clara de Asís, Santa Clara University&#x27;s campus, library holdings, art collection, and many of its defining traditions date back to 1777, almost 75 years before its founding. In January of that year, Saint Junipero Serra, a Spanish Franciscan friar, established Mission Santa Clara as the eighth of 21 Alta California missions. Fray Tomás de la Peña chose a site along the Guadalupe River for the future church, erecting a cross and celebrating the first Mass a few days later. The campus was built on the land of the Ohlone people who relocated after suffering a decline in population due to epidemics and a loss of natural resources in the area.

Natural disasters forced early priests to relocate and rebuild the church on several occasions, moving it westward and away from the river. Built of wood, the first permanent structure quickly flooded and was replaced by a larger adobe building in 1784. This building suffered heavy damage in an 1818 earthquake and was replaced six years later by a new adobe edifice.

===Early college history===

The mission flourished for more than 50 years despite these setbacks. Beginning in the 1830s, however, the mission lands were repossessed in conjunction with government policy implemented via the Mexico&#x27;s secularization, and church buildings fell into disrepair. The bishop of Monterey, Dominican Joseph Sadoc Alemany, offered the site to Italian Jesuits John Nobili and Michael Accolti in 1851 on condition that they found a college for California&#x27;s growing Catholic population when it became part of the United States following the Mexican–American War (1846–48).

Two colleges were organized during 1851 in the small agricultural town of Santa Clara, at the height of the Gold Rush, less than a year after California was granted statehood. Santa Clara College, forerunner of Santa Clara University, was the first to open its doors to students and is the state&#x27;s oldest operating institution of higher education. Shortly after Santa Clara began instruction, the Methodist-run California Wesleyan College (now known as University of the Pacific) received a charter from the State Superior Court on July 10, 1851—the first granted in California—and it began enrolling students in May of the following year. Santa Clara&#x27;s Jesuit founders lacked the $20,000 endowment required for a charter, which was eventually accumulated and a charter granted on April 28, 1855. 

Santa Clara bears the distinction of awarding California&#x27;s first bachelor&#x27;s degree, bestowed upon Thomas I. Bergin in 1857, as well as its first graduate degree granted two years later.

The California Historical Society, the official state historical society of California, was founded in June 1871 on the campus of the College of Santa Clara by a group of prominent Californian politicians and professors, led by Californian Assemblyman John W. Dwinelle (an influential founder of the University of California).

===Modern era===

In 1912, the &quot;College of Santa Clara&quot; became the &quot;University of Santa Clara&quot;, with the addition of the School of Engineering and School of Law.

In 1923 the Leavey School of Business was founded.

Women were first admitted in 1961 to what had been an all-men&#x27;s university, making Santa Clara University the first Catholic university in California to admit both men and women.

In 1985, in part to avoid confusion with the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Santa Clara, as it had been known since 1912, changed its name to &quot;Santa Clara University&quot;. Diplomas were printed with the new name beginning in 1986.

In 2001 the School of Education and Counseling Psychology was formed to offer Master&#x27;s level and other credential programs.

In 2012, Santa Clara University celebrated 50 years of having women attend Santa Clara University.

==Campus==

The university address is in Santa Clara, California, though a significant part of the campus lies over the border into San Jose, California. Over the last century and a half, the Santa Clara University campus has expanded to more than .
In the 1950s, after the university constructed Walsh Hall and the de Saisset Museum on two of the last remaining open spaces on the old college campus, Santa Clara began purchasing and annexing land from the surrounding community. The first addition, which occurred slightly earlier, brought space for football and baseball playing fields. Thereafter, particularly in the 1960s when women were admitted to the school, more land was acquired for residence halls and other new buildings and facilities.

In 1989 the Santa Clara University campus was unified when The Alameda (California State Route 82), a major thoroughfare that had bisected the university, was rerouted. Several interior roads were also closed and were replaced by sparsely landscaped pedestrian malls and plazas. The current five-year campus plan calls for integration of these areas with the gardens of the campus core.

The 1990s brought a number of campus additions, including the Music and Dance Building, a new science wing, the Arts and Sciences Building, the Malley Fitness Center, the Sobrato Residence Hall, and the first on-campus parking structure. Santa Clara carried out all deferred maintenance, including the renovation of Kenna Hall, the Adobe Lodge, and many other historic buildings. One unique feature of Santa Clara University&#x27;s undergraduate education is the Residential Learning Community program. Eight Residential Learning Communities (RLCs), each with a distinct theme, integrate the classroom and resident life experience.

===Recent development===
Recently completed expansion projects include a new baseball field (Stephen Schott Stadium, 2005), a renovated basketball arena (Leavey Center, 2000), Kennedy Mall – the campus&#x27; first &quot;green building&quot; (2005), a Jesuit community residence (2006), a library (2008), a new building for the Leavey School of Business (2008), a new residence hall, Graham (2012), a new Admission and Enrollment Services building (2012), and a new Art and Art History Building (2016). The new Charney Hall (2018) replaces and consolidates Bannan Hall and the Heafey Law Library into the new Law School.

Future changes are to include a new dorm and the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation.

The main entrance to the campus, Palm Drive, is closed to automobiles in order to create a pedestrian mall to &quot;highlight the Mission Church as the centerpiece of the campus&quot;. This effort is to eventually create a new gateway to the Santa Clara campus.

In 2022, Santa Clara University completed a new STEM campus called the Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation.

===Sustainability===

In 2014, Santa Clara University received the STARS Gold Rating by Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). In 2015, Santa Clara University ranked No.19 on the Princeton Review&#x27;s new “Top 50 Green Colleges” list and is also featured in The Princeton Review Guide to 353 Green Colleges as one of the most environmentally responsible colleges.

In 2013, the Center for Sustainability was established to advance academic and public understanding of the ways in which social justice and sustainability intersect by integrating principles of social, environmental, and economic sustainability into campus operations, academic and student life, and outreach programs.

Santa Clara University is a member of The Green Building Council, the overseeing body of the LEED rating system. In the fall of 2011, Paul Locatelli, S. J. Student Activities Center was certified LEED Gold. In addition, Schott Admission and Enrollment Services, Donohoe Alumni House, and Graham Residence Hall have all been designed to LEED gold standards and are pending certification. All new buildings are designed with the Sustainable Building Policy, adopted in May 2014.

==Administration==

Santa Clara University is a private corporation owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees composed of 44 members. Built around historic Mission Santa Clara, the present university is home to a population of approximately 5,435 undergraduate and 3,335 master&#x27;s, Juris Doctor, and PhD students. The institution employs 522 full-time faculty members, who are divided between four professional schools and the College of Arts and Sciences, all of which are located on the mission campus. In July 2009 the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley (JST), formerly an independent institution, legally merged with the university, taking the name &quot;Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University.&quot; Although a division of SCU, it retains its campus in Berkeley, California. JST is one of two Jesuit seminaries in the United States with ecclesiastical faculties approved by the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for Catholic Education. The other, Weston Jesuit School of Theology, completed a similar affiliation with Boston College in June 2008, becoming Boston College School of Theology and Ministry.

Santa Clara University is civilly chartered and governed by a board of trustees, which appoints the president. By internal statute, the president must be a member of the Jesuit order, although the members of the board are primarily non-Jesuits. About 42 Jesuit priests and brothers are active teachers and administrators in various departments and centers located on the main campus in Santa Clara. An additional 15 Jesuits currently hold faculty positions at the university&#x27;s Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley. Jesuits comprise around 7% of the permanent faculty and hold teaching positions in biology, computer engineering, counseling psychology, economics, English, history, law, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religious studies, and theater arts in addition to theology. They also serve in campus and residence-hall ministry, and some act as faculty directors in residential learning communities (RLC&#x27;s).

For the 2013–2014 academic year, the university&#x27;s operating budget was $387 million, and its endowment was $760 million. For the same period, undergraduate tuition and fees totaled $42,156 and the average cost of room and board was $12,546.

On March 18, 2021, Santa Clara University Board of Trustees Chairman John M. Sobrato announced Kevin F. O&#x27;Brien had been placed on leave pending an inquiry into &quot;exhibited behaviors in adult settings, consisting primarily of conversations, which may be inconsistent with established Jesuit protocols and boundaries&quot;. On May 12, 2021, John M. Sobrato announced to students and faculty that Kevin F. O&#x27;Brien resigned May 9, 2021 at the conclusion of this inquiry, coinciding with his enrollment in a therapeutic outpatient program to address &quot;related personal issues, including alcohol and stress counseling&quot;.

Julie H. Sullivan, Ph.D., the first layperson and first woman to serve as president, began her term on July 1, 2022. She was formerly the president of the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. As of June 30, 2021, Santa Clara University&#x27;s endowment was $1.54 billion.

==Colleges and schools==

Santa Clara University is organized into six professional schools, the School of Arts and Sciences, School of Education and Counseling Psychology, SCU Leavey School of Business, School of Engineering, Jesuit School of Theology, and the School of Law. The university&#x27;s professional schools are all led by an academic dean.

===College of Arts and Sciences===

The College of Arts and Sciences offers Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees.

===Leavey School of Business===

The Leavey School of Business was founded in 1923 and accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business thirty years later. Students can earn a Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Master of Business Administration, Executive Master of Business Administration, and Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS).

Drew Starbird has been Dean of the school since 2010. Starbird is to be replaced by Caryn Beck-Dudley starting in the 2015–16 school year.

===Education, Counseling Psychology, and Pastoral Ministries===

The School of Education, Counseling Psychology, and Pastoral Ministries was created in fall 2001, bringing together graduate programs in Counseling Psychology, Education, and Pastoral Ministries. Approximately 800 graduate students are enrolled in the school, with 200 studying psychology, 400 studying education, and the remainder studying pastoral ministries.

===School of Engineering===

The School of Engineering was founded and began offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1912. Over the next century, the school added Master&#x27;s and doctoral programs designed to meet Silicon Valley&#x27;s growing need for expert engineers. Today, the Valley provides opportunities for the school&#x27;s students and faculty, particularly those in electrical engineering and information technology, to work closely with high-tech companies and government institutions. This ranges from individual internships to larger partnerships with projects such as O/OREOS.

===Jesuit School of Theology===

The Jesuit School of Theology is a Divinity School of Santa Clara University located in Berkeley, California, and one of the member colleges of the Graduate Theological Union. The school was founded in 1934 and merged with Santa Clara University in 2009. Prior to its merger with Santa Clara University, it was known as the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley.

===School of Law===
The School of Law was founded in 1911. The school offers the Juris Doctor degree. It also offers several double degree programs, including JD/Master of Business Administration and JD/Master of Science in Information Systems offered in conjunction with Santa Clara University&#x27;s Leavey School of Business.

The school offers Master of Laws degrees in Intellectual Property. Santa Clara Law features specialized curricular programs in High Tech and Intellectual Property law, International law, and Public Interest and Social Justice law.

=== Outreach programs ===

The Center for Sustainability hosts the Sustainability Liaison Network. The Network consists of over 150 Sustainability Liaisons that act as peer educators for sustainability and experts on how sustainability interplays with their respective groups. The Network is a resource and collaborative space for people who are interested in working/living more sustainably in their life on and off campus.

At the start of the 2015 academic year, Santa Clara University announced the creation of the Campus Sustainability Investment Fund (CSIF) as a revolving green fund to support sustainability projects on the SCU campus. Similar green funds at other college campuses have netted projects like installing motion-sense lights in classrooms or information campaigns to encourage the use of re-usable water bottles.

===Student government===

The Associated Student Government of Santa Clara University (ASGSCU) is Santa Clara University&#x27;s student government, an elected representative body for undergraduate students. The Associated Student Government is made up of the executive board, the Senate, Community Development, and the Judicial Branch.

===ROTC===
The Santa Clara US Army ROTC Battalion was established in 1861 due to the outbreak of the American Civil War. The unit was known as the Senior Company of Cadets. On September 10, 1863, Leland Stanford, then Governor of California, presented the Corps of Cadets with forty Springfield rifles, Model 1839. Today, the rifles are preserved in the University Museum. In return for his generosity, an armory was built in his honor in 1936. The armory was located southwest of the athletic field with the pistol range located below the stage of the auditorium.

Paul Locatelli, (former) president of Santa Clara, was a cadet at the university prior to his military service and his entrance into the Jesuit Order. Two Jesuits from Santa Clara, McKinnon and McQuaide, volunteered as chaplains in the Spanish–American War. Both were part of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s American Expeditionary Force that attacked San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898.

On February 2, 2010, the Santa Clara University ROTC &quot;Bronco Battalion&quot; won the MacArthur Award granted by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Cadet Command and the General Douglas MacArthur Foundation. In 2011 the Santa Clara ROTC once again won the MacArthur Award. The award, named after late General Douglas MacArthur, is granted to the year&#x27;s most excellent Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program among 33 battalions in the West Coast eighth Brigade. The award takes into consideration factors such as the battalion&#x27;s physical fitness, navigation skills, leadership, and success in commissioning officers after ROTC.

==Athletics==

Santa Clara participates in NCAA&#x27;s Division I and is a member of the West Coast Conference. It also participates in the West Water Polo Association for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s waterpolo. Santa Clara has 19 varsity sports (10 female, 9 male) and 18 club sports. The school colors are Santa Clara red and white (the school&#x27;s football team uniforms featured gold trim) and the team mascot is the &quot;Bronco,&quot; in past illustrations depicted as a &quot;bucking bronco.&quot; The school is renowned for its successful men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer programs in addition to historically successful men&#x27;s basketball teams. Santa Clara athletes have participated in 12 different Olympic Games.

===Athletic programs===
On February 2, 1993, Santa Clara president Paul Locatelli, S.J. announced the discontinuation of football at the university. For many years, Santa Clara participated in NCAA Division II in football, including reaching the NCAA Division II Championship semi-finals in 1980, because of an NCAA bylaw that allowed Division I schools to participate in lower divisions in football; however, the rule was changed in the mid-1990s, and the program was forced to move into Division I-AA (now FCS). Other teams were Division I, including the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer teams, both of which are past NCAA Division I National Champions. The basketball teams have made regular appearances in NCAA Division I playoffs.

* The women&#x27;s soccer team is consistently ranked in the top 25 nationally. Jerry Smith is the current head coach and led the program to a national title in the 2001 and 2020 NCAA Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship. The 2001 team was led by future United States Women&#x27;s National Soccer Team member Aly Wagner. Now married to Jerry Smith, Brandi Chastain was a member of the team&#x27;s 1988 and 1989 final four seasons. Actresses Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra win football scholarships to Santa Clara in the BAFTA nominated film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;. 
* The men&#x27;s basketball team has participated in the NCAA tournament on several occasions in past decades; the 1992–1993 team (led by future NBA MVP Steve Nash) was the second of seven No. 15 seeds to defeat Arizona the No. 2 seed in the tourney. On February 12, 2007, the men&#x27;s basketball team snapped Gonzaga&#x27;s 50-game home winning streak. At the time, it was the longest home winning streak in the NCAA.
* The women&#x27;s basketball team started in 1963. Their most notable accomplishment was winning the WNIT in 1991. In 2014, JR Payne was hired as the coach.
* The men&#x27;s baseball program holds the best single-season record in program history, 43–18–1, participated in the West I Regional at Fresno State. That 1988 team lost in the regional to a John Olerud–led Washington State Cougar team, twice. The team was led by current Long Beach State coach Troy Buckley, World Series Champion Ed Giovanola (Atlanta Braves 1996), Detroit Tiger first round pick Greg Gohr (1989), Kansas City Royal draft choice Victor Cole (1988), San Diego Padres draftee Matt Toole (1989), and Wes Bliven, a California Angel draft choice (1988). During the regular season, the 1988 squad snapped the 33 game winning streak of Fresno State. That team also knocked off nationally ranked teams such as Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Loyola Marymount University, and Pepperdine University. The coach of the 1988 team was John Oldham.
===Club sports programs===
Sports include boxing, cycling, equestrian, paintball, men&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s rugby, women&#x27;s rugby, men&#x27;s Ultimate, women&#x27;s Ultimate, men&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s ice hockey, sailing, Shotokan karate, swimming, triathlon, and women&#x27;s field hockey.

===Athletic facilities===
*Buck Shaw Stadium: Named after Lawrence T. &quot;Buck&quot; Shaw, the school&#x27;s football coach (1936–1942) and an inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame. Shaw later coached at the University of California, Berkeley, and with the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles, whom he guided to the NFL Championship in 1960. The stadium, longtime home of Bronco football and baseball, is now entirely dedicated to SCU&#x27;s soccer programs. The stadium was expanded to 10,300 seats after the 2007 season, and the soccer pitch and stadium facilities were modernized and improved. The stadium was temporarily home to Major League Soccer&#x27;s San Jose Earthquakes, who began their return to the league in April 2008.
*Leavey Center: Santa Clara University&#x27;s Arena is home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams and volleyball team. The Leavey Center is used as a concert venue and a hall for large lectures and speeches. The Leavey Center houses athletic department offices, a weight room, an academic center, team rooms, a video control room, lower and upper-level seating, and a suite that overlooks the court. The university&#x27;s pool is adjacent to the arena. The Leavey Center has a capacity of 4,500.
*SCU Softball Stadium; Located adjacent to Bellomy Field and the Leavey Center. Prior to the construction of this stadium, home games were played at West Valley College.

<text>The Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, is a four-movement work for orchestra written from 1898 to 1899 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.

The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Orchestral Society, conducted by the composer, in an original version which has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revised version was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 1 July 1900.

The symphony is characterized by its use of string and woodwind solos; the first movement opens with a long and discursive clarinet solo over a timpani roll; (this idea returns at the start of the fourth movement, fortissimo in the strings, with wind and brass chordal accompaniment), and subsequent movements include violin, viola, and cello solos.

Most performances of the work last between 35 and 40 minutes. Many conductors choose to slacken the speeds suggested by Sibelius&#x27;s metronome markings, particularly in the fast part (&quot;allegro energico&quot;) of the first movement. Because of this, many versions of the symphony are about 38–40 minutes long (the publishers suggest the duration is 40 minutes). In Osmo Vänskä&#x27;s recording of the work, released in 1997, the first movement is played at the metronome mark suggested by Sibelius and takes 9:42 (compared with the – minute duration of most other recordings).

==Instrumentation==
2 flutes (both doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (1st and 4th movements in A, 2nd and 3rd in B), 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, bass drum, cymbals, harp, and strings

==Movements==

Like most symphonies, it is in four movements:

The first recording was made by Robert Kajanus with the London Symphony Orchestra for the HMV label in May 1930.
