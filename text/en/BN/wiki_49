<text>Gillian Joanna Merron, Baroness Merron (born 12 April 1959) is a British politician and life peer serving as Chief Executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews since 2014. A member of the Labour Party, she has been serving as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Patient Safety, Women&#x27;s Health and Mental Health since 2024. She served as the shadow spokesperson for Health and Social Care from 2021 to 2024. She was previously Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1997 till 2010 and held several ministerial offices in the Blair and Brown governments.

==Early life and career==
Merron was born in Ilford, Essex to a Jewish family, and was educated at Wanstead High School in Wanstead in east London. She attended Lancaster University Management School, gaining a BSc (Hons) in Management Sciences. She worked in local government and as a NUPE (later UNISON) union official.

Merron joined the Labour Party in 1984. Before becoming an MP, Merron was the vice-chair for the regional Labour Party executive. She coordinated the shadow cabinet central region campaign in the 1992 general election and the 1994 European Parliament election.

==Parliamentary career==
Merron was made a prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) through an all-women shortlist, and was elected to the House of Commons in May 1997 with a majority of 11,130. From July 1998 to July 1999, she served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Doug Henderson as Minister of State for the Armed Forces and, from July 1999 to June 2001, she was PPS to Baroness Symons as Minister of State for Defence Procurement.

From June 2001 to October 2002, Merron served as PPS to John Reid as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. From October 2002 to May 2006, she was a government whip and was a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from December 2004. At the 2005 general election, her majority was 4,613.

Merron was appointed to the Department for Transport in May 2006, where she worked until the reshuffle on 29 June 2007, when she became Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office and the first ever minister of the East Midlands.

Following Peter Hain&#x27;s resignation on 24 January 2008, Merron was reshuffled again, becoming a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for International Development, leaving both of her previous roles. Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s next reshuffle on 5 October 2008, Merron was moved to the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office. A promotion to Minister of State for Public Health soon followed.

Merron followed the party whip in votes on equal gay rights, the hunting ban, foundation hospitals, a ban on smoking in public places, the Iraq war, preventative laws to stop climate change, and The Digital Economy Bill. She lost her seat to the Conservative candidate Karl McCartney in the 2010 general election. From 1997 until 2007, when Quentin Davies defected to the Labour Party, she had been Lincolnshire&#x27;s only Labour MP – and the first since Margaret Beckett had the seat from 1974 to 1979.

===Expenses===
Merron’s expenses as an MP were higher than average. She is one of 98 MPs who voted to support Conservative MP David Maclean&#x27;s bill to keep their expenses and correspondence secret.

On 19 June 2009, MPs&#x27; expenses were revealed (heavily edited) on the internet. Merron received criticism for purchasing a television, television stand, home theatre kit, and numerous other goods. She wrote on her website: &quot;The majority of claims I make directly pay for professional staff, office costs, communication with constituents, and travel. I do not have a second job, do not employ any family members or friends, nor have I taken the annual increase in ministerial salary.&quot;

In the aftermath of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, Sir Thomas Legg recommended that Gillian Merron repay £6,305.17. She repaid this amount in full.

==Post-parliamentary career==
Since her defeat at the 2010 general election, Merron has become Chair of Bus Users UK (formerly known as The National Federation of Bus Users).

In May 2014, it was announced that Merron would become Chief Executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews the following July. Since February 2013, she has served as a Vice-President of the Jewish Leadership Council. She served as external affairs officer on the board of Liberal Judaism from July 2012 to May 2014.

== House of Lords ==
In December 2020, it was announced Merron would be conferred a life peerage after a nomination by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer. She took her seat on 8 February 2021, and made her maiden speech on 13 May during that year&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Speech debate.

In the May shadow cabinet reshuffle, she was appointed to the Shadow Health Team. In the November shadow cabinet reshuffle, she became Shadow Culture Minister.

As part of the coronation of King Charles III, Baroness Merron presented the imperial mantle as a representative of the Jewish community.

==Personal life==
Merron, who is Vice-President of Liberal Judaism, is a member of the South London Liberal Synagogue and of the Lincolnshire Jewish Community.

<text>Laura Jean Moffatt (&quot;née&quot; Field; born 9 April 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Crawley from 1997 until 2010.

==Early life==
Born Laura Jean Field in Wandsworth, London in 1954, she came to Crawley new town with her parents in 1956. She was educated at Hazelwick School in Crawley, West Sussex before attending the Crawley College of Technology (now renamed Central Sussex College).

From 1975 until her election to the House of Commons in 1997, she worked as a state registered nurse at Crawley Hospital. She joined the Labour Party in 1979 and was elected to Crawley Borough Council in 1984, remaining as a councillor until 1997 and serving as the town&#x27;s mayor in 1990.

==Parliamentary career==
Moffatt stood in Crawley at the 1992 general election, but lost out to the sitting Conservative MP Nicholas Soames. For the following election she was again selected as the Labour candidate, though this time through an all-women shortlist and was successful in the 1997 and 2001 elections. 

From 1997 to 2001 she served as a member of the Defence Select Committee. Following her re-election in 2001, Moffatt served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine (2001–03) and to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs Charles Falconer (2003–05).

At the 2005 general election she was elected to the Commons on the smallest majority in the country with 37 votes, with her share of the vote falling by over 10 per cent from the 2001 general election result. After an epic count, and numerous re-counts, Moffatt broke down in tears after being returned to Parliament.

She served as (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions David Blunkett (2005); the Minister of State at the Department for Education and Skills Jacqui Smith (2005–06), and from 2006 served as the PPS to Alan Johnson initially as Secretary of State for Education and Skills and since 2007 as Secretary of State for Health. 

On 15 March 2010, Moffatt announced her intention to stand down at the 2010 General Election because the job had taken a toll on her family life.

==Personal life==
She married Colin Moffatt in 1975 in Crawley and they have three sons. She lives in the Broadfield area of the town.

In May 2009, Moffatt made the news during the MPs&#x27; expenses row for giving up her flat in London because she said that the &quot;annual cost did not sit comfortably with me&quot;, in her blog she wrote: &quot;I never travel first class when commuting and since getting rid of my flat I more often sleep on a camp bed in my office when the house sits late … and have only made one claim for personal goods in 2007/08, under £20, I think, to replace some towels.&quot;

Moffatt has said she has felt unsafe travelling late at night on trains as she has been the victim of a flasher on two occasions on a late night train. She has a tattoo on her left foot of a Labour rose with the number &#x27;37&#x27; in order to remind her of her slim majority in 2005.

<text>Lewis George Moonie, Baron Moonie (born 25 February 1947) is a British politician. He was the Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcaldy from 1987 to 2005.

==Early life==
He attended the Grove Academy in Dundee. He studied medicine at the Bute Medical School, University of St Andrews graduating with a MB ChB in 1970. In 1981 he graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a MSc in community medicine. He also became DPM in 1975, MRCPsych in 1979 and MFCM in 1984. From 1982 to 1986, he was a councillor on Fife Regional Council.

===Medical career===
From 1973 to 1975 he was a trainee registrar in psychiatry. From 1975 to 1980 he was a research clinical pharmacologist and a medical advisor in the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Edinburgh. From 1980 to 1984, he was a trainee in community medicine for the Fife Health Board, becoming a Community Medicine Specialist from 1984 to 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected at the 1987 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kirkcaldy, and served until he retired from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election. He served as a junior minister at the Ministry of Defence.

On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and on 22 June 2005 the peerage was gazetted as Baron Moonie, of Bennochy in Fife.

===The &#x27;Cash for Influence&#x27; Scandal===

In late-January 2009 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; involved Lord Moonie in a classic &#x27;sting operation&#x27;. Along with three other Labour peers, Lord Moonie was approached by a reporter. Of the four, Lord Moonie was the only one subsequently cleared by the House of Lords Sub-committee on Lords&#x27; Interests.

In the newspaper sting, &quot;Moonie said he would contact Healey and offered to identify people who could put down an amendment.&quot; He quoted an annual fee for his assistance of £30,000. Lord Moonie is quoted as saying &quot;I did not agree to amend the legislation. I agreed to seek to help to find a way of trying to amend the legislation.&quot;

The House of Lords Sub-committee on Lords&#x27; Interests was asked to report on the matter. It found that &quot;on the standard of proof that we have set, we do not find that Lord Moonie expressed a clear willingness to breach the Code by promoting amendments on behalf of lobbyists in return for payment.&quot; 

The Lords&#x27; Privileges Committee considered the sub-committee&#x27;s report. It published its findings on 14 May 2009. It agreed that Lord Moonie had not breached the code.

==Personal life==
He married Sheila Ann Burt on 28 December 1971. They have two sons.

<doc id="435627" wikidata="Q6759736" url="?curid=435627" title="Margaret Moran">
<text>Margaret Mary Moran (born 24 April 1955) is a former Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Moran was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton South from the 1997 general election to 2010. In November 2012, jurors at Southwark Crown Court ruled that she had falsified her parliamentary expenses; she had been unable to stand trial because of mental health issues, but the case was nevertheless heard without her. Her fraudulent claims totalled more than £53,000, the highest amount by any politician in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal.

== Early life ==
Moran was born in Bethnal Green, to Irish parents Patrick and Mary (née Murphy). She went to St Ursula&#x27;s High School (now St Ursula&#x27;s Convent School), a Roman Catholic girls&#x27; school in Greenwich, and then to St Mary&#x27;s College (now St Mary&#x27;s University College), a Roman Catholic college in Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. She subsequently attended the University of Birmingham, gaining a Bachelor of Social Science degree in geography and sociology in 1978. She also attended Hackney College.

==Before Parliament==
Moran initially worked as a teacher. In 1984, she became a local councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham; later she became leader of the council between 1993 and 1995. At the same time, Moran stood in the 1992 general election in Carshalton and Wallington, finishing in third place. Moran was also the director of &quot;Housing for Women&#x27; a housing association, national president of the housing branch of the NALGO trade union, vice chair of the Association of London Authorities and vice chair and chair of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities.

==Parliamentary career==
For the 1997 election, she was selected to stand for Labour in Luton South through an all-women shortlist. At the election she was elected, gaining the seat from the Conservatives.

Following her re-election in the 2001 election she was promoted to the position of assistant whip attached to HM Treasury between 2003 and 2005. While serving as a whip, Moran was obliged to vote along with the government line, and did so. She was re-elected for a third term in the 2005 election, with a reduced majority. There had been significant opposition among Luton&#x27;s large Muslim population to her support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Moran supported plans to negotiate with Spain over the status of Gibraltar, describing Gibraltar as &quot;effectively an outpost colony within a major European partner&quot;, although she accepted that any change must have the consent of Gibraltarians. From 2006, Moran was a member of the Home Affairs Committee, where she took an interest in helping female victims of domestic violence and in issues of child protection. She was for a time chairwoman of the All-Party Group on Domestic Violence and worked with Women&#x27;s Aid to launch online projects such as WomenSpeak and KidSpeak.

Moran&#x27;s interest in child protection led her to go to the Internet Governance Forum at Rio de Janeiro in November 2007 and she was involved in the launch of the UK Internet Governance Forum. on 6 March 2008. Moran became a member of the Hansard Society Commission on the Scrutiny of Parliament. She also worked with the Fawcett Society producing a publication on women&#x27;s participation on the internet.

==Expense fraud==

Moran&#x27;s claims for expenses 2004–05 were £73,198, higher than those of Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins. However, it was not until May 2009 that the full details of her claims were revealed. These caused Moran to announce she would not stand in the 2010 general election, and she was later barred from doing so by the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. Speaking in Parliament, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown described Moran&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;.

===Unsolicited mail and stationery costs===
Moran had particularly high spending on stationery and postage and on staff costs.

In the run up to the 2005 general election, Moran sent out thousands of unsolicited letters to her constituents. Following a complaint to the Commons authorities about one of the letters, the Assistant Serjeant at Arms Mark Harvey said the letter was &quot;a reasonable solicited response&quot;, but was against the spirit of the regulations. He went on to say, &quot;Having discussed this with Ms Moran, I&#x27;m confident that there will be no repetition in future.&quot; The regulations have since changed and there is now a limit on the postage costs an MP can claim for.

=== Second home allowance ===
On 8 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed Moran spent £22,500 of taxpayers&#x27; money treating dry rot at her and her partner&#x27;s seaside house in Southampton, about 100 miles from her Luton South constituency, only days after switching her &quot;second home&quot; to his Southampton property. 
Moran&#x27;s partner had worked in Southampton for 20 years when the claim was made. 
The parliamentary authorities were concerned that the work broke the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rules, 
but advised that it was permissible on three occasions. 
The &quot;Telegraph&quot; said the expenses &quot;appear to be among the most questionable of any MP,&quot; and the BBC said the claims caused &quot;widespread public anger&quot;. 
Moran had previously switched her second-home allowance from Luton to London and renovated both.
When telephoned and questioned by Rosa Prince from the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; she said &quot;How dare you&quot; and ended the call.

On 10 May 2009, she defended her expenses claim in an interview with Andrew Sinclair on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Politics Show&quot;, saying she had kept to the rules. According to Moran, &quot;You could argue that I use it to be able to sustain my work. Any MP has to have a proper family life, they have to have support of their partner.&quot;

On 12 May, just two days after defending using taxpayers&#x27; money on her third home, she agreed to repay it, albeit in instalments. In a statement she asserted: &quot;I do understand constituents&#x27; anger at the current fees regime, which is why I will be repaying the full amount claimed for my home in Southampton.&quot; On the same day, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that she used £1,104.34 from her incidental office expenses to pay for &quot;furniture for her house&quot;. Despite the repayment, Moran has refused to apologise for her actions and still claims to have done nothing wrong.

Moran&#x27;s local constituency party backed her following revelations over her claims, but asked her to explain her actions. The then chairman, Mahmood Hussain, described her conduct as &quot;very questionable&quot;.

===Other expense claims===
On 14 May, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Moran had billed the taxpayer almost £4,000 in respect of an employment tribunal case brought by a former member of her staff. The House of Commons fees office agreed that the bill could be paid out of her staffing budget.

===Outcomes===
On 18 May 2009, television presenter Esther Rantzen announced that she would stand against Moran in Luton South as an &quot;anti-sleaze&quot; candidate. Rantzen launched her campaign in July 2009, but lost her deposit in the 2010 general election. On 28 May 2009, Moran announced that she would not stand at the forthcoming general election, citing the &quot;bruising effect upon my friends, my family and my health.&quot; Moran also said &quot;The House of Commons fees office gave me incorrect advice upon which I acted. They have now apologised.&quot; Subsequently, she was barred from standing in the next general election by a disciplinary panel of the Labour Party.

In November 2009, Moran&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;Luton &amp; Dunstable Express&quot;, launched a &quot;Get Moran Out Now&quot; campaign on its front page. It called for her to resign immediately rather than continuing to claim expenses and receiving a big payoff and large pension by remaining in her seat until the general election. The newspaper was critical of Moran&#x27;s failure to apologise or explain her conduct to her constituents, saying that she had &quot;behaved disgracefully&quot; and had &quot;fleeced taxpayers quite enough&quot;.

In December 2009, Gavin Shuker was selected as the Labour candidate to replace Moran and retained the seat in the general election. He has said that her various expense claims could not be defended. &quot;The Guardian&quot; named Moran as one of the newsmakers of the year as a result of her role in the expenses scandal.

After the expense revelations broke, Moran stopped attending Parliament claiming that the stress of the expenses scandal had worsened an existing medical condition. Liberal Democrat candidate Qurban Hussain suggested she had gone into hiding, &quot;leaving her constituents completely unrepresented while continuing to draw her generous salary&quot;.

===Prosecution===
On 6 September 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that Moran would face 21 criminal charges: 15 of false accounting and six of forgery. She was summoned to appear at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on 19 September 2011 where she was reported to have wept throughout the hearing.
Moran was sent to Southwark Crown Court for trial on 30 October 2011; she failed to appear and a &#x27;not guilty&#x27; plea was entered by default in her absence. A date for the trial of an issue was set for 18 April with a directions hearing set for 15 December. On 15 December 2011, Mr Justice Saunders was informed that psychiatrists considered Moran unfit to plead with the defence contending that the trial should therefore not proceed. In April 2012, after receiving evidence from a number of psychiatrists, the judge determined that Moran was not fit to plead in person—the proceedings were allowed to proceed in her absence. On 13 November 2012, the trial jury found she had committed the acts alleged.
In December 2012, she was sentenced to a two-year supervision and treatment order, the judge commenting that although some might feel she had &quot;got away with it&quot;, the court had acted &quot;in accordance with the law of the land and on the basis of the evidence that it hears&quot;.

=== Attempt to remove expenses scandal from Wikipedia page ===
In 2010 it was reported by &quot;the Daily Telegraph&quot; that an IP address associated with the Parliamentary estate had been discovered attempting to remove information on Margaret Moran&#x27;s role in the expenses scandal from her Wikipedia page. As the edits were made from a parliamentary computer, the user received a warning from Wikipedia.

==&quot;Dispatches&quot; lobbyist investigation==

In March 2010, Moran was one of the MPs involved in offering influential political lobbying for financial reward in a sting operation set up by the Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme. The MPs were secretly filmed discussing how they could assist the interests of a business which had been invented by the programme-makers. In the film, Moran appears to claim to be able to help modify laws on immigration in order to boost the business interests of the fake company. She also claimed that she could call on a &quot;girls&#x27; gang&quot; of female ministers to help, and yet, while she appeared to be enthusiastically courting the fake company, half an hour after the meeting her office told a reporter that she was unavailable to do any work on behalf of her constituents because she was &quot;not very well at the moment&quot;. Moran claimed that &quot;This meeting was the beginning of an attempt to rebuild my life&quot;.

On 22 March, she was suspended from holding office in the Labour Party. Labour leader Gordon Brown indicated that there would not be an investigation into the conduct of Moran and the other Labour MPs filmed in the programme.

==Improper use of House of Commons stationery==
In May 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; alleged Moran mis-used stationery to support eQuality Networks Ltd (EQN) T/A eQuality Network, a non-profit group which claims to help impoverished communities. Moran is currently an associate (listed as Margaret Booker). Moran repeatedly used House of Commons headed paper to write letters in support of EQN, without disclosing her involvement with the company. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; obtained copies of letters written by Moran supporting eQuality Networks&#x27; funding bids and personal invitations to eQuality Networks events. Moran denied committing the offence and claimed her husband &quot;has no part in the running of the organisation&quot;.

In 2007 a Spanish Court ruled that she had illegally blocked a right of way at her holiday home in Carataunas, Spain, by installing a gate and digging up the path with an excavator. She was ordered to make the area as it was. She used House of Commons headed paper during the dispute, including a note written in Spanish and English which said &quot;Please note – this road is private &amp; closed. Please remove your motorcycle from our land. Moran family.&quot;

==eQuality Networks==
In 2007 the &quot;Guardian&quot; claimed Moran had been exploiting interns insisting they work for the company eQuality Networks rather than doing political work. Similar allegations were levelled at Moran in 2009 following an investigation by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

In 2009 it emerged that one of Moran&#x27;s employees at eQuality Networks had successfully nominated her to the shortlist of MP of the Year at the Women in Public Life Awards, describing her as a &quot;forward thinking, modern day suffragette&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2009 she married her long-time partner of 30 years, Michael Booker, who lives and works at the University of Southampton as a safety adviser. They have no children. Her personal interests include céilidhs, visiting historical sites and walking.

<doc id="435629" wikidata="Q7683038" url="?curid=435629" title="Tanglewood Festival Chorus">
<text>The Tanglewood Festival Chorus, directed by James Burton, is a chorus which performs with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops in major choral works. The Tanglewood Festival Chorus (TFC) was organized in the spring of 1970, when founding conductor John Oliver (1939 – 2018) became director of vocal and choral activities at the Tanglewood Music Center, the summer home of the BSO. Originally formed for performances at the BSO&#x27;s summer home at the behest of the BSO&#x27;s conductor designate Seiji Ozawa, the Tanglewood Festival Chorus is the official chorus of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra year-round, performing in Boston, New York and Tanglewood. 

==History==
In 1970, John Oliver proposed to the management of the Boston Symphony Orchestra that he would create a permanent chorus for the orchestra, which had relied on various area choruses for much of its history. In Oliver&#x27;s words, &quot;To my utter amazement now--I wasn&#x27;t amazed then, because I was just a brash young man--they said, &#x27;Go! Form a chorus.&#x27;&quot; The TFC&#x27;s first concert was a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony at Symphony Hall in April 1970 when Leonard Bernstein substituted for William Steinberg who had fallen ill. Bernstein had been engaged to conduct the Ninth as the closing concert of the Tanglewood season that summer and expressed a preference to conduct it at Symphony Hall rather than Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony which Steinberg had been scheduled to conduct.

In December 1994 the chorus joined Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra for tour performances in Hong Kong and Japan, the chorus&#x27; first performance overseas.

In February 1998, singing from the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, the chorus represented the Americas when Seiji Ozawa led the Winter Olympics Orchestra with six choruses on five continents, all linked by satellite, in the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony to close the Opening Ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics. The chorus joined Plácido Domingo, Susan Graham, and Yo-Yo Ma in performing at the funeral service for Senator Edward Kennedy on August 28, 2009.

On March 10, 2015, the Boston Symphony Orchestra announced that Oliver would retire as conductor of the TFC at the end of the summer Tanglewood season. The BSO conducted a chorus conductor search, and announced on February 2, 2017 that British conductor James Burton had been appointed as the TFC&#x27;s second permanent conductor.

==Performance practice==
The full roster includes over 200 singers who volunteer their time and talents. Subsets of the group are selected by Mr. Burton to meet the needs of the repertoire being performed. Typically a performance will involve 90-120 singers. During the Christmas Pops season, approximately 50 singers take the stage for each show. To meet the needs of the BSO, members of the TFC appear in 9-11 Christmas performances each.

==Recordings==
The TFC has also collaborated with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on numerous recordings, including Mahler&#x27;s Second, Third, and Eighth symphonies, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, and Bartók&#x27;s &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot;, on Philips; Mendelssohn&#x27;s complete incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s Pavane, on Deutsche Grammophon; and Berlioz&#x27;s Requiem and &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, Fauré&#x27;s Requiem, and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, on RCA Victor Red Seal. Also for Philips, with the BSO under Bernard Haitink&#x27;s direction, the chorus has recorded Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; and Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Nänie&quot;. They can also be heard on the RCA Victor disc &quot;A Splash of Pops&quot;, as well as on three Christmas albums — &quot;Joy to the World&quot; on Sony Classical and &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; on Philips, both with John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra, and &quot;Holiday Pops&quot; on RCA Victor with Keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops Orchestra. The Tanglewood Festival Chorus can also be heard on the soundtracks of four movies, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind ~ Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Mystic River&quot;. James Taylor&#x27;s wife was a member of the chorus, and her voice can also be heard as part of a &quot;virtual&quot; backing group for his 2007 UK tour.

On February 19, 2009, the BSO announced the launch of a new series of recordings on their own label, BSO Classics. Three of the four initial releases, all recorded live in concert, feature the Tanglewood Festival Chorus: William Bolcom&#x27;s 8th Symphony (which the TFC premiered in 2008), Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot;, and Ravel&#x27;s complete &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;. The 2009 Ravel recording was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album in the nominations announced on December 2, 2009, and won the award for Best Orchestral Performance on January 31, 2010. 

In 2010, BSO Classics released &quot;Tanglewood Festival Chorus: 40th Anniversary&quot;, a collection of the group&#x27;s unaccompanied recordings from its Tanglewood Prelude performances between 1998 and 2005.

In October 2023, the BSO released the final installment of an eight-year-long cycle of album releases on Deutsche Grammophon featuring the complete symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich, which included Symphonies 2, 3, 12 and 13. The recording featured the Tanglewood Festival Chorus on Symphonies 2, 3 and 13.

<text>Carol Jean Mountford (née Newton; born 12 January 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Colne Valley from 1997 until she retired from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==

Mountford was born in Crewe, the daughter of an engine driver. She attended Crewe Grammar School for Girls (which became King&#x27;s Grove High School in the late 1970s and The Oaks Academy in 2016) on Buchan Grove in Crewe. At Crewe and Alsager College (now the Alsager Campus of Manchester Metropolitan University), she obtained a DipHE and a BA in Philosophy, Psychology and Sociology in 1988 as a mature student. Mountford worked as a civil servant benefits clerk for 10 years then as a researcher and training officer for a further 10 years prior to entering Parliament. She was also active in the CPSA (which became the PCS in 1998), with joint membership of the IPCS (Institute of Professional and Civil Servants) as a regional and national officer.

==Political career==
In 1986, whilst working at the Crewe Jobcentre, Mountford stood as the Liberal Party candidate in a Cheshire County Council by-election in Crewe Central ward on 18 September. From 1992 to 1996 she was a Labour Party member of Sheffield City Council, representing Hillsborough ward.

Mountford was selected as a Labour candidate through an all-women shortlist. She was first elected at the 1997 general election for Colne Valley and served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Des Browne MP.

She retired from the Commons at the 2010 general election. The Colne Valley seat was then won by the Conservative Party candidate, Jason McCartney. Although Labour fell to third place that election, they would regain the seat seven years later.

==Controversies==
Mountford was suspended from the House of Commons for five working days in 1998 for leaking a Social Security Select Committee report to the government. The House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee stated that although there were some mitigating circumstances for her behaviour, she had in fact &quot;aggravated her original offence by denying responsibility&quot;. In addition to the suspension Mountford was forced to apologise for her conduct.

As a result of the controversy Mountford also resigned from the Social Security Select Committee.

==Personal life==
Mountford married her third husband Ian Leedham in July 1995 in Sheffield; she has a son and daughter.

<doc id="435633" wikidata="Q578990" url="?curid=435633" title="Meg Munn">
<text>Margaret Patricia Munn (born 1959) served as a Labour MP for Sheffield Heeley from 2001 to 2015. After leaving Parliament, she has served in a variety of roles across the public sector, academia and international bodies.

==Before Parliament==
Munn went to Mundella Primary School on Mundella Place in Norton Woodseats, then the comprehensive Rowlinson School on Dyche Lane in Jordanthorpe, Sheffield from 1970 to 1977, (the site became Norton College Campus of Sheffield College, but the old school transferred to Meadowhead School across the road in 1988).

She studied languages at the University of York receiving a BA (Hons) in 1981, later gaining an MA in social work at the University of Nottingham in 1986. Munn later gained a Certificate and Diploma in Management Studies from the Open University and in 2012 became the first MP to be awarded Chartered Manager status by the Chartered Management Institute, subsequently becoming a Fellow of the Institute.

She worked as a social work Assistant for Berkshire County Council from 1981–84; as a social worker for Nottinghamshire County Council from 1986–90, becoming a senior social worker from 1990–92; as a district manager for Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council Social Services from 1992–96, as a child services manager for Wakefield Metropolitan Borough Council from 1996–99; and assistant director of City of York Council Children&#x27;s Services from 1999–2000.

Munn was on the Barnsley Regional Board of the Co-operative Group, the UK&#x27;s largest co-operative society, and the management committee of Wortley Hall, a national co-operative conference centre. She was elected President of the 2006 Co-operative Congress She is a member of USDAW, the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party.

==Member of Parliament==

Munn was Patron of Heeley City Farm, Patron of Home-Start Sheffield and Patron of Sheffield Young Carers.

As a backbencher, Munn served on the Education and Skills Select Committee 2001–03, and the Procedure Select Committee 2001–02. She was closely involved with the Adoption and Children Act 2002; changing national regulations to allow Local Authorities to register body-piercing studios; supporting small business, including co-operative and mutual enterprises; encouraging women to go into business; and House of Lord&#x27;s reform. She also served as Chair of the Women&#x27;s Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party (2003–05) and Chair of the Parliamentary Co-operative Group (2004–05). She has been Vice-Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, a vice-chair of the group Progress and Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Voice group.

Munn served as Parliamentary Private Secretary at the Department for Education and Skills from July 2003 to 2004 and then continuing to be a PPS at the department attached to the Minister of State for Education until May 2005. She was Minister for Women and Equality, based at the Department for Communities and Local Government from May 2005 until June 2007. Munn introduced civil partnerships in the UK in December 2005. She was responsible for the Equality Act 2006, and involved in the Work and Families Act 2006. She established the Equality and Human Rights Commission). She was not able to take a ministerial salary, as the maximum number of paid ministers, had been appointed. This was criticised by the opposition.

Munn argued strongly in support of the coalition government&#x27;s plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian Government in the wake of a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta in the vote on 29 August 2013, contrary to the Labour Party&#x27;s position. She was one of four Labour MPs who did not vote against the government motion, which the government lost. Ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate Syria&#x27;s chemical weapons.

On 29 June 2007, Munn was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Amongst her responsibilities were Overseas Territories, South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Caribbean and Central America. She stood down from the government in October 2008.

She was Chair of the UK government-funded Westminster Foundation for Democracy from October 2008 to July 2010, and Vice-Chair July 2010 to October 2012.
With the Foundation, Munn worked on the Middle East and North Africa, leading workshops and mentoring MPs on Egypt, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Morocco and Jordan.

On 24 January 2014 she advised Heeley Constituency Labour Party that she had decided not to seek reselection to stand at the 2015 general election.

==Expenses claims==

On 26 May 2009, Meg Munn was criticised after &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published an article reporting that her husband, who was employed part-time as her parliamentary aide, was paid more than £5,000 from public funds over four years for professional services in connection with their personal taxation affairs to at least five government ministers, and his wife. The article reported that when Munn published her receipt for these services on her website, she blacked out the portion indicating that her husband was the beneficiary of her expenses. Munn said on her website that the blacking out had been done by the House of Commons, which deleted details considered to be a personal security risk; her husband&#x27;s name was deleted for one year, presumably in error, but published for three other years. Munn said that neither she nor her staff had redacted details.

Labour MPs argued that tax advice relating to their work as MPs was a legitimate expense, and the Labour Party issued a statement supporting this view. Business groups expressed concerns that MPs might be being &quot;treated differently&quot; to other taxpayers, saying, &quot;If entrepreneurs sought professional tax advice, they had to pay the fee themselves and offset it against any profits on which they paid tax&quot;. Munn was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expense details secret.

==Post-Parliamentary career==
From August 2015 to July 2023 Munn served as pro-chancellor and Deputy Chair, and from July 2023 to April 2024 as Interim Chair, of the Board of Governors of Sheffield Hallam University. She is currently the Senior Independent Director of the Phone-paid Services Authority. Previously she was Chair of the British Council&#x27;s Society Advisory Group (2017–2021) and a Non-Executive Director of the Esh Group (2015–2018).

She is also an international governance consultant with a focus on parliamentary processes, political party development, gender mainstreaming and women&#x27;s leadership. She works with organisations such as Global Partners Governance, Inter-Parliamentary Union, United Nations Development Programme, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, UN Women, the Kenya Women Parliamentarians&#x27; Association (KEWOPA) and the Iraq Foundation to support democracy building in a number of countries. She is author of &quot;Participatory Gender Audits of Parliaments: a Step by Step Guidance Document&quot; (2022) and Lead drafter for the &quot;Compendium of Good Practises for Advancing Women&#x27;s Political Participation in the OSCE Region&quot; (2016), Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.

She supports women to consider non-traditional careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and construction. She has been a Patron of the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society and has edited &quot;Building the future: women in construction&quot;, Smith Institute (2014) and &quot;Unlocking Potential: perspectives on women in science, engineering &amp; technology&quot;, Smith Institute (2011).

She was the first independent Chair of the Church of England&#x27;s National Safeguarding Panel and then the acting Chair of the Independent Safeguarding Board. She resigned from both positions on 12 July 2023.

<text>Andrew John Bower Mitchell (born 23 March 1956) is a British politician who was Shadow Foreign Secretary from July to November 2024 and served as Deputy Foreign Secretary between February and July 2024. He was also Minister of State for Development and Africa between October 2022 and July 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sutton Coldfield since 2001 and previously served as the MP for Gedling from 1987 to 1997. Mitchell served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Development from 2010 to 2012 and then briefly as Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons in late 2012.

Mitchell studied History at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was elected President of the Cambridge Union in 1978. He was elected to the House of Commons for Gedling in Nottinghamshire at the 1987 general election. He served in the second Major government as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 1994 to 1995 and as a junior minister at the Department of Social Security from 1995 to 1997. Mitchell lost his seat to the Labour Party&#x27;s Vernon Coaker at the 1997 general election. In 2001, he contested Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, a safe seat for the Conservatives, and was returned to Parliament. Mitchell was appointed to the Shadow cabinet in 2005 as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. In this role, he founded Project Umubano, a Conservative Party social action project in Rwanda and Sierra Leone in central and west Africa.

Under the coalition government of David Cameron, he served as Secretary of State for International Development from 2010 to 2012. In the September 2012 cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed chief whip. Amid public pressure due to the &quot;Plebgate&quot; scandal, Mitchell resigned from the government the following month, and returned to the backbenches. In 2022, after serving on the backbenches for 10 years, Mitchell made a return to government as Minister of State for Development and Africa following the appointment of Rishi Sunak as prime minister. He was appointed to the honorific title of Deputy Foreign Secretary in April 2024. After the defeat of the Conservative party in the 2024 general election, Mitchell became Shadow Foreign Secretary in the Shadow Cabinet of Rishi Sunak.

==Early life and career==
Mitchell was born at Hampstead in north London, the son of Sir David Bower Mitchell, a future Conservative MP of 33 years, and Government Minister. He was educated at Ashdown House School and Rugby School, where—as a self-confessed &quot;stern disciplinarian&quot;—he earned the nickname &quot;Thrasher&quot;.

In February 1975, he joined the Royal Tank Regiment as a second lieutenant on a Short Service Limited Commission (a commission designed for teenagers applying to Oxford or Cambridge University after leaving the sixth form), spending time in Cyprus where his unit was carrying out peacekeeping duties. In October of that year, he transferred to the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve. He resigned his commission on 9 February 1977.

He went to the University of Cambridge, where he read History at Jesus College. He was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association in the Michaelmas Term of 1977. He served as President of the Cambridge Union 1978–79, after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1978, later proceeding to Master of Arts.

Mitchell worked for Lazard, the investment bank, where he worked with British companies seeking large-scale overseas contracts.

==Political career==

=== Early career (1983–2005) ===
Mitchell was the only Conservative member of Islington Health Authority (IHA) in north London during the 1980s and, in that capacity, he called for the IHA to make greater use of competitive tendering in the allocation of service contracts.

After unsuccessfully contesting Sunderland South at the 1983 general election, Mitchell entered Parliament in 1987 at the age of 31 as MP for Gedling, Nottinghamshire, serving in the House of Commons concurrently with his father until 1997. In 1988, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he became PPS to William Waldegrave, who was Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1990, he became PPS to John Wakeham, who was Secretary of State for Energy. In 1992, under John Major, he became Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party, and in the same year was appointed as an Assistant Government Whip. In 1993, he became a Government Whip. In 1995, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security, a position he held until 1997.

Mitchell lost his Commons seat with Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour victory at the 1997 election. He was returned to Parliament at the 2001 election as the MP for Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham. He held no shadow ministerial or organisational position under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith, but in November 2003, under new leader Michael Howard, he became Shadow Economic Affairs Minister. In 2004, he became Shadow Home Office Minister, primarily dealing with police matters.

=== Shadow International Development Secretary (2005–2010) ===
In May 2005, Mitchell was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. Following Howard&#x27;s decision to stand down as leader following the Conservatives&#x27; 2005 general election defeat, Mitchell ran the unsuccessful leadership campaign of David Davis, but retained his Shadow Cabinet position under the winner of the leadership election, David Cameron.

====Project Umubano====
Mitchell led groups of Conservative volunteers from the professions in social development projects in Rwanda for three consecutive summers, from 2007 to 2009, as part of Project Umubano, and kept a detailed diary of their activities and experiences. The volunteers focused on five areas: health, education, justice, the private sector, and a community centre construction project. In 2008, Mitchell himself taught English to over a thousand Rwandan primary school teachers. It was during one of these trips that Mitchell and his aides are reported to have verbally abused one of the volunteers, a student journalist who had circulated a draft newspaper article she had written stressing the positives of the project, but also pointing out some problems with its operation. The journalist, Lucy Kinder, claimed Mitchell texted her father, a friend from Mitchell&#x27;s university days: &quot;They [his aides] are threatening her with physical violence and I can&#x27;t say I blame them&quot;.

====Views on Gaza====
Mitchell expressed support for the idea of a televised appeal for Gaza on the BBC in 2009, a subject which had aroused much controversy on both sides of the argument. He said that, while the matter was ultimately for the BBC to decide, &quot;We believe that they should allow the broadcast to proceed so that the British public, who have proved themselves so generous during recent emergencies in the Congo and Burma, can make their own judgement on the validity of the appeal&quot;.

Following the resignation of Baroness Warsi during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Mitchell criticised repeated Israeli attacks on UN schools and called for an arms embargo, warning that the misery suffered by an &quot;enormous number of innocent people&quot; was poisoning attitudes.

=== International Development Secretary (2010–2012) ===

Following the general election and formation of the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition in May 2010, he became Secretary of State for International Development.

Mitchell travelled to countries in need of aid. He visited Pakistan during the floods in 2010 and returned the following year. He also visited Haiti, to see the effects of the earthquake, and Somalia and Libya in 2011. He also addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 2010 to press the case for greater support for the developing world, strongly criticised the developed world for failing in its responsibilities towards it, and announced that Britain would double its aid contribution to Pakistan.Both in Opposition and Government, Mitchell asserted the need for transparency and value for money in British aid contributions to the developing world, with resources concentrated on the world&#x27;s poorest and most troubled countries.
During the 2011 Battle of Tripoli, Mitchell said that the UK had learned from Iraq and had laid the groundwork for a post-Gaddafi Libya. While emphasising that the transition should be Libyan-led, he said that Libya&#x27;s allies had outlined steps to ensure a smooth transition. He added, &quot;We have made clear that there should be no revenge attacks,&quot; and, &quot;Libyans have to work together for a new Libya. They should keep in place the sinews of security. The National Transitional Council (NTC) in Benghazi has good informal connections with security officials in Tripoli and has told them: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got a job, please help us keep stability&#x27;.&quot; He added that &quot;Divisions between the rebels groups are overstated. The way the National Transitional Council has reached out gives us some confidence.&quot;

Mitchell accepted that a smaller aid budget might have meant fewer cuts elsewhere, but insisted that development projects also helped protect Britain. &quot;Our security is not just provided by soldiers and tanks and fighter jets, it is also provided by training the police in Afghanistan, by building up governance structures in the Middle East and by getting girls into school in the Horn of Africa,&quot; he said, &quot;Those things are all part of what makes us safer.&quot;

====Praise in debate====
On 1 July 2010, at the end of a debate on global poverty in the House of Commons, the Minister of State for International Development, Alan Duncan, quoted the journalist Jon Snow as having said, &quot;Andrew Mitchell is unquestionably the best prepared Secretary of State – nobody has waited longer in the wings and everyone in the sector knows of his commitment to the sector&quot;.

====Aid transparency====

Both in Opposition, and later as Secretary of State for International Development, Mitchell repeatedly asserted the need for transparency in aid donations to other countries, with contributions fully accounted for and published, and announced his intention for Britain to lead the world in this transparency. He made clear that value for money in aid donations was of critical importance and provided a guarantee that British legislation would be amended to ensure that Britain&#x27;s aid contributions would be maintained at 0.7 per cent of UK GNI (Gross National Income) by 2013. He also asked former international envoy and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown to conduct a review of the UK&#x27;s response to international humanitarian disasters, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, to see whether lessons could be learned from them.

====Aid to Rwanda====
On his final day as International Development Secretary, Mitchell authorised the payment of £16 million of previously suspended aid to Rwanda, half of Britain&#x27;s annual aid to Rwanda. The aid had been suspended in July, along with other governments&#x27; aid, over concerns about Rwanda&#x27;s alleged support of the rebel March 23 Movement in east Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mitchell&#x27;s successor stopped further aid payments as Rwanda had breached agreements, and following the publication of a United Nations Security Council investigators&#x27; report which provided evidence that Rwanda had supplied guns, money and recruits to the rebels contrary to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1807, and engaged directly in combat to help the rebels capture territory.

The International Development Select Committee launched an inquiry into the suspending, then subsequent authorisation, of budget support to Rwanda. On 30 November 2012 the committee published its report criticising Mitchell for restoring the funding, stating &quot;We do not understand how [Mitchell] reached the conclusion that support for the M23 had ceased&quot;, which was one of the three conditions that the Prime Minister had set for the resumption of aid.

=== Chief Whip and &quot;Plebgate&quot; (2012) ===

In September 2012, Mitchell was appointed Government Chief Whip in David Cameron&#x27;s first significant Cabinet reshuffle.

On the evening of 19 September, Mitchell allegedly swore when a police officer told him to dismount from a bicycle and exit Downing Street through the pedestrian gate rather than the main gate. The leaked official police log of the incident stated that Mitchell said &quot;Best you learn your fucking place. You don&#x27;t run this fucking government...You&#x27;re fucking plebs&quot;. The allegations became known in the media as &quot;Plebgate&quot;.

Mitchell&#x27;s alleged comments attracted strong criticism from some branches of the Police Federation, and from police officers in general, not least because they came on the day after the murder of two police officers in Manchester.

In response to the allegations, Mitchell apologised, but disputed many of the details of the accusations, in particular that he had used the word &quot;pleb&quot;. He later resigned on 19 October.

In December 2012, CCTV evidence was published in the media which appeared to contradict the police account of the incident, along with evidence that an email corroborating the police account and purporting to be sent by a member of the public to their MP was actually sent by an off-duty police officer who was not at the scene. Additionally, a claim by Police Federation officers from the West Midlands Police who met Mitchell that he refused to give his side of events was contradicted by a recording of the meeting, made by Mitchell himself, and subsequently released to the media. The Metropolitan Police investigation of both the leak of the police log and the discrepancies between it and other accounts was known as Operation Alice.

Mitchell strongly disputed the police account of the incident in statements to the media, and in an article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; alleged the police officers were involved in a &quot;cynical smear campaign&quot;.

Operation Alice resulted in one police officer, Constable Keith Wallis, being charged with misconduct in a public office, for sending an email in which he falsely claimed to be an ordinary member of the public who had witnessed the alleged incident from the public footpath outside the Downing Street gates. On 10 January 2014, Wallis pleaded guilty to the charge. Wallis was dismissed from the police force and three other police officers who were involved in aspects of &#x27;Plebgate&#x27; were dismissed for gross misconduct. Following Wallis&#x27; conviction, Mitchell received a public apology from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and fellow MPs called for him to be reappointed to the cabinet.

Mitchell launched a civil libel case against UK newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, which had first published reports of the affair. He was countersued by PC Toby Rowland, the officer who had been on duty at the Downing Street gate. On 27 November 2014, Mr Justice Mitting ruled against Mitchell, describing his behaviour as childish and saying: &quot;I am satisfied at least on the balance of probabilities that Mr Mitchell did speak the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same including the politically toxic word pleb&quot;. In consequence, Mitchell lost the libel cases against both &quot;The Sun&quot; and PC Rowland and became liable for both parties&#x27; costs, which were estimated at £2m. Mitchell said he was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot;. On 30 January 2015, court papers revealed that News Group newspapers offered a deal on 19 September 2014 which would have allowed Mitchell to avoid liability for the legal costs incurred by the media organisation up to that date. However, the offer did not include any apology from the publisher and Mitchell turned it down. The media organisation&#x27;s legal costs subsequently increased by at least £500,000.

PC Rowland successfully sued Mitchell for libel and agreed to accept a payment of £80,000 in damages.

=== Backbenches (2012–2022) ===
Speaking in January 2018, to the Jesus College, Cambridge, Debating Society, Mitchell expressed the belief that Labour would win the next general election and Jeremy Corbyn would become the next prime minister. Mitchell explained that this was a prospect he regarded with apprehension, and speculated that under a Labour Government borrowing and taxation would increase drastically.

In October 2018, Mitchell said that by supporting the Saudi coalition &quot;Britain is complicit in creating&quot; a famine in Yemen.

On 31 January 2022, after Boris Johnson issued a statement to the house about the interim report by Sue Gray, into the Partygate scandal, Mitchell announced that he no longer supported the Prime Minister. Mitchell had previously been one of Johnson&#x27;s longest supporters. In 1993, Johnson attempted to stand as a Conservative candidate in the 1994 European Parliament elections. Mitchell convinced Prime Minister John Major, who was critical of Johnson, not to veto Johnson&#x27;s candidacy, but Johnson could not find a constituency.

=== Development and Africa Minister (2022–2024) ===
After serving on the backbenches for over a decade, Mitchell returned to the government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and was appointed to a cabinet attending role as Minister of State for Development and Africa in the Sunak ministry.

Following the November 2023 British cabinet reshuffle, former Prime Minister David Cameron became Foreign Secretary, which left Mitchell as the most senior foreign office official in the House of Commons. Because of this, Mitchell was appointed to the honorific title of Deputy Foreign Secretary on 12 April 2024.

=== Return to opposition (2024–present) ===
Following the Conservative party&#x27;s defeat in the 2024 general election, Cameron resigned from the frontbench and Mitchell was appointed to what would have been Cameron&#x27;s position Shadow Foreign Secretary in the Shadow Cabinet of Rishi Sunak.

Following the election of Kemi Badenoch as Leader of the Opposition in November 2024, Mitchell was replaced as Shadow Foreign Secretary by Dame Priti Patel and left the Shadow Cabinet.

==Work as an MP==

===Keep Justice Local campaign===
In 2002, Mitchell led the successful Keep Justice Local campaign across his constituency of Sutton Coldfield to safeguard the 50-year-old Magistrates&#x27; Court from closure. He presented a petition signed by more than 5,500 constituents, protesting at plans to transfer the court&#x27;s work to Birmingham.

However, its closure was again announced in December 2010 by the government in which Mitchell was by then a minister. He said, &quot;We must now ensure that there&#x27;s a widespread local discussion about the future of the site and the building. I know that our councillors are already looking at how best we can do this&quot;. The site was subsequently sold to the Sutton Coldfield Muslim Association in 2012 and converted into a Masjid.

===Voting record===
In 1994, as MP for Gedling, Mitchell voted in the House of Commons for the restoration of the death penalty; the motion was defeated 383–186. Between 2001 and 2010, as MP for Sutton Coldfield, his House of Commons voting record shows that he voted for limiting climate change, civil partnerships for gay couples, greater autonomy for schools, a UK referendum on the EU Lisbon Treaty, replacement of Trident, the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq investigation, and limiting pollution from civil aviation. During the same period, he voted against ID cards, the closure of post offices, both 42 days&#x27; and 90 days&#x27; detention without charge or trial, the DNA database, closer EU integration, the relaxation of gambling laws, Section 28 (although in 1988 he had voted in favour), employment discrimination against gay people, the legalisation of recreational drugs, a fully elected House of Lords, and a ban on fox hunting.

In 2013 Mitchell voted against the legalisation of same-sex marriage and also voted for an amendment to the bill which would have allowed a government registrar to opt out of performing marriage ceremonies &#x27;to which he had a conscientious objection&#x27;. He was ranked by the &quot;Liberal Democrat Voice&quot; (connected to, but not part of, the Liberal Democrat Party) as one of the least authoritarian members of Parliament, scoring 3 out of 100 points for his votes between 2005 and 2010. with a joint ranking of 542 out of 619.

Mitchell supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum.

==Controversies==
===Allegations of lobbying on behalf of donors===
An article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper on 30 October 2010, quoted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper the following day, claimed that Mitchell had pressured the Foreign Office and colleagues to lobby Ghana (successfully) for the lifting of a trading ban on a cocoa company, Armajaro, which had been a repeated donor to Mitchell&#x27;s parliamentary office and also a donor to the Conservative Party. Ghana had imposed the ban as the company was believed to have been smuggling cocoa out of the country. However, when questioned by ITV News on 2 November about his role in the case, Mitchell said that he had a duty as a member of the government to respond to the company&#x27;s requests, as it was registered as a British company, and that the government had a responsibility to promote British trade. He argued that he had seen no evidence that the Ghanaian government&#x27;s suspicions about the company in question had been substantiated, and that the claim that he had acted improperly on behalf of a party donor was unreasonable, as the company had ceased to donate to both the Conservative Party and his parliamentary office several years earlier.

===Allegations of tax avoidance===
In 2006, Mitchell invested funds in privately owned firms implicated in a tax avoidance scheme. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a subsidiary of DV3 purchased the lease on the Dickins &amp; Jones department store building in central London for £65.1 million and sold it a month later to a partnership controlled by DV3 for £65,100, thus avoiding stamp duty. The loophole, although legal, was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; to be considered &quot;aggressive tax avoidance&quot; by Revenue &amp; Customs.

==Personal life==
Mitchell is married to Dr Sharon Bennett, a GP and a former dentist, and has two daughters, born December 1987 and December 1990. He maintains a residence in his constituency of Sutton Coldfield and primarily lives in Islington, London. In the 1980s, he lived at Tithby in Rushcliffe, west of Langar. He married in August 1985 at St Bartholomew-the-Great, in central London.

Mitchell is a trustee of International Inspiration – a charity that promotes access to sport, play and physical exercise in low and middle income countries around the world. He sits on the Board of Trustees alongside Sebastian Coe, Katherine Grainger and David Davies.

Mitchell was previously a trustee of the E. M. Radiation Research Trust, now known as the Radiation Research Trust, which conducts research into radiation emissions, from sites such as mobile phone masts. He was also a senior strategy adviser for consultants Accenture. He is also Freeman of the City of London and a Liveryman of the Vintners&#x27; Company.

In 2010, Mitchell was sworn in as a Privy Councillor.

Mitchell is a member of the Burgundian bacchanalian fraternity, the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin.

<text>In number theory, the Mertens function is defined for all positive integers &quot;n&quot; as

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the Möbius function. The function is named in honour of Franz Mertens. This definition can be extended to positive real numbers as follows:

: formula_3

Less formally, formula_4 is the count of square-free integers up to &quot;x&quot; that have an even number of prime factors, minus the count of those that have an odd number.

The first 143 &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) values are 

The Mertens function slowly grows in positive and negative directions both on average and in peak value, oscillating in an apparently chaotic manner passing through zero when &quot;n&quot; has the values
:2, 39, 40, 58, 65, 93, 101, 145, 149, 150, 159, 160, 163, 164, 166, 214, 231, 232, 235, 236, 238, 254, 329, 331, 332, 333, 353, 355, 356, 358, 362, 363, 364, 366, 393, 401, 403, 404, 405, 407, 408, 413, 414, 419, 420, 422, 423, 424, 425, 427, 428, ... .

Because the Möbius function only takes the values −1, 0, and +1, the Mertens function moves slowly, and there is no &quot;x&quot; such that |&quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)| &gt; &quot;x&quot;. 
H. Davenport demonstrated that, for any fixed &quot;h&quot;, 

: formula_5

uniformly in formula_6. This implies, for formula_7 that

: formula_8
The Mertens conjecture went further, stating that there would be no &quot;x&quot; where the absolute value of the Mertens function exceeds the square root of &quot;x&quot;. The Mertens conjecture was proven false in 1985 by Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele. However, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to a weaker conjecture on the growth of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), namely &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;O&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1/2 + ε). Since high values for &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) grow at least as fast as formula_9, this puts a rather tight bound on its rate of growth. Here, &quot;O&quot; refers to big O notation.

The true rate of growth of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is not known. An unpublished conjecture of Steve Gonek states that

: formula_10

Probabilistic evidence towards this conjecture is given by Nathan Ng. In particular, Ng gives a conditional proof that the function formula_11 has a limiting distribution formula_12 on formula_13. That is, for all bounded Lipschitz continuous functions formula_14 on the reals we have that

: formula_15

if one assumes various conjectures about the Riemann zeta function.

==Representations==
===As an integral===
Using the Euler product, one finds that

: formula_16

where formula_17 is the Riemann zeta function, and the product is taken over primes. Then, using this Dirichlet series with Perron&#x27;s formula, one obtains

: formula_18

where &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1.

Conversely, one has the Mellin transform

: formula_19

which holds for formula_20.

A curious relation given by Mertens himself involving the second Chebyshev function is

: formula_21

Assuming that the Riemann zeta function has no multiple non-trivial zeros, one has the &quot;exact formula&quot; by the residue theorem:

: formula_22

Weyl conjectured that the Mertens function satisfied the approximate functional-differential equation

: formula_23

where &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the Heaviside step function, &quot;B&quot; are Bernoulli numbers, and all derivatives with respect to &quot;t&quot; are evaluated at &quot;t&quot; = 0.

There is also a trace formula involving a sum over the Möbius function and zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the form

: formula_24

where the first sum on the right-hand side is taken over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) are related by the Fourier transform, such that
: formula_25

===As a sum over Farey sequences===
Another formula for the Mertens function is

: formula_26

where formula_27 is the Farey sequence of order &quot;n&quot;.

This formula is used in the proof of the Franel–Landau theorem.

===As a determinant===
&quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the determinant of the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Redheffer matrix, a (0, 1) matrix in which
&quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is 1 if either &quot;j&quot; is 1 or &quot;i&quot; divides &quot;j&quot;.

===As a sum of the number of points under &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperboloids===
: formula_28

This formulation expanding the Mertens function suggests asymptotic bounds obtained by considering the Piltz divisor problem, which generalizes the Dirichlet divisor problem of computing asymptotic estimates for the summatory function of the divisor function.

== Other properties ==
From we have 
: formula_29

Furthermore, from 
: formula_30
where formula_31 is the totient summatory function.

== Calculation ==
Neither of the methods mentioned previously leads to practical algorithms to calculate the Mertens function.
Using sieve methods similar to those used in prime counting, the Mertens function has been computed for all integers up to an increasing range of &quot;x&quot;.

The Mertens function for all integer values up to &quot;x&quot; may be computed in time. A combinatorial algorithm has been developed incrementally starting in 1870 by Ernst Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko, and Deléglise-Rivat that computes isolated values of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in time; a further improvement by Harald Helfgott and Lola Thompson in 2021 improves this to , and an algorithm by Lagarias and Odlyzko based on integrals of the Riemann zeta function achieves a running time of .

See for values of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) at powers of 10.

==Known upper bounds==
Ng notes that the Riemann hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to

:formula_32

for some positive constant formula_33. Other upper bounds have been obtained by Maier, Montgomery, and Soundarajan assuming the RH including

:formula_34

Known explicit upper bounds without assuming the RH are given by:

:formula_35

It is possible to simplify the above expression into a less restrictive but illustrative form as:

:formula_36

<text>Mark Richard Tami (born 3 October 1962) is a  Welsh Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Alyn and Deeside since 2001. He has served as Deputy Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons since 2024.

==Early life==
Born in Enfield, north London, Tami was educated at Enfield Grammar School (by then a comprehensive school), and graduated in history at the University of Wales, Swansea. He was previously National Head of Policy of the union Amicus (previously the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

==Parliamentary career==
Tami was first elected as MP for Alyn and Deeside in 2001 with a majority of 9,222, following the decision of the seat&#x27;s former MP Stephen Barry Jones to step down from Parliament.

Tami was returned again as MP for Alyn and Deeside at the 2005 general election, with a reduced majority. He resigned his post as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Dawn Primarolo on 6 September 2006, due to the refusal by Tony Blair to name a date for stepping down as Prime Minister. He was joined by future Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Tom Watson and fellow Welsh MPs Ian Lucas and Wayne David in resignation.

Tami was promoted by Gordon Brown in July 2007 to a whip. In the 2010 general election, Tami was re-elected for a third time, however with a further reduced majority of 2,919. 

Tami was re-elected as MP for Alyn and Deeside on 7 May 2015 at the general election with a slightly increased majority from 2010. In the 2017 general election, Tami was returned with a vastly increased majority of 5,235 votes and a 52.1% share of the vote.

On Thursday 12 December 2019, Tami was the only Labour MP in North Wales not to lose his seat, narrowly beating the Conservative candidate Sanjoy Sen by just 213 votes, falling from a majority of over 5000 in the previous election.

In March 2020, Tami led a cross-party campaign to end the 9-week wait without income for people on Universal Credit when they reach state pension age. After Tami&#x27;s campaign, the government changed the regulations.

==Expenses==
During the MPs expenses scandal Tami was one of more than 50 MPs identified by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of over-claiming on council tax expenses for their second home. Tami said, &quot;I will go back and calculate the exact level I have over-claimed in error and repay the sum involved&quot;. He paid back the full £996.70 for council tax on his London home.

==Personal life==
He married Sally Daniels in July 1994 in Bromley and they have two sons. They live in Llanfynydd having lived in Bromley for many years. He is a former member of the TUC General Council and an active member of the Fabian Society.

Tami&#x27;s eldest son, Max, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2007 at age 9. Max made a full recovery following intensive chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant at Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital. Tami has repeatedly called for the Government to do more to help cancer patients and their families, including providing appropriate psychological support.

<doc id="435653" wikidata="Q272526" url="?curid=435653" title="Peter Tapsell (British politician)">
<text>Sir Peter Hannay Bailey Tapsell (1 February 1930 – 17 August 2018) was a British Conservative Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Louth and Horncastle. He served in the House of Commons continuously from 1966 until 2015, and was also previously an MP from 1959 to 1964. He was Father of the House between 2010 and 2015. With a total parliamentary service of 54 years, he is one of the longest-serving MPs in British history.

== Early life and education ==
Tapsell was born in Hove, Sussex. He was educated at Tonbridge School, served in the Royal Sussex Regiment from 1948 to 1950, and continued his education at Merton College, Oxford, gaining a BA in Modern History in 1954, during which time he was also elected Librarian of the Oxford Union (a senior office). Tapsell was a member of the Oxford University Labour Club and the Oxford Union debating society during his time at Merton.

==Political career==
Tapsell worked as a personal assistant to Sir Anthony Eden during the 1955 general election. He contested the Wednesbury by-election in 1957, losing to the Labour Party candidate John Stonehouse. Tapsell was chairman of the Coningsby Club (a dining club for Conservative graduates, restricted at that time to graduates of Oxford and Cambridge) from 1957 until 1958.

Tapsell first entered Parliament in the 1959 general election, representing Nottingham West. After losing his seat at the 1964 general election, he was selected for Horncastle, representing the constituency from 1966 to 1983. In 1983, boundary changes moved him to East Lindsey, which he represented until 1997 when further boundary changes moved him to Louth and Horncastle. He was knighted in 1985. Tapsell was a long-time supporter of Keynesian economics, and opposed the monetarist policies of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s governments. In 1981, he voted against Sir Geoffrey Howe&#x27;s Budget – becoming, as Peter Oborne noted, &quot;the first Conservative since Harold Macmillan in the 1930s to vote against a Budget, a brave move which turned him into an internal political exile.&quot;

Tapsell was known for his forthright views and was sometimes controversial. In May 2001, he made headlines during the UK general election campaign when comparing German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s vision of Europe to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s: &quot;We may not have studied Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in time but, by heaven, there is no excuse for us not studying the Schröder plan now&quot;. Tapsell was opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and called for Tony Blair to be impeached for misleading parliament over the invasion of Iraq. From 2005 onwards he was the only MP from any party who had been first elected in the 1950s, but the two-year gap in his parliamentary service prevented him from becoming Father of the House until Alan Williams retired in 2010. He is one of the few MPs in parliamentary history to have served over fifty years in the House of Commons.

Tapsell was strongly Eurosceptic. He was in favour of Britain leaving the EU. He felt that of all his political actions the one of which he was most proud was his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty, &quot;because everything that has gone wrong in Britain dates from us joining the European Union. One of the reasons the House of Commons has lost its prestige is because people feel we are no longer in charge of a country. So much of the legislation that affects them is imposed by Brussels.&quot;

In November 2005, he was the only Conservative MP, and one of only two non-Labour MPs, to vote in favour of a proposal to allow police to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge. During the 2006 Lebanon War, he said that Israeli action in Lebanon was &quot;gravely reminiscent of the Nazi atrocity on the Jewish quarter of Warsaw&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; sketch writer Simon Hoggart frequently lavished praise on Tapsell, describing him as &quot;the grandest of grandees&quot; (July 2008) and that when in the Chamber, Tapsell rises &quot;to speak, or rather to intone superbly&quot; (January 2008).

In June 2011, Tapsell was appointed as a Privy Counsellor in the 2011 Birthday Honours, and he was sworn into the Council the following month. Tapsell was reported as being one of the Conservative MPs to have spoken critically of Party Co-Chairman Sayeeda Warsi at a meeting of the 1922 Committee, following Warsi&#x27;s handling of Roger Helmer MEP&#x27;s defection to UKIP. In March 2014, he announced his intention to step down from Parliament at the 2015 general election, and also gave an interview where he was highly critical of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, under whom he briefly served as a spokesman on economic policy when the Conservatives were still in Opposition in the 1970s.

==Personal life==
Tapsell married Cecilia Hawke, third daughter of the 9th Baron Hawke, in 1963. The couple had a son, James, who was born in 1966 and died in 1985. They divorced in 1971, and Tapsell subsequently married Gabrielle Mahieu in 1974. His former wife Cecilia married Tapsell&#x27;s fellow Conservative politician Sir Nicholas Scott in 1979. 

Tapsell lived at Roughton Hall in Roughton, Lincolnshire. He died there on 17 August 2018, aged 88.

<text>Dari Jean Taylor (&quot;née&quot; Jones; born 13 December 1944) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stockton South between the 1997 and 2010 general elections.

==Biography==
Taylor was born into a staunch Labour Party-supporting family in Rhondda, South Wales, in December 1944. She attended Ynyshir Girls&#x27; School before moving to Burnley Municipal College when her father, Daniel Jones, was elected to Parliament as the Labour MP for Burnley in 1959. He remained the MP for Burnley until 1983. She graduated with a BA from the University of Nottingham and an MA from the University of Durham, then lectured at a number of colleges of Further Education.

Taylor was active in the Trade Union movement from 1990 until her election to Parliament in 1997. She initially worked as a researcher and in 1993 became the Regional Educational Officer for the GMB Union in the Northern Region. She was also an elected member of Sunderland Metropolitan Council between 1986 and the time of her election to Parliament.

She describes her interests as issues relating to women, health, the economy, industry, defence, international development, disabilities, drugs and crime and all aspects of child welfare, especially adoption.

==Parliamentary career==
Taylor was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. Taylor was elected as Member of Parliament for Stockton South in 1997, until losing the seat at the 2010 general election.

Taylor served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lewis Moonie and Lord Bach (Ministry of Defence) from 2001 to 2003 and then as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Hazel Blears, Home Office minister between 2003 and 2005. Her latest such position was again as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, to Phil Hope at the Department of Health in 2008–09.

She was the chairman of the North East Regional Select Committee and a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee. Taylor was secretary of Labour Friends of India, Vice-chair of the Azerbaijan Group and the treasurer for the Opera Group.

Whilst in Parliament, Taylor was Chair of the Adoption and Fostering Group, Secretary for the Cardiac Risk in the Young Group and Vice-chair of the Children Group.

==Controversies==

===Misuses of stationery===
In early November 2008 Taylor was found guilty of misusing House of Commons stationery for political purposes, with four complaints about her upheld. Of particular note was that this was the second occasion Taylor had committed such offences, having already been forced to repay for misused stationery and postage in April 2007.

A House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges stated:
&quot;We strongly deprecate the continued misuse by Ms Taylor of House stationery for political purposes...we are surprised that an experienced Member has repeated previous breaches of the rules and has failed to act in accordance with advice given by the House authorities. We particularly regret the fact that Ms Taylor has continued to dispute parts of the Commissioner&#x27;s findings and we are very disappointed that she has offered no apology. We conclude that Ms Taylor should pay the House authorities the sum of £500 and submit an unequivocal written apology. &quot;

Taylor suggested that the rules were too &quot;confusing&quot; and that she had &quot;tried her best&quot; to stick to them. She complied with the orders of the committee.

===Expenses===

In 2006, on the subject of not being top of north east MP expenses, Taylor said she was disappointed not to be higher in the list. Referring to her position behind Dr Kumar and Sharon Hodgson, Taylor said: &quot;I want to know what Ashok and Sharon are doing better than me.&quot;

In 2007, Taylor was the second costliest MP in the North East region (Stockton South), claiming £159,178, and putting her in 24th place in the Westminster league table.
In May 2009, Taylor attracted some criticism for her expenses claims, in particular for claiming £18,100 over four years for food – the maximum possible claim. She also claimed £54,329 for mortgage interest payments over four years on her two-bedroomed London apartment, £40 per month for a cleaner to perform housekeeping duties and £310 for tiling a bathroom. She was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep MPs&#x27; expenses secret. She was one of the few MPs to publish their expenses independently, but had blacked out the parts that revealed staffers&#x27; personal details.

==Voting record==
Taylor strongly supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She supports a fully elected House of Lords and bills which favoured a partially elected alternative. She is in favour of nuclear power and the replacement of Trident. She is described as a &quot;Labour loyalist&quot;.

==Personal life==
She married David Taylor in July 1970 and they have one daughter. She enjoys classical music, walking and travelling.

<text>David Leslie Taylor (22 August 1946 – 26 December 2009) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for North West Leicestershire from 1997 until his death in 2009.

==Biography==
David Taylor was born in Ashby de la Zouch. He went to Heather County Primary School near Coalville, Ashby Boys&#x27; Grammar School (now known as Ashby School) and Leicester Polytechnic.

===Career===
At Leicester Polytechnic, he became a Chartered Public Finance Accountant in 1970. At the Open University, he gained a BA in Maths and Computing in 1974. During this time, he wrote the first CASCAID computer program that evolved into the modern-day Kudos and Adult Directions programs. Before being elected as a Member of Parliament, Taylor was an accountant and the computer applications manager for Leicestershire County Council from 1977 to 1997.

He founded Safeguard the Quality of the Rural Environment (SQUARE) and had been a parish councillor, churchwarden of St John the Baptist church in Heather, President of Heather Sparkenhoe Cricket Club, magistrate and school governor.

===Religion===
Taylor was a committed Christian and described himself as an ecumenical Anglican.

===Personal life===
Taylor married Pamela Caunt on 13 September 1969 in Loughborough. The couple had four daughters (and one son, deceased), one granddaughter and one grandson.

===Death===
On Boxing Day 2009, whilst walking with his family at Calke Abbey, Derbyshire, Taylor suffered a massive heart attack. He was taken by ambulance to Queens Hospital in Burton-on-Trent hospital, but paramedics were unable to save him. The event occurred during his day off while spending time with his family; he had previously announced that he would not run for re-election due to the high workload.

==Parliamentary career==
He first contested his seat in 1992, achieving a 5.9% swing compared to the national 3.6% swing to Labour.

Taylor&#x27;s views were on the left of the Labour Party. He was widely regarded as one of the parliamentary rebels and had rebelled on 7.2% of votes since June 2001. 

Taylor described it as &quot;a real privilege&quot; to win the title of Commons Backbencher of the Year 2007 in the Annual Awards organised by Sky TV and &quot;The House Magazine&quot; and decided by a ballot of all 646 MPs. 

===Expenses===

Prior to this, he opened his complete &quot;unredacted&quot; expenses file to the local newspaper, the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;.

Following the new emergency interim rules announced on 19 May 2009 by the Speaker, which say that furniture should no longer be claimed for, Taylor voluntarily elected to apply those new rules retrospectively in his case for the life of the parliament and had since made a refund based on the fully funded purchase price of all such items.

===Standing down===
At the May 2008 meeting of his Constituency Labour Party, Taylor announced he would not be standing for re-election at the next general election. Taylor died on 26 December 2009, before the upcoming general election. As an election was due to be called within four months, no by-election was held. At the 2010 general election, Taylor&#x27;s former seat was gained by Andrew Bridgen of the Conservative Party.

<text>Ian Colin Taylor MBE (born 18 April 1945) is a British former Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Esher from 1987 to 1997, and then for Esher and Walton from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
He went to Whitley Abbey School, Abbey Road, Coventry. He was an accomplished sprinter and played rugby for Warwickshire Schools. He studied at Keele University, receiving a BA (Hons) in Economics, Politics and Modern History in 1967. He then did research at the London School of Economics. He chaired both the Federation of Conservative Students and the European Christian Democrat and Conservative Students 1967-70. In 1969, he joined Hill Samuel &amp; Co. In 1971, he became the manager of the European Department at Stirling &amp; Co. From 1975 to 1979, he joined a bank and lived in Paris. He was a Director for corporate finance of Mathercourt Securities Ltd from 1980 to 1991. He is an Associate of the UK Society of Investment Professionals and a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.

==Political career==
Before being elected for Esher in 1987, Taylor had fought Coventry South East in February 1974, being beaten by Labour&#x27;s Bill Wilson.

In the period in which he served Esher, the make-up of the seat was classified by economists as a &#x27;natural home&#x27; for Taylor&#x27;s party, and by historians as a safe seat, including its main successor, which he served from 1997 to 2010. Esher is part of the London Commuter Belt, and has seen strong Conservative majorities since the 1930s; Taylor won five elections before deciding to stand down at the 2010 general election to resume a business career.

He was during his first two terms appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) at the Foreign Office, Department of Health and Cabinet Office. He served as Minister for Science and Technology for most of the Second Major ministry: from 1994 to 1997. He became a Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland in 1997, tracking the peace process. He resigned in November 1997 after disagreeing with William Hague&#x27;s increasing euro-scepticism. See his chapter in &#x27;The Conservatives in Crisis&#x27; by Mark Garnett (Editor), Philip Lynch (Editor).

He supported bids for leadership and main policies of Kenneth Clarke except in the 2005 Conservative leadership contest when he backed David Davis.

Taylor was the Chairman of the European Movement (2000–2005) and a member of the Britain in Europe Council until 2005. He chaired the Conservative Group for Europe 2007–11. His views became increasingly challenged by the Conservative Party. In December 2000 he comfortably overcame an attempted de-selection campaign by eurosceptics in his constituency.

He specialised in science and technology issues. He was Minister for Science, Technology and Space at the DTI during 1994–1997 in a Conservative Government. During this time he dealt with a wide variety of issues, including providing support for the next phase of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, increasing awareness of the importance of access to the early internet revolution and coordinating Government support for the Roslin Institute which led to the Cloning of Dolly the Sheep and the creation of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission] in February 1997. See this background interview on his technology policies: https://archivesit.org.uk/interviews/ian-taylor-mbe/ 

In 2003, he was one of only 15 Conservative MPs who voted against the Iraq War.

He was Chairman of the Conservative Policy Task-force on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 2005–2009. He chaired the all-Party Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (the oldest all-party committee), which includes the Parliamentary Engineering Group. He was also an officer of several all-party Parliamentary committees, including the Office of Science and Technology, the Information Society Alliance (EURIM), PITCOM (Information Technology Committee) and the Corporate Social Responsibility Group. For his comments on science roles, see https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/article/44/1/2/230733/Government-science-ambitions-require-greater 

He was a member of the Commission on National Security 2007–09. He was a Visiting Parliamentary Fellow at St. Antony&#x27;s College Oxford in the Hilary Term 2007, lecturing on energy security. He chaired the European Movement 2000–05 and the Conservative Europe Group 2007-11 and also in 1985–88. He also chaired the Cuba Initiative 2006–2011.

From 1997 until 2010, he was a non-executive director of or adviser to various companies, according to the Register of Members Interests. In 2008, Taylor gained the (Sir) Arthur C. Clarke Award for Individual Achievement in Promoting Space and Science. He was co-chair of the Parliamentary Space Committee and in 2009 he chaired the European Inter-Parliamentary Space Conference.

==After Parliament==
Taylor has become chairman of tech-related ventures, on the board or advisory board of others. He was on the Government&#x27;s Science and Technology Facilities Council 2011–2018, on an ESA (European Space Agency) Advisory Board, chaired the National Space Academy steering group until 2018 and was Chair and now President of The League of Remembrance. He is on the Advisory Board of D Group https://www.dgroup.co.uk/ and is an advisor to Westbourne Park LLP.

During the 2019 general election campaign, he declared that he had become an Independent Conservative and explained in an open letter why on balance he supported the Liberal Democrat candidate in Esher and Walton. In 2024 he gave his endorsement to the Lib Dem candiade Monica Harding, and welcomed her General Election victory.

==Personal life==
Taylor married Carole Alport in 1974 (daughter of late Lord Alport), and they have two sons and 5 grandchildren.

<text>John Mark Taylor (19 August 1941 – 28 May 2017) was a British solicitor and Conservative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Solihull from 1983 to 2005, when he lost his seat to Lorely Burt of the Liberal Democrats by a margin of 279 votes in the 2005 general election. He had previously been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and leader of West Midlands County Council. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1983, and served as a junior minister under John Major.

==Early life==
He went to the independent Bromsgrove School and the College of Law. He was a senior partner in John Taylor &amp; Co. solicitors.

He began his career in the Solihull County Borough Council in 1971, then went on to the West Midlands Metropolitan County Council in 1973. He became Leader of the Opposition in 1975, Leader of the Council in 1977 and deputy chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in 1978.

== Parliamentary career ==
He contested Dudley East in February and October 1974.

Taylor was elected to the European Parliament for Midlands East in 1979, and served as the Conservatives&#x27; European Spokesman on the Community Budget from 1979 to 1981. He was deputy chairman of the Conservative Group in the European Parliament from 1981 to 1982.

Elected as MP for Solihull in 1983, he held the seat for the subsequent four general elections. He became secretary of the Conservative Back Bench Committee on European Affairs in 1983, member of the Select Committee on the Environment from 1983 to 1987, as well as vice chairman of the Conservative Back Bench Committee on Sport.

He served as an assistant government whip from 1988 to 1989, a Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&#x27;s Treasury from 1989 to 1990 and Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty&#x27;s Household from 1990 to 1992.

From 1992 to 1995, Taylor was Parliamentary Secretary at the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry from 1995 to 1997, and then a delegate Member of the Council of Europe and vice-chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary Committees on Trade and Industry and Legal Affairs. He served in the Conservative Whips Office from 1997 to 1999, and became a Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland in 1999.

He narrowly lost his Solihull seat to the Liberal Democrat Lorely Burt in a surprise result in the May 2005 general election.

<text>The Association of Free Democrats () was a liberal electoral coalition, later party, formed in East Germany on 12 February 1990. It originally consisted of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party (East Germany) and the German Forum Party. In the Volkskammer election of the 18 March 1990 the Association of Free Democrats, heavily supported by the West German Free Democratic Party, polled 5.28% of the votes and gained 21 seats, all parties running on the same lists. Most of the seats went to Liberal Democratic Party members, whose leader Rainer Ortleb became their parliamentary leader. It then participated in the last GDR government led by Lothar de Maizière.

On 27 March 1990, the Liberal Democratic Party and the National Democratic Party of Germany, previously excluded from the coalition, merged into the party &quot;Association of Free Democrats&quot;, leaving their old identity as bloc parties behind. Ortleb was elected chairman, former NDPD leader Wolfgang Rauls became his deputy. Finally, on 11 August 1990 the Association of Free Democrats party, the Free Democratic Party (East Germany) and the German Forum Party merged with the Free Democratic Party.

<doc id="435685" wikidata="Q996502" url="?curid=435685" title="Clydebank">
<text>Clydebank () is a town in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Situated on the north bank of the River Clyde, it borders the village of Old Kilpatrick (with Bowling and Milton beyond) to the west, and the Yoker and Drumchapel areas of the adjacent City of Glasgow immediately to the east. Depending on the definition of the town&#x27;s boundaries, the suburban areas of Duntocher, Faifley and Hardgate either surround Clydebank to the north, or are its northern outskirts, with the Kilpatrick Hills beyond.

Historically part of Dunbartonshire and founded as a police burgh on 18 November 1886, Clydebank is part of the registration County of Dumbarton, the Dunbartonshire Crown Lieutenancy area, and the wider urban area of Greater Glasgow.

==History==
===Early origins===
Clydebank is located within the historical boundaries of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, the Mormaerdom of Lennox, and the parish of Old Kilpatrick (12th century), on the north bank of the River Clyde. A long-standing local legend is that the village of Old Kilpatrick derived its name from being the birthplace of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.

The town encompasses part of the Antonine Wall, including, at Hardgate/Duntocher, the site of one of the forts built at regular intervals along the wall. In 2008, the Antonine Wall was designated as a World Heritage Site, as part of a multinational Heritage Site encompassing the borders of the Roman Empire.

Before 1870, the area which later became Clydebank was largely rural, and agricultural. It consisted of some villages (Kilbowie, Drumry, Hardgate, Faifley, Duntocher, Dalmuir, Old Kilpatrick), farms and estates (Dalnotter House, Mountblow House, Dalmuir House, Auchentoshan House, Park Hall, Boquhanran House, and West Barns of Clyde), with some small scale mining operations (coal, limestone and whinstone), several paper and cotton mills and some small boatbuilding yards.

===Industrial development===

At the start of the 1870s, however, the growing trade and industry in Glasgow resulted in the Clyde Navigation Trustees needing additional space for shipping quays in Glasgow. They used their statutory powers to compulsorily purchase the area occupied by the Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard in Govan, which belonged to J &amp; G Thomson. Forced to find another site for their shipyard, J &amp; G Thomson looked at various sites further down the River Clyde, and eventually purchased, from the estates of Miss Hamilton of Cochno, some suitably flat land on the &quot;West Barns o&#x27;Clyde&quot; on the north bank of the river, opposite the point where the River Cart flows into the River Clyde. The land was situated close to the Forth and Clyde Canal and to the main road running west out of Glasgow to Dumbarton, and so was conveniently positioned for transporting materials and workers to and from the shipyard. The position opposite the mouth of the River Cart was to prove important as the shipyard grew, since it enabled the company to build much bigger, heavier ships than would otherwise have been possible farther up the Clyde. Construction of the new shipyard started on 1 May 1871.

Initially, the company transported workers to and from the shipyard by paddle steamer (passenger steamers were commonly used by people to travel up and down the Clyde well into the second half of the 20th century). However, having to ship workers to and fro all the time was not ideal, so the company also started building blocks of tenement flats to house the workers. These first blocks of housing became known unofficially as &quot;Tamson&#x27;s (Thomson&#x27;s) Buildings&quot;, after the name of the company.

Gradually, as the shipyard grew, so did the cluster of buildings grow nearby. More houses, a school, a large shed which served as canteen, community hall and church (known as the &quot;Tarry Kirk&quot;), then finally two proper churches in 1876 and 1877. As the resident population grew, so did the needs and problems associated with a growing population. Other manufacturers and employers moved into the area, and by 1880 approximately 2,000 men were living and working there.
In 1882 a railway line was built running from Glasgow out to the new shipyard (the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway). This was followed by the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway during the 1890s. Then, between 1882 and 1884, the Singer Manufacturing Company built a massive sewing machine factory in Kilbowie, less than north of the Clyde Bank shipyard. More people moved into the area, and finally, in 1886, the local populace petitioned for the creation of a police burgh, on the basis that the area now qualified as a &quot;populous place&quot;. The petition was granted, and the new town was named after the shipyard which had given birth to it – Clydebank.

===Clydebank blitz===
On 13 and 14 March 1941, Luftwaffe bombers attacked various targets in and around Clydebank. In what became known as the Clydebank Blitz, the town was seriously damaged as were the local shipyards, the Dalnottar Royal Navy oil depot and the Singer&#x27;s Sewing Machine factory. Over the two days 528 civilians were killed and over 617 people were seriously injured.

==Governance and politics==
Clydebank is in West Dunbartonshire, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. West Dunbartonshire Council, the unitary local authority, is based in Dumbarton, to the northwest, although Clydebank is the largest town in the council area. For local electoral purposes, West Dunbartonshire is split into wards electing either three or four councillors. The Clydebank Waterfront ward broadly covers the area between the River Clyde and the Forth and Clyde Canal, including the town centre, Whitecrook and part of Dalmuir; it also includes neighbouring Old Kilpatrick. The Clydebank Central ward includes Kilbowie, Linnvale, Radnor Park, Parkhall and the northern part of Dalmuir.

West Dunbartonshire is also divided into community council areas: those covering Clydebank include Dalmuir and Mountblow; Parkhall, North Kilbowie and Central; Linnvale and Drumry; and Clydebank East. The area that is now Clydebank was once in the territory of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and has been part of the historic county of Dunbartonshire since medieval times. From 1890 onwards, Dunbartonshire was an area of local government administered by a county council. Although Dunbartonshire ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975, it continues to exist as both a Lieutenancy area and registration county. Clydebank is also within the ancient parish of Old Kilpatrick. The town became a burgh in 1886; as such, it exercised most local government functions independently of the county council. Following the abolition of administrative counties in 1975, a new Clydebank District was created within Strathclyde Region under the new two tier system of local government. As well as Clydebank itself and its suburbs, the district also covered a wider area including Old Kilpatrick and Bowling. This lasted until the creation of the present unitary authorities in 1996.

In the early 20th century the town was synonymous with the Scottish socialist movements led by the shipyard workers along the river Clyde, giving rise to the title of Red Clydeside. The 11,000 workers at the largest factory of Singer sewing machines went on strike in March–April 1911, ceasing to work in solidarity of 12 female colleagues protesting against work process reorganisation. Following the end of the strike, Singer fired 400 workers, including all strike leaders and purported members of the Industrial Workers of Great Britain, among whom Arthur McManus, who later went on to become the first chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain between 1920 and 1922.

Labour unrest, particularly by women and unskilled labour, greatly increased between 1910 and 1914 in Clydeside, with four times more days on strike than between 1900 and 1910. During these four years preceding World War I, membership of those affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress rose from 129,000 in 1909 to 230,000 in 1914. The town is part of a single urban area (officially the Glasgow City Metropolitan Area) with the terms Glasgow and Greater Glasgow often used interchangeably, though for some Clydebank residents any claim of the town being part of Glasgow can be a sensitive issue. This Glasgow City Metropolitan Area includes places falling within the limits of several local authorities surrounding Glasgow proper; these form a single health service area, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Most of Clydebank uses the Glasgow telephone area code &quot;0141&quot;, however Duntocher, Faifley, Hardgate and Old Kilpatrick use &quot;01389&quot;. The G81 postcode is the most widely used in the area, but Bowling and Old Kilpatrick use G60.

===Coat of arms===
The Burgh of Clydebank adopted an unofficial coat of arms in 1892, when it was required to obtain a common seal by the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1892. The design was described disparagingly by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies as a &quot;fine healthy specimen of home-made heraldry&quot;.

The design comprised a shield surmounted by a mural crown, above which was a helm bearing a wreath and crest. In the centrepiece of the shield was a Lennox Cross representative of the ancient Earls of Lennox. In chief position was a sewing machine representing the Singer Corporation and in base position &quot;on the waves of the sea&quot; was a representation of the battleship built at J &amp; G Thomson&#x27;s Clydebank Shipyard in 1892. In the dexter fess position was a stag&#x27;s head taken from the coat of arms of shipbuilder James Rodger Thomson, the first Provost of the Burgh. In sinister fess position there was a lion rampant taken from the coat of arms of local landowner, Alexander Dunn Pattison of Dalmuir. The crest was a garb or wheatsheaf representing the agricultural interests of the area. The Latin motto below the shield was &quot;Labore et Scientia&quot; or &quot;by work and by knowledge&quot;.

In 1929 there was a concerted campaign by the office of Lord Lyon King of Arms to ensure that all burghs using unmatriculated arms regularised their position, and more than fifty burghs registered arms between 1929 and 1931. This led to Clydebank&#x27;s arms being matriculated on 6 February 1930. The 1930 grant was almost identical to the 1892 device.

When the burgh was abolished in 1975 to become part of a larger Clydebank District, the burgh arms went out of use. Clydebank District Council was granted new arms on 3 September 1975, consisting of a red saltire on a white field for the ancient province of Lennox and for the town&#x27;s more recent historic links to Ireland which previously used the same flag. The cog-wheel symbolised all the local industries and the demi-figure of Saint Patrick referred to Old Kilpatrick, a burgh of barony from 1672, and where the saint is reputed to have been born. A representation of part of the Roman Antonine Wall was included as the Wall and Roman forts at Old Kilpatrick and Greenhill were features common to the burgh and to the villages in the district. The lymphad (galley ship) was for Clyde shipbuilding. The burgh motto was retained.

At the request of the district council, the arms were rematriculated on 19 April 1985 with the addition of a dove of peace in the centre of the saltire. The coat of arms went out of use in 1996 with the abolition of the District Council. In 1998, the successor West Dunbartonshire Council was granted very similar arms.

==Geography==
Clydebank is in Scotland&#x27;s west Central Lowlands, on the north bank of the River Clyde. Part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, the town is just outside the boundaries of Glasgow itself, northwest of the city centre.

What is now Clydebank was a rural area known as the Barns o&#x27; Clyde up until the late 19th century, when the growth of the shipbuilding industry on the river led to the foundation of the village that became Clydebank. As the area rapidly urbanised, Clydebank grew into a town and absorbed older neighbouring settlements such as Dalmuir, Kilbowie and Yoker (although the latter area was largely annexed by Glasgow in 1926).

===Neighbourhoods===
The Linnvale housing estate was rebuilt in the late 1940s after being destroyed during the Clydebank Blitz, with its new streets named after members of the Labour government of the time, such as Attlee Avenue and Bevin Avenue. The area has one non-denominational primary school, Linnvale Primary, which also runs a nursery service. Linnvale Parish Church of Scotland was opened under the Church of Scotland&#x27;s church extension scheme of the 1950s. During the 1980s, Linnvale was one of the areas included in the East End Initiative, and a support team helped to set up groups and clubs and to enable them to become self-sufficient.

Whitecrook occupies part of the south-east of the town, between the Forth and Clyde Canal to the north and Glasgow Road to the southwest. The neighbourhood is named after Whitecrook farm which used to stand there. It includes one non-denominational primary school (Whitecrook Primary), a Catholic primary school (Our Holy Redeemer&#x27;s – usually referred to as O.H.R.), and formerly had a Roman Catholic high school (St Andrew&#x27;s High School). It also has St Margaret&#x27;s Hospice, which has recently completed development to add a new wing. Local amenities include John Brown&#x27;s park on Barns Street, two bowling clubs and Clydebank Rugby Club which plays at Whitecrook sports ground. Frequent buses go along Barns Street/East Barns Street.

== Demography ==
The town has lacked any strictly defined administrative boundaries since the abolition of the burgh in 1975. For modern UK Census purposes, the locality of Clydebank is defined as the town centre and surrounding areas, mainly lying south of the A82 road. While this roughly corresponds to the burgh boundaries prior to the Second World War, it excludes outlying areas such as Faifley, Hardgate, Duntocher and Old Kilpatrick which were either annexed to the burgh in the postwar era or included in the post-1975 district, and which are often considered to be part of Clydebank.

According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, Clydebank (including Dalmuir, Drumry, Linnvale, Mountblow, Radnor Park and Kilbowie) had a total resident population of 28,799. The population is 93% White Scottish, with white people as a whole making up 98.1% of the total. 63.7% of the population identified as Christian (35.8% Roman Catholic, 25.3% Church of Scotland and 2.6% other Christian denominations), with 28.3% stating they had no religion. The mid-2012 population estimate suggested the population of Clydebank had decreased to 26,640.

==Sport==
Clydebank has two semi-professional football teams, Clydebank F.C. and Yoker Athletic F.C. Both were members of the Scottish Junior Football Association before switching to the West of Scotland Football League in 2020. Clydebank F.C. formerly held status as a senior league club but, while in administration in 2002 having sold their Kilbowie Park ground, the club was purchased by a consortium, moved to Airdrie and renamed Airdrie United F.C. A new Clydebank F.C. were formed in 2003 and entered Junior football, initially playing in Duntocher before moving in to share with Yoker Athletic at Holm Park, situated very close to the boundary with Glasgow. A previous Clydebank club also played nearby, with their Clydeholm ground even closer to Glasgow beside Yoker railway station – like Kilbowie, no trace of it remains. The town also encompasses a variety of amateur football teams, including Drumchapel Amateurs who have played in Duntocher since the ground was vacated by Clydebank.

Clydebank&#x27;s Rugby Football Club is based in Whitecrook. The club was founded on 29 May 1969. Their first game was played at Whitecrook on Monday 1 September 1969 against a Presidents XV captained by Richard Alan of Hutchesons and Scotland. The club play in red and black and regularly field two XVs.

Other sport clubs based in Clydebank are: Singer&#x27;s Football Club founded in 2013, the Clydesdale Harriers, founded in 1885 as Scotland&#x27;s first amateur open athletics club; and the Lomond Roads Cycling Club.

The Antonine Sports Centre is located in Duntocher and was established in October 1980. It is a not-for-profit, charitable organisation which is run by a voluntary Board of Directors.

==Employment==

The town currently has a fairly moderate official unemployment rate of around 6%, however 20% of the population are described by Scottish National Statistics as &quot;employment deprived&quot;.

A major employer in the town was its founding firm, the John Brown &amp; Company shipyard, which built several well-known ships, including the , &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, as well as the warship . Later it became part of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, which was the scene of a famous &quot;work-in&quot; in the 1970s. The yard and associated engineering works continued to operate under a succession of owners until it was closed in 2000. The site has been redeveloped, with tourist attractions such as the Titan Clydebank Crane and a new campus for Clydebank College, part of the merged institution West College Scotland.

Singer Corporation was also a major industry in Clydebank, providing thousands of jobs to the townsfolk but closed in 1980, with the Clydebank Business Park later created where its famous building used to stand (next to where Singer railway station is now).

The town is home to the independent Clydebank Co-operative Society which has a number of outlets in the town. The town&#x27;s main department store closed in 2013.

==Local transport==

In rail transport, the town is served by , , , , and stations. Bus connections to Glasgow, Dumbarton and the surrounding areas of Clydebank use the bus terminus at the southern end of the Clyde Shopping Centre.

Formerly, the town was connected to the once extensive Glasgow tramway system, being served by routes 9 (via Dumbarton Road) and 1A (via Anniesland). Route 20 served Duntocher. Route 9 (to Dalmuir) was the last service to close. Clydebank held its own &#x27;last tram&#x27; day on 6 September 1962, four days after the official end of tramway operation in Glasgow, bringing to an end the operation of the last major tramway system in Great Britain.

The Erskine Bridge at Old Kilpatrick connects the A82, which bypasses Clydebank to the north of the town, to the M8 motorway running between Greenock, Glasgow Airport, Paisley and the wider Scottish road network.

<text>Charlie, also known as Charlie the Curser, is a female blue-and-yellow macaw who lives in a garden centre in Reigate, Surrey, England.

==Claimed association with Churchill==

The owner claimed the parrot was that of Sir Winston Churchill while he was the United Kingdom&#x27;s prime minister during World War II. He claims that his father-in-law sold the parrot to Churchill in 1937 and then reclaimed the bird shortly after Churchill&#x27;s death in 1965. According to his stories, the vocal bird was taught by Churchill to shout curses at Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany, with which Britain was at war with.

The claim is solidly rejected by the administrators of the Chartwell property, Churchill&#x27;s former country home, who note only that he kept a grey parrot elsewhere. Further, Churchill&#x27;s daughter, Lady Soames, has denied her father ever owned a macaw. She added he owned a grey parrot named Polly, but sold the bird before becoming prime minister. It is reported Charlie has been living at Heathfield Nurseries, where she is most frequently cared for by the establishment&#x27;s manager, Sylvia Martin, who says that she&#x27;s gotten slightly grumpy in her old age but is still a bright bird.

<doc id="435698" wikidata="Q3275036" url="?curid=435698" title="MacsBug">
<text>MacsBug is a low-level (assembly language/machine-level) debugger for the classic Mac OS operating system. MacsBug is an acronym for &quot;Motorola Advanced Computer Systems Debugger&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Macintosh debugger&quot; (The Motorola 68000 Microprocessor is imprinted with the MACSS acronym). The original version was developed by Motorola as a general debugger for its 68000 systems.
— it was ported to the Mac as a programmer&#x27;s tool early in the project&#x27;s development.

MacsBug is invoked by hitting the Macintosh&#x27;s &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Key&quot; or, as it became later known, the &quot;Interrupt Key&quot; or by pressing &quot;Command-Power&quot;. MacsBug offers many commands for disassembling, searching, and viewing data as well as control over processor registers. MacsBug is not installed by default with Mac OS, although every Macintosh since the Macintosh Plus includes a debugger in ROM known as MicroBug.

Users who stumble into MacsBug by accident need only to enter G and press return to escape from MacsBug; however, MacsBug is not installed by default, requiring a system extension, so a typical user environment does not include it. However, it was occasionally installed by end users to provide very basic error recovery. As the classic Mac OS lacked memory protection, &quot;hard crashes&quot; where an application crash simply froze the entire system weren&#x27;t uncommon. With MacsBug installed, instead of an unresponsive system, the user would be dumped into MacsBug, where they could type ES to Exit to Shell (force quit the crashed application and return to the Finder) or RB for ReBoot, which restarted the system. Such recovery efforts were often not successful, with the only alternative a hard reset.

In Mac OS versions 7.5 and later, the presence of MacsBug is indicated at startup; it is present if the user sees the text &quot;Debugger installed&quot; (although, occasionally, this may indicate the presence of another piece of software loaded into the area of memory reserved for the debugger, instead).

MacsBug was originally for the Motorola 68000 series of processors only. When Apple introduced the Power Macintosh in 1994, it was followed by an updated MacsBug that supported the PowerPC instruction set and architecture.

The last version of MacsBug was 6.6.3, released September 14, 2000. This final version works with all of the machines released in the July–September timeframe of 2000, including the Power Mac G4 (uni- and multi-processor), Power Mac G4 Cube, the iMac family (Ruby, Indigo, Sage, Graphite, and Snow), and the iBook family (Indigo, Key Lime, and Graphite).

6.6.3 includes better support for debugging MP tasks, and fixes some serious bugs in the memory setting commands when used in PCI I/O space. It can also be used in Classic when running under Mac OS X, where it is invoked by pressing &quot;⌘-⏏&quot; (or &quot;⌘-F12&quot; on systems without an Eject key).

Mac OS X allows programmers to use familiar MacsBug commands in gdb. This gdb plugin is included with the OS X Developer Tools, located in the directory /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/.

Third party alternatives to MacsBug included ICOM Simulations&#x27; TMON which came with the Darin Adler Extended User Area &amp; Trap Discipline (allowing all documented Mac API parameters to be verified) and the fully symbolic Jasik debugger, which was much more powerful, but harder to use due to the intricate and non-standard user interface.

<doc id="435706" wikidata="Q214926" url="?curid=435706" title="Nikolai Vavilov">
<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov (; – 26 January 1943) was a Russian and Soviet agronomist, botanist and geneticist who identified the centers of origin of cultivated plants. He devoted his life to the study and improvement of wheat, maize and other cereal crops that sustain the global population.

Vavilov became the youngest member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He was a member of the USSR Central Executive Committee, a recipient of the Lenin Prize, and president of All-Union Geographical Society. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Vavilov&#x27;s work was criticized by Trofim Lysenko, whose anti-Mendelian concepts of plant biology had won favor with Joseph Stalin. As a result, Vavilov was arrested and subsequently sentenced to death in July 1941. Although his sentence was commuted to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment, he died in prison in 1943. In 1955, his death sentence was retroactively pardoned under Nikita Khrushchev. By the late 1950s, his reputation was publicly rehabilitated, and he began to be hailed as a hero of Soviet science.

== Early years and education ==

Nikolai Vavilov was born on 25 November 1887 into a merchant family in Moscow, the older brother of physicist Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov. Despite his strict upbringing in the Orthodox Church, he was an atheist.

His father had grown up in poverty due to recurring crop failures and food rationing, and Vavilov became obsessed from an early age with ending famine.

Vavilov entered the Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy (now the Russian State Agrarian University – Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy) in 1906. During this time, he became known for carrying a pet lizard in his pocket wherever he went. He graduated from the Petrovka in 1910 with a dissertation on snails as pests. From 1911 to 1912, he worked at the Bureau for Applied Botany and at the Bureau of Mycology and Phytopathology. From 1913 to 1914, he travelled in Europe and studied plant immunity, in collaboration with the British biologist William Bateson, who helped establish the science of genetics.

== Academic career ==

Throughout his career, Vavilov went on a series of botanical-agronomic expeditions, collecting seeds from many parts of the world, and developing theories of their origins. The first expedition, in 1916, was to Iran, where he collected 171 samples of legume crop seeds new to Russia, including beans, chickpeas, clovers, everlasting peas, lentils, and peas. These finds suggested to him that many cultivated plants including legumes came from a center of origin in Southwest Asia. In 1917, Vavilov was a professor at the Faculty of Agronomy, University of Saratov. In 1920, he became Director of the Bureau of Applied Botany in Leningrad. Later expeditions visited places including the high plains of Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Khoresm oasis, Japan, and Taiwan. The 1921 expedition visited Canada and the United States; Vavilov stated that North America was not a center of plant diversity, finding later that the centers of origin in the Americas were in Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. On his way back from America he visited Western Europe, collecting seeds in Britain, France, Holland, Germany, Poland, and Sweden in 1922.

From 1924 to 1935, he was the director of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences at Leningrad. He travelled the Mediterranean in 1926, visiting France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, North Africa and islands including Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, and Cyprus. He took special interest in legumes such as the chickpea, which he found contributed to soil fertility and added protein to the diets of people and their animals around the Mediterranean. Another expedition visited Jordan, Palestine, and Syria; he returned with seeds of a white lupin from Palestine; they became useful in plant breeding as they came to maturity early. Later expeditions went to Sudan and Ethiopia, where he identified a center of diversity in 1926.

In 1927, Vavilov presented his theory of centers of origin to the public at the Fifth International Congress of Genetics in Berlin. In his institute at Leningrad, he created the world&#x27;s largest collection of plant seeds; by 1933, it contained over 148,000 specimens. The collection became internationally famous, attracting praise from overseas but hostile attention from Joseph Stalin.

In 1929 he went to China, Japan, and Korea, locating another center of cultivated plants in Japan.

In 1932, on his last expedition, he travelled widely in Latin America, visiting Cuba, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay after attending the Sixth International Congress of Genetics in Uruguay.

Vavilov&#x27;s work on the genetic diversity of crop plants across the world spanned the concept of centers of origin, the Darwinian problem of speciation, plant breeding, and a geographical approach to studies of crops, as well as the law of homologous series in variation. 
He is remembered for his contributions to the improvement of varieties of wheat, maize and other cereal crops that sustain the global population. Vavilov was a man of enormous energy, described as having &quot;a mind that never slept and a body which for its capacity for enduring physical hardships can seldom have been matched.&quot; For example, he documented 3,000 types of &quot;Triticum vulgare&quot; wheat, calling them all &quot;perfectly recognizable morphologically&quot;; J. Scott McElroy comments that it is difficult to imagine the time, energy, and knowledge required to collect and describe so many types of one species.

== Eclipse ==

=== Genetics conference debacle ===

In 1932, during the sixth congress, Vavilov proposed holding the seventh International Congress of Genetics in the USSR in 1937. In 1935, Vavilov was elected chairman of the International Congress of Genetics for this purpose, but in 1936 the Politburo cancelled the event; the congress eventually took place in Edinburgh in 1939 instead. The Politburo further prohibited Vavilov from travelling abroad; during the Congress&#x27;s opening ceremony an empty chair was placed on the stage as a symbolic reminder of Vavilov&#x27;s involuntary absence.

=== Lysenko&#x27;s opposition ===

Trofim Lysenko joined the staff of the institute and began to oppose Vavilov, arguing that genetics was nonsense invented by the Roman Catholic monk Gregor Mendel, and proposing his own Lamarckian views of inheritance and evolution, and the idea of improving a crop variety by vernalization. Lysenko had the ear of Stalin, who summoned Vavilov and mocked him in the Kremlin. In 1936, Lysenko arranged for Vavilov to be sacked from his post as head of the institute.

=== Imprisonment and death ===

While collecting seeds in Ukraine in August 1940, Vavilov was arrested by the NKVD (the Soviet secret police) and imprisoned for his opposition to Lysenko; he was accused of spying for the British and ruining Soviet agriculture. After undergoing interrogations, he made a false confession, was found guilty, and sentenced to death in 1941. In 1942, his sentence was commuted to twenty years imprisonment. In 1943, he died in prison in Saratov as a result of the harsh conditions. The prison&#x27;s medical documentation indicates that he had been admitted into the prison hospital a few days prior to his death and mentions the diagnoses of pneumonia, dystrophy and edema as well as general weakness as a complaint, but the death certificate only mentions &quot;decline of cardiac activity&quot;. Some authors assert that the actual cause of death was starvation. 

== Personal life ==

Vavilov&#x27;s son Oleg with his first wife Yekaterina Sakharova was born in 1918. That marriage ended in divorce in 1926, after which he married geneticist Elena Ivanovna Barulina, a specialist on lentils and assistant head of the institute&#x27;s seed collection. Their son Yuri was born in 1928.

== Honors and distinctions ==

Vavilov became the youngest member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He was a member of the USSR Central Executive Committee, a recipient of the Lenin Prize in 1928, and president of All-Union Geographical Society in 1931. He was a fellow of the Royal Society (of London), and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

== Legacy ==

=== Seedbank ===

Vavilov realized that many useful plant varieties would be lost through human action unless specific steps were taken to save them. He was the first botanist to grasp the need for a seedbank, and he was an expert germplasm collector. The Leningrad seedbank was preserved and protected through the 28-month long Siege of Leningrad. While the Soviets had ordered the evacuation of art from the Hermitage Museum, they had not evacuated the 250,000 samples of seeds, roots, and fruits stored in what was then the world&#x27;s largest seedbank. A group of scientists at the Vavilov Institute boxed up a cross section of seeds, moved them to the basement, and took shifts protecting them. Those guarding the seedbank refused to eat its contents, even though by the end of the siege in the spring of 1944, a number of them had died of starvation.

In 1943, parts of Vavilov&#x27;s collection, samples stored within the territories occupied by the German armies, mainly in Ukraine and Crimea, were seized by a German unit headed by Heinz Brücher. Many of the samples were transferred to the Schutzstaffel (SS) Institute for Plant Genetics, which had been established at near Graz, Austria.

=== Economic impact ===

Vavilov combined the skill of collecting distinct varieties of crop plants with theoretical understanding of their significance in botany and the ability to put this knowledge to practical use. In particular, he created the collection of germplasm of leguminous crop plants held at the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (renamed after him in 1967). In turn, this collection supplied the germplasm for more than three quarters of the legume varieties bred in the Soviet Union. By 2010, the institute held 43,000 legume samples, from 160 species in 15 genera. Vavilov&#x27;s work has been continued by later botanists at the institute, for example breeding transgressive forms of lupin (a legume) resistant to the fusarium wilt fungus.

=== Soviet rehabilitation ===

In 1955, Vavilov&#x27;s life sentence was voided at a hearing of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, undertaken as part of a de-Stalinization effort to review Stalin-era death sentences in the time of Nikita Khrushchev. By the late 1950s, his reputation was publicly rehabilitated, and he began to be hailed as a hero of Soviet science.

=== Vavilovian mimicry ===

While studying the origins and evolutionary history of crop plants including cereals, Vavilov observed that weeds are inevitably included with crop seed by seed contamination. A consequence, he stated, was that the weed would evolve to appear progressively more like the crop: whenever a farmer, or a winnowing machine, removed as many weed seeds as possible, only the weed seeds that most closely resembled the crop would survive. Thus, natural selection would be applied unconsciously by the farmer (or by the winnowing machine used to separate the seeds). Vavilov described the cereal rye, which he believed had evolved in this way, as secondary crops. In 1982, Georges Pasteur proposed the name &#x27;Vavilovian mimicry&#x27; for this process.

=== Namesakes ===

Today, a street in downtown Saratov bears Vavilov&#x27;s name. Vavilov&#x27;s monument in Saratov near the end of Vavilov Street was unveiled in 1997. The USSR Academy of Sciences established the Vavilov Award (1965) and the Vavilov Medal (1968). Today, the N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in St. Petersburg still maintains one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of plant genetic material. In 1968, the institute was renamed after Vavilov in time for its 75th anniversary. A minor planet, 2862 Vavilov, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after him and his brother Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov. The crater &quot;Vavilov&quot; on the far side of the Moon is named after him and his brother, a physicist.
=== Media ===

The story of the researchers at the Vavilov Institute during the Siege of Leningrad was fictionalized by novelist Elise Blackwell in her 2003 novel &quot;Hunger&quot;. That novel was the inspiration for the Decemberists&#x27; song &quot;When The War Came&quot; in the 2006 album &quot;The Crane Wife&quot;, which also depicts the Institute during the siege and mentions Vavilov by name.

In 1987, the Shevchenko National Prize was awarded to Anatoliy Borsyuk (film director), Serhiy Dyachenko (script writer), and Oleksandr Frolov (camera) for the film &quot;Star of Vavilov&quot; (Russian: &quot;Звезда Вавилова&quot;) about Vavilov&#x27;s work.

In 1990, a six part documentary entitled Nikolai Vavilov (Russian: Николай Вавилов) was created as a joint production of the USSR and East Germany.

<text>George Robert Wendt Jr. (born October 17, 1948) is an American actor. He is best known for playing Norm Peterson on the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (1982–1993), which earned him six consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. After &quot;Cheers&quot; ended in 1993, he starred in his own sitcom, &quot;The George Wendt Show&quot; (1995), but it was cancelled after only a few episodes. Wendt also appeared in the films &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982), &quot;No Small Affair&quot; (1984), &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; (1994), &quot;Spice World&quot; (1997), &quot;Outside Providence&quot; (1999), &quot;Santa Buddies&quot; (2009), and &quot;Sandy Wexler&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
George Robert Wendt Jr. was born in the Beverly neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, Illinois. His parents were Loretta Mary (née Howard) and George Robert Wendt, an officer in the Navy and a realtor. He is one of nine children, with six sisters—Nancy, Karen, Mary Ann, Kathryn, Loretta, and Marti—as well as two brothers, Tom and Paul. His maternal grandfather was photographer Tom Howard. Wendt is of Irish and one quarter German descent. Wendt is an uncle of actor and former &quot;SNL&quot; writer and cast member Jason Sudeikis, his sister Kathryn&#x27;s son.

He graduated from Campion High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Notre Dame until he was expelled after receiving a 0.00 GPA during his first semester of junior year, reportedly due to challenges associated with living in an off-campus apartment without transportation during winter. He later attended the Jesuit Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri, where he graduated with a B.A. in economics in 1971.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wendt is a 1975 alumnus of The Second City, which he discovered shortly after college. A viewing had inspired him to join and on his first day of employment, he showed up promptly at 11:30 a.m. as he was instructed. The woman working there handed him a broom and said &quot;Welcome to the theater, kid&quot;; thus, his first job in show business was sweeping the floors. Second City, located in Chicago, was also where he met his future wife, Bernadette Birkett, who played Cliff&#x27;s Halloween date in the third season of &quot;Cheers&quot; and later in the series played the voice of Norm&#x27;s never-seen wife, Vera.

Wendt appeared in the 1980 film &quot;My Bodyguard&quot;, and had small roles in the TV series &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Soap&quot;, and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. In 1982, Wendt landed his first role as a series regular on the CBS sitcom &quot;Making the Grade&quot;, which was created by Gary David Goldberg. The series was canceled after six episodes in the spring of that year.

=== &quot;Cheers&quot; ===
From 1982 to 1993, Wendt appeared as Norm Peterson in all 275 episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot;. For his work on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Wendt earned six Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. He also played the role in the short-lived spin-off &quot;The Tortellis&quot;, in an episode of &quot;Wings&quot;, and in an episode of another &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off, &quot;Frasier&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Cheers&quot;===

His first appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was in a season 11 (1985–1986) episode where he shared hosting duties with director Francis Ford Coppola. In 1988 he played the part of &quot;Witten&quot; in the New Zealand-made film, &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. In the early 1990s, Wendt made cameo appearances on several episodes of &quot;SNL&quot; as Bob Swerski, one of the Chicago Superfans (along with cast members Chris Farley, Mike Myers, Robert Smigel, and one-time host, Joe Mantegna). Having grown up as a lifelong fan of his hometown Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bears, Wendt&#x27;s Bob Swerski character is said to be a &quot;spot-on&quot; characterization of Chicago&#x27;s south-side citizens.

In 1989, Wendt appeared as the eponymous protagonist in a BBC TV dramatization of Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s novel &quot;Oblomov&quot;. He has also appeared twice on the original British edition of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; In 1991, Wendt played the father in Michael Jackson&#x27;s music video &quot;Black or White&quot;. He had roles opposite Robert De Niro in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Guilty by Suspicion&quot; and with Mel Gibson in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot;.

Following his success on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Wendt starred in the short-lived &quot;The George Wendt Show&quot;, which featured him as a garage mechanic with a radio show, based on the NPR radio show &quot;Car Talk&quot;. &quot;The George Wendt Show&quot; aired from March through April 1995.

Wendt starred as the killer in one of the last episodes of the TV series &quot;Columbo&quot;, portraying a thoroughbred horse owner in the 1995 episode &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. Wendt appeared as himself on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and has reprised the character Norm Peterson on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Road to Rupert&quot; and &quot;Three Kings&quot;, and the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;. In the same year as his &quot;Frasier&quot; guest appearance, Wendt played the bartender to Ted Danson&#x27;s character in &quot;Becker&quot; (the inverse of their relationship on &quot;Cheers&quot;). In 1994, he appeared in the film &quot;Man of the House&quot; as Chet Bronski, the stepfather of Norman (Zachary Browne), and starred with Chevy Chase, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Farrah Fawcett. He also played the role of Old Man Dunphy&#x27;s closeted homosexual friend Joey in the 1999 film &quot;Outside Providence&quot;.

In early 1997, Wendt joined the cast of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; as Les Polonsky, the new owner of the celebrity tabloid where the series&#x27; main characters worked. Wendt&#x27;s role only lasted 13 episodes as &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; underwent further creative changes for its next season. In 1998, Wendt was one of the three characters in a London West End production of &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; with David Dukes and Stacy Keach. He would later join the Broadway production of the play, starring alongside Judd Hirsch and Joe Morton.

In 2003, Wendt appeared as a celebrity fisherman in the music video for Cobra Verde&#x27;s &quot;Riot Industry&quot; along with Rudy Ray Moore (of &quot;Dolemite&quot; fame) and The Minutemen&#x27;s Mike Watt. He appeared in several episodes of The WB&#x27;s &quot;Sabrina, The Teenage Witch&quot; in 2001 as the title character&#x27;s boss. He also was the host of the A&amp;E reality show &quot;House of Dreams&quot; in 2004. In January 2006, Wendt was seen again on television screens as part of the cast of &quot;Modern Men&quot;.

He has also appeared on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; as a guest on the show. In 2006, Wendt made several appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; where he performed short skits. His appearances on &quot;Late Night&quot; were in all likelihood because the show was having a week-long event in his home town of Chicago.

Wendt performed alongside Richard Thomas in &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; in October 2006 in the Eisenhower Theatre in Washington, D.C.. After the show opened, Wendt was interviewed by local film critic Arch Campbell for a piece on the NBC Washington affiliate WRC. Wendt was asked, &quot;What should people do when they see you around town?&quot; After hesitating for a moment, Wendt held his thumbs up and replied, &quot;If their impulse is to buy me a beer, then by all means, follow that impulse.&quot; In spring 2007, Wendt performed in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; in Los Angeles. Wendt appeared as an American GI in the 2007 Christmas Special episode of British sitcom &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;.

<text>New Forum () was a political movement in East Germany formed in the months leading up to the collapse of the East German state. It was founded on 9 September 1989 and was the first independent (non-National Front) political movement to be recognised by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany-led state on 8 November 1989. In February 1990 it formed Alliance 90 (Bündnis 90) with Democracy Now (Demokratie Jetzt) (DJ) and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights (Initiative für Frieden und Menschenrechte) (IFM).

The New Forum was the first countrywide political movement in the GDR outside the Protestant church. Members of the Peace Movement, including Bärbel Bohley, Ingrid Köppe, Rolf Henrich, Jens Reich and Reinhard Meinel signed the &quot;Aufbruch 89&quot; [Initiative 89] founding proclamation on 9/10 September 1989 in Grünheide, which had been the last home of the dissident Robert Havemann. New Forum demanded a dialogue about democratic reforms, with the aim, together with the largest possible participation from the population, of &#x27;reshaping&#x27; society.

== Timeline ==
* 19 September 1989 – Members apply for registration
* 21 September 1989 – Registration denied by the Interior Ministry: the New Forum is &#x27;anti-state&#x27; and &#x27;illegal&#x27;. Demonstrations follow. The increased pressure forces the authorities to allow New Forum to exist, and finally recognise it as a political organisation.
* By the end of 1989, 200,000 people have signed the proclamation, and there are approx. 10,000 full members. New Forum demands free and democratic elections. Local New Forum groups are active mostly in the cities. Discussions about the development of grass-roots democracy led by the end of 1989 to a dispute over whether New Forum should become a party or remain a movement.
* 27–28 January 1990 – About one quarter of the members (mostly from the southern regions of the GDR) split from New Forum and form the German Forum Party (DFP). New Forum retains its grass-roots democratic structure.
* February 1990 – New Forum joins with other opposition groups (Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte (The Initiative for Peace and Human Rights] and Demokratie Jetzt [Democracy Now]) to form the political party Bündnis 90.
* May 1993 – Bündnis 90 and the West German Green party join to form Bündnis 90/Die Grünen.

<text>A hierophant () is a person who brings religious congregants into the presence of that which is deemed &quot;holy&quot;. As such, a hierophant is an interpreter of sacred mysteries and principles.

The word comes from ancient Greece, where it was constructed from the combination of &#x27; (&quot;ta hiera&quot;, &#x27;the holy&#x27;) and&#x27; (&quot;phainō&quot;, &#x27;to reveal&#x27;).

==Greek priesthood==
&quot;Hierophant&quot; was the title of the chief priest at the Eleusinian Mysteries in ancient Attica. It was an office inherited within the genos of the Eumolpidae, one of the two main clans which managed the Eleusinian cult - the other being the Cerycids. Occasionally from the late fourth century BC and consistently from the first century BC, hierophants practised &quot;hieronymy&quot;, which means that they were referred to during their lifetime as &quot;hierophant&quot; instead of their personal name.

The known hierophants at Eleusis are:
* Zacorus, early 5th century BC
* Theodorus, before 415 - after 408 BC
* Archias, ca. 379 BC
* Lacrateides, before 353 - 350/49 BC or later
* -ottus, c. 333 BC
* Eurymedon, ca. 323 BC
* Eurycleides, ca. 317-307 BC
* &quot;Hierophant&quot; (Mnesiarchus?) son of Nouphrades of Perithoedae, late 4th century BC
* Chaeretius son of Prophetes of Eleusis, ca. 248 BC
* Aristocles of Perithoedae, 183/2-148 BC or later
* Amynomachus adopted son of Eucles of Halae, after 148 BC (natural brother of Aristocles)
* Menecleides son of Theophemus of Kydathenaeum, last quarter of the 2nd century BC
* &quot;Hierophant&quot; son of Eustrophus of Piraeus, last quearter of the 2nd century BC
* Theophemus son of Menecleides of Kydathenaeum, end of the 2nd century BC
* &quot;Hierophant&quot;, ca. 86/5 BC, when he served as eponymous archon
* &quot;Hierophant&quot;, mid-first century AD
* Tiberius Claudius Oenophilus son of Callicratides of Tricorynthus, end of the 1st century AD
* Julius &quot;Hierophant&quot;, end of the 1st century AD
* Titus Flavius Straton, ca. 125 AD
* Firmus &quot;Hierophant&quot; of Gargettus, mid-2nd century AD
* Decimus Ju- of Piraeus, mid-2nd century AD
* &quot;Hierophant&quot; of Hagnous, ca. 138-150 AD
* Julius &quot;Hierophant&quot;, 168-191 or 192 AD
* Tiberius Claudius Apollinarius son of Tiberius Claudius Apollodorus of Acharnae, 191 or 192 - 193/4 AD
* Nummius &quot;Hierophant&quot; of Phaleron, 194 - before 209 AD
* Claudius &quot;Hierophant&quot; of Marathon, ca. 209/10 AD
* Apollonius son of Apollonius, ca. 215 AD
* Heracleides, ca. 220-230 AD
* Logimus, ca. 220-230 AD
* Titus Flavius Glaucus son of Titus Flavius Glaucus of Marathon, ca. 225-235 AD
* &quot;Hierophant&quot;, before or after Glaucus
* Erotius, after 235 AD
* &quot;Hierophant&quot; son of Xenagoras, first half of the 4th century AD.
* Nestorius, before 355 - not long before 392 AD, an associate of Julian the Apostate, and initiator of Eunapius

Eunapius and Vettius Agorius Praetextatus are notable examples.

==In modern culture==
===Rider Waite tarot===
In the Rider–Waite tarot deck and similar decks, &quot;The Hierophant&quot; (known in the Tarot de Marseille as &quot;The Pope&quot;) is one of the twenty-two trump cards comprising the &quot;Major Arcana&quot;, and represents conformity to social standards, or a deference to the established social moral order. As the guide towards knowledge, insight, and wisdom, in a Tarot reading it might, for example, represent a priest, scholar, therapist, or teacher, possibly similar to the Hermit or the King of Cups cards.

A. E. Waite wrote that the Hierophant:...symbolizes also all things that are righteous and sacred on the manifest side. As such, he is the channel of grace belonging to the world of institution as distinct from that of Nature, and he is the leader of salvation for the human race at large. He is the order and the head of the recognized hierarchy, which is the reflection of another and greater hierarchic order; but it may so happen that the pontiff forgets the significance of his symbolic state and acts as if he contained within his proper measures all that his sign signifies or his symbol seeks to shew [sp] forth. He is not, as it has been thought, philosophy—except on the theological side; he is not inspiration; and his is not religion, although he is a mode of its expression.

=== In &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ===
The original &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; supplement to 1st edition AD&amp;D detailed how the 15th-level Grand Druid (the in-game head of all druids) could step down from his position and become a 16th-level Hierophant. In 3rd edition D&amp;D, the hierophant prestige class for high-level divine spellcasters appeared in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; and in the 3.5e &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

<doc id="435728" wikidata="Q138852" url="?curid=435728" title="Democracy Now (East Germany)">
<text>Democracy Now () was a political movement which emerged in East Germany at the time of German reunification, which it helped significantly to shape. It was officially founded on 12 September 1989 and merged with sections of the &quot;Neue Forum&quot; (&quot;New Forum&quot;) and the &quot;Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte&quot; (&quot;Initiative for Peace and Human Rights&quot;) to form &quot;Bündnis 90&quot; (&quot;Alliance 90&quot;) in 1991.

== Historical background ==
Democracy Now had its roots in a working party of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Evangelical Church () in Berlin called &quot;Initiative für Absage an Praxis und Prinzip der Abgrenzung&quot; (&quot;Initiative for the Repudiation of the Practice and Principle of Separation&quot;). In April 1987, the Initiative made an application to the synod of Protestant Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg to pronounce a repudiation of the practice and principle of separation and, at the same time, to make the case for a series of political demands, such as freedom to travel. In its wording, this recalled a 1983 pronouncement of the Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic calling for peace and the &quot;repudiation of the spirit, logic and practice of deterrence&quot;. After the synod had presented the application, initially at two of its committees and then for discussion among its congregations, the working party called for discussion of the issue among all East German Christians. Seminars on the issue were subsequently held. Both synods of the Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic held in September 1987 and September 1988 addressed the issue of societal separation. On 13 August 1989, the 28th anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall, an event was held in the Confessional Church (&quot;Bekenntniskirche)&quot; in the former Berlin borough of Treptow, in which a member of the working party, Hans-Jürgen Fischbeck, demanded the creation of an opposition, coalition movement in favour of democratic reform in East Germany.

== Founding proclamation ==
On 12 September 1989, the founding proclamation of Democracy Now, &quot;Aufruf zur Einmischung in eigener Sache&quot; (&quot;Appeal for Personal Intervention&quot;), was signed by 12 members of the Berlin working party. The proclamation began with the sentence, &quot;Our country is living in a state of internal strife&quot;, and went on to describe the situation in East Germany in several paragraphs. The founding of the people&#x27;s movement &quot;Democracy Now&quot; was called for, At a meeting of representatives in early 1990, a manifesto was to be decided, and a list of candidates for the next &quot;Volkskammer&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Chamber&quot;) elections was to be sought.

&quot;Theses for democratic transformation in East Germany&quot; were attached to the proclamation and these made a number of concrete, political demands for the democratisation of the state and economy, the decoupling of state and society, as well as ecological transformation. The reunification of Germany was also listed as an objective: &quot;We invite Germans in the Federal Republic to work towards a transformation of their society, such that it will enable a new unity among the German People within the community of Europe. For the sake of unity, both German states should reform themselves.&quot;

== History ==
At the end of October 1989, Democracy Now started a petition to change Article 1 of the national constitution, which enshrined the leadership claim of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (&quot;SED&quot;). In November, Democracy Now circulated its proposal for a &quot;four-sided table&quot; which would include representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Democratic Bloc, and members of the church and citizens&#x27; rights movements. In December, this proposal was realised in the form of the Central Round Table. Two representatives of Democracy Now sat at the Round Table, which met from December onwards. 

At the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; Elections in 1990, Democracy Now formed an electoral alliance with the &quot;Neue Forum&quot; and &quot;Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte&quot;, receiving 2.9% of the vote and obtaining 12 of the 400 seats. Together with the eight elected representatives of the East German Green Party, they formed the &quot;Bündnis 90/Grüne&quot; faction. Democracy Now stood for an eco-social market economy, for the rule of law and for the reunification of German in three phases (rapprochement, confederation, federation).

On 21 September 1991 in Potsdam, Democracy Now, sections of the &quot;Neue Forum&quot;, and &quot;Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte&quot; formed &quot;Bündnis 90&quot; as a political party, going on to merge with the Greens in May 1993. The state association &quot;Bündnis 90/Die Grünen in Sachsen&quot; was formed in Saxony in September 1991.

<text>The Klamath Mountains are a rugged and lightly populated mountain range in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon in the western United States. As a mountain system within both the greater Pacific Coast Ranges and the California Coast Ranges, the Klamath Mountains have a varied geology, with substantial areas of serpentinite and marble, and a climate characterized by moderately cold winters with very heavy snowfall and warm, very dry summers with limited rainfall, especially in the south. As a consequence of the geology and soil types, the mountains harbor several endemic or near-endemic trees, forming one of the largest collections of conifers in the world. The mountains are also home to a diverse array of fish and animal species, including black bears, large cats, owls, eagles, and several species of Pacific salmon. Millions of acres in the mountains are managed by the United States Forest Service. The northernmost and largest sub-range of the Klamath Mountains are the Siskiyou Mountains.

==Geography==

Physiographically, the Klamath Mountains include the Siskiyou Mountains, the Marble Mountains, the Scott Mountains, the Trinity Mountains, the Trinity Alps, the Salmon Mountains, and the northern Yolla-Bolly Mountains. They are a section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the Pacific Mountain System (Pacific Coast Ranges) physiographic division. &quot;Klamath Mountains&quot; is the name given to one of California&#x27;s eleven geomorphic provinces.

===Ten highest peaks===
These are the ten highest points in the Klamath Mountains:
# Mount Eddy (Trinity County and Siskiyou County, California; )
# Thompson Peak (Trinity and Siskiyou County, California; )
# Mount Hilton (Trinity and Siskiyou County, California; )
# Caesar Peak (Trinity and Siskiyou County, California; )
# Sawtooth Mountain (Trinity County, California; )
# Wedding Cake Mountain (Trinity County, California; )
# Caribou Mountain (Siskiyou County, California; )
# China Mountain (Siskiyou County, California; )
# Gibson Peak (Trinity County, California; )
# Boulder Peak (Siskiyou County, California; )

===Protected areas===
A large portion of the Klamath Mountains is managed by the United States Forest Service. Several national forests lie in the Klamath Mountains region, including the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Siskiyou National Forest, Klamath National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, and Mendocino National Forest.

The Klamath Mountains contain 11 wilderness areas in both Oregon and California:
*Chanchelulla Wilderness
*Kalmiopsis Wilderness
*Marble Mountain Wilderness
*Mount Lassic Wilderness
*North Fork Wilderness
*Red Buttes Wilderness
*Russian Wilderness
*Siskiyou Wilderness

*Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness
==Recreation==
There are extensive hiking trail systems, recreation areas, and campgrounds both primitive and developed in the Klamaths. A stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) passes through these mountains as well. This section of the PCT is known locally as &quot;The Big Bend&quot; and is the transition from the California Floristic Province to the Cascades.

The Bigfoot Trail is a trail through the Klamath Mountains from the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness to Crescent City, California.

==Geology==
The rocks of the Klamath Mountains originated as island arcs and continental fragments in the Pacific Ocean. The island masses consisted of rifted fragments of pre-existing continents and volcanic island masses created over subduction zones. These island masses contain rocks as old as 500 million years, dating to the early Paleozoic Era. A succession of eight island terranes moved eastward on the ancient Farallon Plate and collided with the North American Plate between 260 and about 130 million years ago. Each accretion left a terrane of rock of a single age. During the accretion, subduction of the plate metamorphosed the overlying rock and produced magma which intruded the overlying rock as plutons. Serpentinite, produced by the metamorphism of basaltic oceanic rocks, and intrusive rocks of gabbroic to granodiorite composition are common rocks within the Klamath terranes.

Subsequent lava flows from active volcanoes in the Cascade Range and the erosion of the Oregon Coast Range to the north partially covered these rocks with basalt and sediments.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
As a consequence of the geology, the mountains harbor rich biodiversity, with several distinct plant communities, including temperate rain forests, moist inland forests, oak forests and savannas, high elevation forests, and alpine grasslands. These communities form the Klamath Mountains ecoregion. One of the principal plant communities in the Klamath Mountains is Mediterranean California Lower Montane Black Oak-Conifer Forest.

The ecoregion includes several endemic or near-endemic species, such as Port Orford cedar or Lawson&#x27;s cypress (&quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot;), foxtail pine (&quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot; spp. &quot;balfouriana&quot;), and Brewer&#x27;s spruce (&quot;Picea breweriana&quot;), forming one of the largest collections of different conifers in the world. The flowering plant &quot;Kalmiopsis leachiana&quot;, also endemic to the Klamaths, is limited to the Siskiyou sub-range in Oregon.

;Conifers
A large concentration of diverse coniferous species of trees exists in these mountains. Thirty conifer species (or more, depending on where one delineates the region) inhabit the area, including two endemic species, the Brewer&#x27;s spruce and the Port Orford cedar, making the Klamath Mountains one of the richest coniferous forest regions of the world in terms of concentrated species diversity. The region also has several edaphic plant communities, adapted to specific soil types, notably serpentine outcrops.
In 1969, Drs. John O. Sawyer and Dale Thornburgh discovered 17 species of conifers in around Little Duck Lake and Sugar Creek in the Russian Wilderness. They called this diverse area the Miracle Mile. In 2013 Richard Moore identified an 18th species, western juniper, in the Sugar Creek canyon. This is now considered the richest assemblage of conifers per unit area in any temperate region on Earth.

Conifer species in the Klamath Mountains include coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; ssp. &quot;menziesii&quot;), Port Orford cedar, ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), sugar pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot;), mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;), western hemlock, white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot; var. &quot;lowiana&quot;), red fir (&quot;A. magnifica&quot; var. &quot;shastensis&quot;), Brewer spruce, coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), western red cedar (&quot;Thuja Plicata&quot;),Pacific yew (&quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;),Western White Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Whitebark Pine, Incense Cedar, Foothill Pine, Foxtail Pine, western Juniper, common juniper, subalpine fir, grand fir,  sitka spruce, Shasta fir, knobcone pine, Engelmann spruce, Noble fir, Bishop Pine, Baker cypress, yellow cedar, shore pine and Jeffrey Pine. The Westernmost stand of Quaking Aspen trees is located in the northern portion of the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness .

;Trinity Alps flora
Typical species of the Trinity Alps region include Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, red fir, white fir, black oak, canyon live oak, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple, California Buckeye, incense cedar, and Jeffrey pine. California&#x27;s northernmost stand of gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;) is found here along the South Fork of the Salmon River.

===Fauna===

The vast forested wildlands, coupled with a low rate of human settlement in the rugged remote terrain, provides excellent habitat for a number of species. Mammal species include mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, lynx, raccoons, martens, fishers, beavers, grey fox, red fox, northern flying squirrel, and plentiful black-tailed deer. Bird species include golden eagles, bald eagles, pileated woodpecker, Flicker woodpecker,band-tailed pigeon, several hawks including goshawks, Red-tailed hawks several large owl species including the spotted owl, plus an extensive variety of additional species both plant and animal.

Grizzly bears, gray wolves, and mule deer once inhabited the area, but were extirpated by European settlers. A project to reintroduce Roosevelt elk began in 1985 in the western Marble Mountains, near Elk Creek. Over the next 10 years the number and placement of reintroduced animals was expanded, and now elk can be seen roaming throughout the Marble Mountain Wilderness, Trinity Alps Wilderness, in the northern Siskiyou Mountains, along the South Fork of the Salmon River, and in small numbers near Trinity Lake and Reading Creek.

Some of the most remote areas are the location of supposed Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings from time to time, and the legendary creature plays a part in the folk tales of the Native American populations.
=== Rivers and fish ===

Major rivers and lakes in the Klamath Mountains include the Klamath River, Trinity River, Smith River, Salmon River, Rogue River, Scott River, upper Sacramento River, Chetco River, Mad River, Van Duzen River, Applegate River, Illinois River, Elk River, South Umpqua River, South Fork Coquille River, Shasta Lake, Trinity Lake, Ruth Lake, Castle Lake, Applegate Lake, and Whiskeytown Lake.

The many mountains, streams and rivers form a major spawning ground for several species of trout and salmon; yet recently, in the last 50 years, some of the fish stocks have fallen drastically, particularly salmon stocks. The ecoregion&#x27;s rivers and streams are home to nine species of native salmonids. The depletions occur mainly due to construction of dams and clearcutting of forests on the rugged slopes of the area contribute to large amounts of silt in the stream beds, which in turn interfere with spawning salmon, as they lay their eggs in exposed gravel beds. The notable fish species are king, kokanee, and silver salmon, brown, brook, and rainbow trout (including steelhead), cutthroat trout, and crappie, bluegill, catfish, and largemouth and smallmouth bass.

<text>The Hotel San Carlos branch in Phoenix, Arizona, also known as San Carlos Hotel, is both an operating hotel and tourist site. It has been associated with ghost sightings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983 as San Carlos Hotel. Hotel San Carlos is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation

== Legend ==
Many employees have said that they have seen ghosts at the hotel, the most commonly mentioned being that of Leone Jensen. This caused the Travel Channel to dedicate part of their show &quot;World Travels&quot; to the hotel. This feature on the hotel was premiered on Monday, January 19, 2004. Whether the ghost sighting theory is a promotional stunt is debatable.

== Historical facts ==

The site where the hotel sits was the location of the first school in Phoenix. The 4-room adobe school was inaugurated in 1874 and was replaced with a larger structure in 1879. The school was enlarged several times in subsequent years but was condemned in 1916, with construction of a luxury hotel in mind. In addition, many area children died during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic that attacked the United States.

In 1919, the land was bought by the Babbitt family (relatives of Bruce Babbitt, former Arizona Governor and Secretary of the Interior), who intended to build a hotel. The San Carlos Hotel project was finally begun by Charles Harris and Dwight D. Heard who purchased the property from the Babbitts. Harris and Heard formed the Hotel San Carlos Company and construction began in 1927. The hotel was designed by nationally known architect George Whitecross Richie in the Italian Renaissance style. Construction was undertaken by Kinnie &amp; Westerhouse General Contractors. The hotel was state of the art with air conditioning (the first in Phoenix), elevators, circulating chilled water in the rooms and steam heat. The hotel grand opening was on March 19, 1928. The hotel was built at a cost of nearly $850,000. Charles Harris was the co-owner and managing partner of the San Carlos, and took over full-time management of the San Carlos after the original manager, Dwight Heard, died in 1929. Harris moved his family into the roof-top bungalow (or penthouse) and worked diligently to keep the San Carlos Hotel open during the Great Depression. The hotel remained in the Harris family until 1967 when Harris&#x27; widow, Elsie, sold the property to an investment group. The investment group was unsuccessful and in 1970 sold the San Carlos to Gregory Melikian. Over the past 43 years, Melikian and his family have owned, operated and lovingly restored the San Carlos Hotel to its original splendor. The Melikian family has been instrumental in saving many historic properties in Phoenix.

The hotel competed with the posh Westward Ho hotel completed nearby the following year, which was located on the site of what once was Phoenix&#x27;s first radio transmitter and whose list of clientele include such celebrities as Jack Dempsey and John F. Kennedy. The San Carlos had its share of celebrities such as Mae West, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Marilyn Monroe and Gene Autry.

On May 7, 1928, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; reported the death of Leone Jensen at the hotel. The article&#x27;s headline read &quot;Pretty blonde jumps from (the) San Carlos (hotel) early today.&quot; Based on what she wrote in her suicide note, it was believed the 22-year-old woman was physically abused by her boyfriend, a bellboy at the Westward Ho. Speculations have been made regarding whether Jensen was pregnant and/or her boyfriend was having an affair with another hotel worker. Because of these theories, the way she died is also debated. While most evidence pointed to suicide, others postulated she could have been pushed by her boyfriend or her boyfriend&#x27;s other girlfriend. There have been numerous reports of sitings of Leone Jensen&#x27;s ghost at the hotel.

Another ghost frequently mentioned by hotel employees is a little girl, possibly around six to nine years old, who is rumored to visit hotel rooms at night and sit crying. Believers think she was probably one of the area children affected either by the school&#x27;s closing or the flu epidemic.

On December 9, 2004, yet another death occurred at the San Carlos, when an unidentified man jumped from the hotel&#x27;s roof.

The Hotel San Carlos in Phoenix, a member of Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, underwent a $1-million remodel in 2003 and work continues on the historic boutique hotel. The hotel faces stiff competition from such five-star hotels as The Phoenician, Arizona Biltmore Hotel the Ritz Carlton, many Hilton Hotels and the Hyatt Regency Phoenix. However, as downtown Phoenix continues its dramatic growth the Hotel San Carlos remains a popular tourist destination in the heart of downtown Phoenix, six blocks from Chase Field (home of the Arizona Diamondbacks), five blocks from Talking Stick Resort Arena (home of the Phoenix Suns), and less than three blocks from the Dodge Theatre, Symphony Hall Phoenix, Orpheum Theatre, the Phoenix Convention Center and the Herberger Performing Arts Center.

The hotel can be briefly seen in the opening shot of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot; as the camera pans the skyline of downtown Phoenix.

<doc id="435747" wikidata="Q316234" url="?curid=435747" title="Initiative for Peace and Human Rights">
<text>The Initiative for Peace and Human Rights () was the oldest opposition group in East Germany. It was founded on 24 January 1986 and was independent of the churches and state. On 7 February 1990 it joined with New Forum and Democracy Now to form the electoral Alliance 90 and merged with them to form the Alliance 90 party on 21 September 1991.

==Before the Peaceful Revolution==
The Initiative emerged from a human rights seminar in East Berlin that was planned for 16 November 1985 but was cancelled by the Berlin-Brandenburg state church due to Stasi pressure. At first, it had a loose organizational structure and about 30 members. People involved in the IFM included Bärbel Bohley, Werner Fischer, Peter Grimm, Ralf Hirsch, Gerd Poppe, Ulrike Poppe, Martin Böttger, Wolfgang Templin and Ibrahim Böhme. It cooperated with the churches but was independent from them. The Initiative campaigned for disarmament and demilitarization and was against any kind of authoritarian structure, the glorification of violence and the exclusion of minorities and foreigners. The positions were published, among others, in the illegal magazine &quot;grenzfall&quot;. In February 1986, a social revolutionary wing led by Thomas Klein and Reinhard Schult split from the Initiative and formed the &quot;Gruppe Gegenstimmen&quot;. 

In January 1988, several members of the IFM were arrested in connection with the state-sponsored Liebknecht-Luxemburg Memorial March in Berlin and subsequently deported to the West. Ralf Hirsch was expatriated. In November 1988, when the Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu was invited to visit East Germany, civil rights activists organized a Romanian evening in the Gethsemane Church in East Berlin in order to draw attention to the violation of fundamental rights and the catastrophic living standards in Romania. Subsequently, several members of the IFM were placed under house arrest during the Ceauşescu visit. These and other &quot;Zersetzung&quot; psychological warfare measures of the Stasi severely hampered the work of the IFM in the subsequent period.

==During the Peaceful Revolution==
On 11 March 1989, the IFM became the first opposition group to expand across all of East Germany. The Initiative&#x27;s activity surged during the Peaceful Revolution, but its numbers were modest compared to the new opposition forces. The first regular East Germany-wide meeting took place on 28 October 1989. Werner Fischer (Berlin), Gerd Poppe (Berlin) and Thomas Rudolph (Leipzig) were elected for six months as speakers. The Initiative was part of the East German Round Table, with two members. Gerd Poppe became a minister without portfolio in the Hans Modrow government on 5 February 1990. On 7 February 1990 it joined with New Forum and Democracy Now to form the electoral Alliance 90. In the 18 March 1990 East German general election, the Alliance scored 2.9% of the vote and received 12 seats in the Volkskammer.

<doc id="435750" wikidata="Q1028491" url="?curid=435750" title="Camelot (musical)">
<text>Camelot is a musical with music by Frederick Loewe and lyrics and a book by Alan Jay Lerner. It is based on the legend of King Arthur as adapted from the 1958 novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; by T. H. White.

The original 1960 production, directed by Moss Hart with orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett and Philip J. Lang, ran on Broadway for 873 performances, winning four Tony Awards. It starred Richard Burton as Arthur, Julie Andrews as Guenevere, and Robert Goulet as Lancelot. 

It spawned several notable productions including four Broadway revivals and a 1967 film adaptation. The 2023 Broadway revival features a revised book by Aaron Sorkin.

The musical has become associated with the Presidency of John F. Kennedy, which is sometimes called the &quot;Camelot Era&quot;, because of an interview with Jackie Kennedy in which she compared her husband&#x27;s presidency to King Arthur&#x27;s reign, specifically mentioning his fondness for the musical and particularly the title song&#x27;s closing lyrics, which end &quot;Camelot&quot;.

==Background==
In 1959, Alan Jay Lerner and Moss Hart decided to adapt T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; as their next project. As discussed in Lerner&#x27;s 1978 book, &quot;The Street Where I Live&quot;, Frederick Loewe, who initially had no interest in the project, agreed to write music, with the understanding that if things went badly, it would be his last score. After the tremendous success of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, expectations were high for a new Lerner and Loewe musical. However, the show&#x27;s production met several obstacles. Lerner&#x27;s wife left him during the writing process, causing him to seek medical attention and delaying the production.

When &quot;Camelot&quot; began rehearsals, it still needed considerable work. However, the producers were able to secure a strong cast, including Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, and Roddy McDowall, as well as Robert Goulet in his first Broadway role. John Cullum also made his Broadway debut as Sir Dinadan; Bruce Yarnell was Sir Lionel. Cullum later replaced McDowall, and William Squire replaced Burton. Other replacements included Patricia Bredin (as of April 16, 1962), Kathryn Grayson (as of October 23, 1962) and Janet Pavek (as of July 9, 1962) for Andrews.

===Tryouts and promotion===
The show premiered in Toronto, at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. It overran drastically — it was supposed to last two hours forty minutes, and instead clocked in at four and a half hours. The curtain came down at twenty minutes to one in the morning; Lerner later noted that &quot;Only &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot; equaled it as a bladder endurance contest.&quot; Noël Coward is supposed to have remarked that the show was &quot;longer than the &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; ... and not nearly as funny!&quot; In spite of this, the morning papers gave generally positive reviews, but hinted that the show needed much work, &quot;i.e.&quot;, drastic editing, in order to succeed. Soon afterwards, Lerner was hospitalized for three weeks with a bleeding ulcer. Soon after he was discharged, Hart suffered his second heart attack, and Lerner stepped in as temporary director for the rest of the out-of-town run. &quot;Camelot&quot; then moved to Boston, edited, but still running well over the intended length. The production team tried to find another director, even phoning José Ferrer, who could not undertake the job. Lerner and Loewe disagreed on how to proceed with the show, as Loewe did not want to make any major changes without Hart&#x27;s guidance. Lerner wrote: &quot;God knows what would have happened had it not been for Richard Burton.&quot; Accepting cuts and changes, he radiated a &quot;faith and geniality&quot; and calmed the fears of the cast. Guenevere&#x27;s song &quot;Before I Gaze at You Again&quot; was given to Andrews at the last minute before the first New York preview, which provoked her famous quote, &quot;Of course, darling, but do try to get it to me the night before.&quot; After the show opened on Broadway, Hart was released from the hospital, and he and Lerner began cutting the play even further. Two songs, &quot;Then You May Take Me To the Fair&quot; and &quot;Fie on Goodness,&quot; were cut a few months into the run (though they remain on the cast album, and the former featured in the 1967 film).

The New York critics&#x27; reviews of the original production were mixed. However, Ed Sullivan approached Lerner and Loewe to create a segment for his television variety program, celebrating the fifth anniversary of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. They decided to do very little from their previous hit and instead to perform four highlights from &quot;Camelot&quot;. The show stimulated ticket sales, and &quot;Camelot&quot; achieved an unprecedented advance sale of three and a half million dollars. Robert Goulet received favorable reviews, most notably for his rendition of the show-stopping romantic ballad &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You&quot;, which became his signature song.

===Aftermath===
After &quot;Camelot&quot;&#x27;s run, Goulet appeared on &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which made him a household name among American audiences.

A week after the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, Kennedy&#x27;s widow, Jackie Kennedy, was interviewed by Theodore H. White, an interview that ran in the December 1963 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In the interview, Jackie stated that the show&#x27;s original cast recording had been a favorite bedtime listening for her husband (who had been Lerner&#x27;s classmate at Harvard University), and that his favorite lines were in the final number: &quot;Don&#x27;t let it be forgot/ That once there was a spot/ For one brief, shining moment/ That was known as Camelot&quot;. She also made a direct comparison to the &quot;Camelot&quot; storyline, saying, &quot;There&#x27;ll be great presidents again... but there&#x27;ll never be another Camelot.&quot;

The veracity of her claim about her husband&#x27;s love of &quot;Camelot&quot; has been disputed. Nevertheless, an association between &quot;Camelot&quot; and Kennedy&#x27;s tenure as president formed immediately in the public consciousness, and has remained in the decades since. Lerner later wrote in his autobiography that, soon after the article came out, a touring production of the show at the Civic Opera House in Chicago had to be stopped after those lines were sung: &quot;there was a sudden wail from the audience. It was not a muffled sob; it was a loud, almost primitive cry of pain. The play stopped, and for almost five minutes everyone in the theater - on the stage, in the wings, in the pit, and in the audience - wept without restraint. Then the play continued...&quot;

The obstacles encountered in producing &quot;Camelot&quot; were hard on the creative partnership of Lerner and Loewe, and the show turned out to be one of their last collaborations (although they did work together to adapt their 1958 movie &quot;Gigi&quot; to the stage in 1973, and collaborated again the following year on the movie musical &quot;The Little Prince&quot;). &quot;Camelot&quot; was Hart&#x27;s last Broadway show. He died of a heart attack in Palm Springs, California, on December 20, 1961.

==Synopsis==

In the 1981 revision of the stage musical, the action starts at the end of the plot as Arthur is about to fight Mordred. 
Arthur asks that Merlin take his memory back to the beginning and the rest of the musical is told in flashback from this frame story. This was a device adopted from the 1967 film adaptation.
The 1981 revision also changes the sequence of some scenes especially in Act II. What follows is a synopsis of the original 1960 version.

===Act I===
King Arthur is nervous about his upcoming arranged marriage and is hiding in a tree. [Merlin] the Magician, his wise tutor, calls Arthur down to warn the young king that he must learn to think for himself. Merlin, who lives backward in time and remembers the future as well as the past, knows he will soon be separated from Arthur. Merlin persuades Arthur to climb down and chides him for his unkingly behavior. Arthur then left alone, ponders both his subjects and his own feelings about the intended nuptials (“I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight?”). Arthur hears someone coming and scampers up the tree again. Guenevere, Arthur&#x27;s intended bride, comes to the woods. She does not like the idea of being Queen, preferring to live the life of an ordinary nobleman&#x27;s daughter, (“Simple Joys of Maidenhood”). She stumbles into Arthur, who initially calls himself “Wart” (his childhood nickname), and then, hearing of her reluctance to marry, tells her of the joys of life in Camelot (“Camelot”). It is love at first sight, and they almost kiss but are interrupted when Arthur&#x27;s attendants come upon the two of them. He is revealed as the King. He tells Guenevere the story of how he pulled the sword from the stone and became king, and she finally agrees to marry him. The wizard Merlin is amused by this development, but his joy turns to sorrow as his memories of the future begin to fade. He realizes that Nimue, a beautiful water nymph, has come to draw him into her cave for eternal sleep (“Follow Me”). He begs Nimue for answers, as he has forgotten if he has warned Arthur about two important individuals, Lancelot and Mordred. His memories fade permanently, though, and he is led away.

Five years later, Arthur sits with Guenevere in his study, discussing his views on knights and chivalry. He explains that he wishes to create a new kind of knight — one that does not pillage and fight but tries to uphold honor and justice. He is eventually inspired, with Guenevere&#x27;s help, to establish the Round Table with the motto “might for right.” Within a few years, Arthur&#x27;s idea leads to the Knights of the Round Table being renowned all over England, and their fame even spreads to France. A young, pretentious and over-religious French prince from Joyous Garde named Lancelot du Lac has heard of the Round Table and is determined to come to Camelot and join Arthur&#x27;s knights, confident that he is perfect for the post (“C’est Moi”). King Pellinore, an elderly man who was a friend of Arthur&#x27;s family, also comes to Camelot to witness Arthur&#x27;s greatness for himself. He inadvertently wanders into the May Day festivities organized by Guenevere (“The Lusty Month of May”). On learning who he is, Guenevere orders a guestroom to be prepared, and has one of the knights escort him to the castle. Pellinore becomes part of the family — he is still present at the musical&#x27;s conclusion, many years later. As Pellinore departs, King Arthur arrives with Lancelot, and introduces him to the company. Guenevere is put off by Lancelot&#x27;s boastful manner and her attempts to draw him into conversation seem only intended to prove him wrong about his apparently unrealistic claims about his own prowess. The knights and ladies of the court watch in amusement. Guenevere incites three of the knights — Sir Dinadan, Sir Sagramore, and the burly Sir Lionel — to challenge Lancelot to a joust (“Then You May Take Me to the Fair”). Arthur (who, unlike everybody else, is friendly with Lancelot) is dismayed by this, and is at a loss to understand a woman&#x27;s ways — though he cannot be angry with Guenevere (“How to Handle a Woman”).

In the jousting match, Lancelot easily defeats all three knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, so badly that the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot&#x27;s distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live seem to resurrect a dead man. Whether it is an actual miracle or not, the entire court believes it to be one, and all the knights and ladies bow or curtsy to Lancelot, paying homage to him as he passes by. Guenevere curtsies to him, too, and as he kneels before her, their eyes lock, and both seem to realize something that neither understood before. Arthur notices their silent exchange. In the scenes that follow, Guenevere is torn between her new love for Lancelot and her love and loyalty for Arthur. She wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot (“Before I Gaze at You Again”). In spite of Lancelot&#x27;s boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, he is also madly in love with Guenevere and also torn by the conflict between that love and his devotion to Arthur, who makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. Arthur, realizing that Lancelot and Guenevere have feelings for each other, hopes it will blow over and soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur that they will rise to the challenges they will all face together.

===Act II===
Many years later, Guenevere and Lancelot are still tormented by their unfulfilled love. She tries to get rid of him, but Lancelot will not leave her (“If Ever I Would Leave You”). They both believe that Arthur is not aware of it. Nevertheless, she remains faithful to Arthur and helps him in carrying out the affairs of State.

Mordred, Arthur&#x27;s illegitimate son, comes to Camelot to dishonor the King and tries to gain the throne for himself. Arthur puts him in charge of the knights’ training program, not knowing that Mordred is there to destroy the Round Table in revenge against Arthur for abandoning him, and that he detests the idea of being a Knight (“The Seven Deadly Virtues”). Arthur begins to feel the strain of ruling England, and both he and Guenevere wonder what commoners do without any such responsibilities (“What Do The Simple Folk Do?”).

Mordred, meanwhile, has devised a plan to ruin Arthur and his kingdom permanently. He enters an enchanted glade where his aunt, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, dwells in an invisible castle. Morgan has a sweet tooth, and though she likes Arthur, Mordred manages to bribe her with a large supply of sweetmeats to build one of her invisible walls around Arthur for one night, so that when he goes on his hunting trip the next day, he will not be able to get back to the castle (“The Persuasion”). Meanwhile, Mordred incites the Knights to remember their former days of fighting and pillaging and turns them against Arthur (“Fie On Goodness!”).

With Arthur gone, Lancelot, unable to stop himself, visits Guenevere in her chambers, as Mordred fully suspected he would. They kiss passionately (“I Loved You Once in Silence”). However, Lancelot and Guenevere&#x27;s affair and Mordred&#x27;s machinations come to a head when Mordred and some of the Knights of the Round Table interrupt, accuse Lancelot of treason, and try to take him prisoner. Lancelot fights them off and escapes, but Guenevere is arrested, tried, found guilty of treason by reason of her infidelity, and sentenced to be burned at the stake (“Guenevere”). At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guenevere, whom he still loves in spite of everything. At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guenevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.

For the sake of his own honor and that of Camelot, Arthur must now wage war against Lancelot. Mordred has taken up his own army against Arthur, back in England. The war takes a terrible toll on Camelot, as more than half of the Knights of the Round Table are killed. Before the final battle, Arthur meets Lancelot and Guenevere. Lancelot and Guenevere&#x27;s relationship has foundered, doubtless because of their guilty consciences. Guenevere has become a nun, and the Round Table is now broken. They offer to face up to justice in England, but Arthur will not see Guenevere burned or Lancelot beheaded. He forgives them both, and they depart separately. That night in camp, Arthur meets a young stowaway named Tom of Warwick (likely Sir Thomas Malory), who has come to join the Round Table. His speech reminds Arthur of the idealism and hope that he had as a young king, and inspires him. Arthur knights Tom and sends him back to England to grow up there, that he might pass on to future generations the ideals of chivalry and Camelot (&quot;Camelot&quot; (reprise)).

===Revisions to the 2023 Broadway revival===

The Aaron Sorkin-penned revision of the book excises all magic, makes Merlin a sage, and Morgan Le Fay a scientist heralding the Age of Enlightenment as well as Mordred&#x27;s mother and Arthur&#x27;s ex-partner, and removes the character of Nimue. The new book also underscores democracy and a more egalitarian society. Act I begins with Arthur’s retinue alert, waiting for the arrival of Guenevere’s carriage from France as part of a peace treaty, and critiquing her flouting of tradition by disembarking at the bottom of the hill instead of atop. Guenevere is more contemporary and is cold to Arthur in their meeting, replacing their love-at-first-sight encounter. She seems bound by duty in/to her marriage, rather than love, and serves as an advisor to Arthur rather than a mere consort. Despite this, near the conclusion of Act II, a tearful Guenevere admits to Arthur that she has loved him since their first meeting and wishes he could see himself the way she has. 

The knights are mistrustful of Guenevere because she is a French foreigner. Pellinore is an older knight who takes on Merlin’s role of sage/advisor. Arthur steps in as the final jouster and is the one revived by Lancelot. It is revealed that Arthur has written Morgan Le Fay a letter every week for the past four years, despite never receiving a reply, begging her and Mordred to live in the castle. This long-standing faithfulness stirs Guenevere’s jealousy and fear when Arthur pays Le Fay a visit as a result of a forged letter from Mordred. Lancelot, torn between his duty to Arthur and the Knights and his forbidden love of Guenevere, agrees to guard her one final night before returning to France when Arthur pays Le Fay a visit.

==Productions and adaptations==

=== Original production and tours ===
&quot;Camelot&quot; opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on December 3, 1960, and closed on January 5, 1963, after 873 performances and 2 previews. Directed by Moss Hart, the choreography was by Hanya Holm, scenic design by Oliver Smith, costume design by Adrian (who worked on the designs prior to his death in September 1959) and Tony Duquette, and lighting design by Abe Feder. It won four Tony Awards. The original cast album was America&#x27;s top-selling mono LP record for 6 weeks.

A two-year U.S. tour followed the Broadway closing, starring Kathryn Grayson and William Squire, who was succeeded by Louis Hayward. Grayson was dismissed in Cincinnati, OH, for having missed performances and replaced by her understudy, Jan Moody. There was also a 1963–1964 bus-and-truck tour starring Biff McGuire as Arthur, Jeannie Carson as Guenevere, and Sean Garrison as Lancelot. Yet another company toured with the show in 1964, starring Howard Keel as Arthur, Constance Towers as Guenevere, and Bob Holiday as Lancelot. Also in 1964 an Australian production opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, starring Paul Daneman and Jacqueline McKeever, with stage design by John Truscott. Truscott would later work on the film adaptation. The production, by the J. C. Williamson company, ran for two years.

=== Original and revived West End productions ===
The London production opened in August 1964 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and featured Laurence Harvey as Arthur, Elizabeth Larner as Guenevere and Barry Kent as Lancelot. It played for 518 performances.

Richard Harris again played Arthur in a West End revival at the Apollo Victoria Theatre, London, from November 23, 1982 to February 5, 1983 with Fiona Fullerton, William Squire and Robert Meadmore.

=== Broadway revivals ===
The show was revived on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre from November 15, 1981, to January 2, 1982, and was broadcast on HBO a year later, starring Richard Harris as Arthur, Meg Bussert as Guenevere, Muenz as Lancelot and Thor Fields as Tom of Warwick. Harris, who had starred in the film, and Muenz also took the show on tour nationwide. The book for this version was slightly revised, including the addition of a frame story in which the show opens with an older Arthur looking back on his life, a device taken from the 1967 film version. Scenes had their sequence changed, mainly in Act II.

Richard Burton reprised his role as Arthur in a revival that ran from July 8, 1980, to August 23, 1980, at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Christine Ebersole played Guenevere, and Richard Muenz was Lancelot.

Another Broadway revival ran from June 21, 1993 to August 7, 1993 for 56 performances at the Gershwin Theatre as a stop on a national tour, with Robert Goulet now cast in the role of Arthur. Goulet reprised this role at Toronto&#x27;s O&#x27;Keefe Centre in 1993.

In March 2022, it was reported that Aaron Sorkin and Bartlett Sher were working on a reimagined production for Broadway, which was to begin performances on Thursday, November 3 and open on Thursday, December 8 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. In June 2022, it was announced that the revival had been postponed to the spring of 2023. It began previews on March 9, 2023, with an official opening on Thursday, April 13, 2023. Cast members included Andrew Burnap as Arthur, Phillipa Soo as Guenevere, and Jordan Donica as Lancelot. A cast recording was released on June 2nd, 2023. The show was nominated for five Tonys, but won none, and reviews were mixed. The production closed on July 23, 2023, after 38 previews and 115 regular performances. Plans for a U.S. national tour and West End production were announced, but later cancelled.

==Critical response==
The New York critics&#x27; reviews of the original production were mixed to positive. A 1993 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the musical &quot;has grown in stature over the years, primarily because of its superb score ... [which] combined a lyrical simplicity with a lush romanticism, beautifully captured in numbers like &#x27;I Loved You Once in Silence&#x27; and &#x27;If Ever I Would Leave You.&#x27; These ballads sung by Guenevere and Lancelot are among the most memorable in the Lerner-Loewe catalogue. King Arthur supplies the wit, with songs like &#x27;I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight.&#x27;&quot; A 2003 review noted, &quot;this musically rich, legend-based classic evokes enough swashbuckling spectacle to keep one smiling. And for lovers of dime-store romance, &quot;Camelot&quot; has it all — a beautiful English princess swept off her feet by a shy, but passionate bachelor king; an ardent French knight, torn between devotion to his liege and an uncontrollable hunger, reciprocated, to be sure, for the king&#x27;s tempestuous wife... &quot;Camelot&quot; features a score rich in English country-tune charm by Mr. Lerner. [&quot;sic&quot;: Loewe wrote the music] Its lyrics, by Mr. Loewe [&quot;sic&quot;: Lerner wrote the lyrics], never fail to dazzle with their virtuosity and wit.&quot; However, &quot;Jay Lerner&#x27;s murky book... has helped sink many a revival of the musical... It&#x27;s a good story, but Lerner&#x27;s book is talky and dense, filled with pontificating soliloquies that would have been more powerfully contained in song. Moreover, while the entire show rushes towards a bloody climax... when it finally arrives, it is merely sketched upon in one song, &#x27;Guenevere.&#x27; ...The score, though, is pure magic.&quot;

<text>Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets, is a 1997 book by University of Arizona Planetary Sciences professor emeritus John S. Lewis that describes possible routes for accessing extraterrestrial resources, either for use on Earth or for enabling space colonization. Each issue or proposal is evaluated for its effects on humanity, physics and economic feasibility based on planetary science. For instance, Chapter 5 (&quot;Asteroids and Comets in our Backyard&quot;) exhaustively catalogs the types of near-Earth objects (asteroids and extinct comets whose orbits intersect Earth&#x27;s), assessing both the harms likely from possible collisions with Earth (the subject of Prof. Lewis&#x27;s previous book, &quot;Rain of Iron and Ice&quot;) on the one hand, and their potential for profitable exploitation on the other.

To illustrate this potential, Lewis includes an order-of-magnitude estimate of the economic value of the &quot;smallest&quot; known metallic (&quot;M-type&quot;) near-Earth asteroid: 3554 Amun. With its diameter of 2 kilometers and assumed composition similar to typical iron-type meteorites, he calculated a mass of 3 (30 billion) tons and a 1996 market value of $8 trillion for its iron and nickel alone, another $6 trillion for its cobalt, and $6 trillion more for its platinum-group metals.
(Of course these numerical values must not be taken too seriously, partly due to the large variations in commodity prices with time, and even more because of the great impact on market prices such huge quantities of materials—especially precious materials—would inevitably have. They merely serve to suggest that the economic benefits of obtaining such enormous resources would probably far exceed the costs involved in accessing them.)

In general, like previous space advocates such as Princeton&#x27;s Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, Lewis responds to the limits to growth on Earth with detailed plans to first ameliorate them by accessing space resources on Earth, followed by human space colonization of the entire Solar System. In this light, he asserts that &quot;Shortage of resources is not a fact; it is an illusion born of ignorance&quot;. He claims that colonies built with the natural resources of the asteroid belt alone, including limitless space-based solar power, could eventually support a vast civilization of &quot;several tens of quadrillion ()s of people&quot;. He closes the book with an assertion that this vast population could be a very good thing. &quot;Intelligent life, once liberated by the resources of space, is the greatest resource in the solar system ... the highest fulfillment of life is unbounded intelligence and compassion&quot;

<text>Control charts are graphical plots used in production control to determine whether quality and manufacturing processes are being controlled under stable conditions. (ISO 7870-1) 
The hourly status is arranged on the graph, and the occurrence of abnormalities is judged based on the presence of data that differs from the conventional trend or deviates from the control limit line.
Control charts are classified into Shewhart individuals control chart (ISO 7870-2) and CUSUM(CUsUM)(or cumulative sum control chart)(ISO 7870-4).

Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts (after Walter A. Shewhart) or process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control. It is more appropriate to say that the control charts are the graphical device for statistical process monitoring (SPM). Traditional control charts are mostly designed to monitor process parameters when the underlying form of the process distributions are known. However, more advanced techniques are available in the 21st century where incoming data streaming can-be monitored even without any knowledge of the underlying process distributions. Distribution-free control charts are becoming increasingly popular.

== Overview ==
If analysis of the control chart indicates that the process is currently under control (i.e., is stable, with variation only coming from sources common to the process), then no corrections or changes to process control parameters are needed or desired. In addition, data from the process can be used to predict the future performance of the process. If the chart indicates that the monitored process is not in control, analysis of the chart can help determine the sources of variation, as this will result in degraded process performance. A process that is stable but operating outside desired (specification) limits (e.g., scrap rates may be in statistical control but above desired limits) needs to be improved through a deliberate effort to understand the causes of current performance and fundamentally improve the process.

The control chart is one of the seven basic tools of quality control. Typically control charts are used for time-series data, also known as continuous data or variable data. Although they can also be used for data that has logical comparability (i.e. you want to compare samples that were taken all at the same time, or the performance of different individuals); however the type of chart used to do this requires consideration.

==History==
The control chart was invented by Walter A. Shewhart working for Bell Labs in the 1920s. The company&#x27;s engineers had been seeking to improve the reliability of their telephony transmission systems. Because amplifiers and other equipment had to be buried underground, there was a stronger business need to reduce the frequency of failures and repairs. By 1920, the engineers had already realized the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process. Moreover, they had realized that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality. Shewhart framed the problem in terms of common- and special-causes of variation and, on May 16, 1924, wrote an internal memo introducing the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart&#x27;s boss, George Edwards, recalled: &quot;Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic control chart. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control.&quot; Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only common-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically.

Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood that data from physical processes typically produce a &quot;normal distribution curve&quot; (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly referred to as a &quot;bell curve&quot;). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.

In 1924, or 1925, Shewhart&#x27;s innovation came to the attention of W. Edwards Deming, then working at the Hawthorne facility. Deming later worked at the United States Department of Agriculture and became the mathematical advisor to the United States Census Bureau. Over the next half a century, Deming became the foremost champion and proponent of Shewhart&#x27;s work. After the defeat of Japan at the close of World War II, Deming served as statistical consultant to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. His ensuing involvement in Japanese life, and long career as an industrial consultant there, spread Shewhart&#x27;s thinking, and the use of the control chart, widely in Japanese manufacturing industry throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

Bonnie Small worked in an Allentown plant in the 1950s after the transistor was made. Used Shewhart&#x27;s methods to improve plant performance in quality control and made up to 5000 control charts. In 1958, &quot;The Western Electric Statistical Quality Control Handbook&quot; had appeared from her writings and led to use at AT&amp;T.

==Chart details==

A control chart consists of:
* Points representing a statistic (e.g., a mean, range, proportion) of measurements of a quality characteristic in samples taken from the process at different times (i.e., the data)
* The mean of this statistic using all the samples is calculated (e.g., the mean of the means, mean of the ranges, mean of the proportions) - or for a reference period against which change can be assessed. Similarly a median can be used instead.
* A centre line is drawn at the value of the mean or median of the statistic
* The standard deviation (e.g., sqrt(variance) of the mean) of the statistic is calculated using all the samples - or again for a reference period against which change can be assessed. in the case of XmR charts, strictly it is an approximation of standard deviation, the does not make the assumption of homogeneity of process over time that the standard deviation makes.
* Upper and lower control limits (sometimes called &quot;natural process limits&quot;) that indicate the threshold at which the process output is considered statistically &#x27;unlikely&#x27; and are drawn typically at 3 standard deviations from the center line

The chart may have other optional features, including:
* More restrictive upper and lower warning or control limits, drawn as separate lines, typically two standard deviations above and below the center line. This is regularly used when a process needs tighter controls on variability. 
* Division into zones, with the addition of rules governing frequencies of observations in each zone
* Annotation with events of interest, as determined by the Quality Engineer in charge of the process&#x27; quality
* Action on special causes
(n.b., there are several rule sets for detection of signal; this is just one set. The rule set should be clearly stated.)

# Any point outside the control limits
# A Run of 7 Points all above or all below the central line - Stop the production 
#* Quarantine and 100% check 
#* Adjust Process.
#* Check 5 Consecutive samples
#* Continue The Process.
# A Run of 7 Point Up or Down - Instruction as above

===Chart usage===

If the process is in control (and the process statistic is normal), 99.7300% of all the points will fall between the control limits. Any observations outside the limits, or systematic patterns within, suggest the introduction of a new (and likely unanticipated) source of variation, known as a special-cause variation. Since increased variation means increased quality costs, a control chart &quot;signaling&quot; the presence of a special-cause requires immediate investigation.

This makes the control limits very important decision aids. The control limits provide information about the process behavior and have no intrinsic relationship to any specification targets or engineering tolerance. In practice, the process mean (and hence the centre line) may not coincide with the specified value (or target) of the quality characteristic because the process design simply cannot deliver the process characteristic at the desired level.

Control charts limit specification limits or targets because of the tendency of those involved with the process (e.g., machine operators) to focus on performing to specification when in fact the least-cost course of action is to keep process variation as low as possible. Attempting to make a process whose natural centre is not the same as the target perform to target specification increases process variability and increases costs significantly and is the cause of much inefficiency in operations. Process capability studies do examine the relationship between the natural process limits (the control limits) and specifications, however.

The purpose of control charts is to allow simple detection of events that are indicative of an increase in process variability. This simple decision can be difficult where the process characteristic is continuously varying; the control chart provides statistically objective criteria of change. When change is detected and considered good its cause should be identified and possibly become the new way of working, where the change is bad then its cause should be identified and eliminated.

The purpose in adding warning limits or subdividing the control chart into zones is to provide early notification if something is amiss. Instead of immediately launching a process improvement effort to determine whether special causes are present, the Quality Engineer may temporarily increase the rate at which samples are taken from the process output until it is clear that the process is truly in control. Note that with three-sigma limits, common-cause variations result in signals less than once out of every twenty-two points for skewed processes and about once out of every three hundred seventy (1/370.4) points for normally distributed processes. The two-sigma warning levels will be reached about once for every twenty-two (1/21.98) plotted points in normally distributed data. (For example, the means of sufficiently large samples drawn from practically any underlying distribution whose variance exists are normally distributed, according to the Central Limit Theorem.)

===Choice of limits===
Shewhart set &quot;3-sigma&quot; (3-standard deviation) limits on the following basis.

*The coarse result of Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality that, for any probability distribution, the probability of an outcome greater than &quot;k&quot; standard deviations from the mean is at most 1/&quot;k&quot;2.
*The finer result of the Vysochanskii–Petunin inequality, that for any unimodal probability distribution, the probability of an outcome greater than &quot;k&quot; standard deviations from the mean is at most 4/(9&quot;k&quot;2).
*In the Normal distribution, a very common probability distribution, 99.7% of the observations occur within three standard deviations of the mean (see Normal distribution).

Shewhart summarized the conclusions by saying:
&quot;... the fact that the criterion which we happen to use has a fine ancestry in highbrow statistical theorems does not justify its use. Such justification must come from empirical evidence that it works. As the practical engineer might say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&quot;
Although he initially experimented with limits based on probability distributions, Shewhart ultimately wrote:
&quot;Some of the earliest attempts to characterize a state of statistical control were inspired by the belief that there existed a special form of frequency function&quot; f &quot;and it was early argued that the normal law characterized such a state. When the normal law was found to be inadequate, then generalized functional forms were tried. Today, however, all hopes of finding a unique functional form&quot; f &quot;are blasted.&quot;
The control chart is intended as a heuristic. Deming insisted that it is not a hypothesis test and is not motivated by the Neyman–Pearson lemma. He contended that the disjoint nature of population and sampling frame in most industrial situations compromised the use of conventional statistical techniques. Deming&#x27;s intention was to seek insights into the cause system of a process &quot;...under a wide range of unknowable circumstances, future and past...&quot; He claimed that, under such conditions, &quot;3-sigma&quot; limits provided &quot;... a rational and economic guide to minimum economic loss...&quot; from the two errors:

#&quot;Ascribe a variation or a mistake to a special cause (assignable cause) when in fact the cause belongs to the system (common cause).&quot; (Also known as a Type I error or False Positive)
#&quot;Ascribe a variation or a mistake to the system (common causes) when in fact the cause was a special cause (assignable cause).&quot; (Also known as a Type II error or False Negative)

===Calculation of standard deviation===

As for the calculation of control limits, the standard deviation (error) required is that of the common-cause variation in the process. Hence, the usual estimator, in terms of sample variance, is not used as this estimates the total squared-error loss from both common- and special-causes of variation.

An alternative method is to use the relationship between the range of a sample and its standard deviation derived by Leonard H. C. Tippett, as an estimator which tends to be less influenced by the extreme observations which typify special-causes.

==Rules for detecting signals==

The most common sets are:

*The Western Electric rules
*The Wheeler rules (equivalent to the Western Electric zone tests)
*The Nelson rules

There has been particular controversy as to how long a run of observations, all on the same side of the centre line, should count as a signal, with 6, 7, 8 and 9 all being advocated by various writers.

The most important principle for choosing a set of rules is that the choice be made before the data is inspected. Choosing rules once the data have been seen tends to increase the Type I error rate owing to testing effects suggested by the data.

==Alternative bases==

In 1935, the British Standards Institution, under the influence of Egon Pearson and against Shewhart&#x27;s spirit, adopted control charts, replacing &quot;3-sigma&quot; limits with limits based on percentiles of the normal distribution. This move continues to be represented by John Oakland and others but has been widely deprecated by writers in the Shewhart–Deming tradition.

==Performance of control charts==

When a point falls outside the limits established for a given control chart, those responsible for the underlying process are expected to determine whether a special cause has occurred. If one has, it is appropriate to determine if the results with the special cause are better than or worse than results from common causes alone. If worse, then that cause should be eliminated if possible. If better, it may be appropriate to intentionally retain the special cause within the system producing the results.

Even when a process is &quot;in control&quot; (that is, no special causes are present in the system), there is approximately a 0.27% probability of a point exceeding &quot;3-sigma&quot; control limits. So, even an in control process plotted on a properly constructed control chart will eventually signal the possible presence of a special cause, even though one may not have actually occurred. For a Shewhart control chart using &quot;3-sigma&quot; limits, this &quot;false alarm&quot; occurs on average once every 1/0.0027 or 370.4 observations. Therefore, the &quot;in-control average run length&quot; (or in-control ARL) of a Shewhart chart is 370.4.

Meanwhile, if a special cause does occur, it may not be of sufficient magnitude for the chart to produce an immediate &quot;alarm condition&quot;. If a special cause occurs, one can describe that cause by measuring the change in the mean and/or variance of the process in question. When those changes are quantified, it is possible to determine the out-of-control ARL for the chart. 

It turns out that Shewhart charts are quite good at detecting large changes in the process mean or variance, as their out-of-control ARLs are fairly short in these cases. However, for smaller changes (such as a &quot;1-&quot; or &quot;2-sigma&quot; change in the mean), the Shewhart chart does not detect these changes efficiently. Other types of control charts have been developed, such as the EWMA chart, the CUSUM chart and the real-time contrasts chart, which detect smaller changes more efficiently by making use of information from observations collected prior to the most recent data point.

Many control charts work best for numeric data with Gaussian assumptions. The real-time contrasts chart was proposed to monitor process with complex characteristics, e.g. high-dimensional, mix numerical and categorical, missing-valued, non-Gaussian, non-linear relationship.

==Criticisms==

Several authors have criticised the control chart on the grounds that it violates the likelihood principle. However, the principle is itself controversial and supporters of control charts further argue that, in general, it is impossible to specify a likelihood function for a process not in statistical control, especially where knowledge about the cause system of the process is weak.

Some authors have criticised the use of average run lengths (ARLs) for comparing control chart performance, because that average usually follows a geometric distribution, which has high variability and difficulties.

Some authors have criticized that most control charts focus on numeric data. Nowadays, process data can be much more complex, e.g. non-Gaussian, mix numerical and categorical, or be missing-valued.

==Types of charts==

†Some practitioners also recommend the use of Individuals charts for attribute data, particularly when the assumptions of either binomially distributed data (p- and np-charts) or Poisson-distributed data (u- and c-charts) are violated. Two primary justifications are given for this practice. First, normality is not necessary for statistical control, so the Individuals chart may be used with non-normal data. Second, attribute charts derive the measure of dispersion directly from the mean proportion (by assuming a probability distribution), while Individuals charts derive the measure of dispersion from the data, independent of the mean, making Individuals charts more robust than attributes charts to violations of the assumptions about the distribution of the underlying population. It is sometimes noted that the substitution of the Individuals chart works best for large counts, when the binomial and Poisson distributions approximate a normal distribution. i.e. when the number of trials for p- and np-charts or for u- and c-charts.

Critics of this approach argue that control charts should not be used when their underlying assumptions are violated, such as when process data is neither normally distributed nor binomially (or Poisson) distributed. Such processes are not in control and should be improved before the application of control charts. Additionally, application of the charts in the presence of such deviations increases the type I and type II error rates of the control charts, and may make the chart of little practical use.

<text>The Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ World-Wide was an African-American Oneness Pentecostal denomination started in 1927 in Washington, DC. In 1997, a division over who was the rightful successor to Presiding Bishop and founder Smallwood Edmond Williams occurred. This dispute ultimately led to the splitting of the church into two separate organizations: a church of the same name led by Huie L. Rogers and the International Bible Way Church Of Jesus Christ led by Cornelius Showell.
The church&#x27;s chief officer was the Presiding Bishop. Both successor bodies conduct a general conference annually in July and operate a publishing house in Washington, DC.

== Beliefs and organization ==
Beliefs of the Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ and its successors include the inspiration of the Bible as the word of God; salvation made possible only through Jesus Christ; the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues; water baptism by immersion in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; the premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ; the final judgment of the dead; and the establishment of new heavens and a new earth. However, unlike Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic, or Eastern Orthodox Christianity, it is a non-Trinitarian offshoot religion based upon the Old and New Testaments, teaching that there is only one person in God, i.e. Jesus Christ, and not a Trinity of persons as Christianity confirmed at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD. See Oneness Pentecostalism.

The church was led by a Presiding Bishop and a General Assembly. The General Assembly was composed of bishops, overseers, district elders, pastors, elders, ministers, deacons, missionaries, and laity. Bishops in the church do not claim or maintain succession from the original 12 apostles.

== History ==
The Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ was organized in September 1927 by Smallwood Edmond Williams, who at the time was the General Secretary of the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith (COOLJC). Under Williams&#x27; leadership, about 70 churches withdrew from that organization to form the Bible Way Church, citing the autocratic leadership of COOLJC leader and founder, Bishop Robert C. Lawson. Nearly half of the 177 churches in the organization left and followed Williams. He and four other leading ministers from COOLJC and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World were soon formally ordained as bishops in a ceremony performed by Bishop John Holly of the PAW. Williams became the first Presiding Bishop of the church.

Williams&#x27; daughter, Pearl Williams-Jones, served as the minister of music at the church for many years.

=== Schism ===
A division developed over church governance. After the death of Williams in 1991, the church considered Rogers and Campbell each as a potential leader and visionary for the church. The &quot;Order of Succession and Constitution&quot;, ratified after the death of Williams, stated that both Lawrence Campbell and Rogers would each serve a three-year trial term. Then the church body would vote to see who would be the official successor to Williams. It is generally agreed that, during the trial period, Campbell was selected to serve the first term and Rogers the second. The order of succession also held that Campbell would serve as Vice Presiding Bishop under Rogers at the end of his tenure as Presider however Campbell refused to do so because he saw it as a demotion. This led to a break down of the order of succession.

On July 4, 1997, during the 40th Convocation, the General Assembly voted to retain Rogers and his administration for a &quot;Sabbath&quot; year. The reasoning being that during the General Assembly a motion was offered on the floor to accept the Sabbath resolution, which held in part,&quot; that voting would be postponed for a Sabbath year and all current officers would remain in place until July of 1998.&quot; The motion passed with about 85% in favor and 15% against. But the majority of Bishops wanted Campbell and what happened next came to be called, &quot;the schism&quot;.

There are now two separate and distinct organizations: Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ World Wide, Inc. headquartered in Brooklyn, New York, and The International Bible Way Church Of Jesus Christ, Inc., headquartered in Washington, DC.

=== International Bible Way Church Of Our Lord Jesus Christ ===
Most bishops, pastors, and churches continued to follow Campbell, making this branch the largest of the two, with approximately 1,000 or more churches worldwide as of 2012. In 2006, Bishop Cornelius Showell, pastor of First Apostolic Faith Church in Baltimore, was appointed Presiding Bishop and Chief Apostle of the International Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ. In 2014, Apostle Floyd E. Nelson Sr. succeeded Showell as Presiding Bishop and Chief Apostle of International Bibleway. While serving his second term, Apostle Nelson was &quot;promoted to glory&quot; on April 2, 2019. Apostle Willie Rookard of Inman, South Carolina, who served as First Vice Presiding Bishop under Apostle Nelson, has now assumed the role of Presiding Bishop to complete Nelson&#x27;s term.

Women in International Bible Way Church Of Our Lord Jesus Christ

Apostle Campbell began the practice of ordaining women to the office of elder. In July 2006, Showell, appointed Pastor Bonnie Hunter as the first woman District Elder.

In July 2011, Pastor Marcia Fountain (Bridgeport, Connecticut) was appointed as the third woman District Elder.

As of July 2012, Pastor Deborah Barnette-Street, a female pastor from Roxboro North Carolina, is the Diocesan Liaison (of the Central Carolina Diocese) under Apostle Cornelius Showell who serves as the diocese&#x27;s current Diocesan. She also serves in the office of District Elder in International BibleWay. In addition to being a Diocesan Liaison and District Elder, she is also the Chair of the District Elders for International Bibleway.

As of July 2017, Under the leadership of Apostle Floyd E. Nelson sr it was so moved that District Elder Bonnie Hunter be consecrated to the episcopacy in July 2018 at the 61st Holy Convocation as the First Woman Bishop of International Bibleway.

=== Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ World-Wide ===
Though the organizations are similar in structure and doctrine, the major differences reside in ordination of women. This was the always a point of contention between Apostle Winfield Showell and Apostle Smallwood Williams. Cornelius Showell, is following the convictions of his Father Winfield A. Showell.

<doc id="435759" wikidata="Q5422396" url="?curid=435759" title="Extreme cold weather clothing">
<text>In arctic or mountainous areas, the primary function of extreme cold weather clothing is to trap air as an insulator to prevent heat loss from the wearer&#x27;s body. Secondary and necessary is to conduct water vapor away from the body to keep the insulating layers dry. A shell keeps the wind from disturbing the still air in the insulating layers. In warmer conditions, the shell protects from water intrusion.

The U.S. National Weather Service defines &quot;extreme cold&quot; as with winds less than . In these conditions, the unprotected skin of a healthy adult will develop frostbite in ten to twenty minutes. The Canadian standard includes even lower temperatures.
==Principles==
A vacuum is the best insulator, but its use in clothing is impractical. Dry air is a practical insulator. Extreme cold weather clothing uses still dry air to insulate the body, layers of loose air trapping material are most effective. The inner layers should conduct moisture away from the body. Outer layers should be windproof as well as suitable to the harsh terrain.

==Materials==
The original cold weather clothing was made of furs. The fibers of the fur trapped insulating air, lanolin on the fur repelled water. Knitted wool is an effective insulator when dry, but ineffective when wet. Goose down is the lightest insulator, and still used today. Its quality, called &quot;loft&quot; is a measure of its low density. It is ineffective when wet. 

Artificial fibers have good loft, and do not lose it when wet. One effective fiber is &quot;Hollofil&quot; a hollow fiber of polyolefin. Outer garments are often made of nylon, which is strong and abrasion resistant. The nylon is often bonded to a layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (trade name Teflon) in a form that has holes small enough for moisture to escape, but not allow liquid water to intrude. This material is trade named &quot;Gore-Tex&quot;.

==Best practices==
The U.S. Army describes cold weather best practices by the mnemonic acronym &quot;COLD&quot;.
* Clean
* Avoid Overheating
* Loose
* Dry
The protocol is aimed at keeping the insulation dry, so that it may be most effective.
==Layering==
Best practice indicates that for extreme conditions, clothing should be layered and loose. Near the core of the body, a soft, wicking layer is best. Wool or silk underwear is preferred. Then, by preference, a knitted layer of wool or synthetic fleece. A massive insulating layer and a windproof layer complete the ensemble.

==Parts of clothing==

===Inner layer===
Underwear, inner socks, and glove liners are typically thin, soft knits of silk, wool, or synthetic.

===First insulating layer===
Typically knit wool or synthetic fleece. A common material is polar fleece.

===Massive insulating layer===
Down or synthetic fiber sewn into bats of a (typically nylon) coat or pants. 

===Wind layer===
The usual clothing for Arctic or mountain regions is a parka. A tightly woven fabric prevents wind from disturbing the still air in the insulating layers.

===Footwear===

Footwear is chosen according to purpose. In alpine conditions, insulated mountaineering boots are used. In other work conditions, pacs, or bunny boots, with rubber soles and thick, removable wool felt liners are used. In camp, lightweight moon boots of foam and nylon are common. In the tent, down booties are comfortable.

===Gloves===
In severe conditions, mittens with long gauntlets are preferred.

===Headwear===
A knitted or fleece cap is worn underneath the hood of the parka. The face is protected by a mask or balaclava. The water transmission properties of anything touching the face are of the highest concern.

Another option is to use heated clothing, which contains battery-powered electrical heating elements or gel packs.

<doc id="435760" wikidata="Q12565265" url="?curid=435760" title="Telophase">
<text>Telophase () is the final stage in both meiosis and mitosis in a eukaryotic cell. During telophase, the effects of prophase and prometaphase (the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disintegrating) are reversed. As chromosomes reach the cell poles, a nuclear envelope is re-assembled around each set of chromatids, the nucleoli reappear, and chromosomes begin to decondense back into the expanded chromatin that is present during interphase. The mitotic spindle is disassembled and remaining spindle microtubules are depolymerized. Telophase accounts for approximately 2% of the cell cycle&#x27;s duration.

Cytokinesis typically begins before late telophase and, when complete, segregates the two daughter nuclei between a pair of separate daughter cells.

Telophase is primarily driven by the dephosphorylation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates.

== Dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates ==
The phosphorylation of the protein targets of M-Cdks (Mitotic Cyclin-dependent Kinases) drives spindle assembly, chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown in early mitosis. The dephosphorylation of these same substrates drives spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation and the reformation of daughter nuclei in telophase. Establishing a degree of dephosphorylation permissive to telophase events requires both the inactivation of Cdks and the activation of phosphatases.

Cdk inactivation is primarily the result of the destruction of its associated cyclin. Cyclins are targeted for proteolytic degradation by the anaphase promoting complex (APC), also known as the cyclosome, a ubiquitin-ligase. The active, CDC20-bound APC (APC/CCDC20) targets mitotic cyclins for degradation starting in anaphase. Experimental addition of non-degradable M-cyclin to cells induces cell cycle arrest in a post-anaphase/pre-telophase-like state with condensed chromosomes segregated to cell poles, an intact mitotic spindle, and no reformation of the nuclear envelope. This has been shown in frog (&quot;Xenopus)&quot; eggs, fruit flies (&quot;Drosophilla melanogaster&quot;), budding (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) and fission (&quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;) yeast, and in multiple human cell lines.

The requirement for phosphatase activation can be seen in budding yeast, which do not have redundant phosphatases for mitotic exit and rely on the phosphatase cdc14. Blocking cdc14 activation in these cells results in the same phenotypic arrest as does blocking M-cyclin degradation.

Historically, it has been thought that anaphase and telophase are events that occur passively after satisfaction of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) that defines the metaphase-anaphase transition. However, the existence of differential phases to cdc14 activity between anaphase and telophase is suggestive of additional, unexplored late-mitotic checkpoints. Cdc14 is activated by its release into the nucleus, from sequestration in the nucleolus, and subsequent export into the cytoplasm. The Cdc-14 Early Anaphase Release pathway, which stabilizes the spindle, also releases cdc14 from the nucleolus but restricts it to the nucleus. Complete release and maintained activation of cdc14 is achieved by the separate Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) pathway to a sufficient degree (to trigger the spindle disassembly and nuclear envelope assembly) only after late anaphase.

Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation activates downstream regulatory processes unique to telophase. For example, the dephosphorylation of CDH1 allows the APC/C to bind CDH1. APC/CCDH1 targets CDC20 for proteolysis, resulting in a cellular switch from APC/CCDC20 to APC/CCDH1 activity. The ubiquitination of mitotic cyclins continues along with that of APC/CCDH1-specific targets such as the yeast mitotic spindle component, Ase1, and cdc5, the degradation of which is required for the return of cells to the G1 phase.

=== Additional mechanisms driving telophase ===
A shift in the whole-cell phosphoprotein profile is only the broadest of many regulatory mechanisms contributing to the onset of individual telophase events.
* The anaphase-mediated distancing of chromosomes from the metaphase plate may trigger spatial cues for the onset of telophase.
* An important regulator and effector of telophase is cdc48 (homologous to yeast cdc48 is human p97, both structurally and functionally), a protein that mechanically employs its ATPase activity to alter target protein conformation. Cdc48 is necessary for spindle disassembly, nuclear envelope assembly, and chromosome decondensation. Cdc48 modifies proteins structurally involved in these processes and also some ubiquitinated proteins which are thus targeted to the proteasome.

== Mitotic spindle disassembly ==
The breaking of the mitotic spindle, common to the completion of mitosis in all eukaryotes, is the event most often used to define the anaphase-B to telophase transition, although the initiation of nuclear reassembly tends to precede that of spindle disassembly.

Spindle disassembly is an irreversible process which must effect not the ultimate degradation, but the reorganization of constituent microtubules; microtubules are detached from kinetochores and spindle pole bodies and return to their interphase states.

Spindle depolymerization during telophase occurs from the plus end and is, in this way, a reversal of spindle assembly. Subsequent microtubule array assembly is, unlike that of the polarized spindle, interpolar. This is especially apparent in animal cells which must immediately, following mitotic spindle disassembly, establish the antiparallel bundle of microtubules known as the &quot;central spindle&quot; in order to regulate cytokinesis. The ATPase p97 is required for the establishment of the relatively stable and long interphase microtubule arrays following disassembly of the highly dynamic and relatively short mitotic ones.

While spindle assembly has been well studied and characterized as a process where tentative structures are edified by the SAC, the molecular basis of spindle disassembly is not understood in comparable detail. The late-mitotic dephosphorylation cascade of M-Cdk substrates by the MEN is broadly held to be responsible for spindle disassembly. The phosphorylation states of microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing factors, as well as microtubule nucleators are key regulators of their activities. For example, NuMA is a minus-end crosslinking protein and Cdk substrate whose dissociation from the microtubule is effected by its dephosphorylation during telophase.

A general model for spindle disassembly in yeast is that the three functionally overlapping subprocesses of spindle disengagement, destabilization, and depolymerization are primarily effected by APC/CCDH1, microtubule-stabilizer-specific kinases, and plus-end directed microtubule depolymerases, respectively. These effectors are known to be highly conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes. The APC/CCDH1 targets crosslinking microtubule-associated proteins (NuMA, Ase1, Cin1 and more). AuroraB (yeast IpI1) phosphorylates the spindle-associated stabilizing protein EB1 (yeast Bim1), which then dissociates from microtubules, and the destabilizer She1, which then associates with microtubules. Kinesin8 (yeast Kip3), an ATP-dependent depolymerase, accelerate microtubule depolymerization at the plus end. It was shown the concurrent disruption of these mechanisms, but not of any one, results in dramatic spindle hyperstability during telophase, suggesting functional overlap despite the diversity of the mechanisms.

== Nuclear envelope reassembly ==
The main components of the nuclear envelope are a double membrane, nuclear pore complexes, and a nuclear lamina internal to the inner nuclear membrane. These components are dismantled during prophase and prometaphase and reconstructed during telophase, when the nuclear envelope reforms on the surface of separated sister chromatids. The nuclear membrane is fragmented and partly absorbed by the endoplasmic reticulum during prometaphase and the targeting of inner nuclear membrane protein-containing ER vesicles to the chromatin occurs during telophase in a reversal of this process. Membrane-forming vesicles aggregate directly to the surface of chromatin, where they fuse laterally into a continuous membrane.

Ran-GTP is required for early nuclear envelope assembly at the surface of the chromosomes: it releases envelope components sequestered by importin β during early mitosis. Ran-GTP localizes near chromosomes throughout mitosis, but does not trigger the dissociation of nuclear envelope proteins from importin β until M-Cdk targets are dephosphorylated in telophase. These envelope components include several nuclear pore components, the most studied of which is the nuclear pore scaffold protein ELYS, which can recognize DNA regions rich in A:T base pairs (in vitro), and may therefore bind directly to the DNA. However, experiments in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts have concluded that ELYS fails to associate with bare DNA and will only directly bind histone dimers and nucleosomes. After binding to chromatin, ELYS recruits other components of the nuclear pore scaffold and nuclear pore trans-membrane proteins. The nuclear pore complex is assembled and integrated in the nuclear envelope in an organized manner, consecutively adding Nup107-160, POM121, and FG Nups.

It is debated whether the mechanism of nuclear membrane reassembly involves initial nuclear pore assembly and subsequent recruitment of membrane vesicles around the pores or if the nuclear envelope forms primarily from extended ER cisternae, preceding nuclear pore assembly:
* In cells where the nuclear membrane fragments into non-ER vesicles during mitosis, a Ran-GTP–dependent pathway can direct these discrete vesicle populations to chromatin where they fuse to reform the nuclear envelope.
* In cells where the nuclear membrane is absorbed into the endoplasmic reticulum during mitosis, reassembly involves the lateral expansion around the chromatin with stabilization of the expanding membrane over the surface of the chromatin. Studies claiming this mechanism is a prerequisite to nuclear pore formation have found that bare-chromatin-associated Nup107–160 complexes are present in single units instead of as assembled pre-pores.

The envelope smoothens and expands following its enclosure of the whole chromatid set. This probably occurs due to the nuclear pores&#x27; import of lamin, which can be retained within a continuous membrane. The nuclear envelopes of &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts failed to smoothen when nuclear import of lamin was inhibited, remaining wrinkled and closely bound to condensed chromosomes. However, in the case of ER lateral expansion, nuclear import is initiated before completion of the nuclear envelope reassembly, leading to a temporary intra-nuclear protein gradient between the distal and medial aspects of the forming nucleus.

Lamin subunits disassembled in prophase are inactivated and sequestered during mitosis. Lamina reassembly is triggered by lamin dephosphorylation (and additionally by methyl-esterification of COOH residues on lamin-B). Lamin-B can target chromatin as early as mid-anaphase. During telophase, when nuclear import is reestablished, lamin-A enters the reforming nucleus but continues to slowly assemble into the peripheral lamina over several hours in throughout the G1 phase.

&quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts and human cancer cell lines have been the primary models used for studying nuclear envelope reassembly.

Yeast lack lamins; their nuclear envelope remains intact throughout mitosis and nuclear division happens during cytokinesis.

== Chromosome decondensation ==
Chromosome decondensation (also known as relaxation or decompaction) into expanded chromatin is necessary for the cell&#x27;s resumption of interphase processes, and occurs in parallel to nuclear envelope assembly during telophase in many eukaryotes. MEN-mediated Cdk dephosphorylation is necessary for chromosome decondensation.

In vertebrates, chromosome decondensation is initiated only after nuclear import is reestablished. If lamin transport through nuclear pores is prevented, chromosomes remain condensed following cytokinesis, and cells fail to reenter the next S phase. In mammals, DNA licensing for S phase (the association of chromatin to the multiple protein factors necessary for its replication) also occurs coincidentally with the maturation of the nuclear envelope during late telophase. This can be attributed to and provides evidence for the nuclear import machinery&#x27;s reestablishment of interphase nuclear and cytoplasmic protein localizations during telophase.

<text>Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría (born 9 January 1940) is a Costa Rican economist, lawyer, businessman and politician who served as President of Costa Rica from 1998 to 2002. He was minister of planning from 1968 to 1970 and minister of the presidency in 1970 during the administration of Jose Joaquin Trejos Fernandez (1966 - 1970); member of the board of the Costa Rican Central Bank from 1966 to 1969; congressman from 1990 to 1993, serving as president of the Legislative Assembly during the 1991 to 1992 period; and was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 2004. He voluntarily stepped down from this post to return to his country to face allegations of financial wrongdoing during his presidential tenure in Costa Rica. On April 27 of 2011 he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, but this ruling was later reversed in a December 2012 decision by an appeals court, which found him innocent of all charges.

Rodríguez came to the presidency as the candidate of the social Christian party (Partido Unidad Social Cristiana) with an agenda that included the opening of state-run monopolies in insurance and telecommunications, the rationalization of the public sector including increasing the role of the private sector in public infrastructure, trade liberalization, and the expansion and modernization of the social welfare system. The reforms of the insurance and telecom sectors generated massive protests and were subsequently abandoned, but were later implemented when Costa Rica became part of the DR-CAFTA (Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement) in 2009.

==Early life==
Rodríguez was born in San José. At the University of Costa Rica he obtained degrees in both economics (1962) and law (1963) and worked there briefly as an assistant professor of economics. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley in the United States, where he received both M.A. and PhD degrees in economics in 1966, having completed a thesis on monetary policy. Immediately after graduating he returned to Costa Rica to serve as Minister of Planning and member of the board of directors of the Costa Rican Central Bank, during the government of president José Joaquín Trejos.

In the 1970s and 1980s Rodríguez combined academic work as a professor of economics at the University of Costa Rica and at the Autonomous University of Central America with a business venture in cattle holding: Grupo Ganadero Industrial, S.A.

Rodriguez is also a devout Roman Catholic. His brother, Álvaro Rodríguez, currently serves as Superior General of the De La Salle Brothers.

==Political career==
Rodríguez was the President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica from 1991 to 1992. Rodríguez ran three times for president. In 1990 he lost his party&#x27;s nomination to Rafael Ángel Calderón. In 1994 he won his party&#x27;s nomination but lost the election to José María Figueres. He finally secured the presidency in 1998. In spite of his experience as an economist and businessman, his presidency was generally regarded as ineffectual. Proposed free-market reforms, including a plan to end the state monopoly on telecommunications, fell apart under opposition from the trade unions of government employees and other groups, but he was successful in reforming the retirement system and opening it to private participation as well as giving in concession to a private company the operation of the main port in the Pacific Ocean (Caldera). After his term of office, Rodríguez worked as a consultant at Manatt Jones Global Strategies and as a visiting professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

=== Political views ===

Rodriguez is widely considered a believer in free enterprise and a pro-market politician, who favors market reforms and the opening of the economy to foreign investment.

He is also considered a social conservative. In 1998 Rodriguez incensed people in the gay community, by opposing a gay/lesbian festival in a beach resort in Quepos, in the central Pacific region of Costa Rica. Rodriguez, at the time the president of Costa Rica, was quoted in the press as saying &quot;It is important that the appropriate authorities not grant any permits for any type of public activities associated with the gay/lesbian festival&quot;. His position was echoed by Mons. Roman Arrieta, Archbishop of San Jose, and Father Minor de Jesús Calvo, a conservative priest that had at the time a program in TV. Francisco Madrigal, the director of Triangulo Rosa, a gay/lesbian organization filed a complaint in the Costa Rican Supreme Court&#x27;s complaints division against Msgr. Román Arrieta Villalobos, the Archbishop of San José, and Father Minor de Jesús Calvo. Triángulo Rosa also registered a complaint with the Defensoría de los Habitantes, the government&#x27;s ombudsmen organization, against the President of Costa Rica, Dr. Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Gay organization fights discrimination.

==Secretary-General of the Organization of American States==
On 7 June 2004 he was unanimously elected to replace César Gaviria as secretary general of the OAS. He began his term on 15 September 2004 but served only 1 month, before stepping down when a former political collaborator accused him of having accepted a kickback from the French telecommunications firm Alcatel, which had been awarded a large government contract for cellular phone bandwidth during Rodríguez&#x27;s tenure as president.

On 8 October 2004, Rodríguez resigned as OAS Secretary General, effective 15 October, and was replaced by Assistant Secretary General Luigi Einaudi, a former U.S. State Department official who assumed the title of Acting Secretary General. After resigning from his post, Rodríguez returned to Costa Rica on 15 October 2004 and was placed first under house arrest and two weeks later in jail, pending further investigations.

==Accusations of involvement in corruption scandals==

=== Political contributions from Carlos Hank ===

In 1997, while Rodríguez was a candidate for the Presidency of Costa Rica, he met Carlos Hank González, a Mexican politician and rich businessman. He reportedly accepted campaign contributions from Hank, which is forbidden by Costa Rican law. The international media made allegations of these illegal payments. Most of the articles hinted that Hank had ties with organized crime. Rodríguez denied any wrongdoing. He did not face charges.

===Payments from Taiwan===
News reports claimed that Rodríguez had also received $1.4 million from the government of Taiwan. This amount was deposited in Panama in an account controlled by the firm Inversiones Denisse S.A., a consulting firm that allegedly belonged to Rodríguez. His lawyers claim that Rodríguez was no longer the owner of Inversiones Denisse when the payments took place. The motivation for the Taiwanese government payments is unknown. Taiwanese officials, however, have recognized that their cooperation with allies led to corruption in some cases. President Ma Ying-jeou promised to end what he called &quot;the diplomacy of the cheque book.&quot; In 2007 Oscar Arias recognizing China&#x27;s economic growth ended Costa Rica recognition of Taiwan.

===Payments from reinsurers===
On 22 October 2010, the British media reported that Julian Messent, a former executive in the reinsurance firm PWS (owned by Lord Pearson), had pleaded guilty in Southwark Crown Court to paying £ 1.2 million in bribes to three Costa Rican officials, in exchange for a contract with the state insurance monopoly, the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Seguros&quot; (INS). The money was disbursed in 41 payments, over the period from 1999 to 2002. Messent was sentenced to serve 21 months in jail. According to the sentence, Mr. Messent should pay a fine of US$160,000 to the Costa Rican state. 21 meses de cárcel para exejecutivo de PWS por sobornar a ticos - EL PAÍS - La Nación The Costa Rican media suggested that the unnamed officials might be Rodríguez, former INS director Cristóbal Zawadski, and former director of the INS&#x27;s reinsurance department Álvaro Acuña Prado.

Rodríguez, Zawadski, Prado, and several others were already under investigation in Costa Rica after it had been revealed that PWS had transferred at least $200,000 to Inversiones Denisse, a Panamanian firm owned by Rodríguez. PWS allegedly inflated the policies of the &quot;Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad&quot; (ICE) in order to create a discretionary fund of $1.6 million. The director of ICE at the moment that this operation took place was Rafael Sequeira, father-in-law of Rodríguez&#x27;s son. The other reinsurer that made payments to the company of Rodríguez was the firm Guy Carpenter Reinmex, based in Mexico.

On 30 July 2013, The Prosecutor&#x27;s Office requested the opening of a judicial investigation of alleged embezzlement charges against Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, according to the weekly newspaper The Tico Times. The investigation also includes the president of the National Insurance Institute (INS) Cristóbal Zawadzki Wojtasiak and Álvaro Acuña Prado, a department manager at INS. Reportedly, Rodriguez dismissed the charges in a press release, stating that these charges are a gross persecution against him, and that he will fight the allegations in courts. He also mentioned that the Prosecutor Office had already decided to dismissed the charges in 2005.

===ICE-Alcatel scandal===
Rodríguez was tried in Costa Rica for allegedly receiving more than US$800,000 in payments from Alcatel, a French telecommunications company, in exchange for helping the company receive a government contract to provide 400,000 cell phone lines. In 2007, Christian Sapsizian, a former adjunct to the vice president of Alcatel for Latin America, pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court of Miami to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by conspiring with Edgar Valverde (the president of Alcatel in Costa Rica) to bribe an &quot;official&quot; of the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity (ICE) and a &quot;senior government official&quot; of Costa Rica. Mr. Sapsizian was sentenced to 30 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and forfeiture of $261,500.

The prosecution in Costa Rica alleges that the &quot;senior government official&quot; was President Rodríguez, and that the ICE official was José Antonio Lobo, who has agreed to testify against Rodríguez in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Valverde, Rodríguez, and seven other people were tried in Costa Rica for their alleged involvement in the kickback scheme. After long delays, the trial began in April 2010. The trial took many months, because 110 witnesses appeared before the judges. On 28 April 2011, Rodríguez Echeverría was sentenced to 5 years in prison for his participation in the kickback scheme. Moreover, he will not be able to serve in public office during 12 years. Miguel Angel Rodríguez sentenced to five years in prison-Spanish. The other defendants were also found guilty and received sentences ranging from two to 15 years of prison Three defendants will go directly to prison.

In 2010 Alcatel-Lucent agreed to pay a fine of US$137.4 million to avoid US prosecution for alleged bribes paid in several countries, including Kenya, Taiwan and Costa Rica. In a separate deal with Costa Rican government, Alcatel-Lucent also agreed to pay a fine of US$10 million. The agreement with the &quot;Procuraduría General de la República&quot;, the legal representative of the Costa Rican state, is intended to compensate for the social damage brought about by the kickback scheme. Originally, the Procuraduria had demand a compensation of US$60 million. Reportedly, the &quot;Procuraduría&quot; will also pursue compensation from other people currently on trial. The compensation sought amounts to US$52 million.

In July 2015 it was reported in the international media that Alcatel-Lucent (name of the company after a merger with Lucent Technologies) had agreed to make an additional payment of US$10 million to the Costa Rican government. According to these reports, discussions on the settlement have been dragging on for years. However, on 8 June 2015 Alcatel agreed with the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) to pay to the latter US$10 million to settle the question. It has also been reported that Alcatel-Lucent has budgeted US$52 million to pay for civil action concerning legal prosecution of its former managers in the country. Alcatel Luct pays 10 million to Costa Rica&#x27;s ICE over old bribery scandal

==Sentence==
On 27 April 2011 he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. In 2012 the sentence was revoked amid accusation of prosecutor misconduct. The appellation tribunal found that Lobo, the crown&#x27;s prosecution witness was not only given immunity (even as from his own declaration he was the mastermind of the transactions) but was allowed to keep the money he obtain from the illegal transactions (an amount more than 3 times that of Rodriguez). Lobo also changed versions more than 7 times and the appellation tribunal found unusual that Rodriguez was accused using one version on the events but condemn using a different version, harming his ability to mount an effective defense.

<text>José María Figueres Olsen (born 24 December 1954) is a Costa Rican businessman and politician, who served as President of Costa Rica from 1994 to 1998. He also ran for president in the 2022 presidential election but was defeated by Rodrigo Chaves.

Figueres started his career as an engineer working in agribusiness. After a decade, he entered public service as Minister of Foreign Trade and then Minister of Agriculture. In 1994, he was elected President of Costa Rica, as the nation&#x27;s youngest elected president of the 20th century (Alfredo Gonzalez Flores became president in 1914 at the age of 36, however he was not elected directly, as he was appointed by the National Assembly). He left the presidency of Costa Rica in 1998, since then he has been involved in global issues such as climate change, sustainable development, and technology.

In 2000, Figueres joined the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. In 2004, he resigned over the undeclared receipt of more than 900,000 US dollars in consultancy fees from the French telecommunications firm Alcatel. Later, he worked with Concordia 21 in Madrid. Since 2010, he has been Chairman of the Carbon War Room, an independent non-profit organization focused on the global transition to a low-carbon economy. On 27 March 2012, Sir Richard Branson announced that he was appointed as the new President of the Carbon War Room.

==Biography==
José María Figueres is the son of José Figueres Ferrer (known as Don Pepe), who was a three-time President of Costa Rica. His mother, Karen Olsen Beck, an American social worker born to Danish immigrant parents, later adopted Costa Rican nationality. After serving as First Lady, she was appointed Ambassador to Israel in 1982. In 1990, she was elected Member of Congress for the 1990–1994 legislature.

Figueres grew up in La Lucha, a farm community his father Don Pepe founded in 1928. There José María attended the public school Cecilia Orlich Figueres, before going on to study at the Colegio Humboldt and later at the Lincoln High School, both in San José.

Figueres has three younger siblings, Christiana Figueres, Mariano and Kirsten. Christiana Figueres was Executive Director of the UNFCCC, responsible for international climate change negotiations. From the first marriage of his father, Figueres has an older brother, Marti, and a sister, Muni. Muni Figueres has held various public positions, and since 2010 she has served as the Costa Rican Ambassador to the United States.

José María has two children from his first marriage to former First Lady Josette Altmann Borbón, José María and Eugenia. The marriage between Figueres and Altmann ended in divorce. He is currently married to Cinthya Berrocal Quirós.

==Education==
Figueres completed his undergraduate studies at the United States Military Academy (West Point), where he graduated in the Class of 1979 with a major in Engineering. While attending West Point, he attended and completed the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ranger Training Course in 1975. He was awarded the Army Ranger tab and was the class Distinguished Honor Graduate.

Later, he continued his academic studies at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, graduating in 1991 with a master&#x27;s degree in Public Administration. During his studies at Harvard, Figueres also attended courses at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.

==Business career==
Upon returning to Costa Rica after concluding his studies at West Point, he joined and later led the restructuring process of the deeply indebted family business, Sociedad Agroindustrial San Cristobal (SAISC) . Figueres helped return the business to profitability by disposing of non-productive assets, reducing leverage, improving the efficiency of many industrial processes, and focusing on expanding exports.

Years later, in 1990, Figueres co-founded Energía Global Inc. a renewable energy company with operations in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Chile. The business was later sold and today it continues to operate as a subsidiary of ENEL.

In 1999, Figueres joined the Board of Directors of Terremark Worldwide Inc, on which he served for five years. He then continued to be closely associated with the company in its international expansion projects. Terremark is involved in transforming and securing enterprise-class IT on a global scale, providing industry managed services, cloud computing, colocation and web hosting solutions for enterprise IT infrastructures from their data centers. In 2011, Terremark was acquired by Verizon.

In 2005, Figueres undertook a one-year assignment as Managing Director of Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization, responsible for refocusing global consulting within the group. This group is the largest Arab group of professional services firms, headquartered in Amman, Jordan, with over 73 offices in 23 countries. From 2006 to 2009, Figueres served on the International Advisory Board of Abraaj Capital, the largest Middle East Private Equity firm with over $6 billion of assets under management. In 2009, he joined the Advisory Board of Grupo Arcano, an independent financial services firm based in Madrid, Spain.

In 2010, Figueres joined IJ Partners in Geneva, Switzerland, as a Managing Partner. IJ Partners was founded in 2009 during the global economic crisis, to provide financial services to private individuals and family offices investing exclusively in tangible assets.

Figueres served on the board of the Rocky Mountain Institute, including as chairman until 2017.

==Political career==
In 1986 Nobel Peace Prize Laurate and President Óscar Arias (1986–1990), appointed Figueres to overhaul the ailing National Railway System, INCOFER. He was then appointed Minister in the Arias government, first of Foreign Trade and later of Agriculture. Upon the completion of the governmental period Figueres continued his academic studies at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, graduating in 1991 with a master&#x27;s degree in Public Administration.

Following his graduate studies at Harvard, Figueres returned to Costa Rica and declared his intention to seek the nomination of the political party he belonged to, the National Liberation Party. After a heated and much-disputed primary election process involving five candidates, Figueres won the party&#x27;s nomination in 1993 and went on to the national election that he won in February 1994. José María Figueres Olsen was elected President of Costa Rica for four years at the age of 39, the nation&#x27;s youngest elected president in the 20th century (Alfredo González Flores took office in 1914 at the age of 36. However he was not elected by popular vote but rather appointed by Congress.

==Presidency (1994-1998)==
According to Leonardo Garnier, minister of Planning and Economic Policy during the Figueres&#x27; administration, the latter promoted Sustainable Development as the integrating architecture of governmental action. This program was anchored on three pillars: Firstly, to transform the Costa Rican economy towards one of higher productivity, with special emphasis on technology. Secondly, for the Costa Rican society to express greater solidarity by opening opportunities of wellbeing for all. Thirdly, for society to develop itself in harmony with nature (from the book &quot;Gobernando en Tiempos de Cambio: Administración Figueres Olsen&quot;, by Leonardo Garnier). The administration is credited with having worked to advance and promote further integration of Costa Rica into the globalised economy.

Figueres reformed and reorganized many public institutions including the closing of some of them, such as Banco Anglo Costarricense (which was plagued with corruption charges) and the National Railway System (INCOFER) which after being re-organized several times was again insolvent. The latter decision was reversed by the following administrations, which actually invested in modernizing the railway, with apparent success. The Figueres Administration contributed to the establishment of Intel Corporation in Costa Rica.

His administration also launched several initiatives to improve national education, including a constitutional reform approved by Congress to dedicate 6% of GDP towards public education; introduced English as a second language in public schools from the first grade up; consolidated the installation of computer labs in high schools.

During his term, government created the EBAIS (Primary Teams of Basic Health Care) as a provider of preventive medicine in the communities, primarily by giving easy access to medical services.

He was also an early leader on climate change, putting in place the first price on carbon in the world in Costa Rica in 1995. In 1994, he proposed to the U.S. Government via the U.S. Department of Energy negotiation of a U.S. - Costa Rica bilateral agreement on climate change. This was the first such agreement in the world, was negotiated in 1994 and signed by President Figueres and U.S. Vice President Al Gore in the Indian Treaty Room of the White House on September 30, 1994. From then on, Costa Rica continued to lead on climate change, engaging other nations across the Americas and under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, helping to ensure the success of the Kyoto Protocol and since. Jose Maria&#x27;s sister, Christiana Figures, played a leading role, advising President Figueres, negotiating the agreement with the U.S., and engaging other nations, eventually becoming Costa Rica&#x27;s representative in the global climate treaty negotiations, and then the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

== Controversies ==
===Chemise case===
In 1991, when Figueres was seen as a possible contender for the presidency, brothers David and José Romero published a book accusing Figueres of having participated in the extrajudicial execution of a drug dealer named Jose Joaquin Orozco, known as &quot;Chemise&quot;. The basis for this allegation dated back to March 7, 1973. Figueres accused the Romero brothers of libel and in 1993 a court acquitted them while condemning their main source, former drug-enforcement officer Walter Campos. In 1998 another court sentenced the Romero brothers to seven years&#x27; imprisonment for making a false accusation, but that sentence was appealed and revoked due to procedural issues. In 2000, two years after Figueres left office, the legal proceeding ended with a settlement between the Romero brothers and Figueres&#x27;s lawyers.

===Religion===
In the middle of Figueres&#x27; presidential campaign, anonymous allegations arguing Figueres was not Roman Catholic were widely spread and picked up by the media. Costa Rica&#x27;s political constitution establishes the Catholic faith as the official State religion. To dispel the strong rumors Monsenor Román Arrieta, Archbishop of San José and President of the Episcopal Conference was obliged to pronounce himself acknowledging that Figueres had been baptized a Roman Catholic.

===Alcatel===
In 2004, Costa Rica&#x27;s Attorney General opened official investigations against two other former presidents, for alleged financial misconduct. Both were placed under arrest. Shortly afterwards local media reports claimed Figueres had also received payments from Alcatel. It was reported that Figueres had earned nearly US$900,000 for three years of consultancy work on telecommunications with Alcatel, initiated two years after his presidency, and while already working in Europe. Figueres disclosed all his financial affairs and requested the Costa Rican Internal Revenue Service to review his tax returns. Following this review, Figueres amended his tax filings to include income earned outside of Costa Rica, which is not subject to Costa Rican tax, and paid 67.2 million Costa Rican colones in taxes. On 5 December 2005 the Internal Revenue Service of Costa Rica notified Figueres of no financial misconduct with resolution number 5452000009594 dated 27 October 2005.

A Congressional Commission took it upon themselves to investigate the allegations. The Commission of Control of Public Revenue and Expenditure (Comisión de Control del Ingreso y el Gasto Público) summoned Figueres. On 6 September 2005, Judge Maria Morales of the First Circuit Court of Costa Rica pronounced a ruling in Figueres&#x27; favour, and against the Congressional Commission&#x27;s procedures. The Commission also failed to register a report on the findings before the Congress, as stipulated in Congressional Procedural Regulations.

In the context of the allegations, Figueres resigned from his role as CEO and executive director of the World Economic Forum in October 2004. Transparency International had highlighted this incident in their Global Corruption Report in 2006. Figueres was never summoned nor charged by the Costa Rican Attorney General&#x27;s office. On 19 September 2007, the Attorney General formally announced that there were no grounds on which to press any charges against Figueres.

=== Paradise Papers ===
In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in the &quot;Paradise Papers&quot; allegations.

==International awards==
President Figueres has received international awards for his work and adherence to the tenets of Sustainable Development.

==International work==
Upon leaving government in 1998 President Figueres founded Entebbe (Costa Rican Foundation for Sustainable Development). The foundation started and developed pioneering programs, such as LINCOS (Little Intelligent Communities), APVE (Clean Transport Alternatives) and CENTAIRE (Center for monitoring and evaluation of Air Quality in Central America). A large number of academic, social and communal organizations, as well as private sector partners contributed to the development of these programs. In the same field of deploying technologies to boost development, together with Nicholas Negroponte and Jeffrey Sachs, Figueres founded the &quot;Digital Nations Consortium&quot;, a program overseen by the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1999 he was called upon by Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations to chair a working group on Information, Communication, Technology (ICT). He was later elected Chairman of the United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force (ICT).

While leading the ICT Task Force, in mid-2000 Figueres was appointed Managing Director of the World Economic Forum (WEF), and independent international organization dedicated to improving the state of the world by bringing together world leaders to establish alliances that can influence industry, regional and global agendas. Three years later he was appointed the first CEO of the WEF. His responsibilities included coordinating the annual meeting of the forum in Davos, Switzerland, which brought together prominent corporate leaders, heads of State and government, as well as respected personalities from the academic, cultural and religious world.

Figueres resigned from the WEF towards the end of 2004, when consulting work with Alcatel appeared in the international media. Andre Schneider, the WEF&#x27;s spokesman said that Figueres acknowledged violating the rules of the forum by not declaring that he was being retained as a consultant when he took the post and while he was working at the forum. In his letter of resignation, Figueres apologized to forum founder Klaus Schwab for failing to inform the organization that he had entered the consultancy &quot;many months before joining the Forum.&quot;

Since having left government in Costa Rica, Figueres has served on numerous boards. He has served as a director of the World Wildlife Fund, the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the Stockholm Environment Institute. In 2008, Figueres has served as Chairman of the Global Fairness Initiative, taking on the role from its founding chairman, Bill Clinton. He is a board member of FRIDE, the Earth Council Geneva, Population Action International, and is Chairman of the Board of Trustees of DARA. From 2009 until 2011, he served on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon&#x27;s Advisory Group on Climate Change and Energy. In 2010, He joined the Carbon War Room as its first chairman. In the academic field, He also served on the Dean&#x27;s Alumni Leadership Council at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and he is a member of Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he often participates in global business events. Figueres is a founding member of the Club de Madrid, an independent non-profit organization with the objective to promote &quot;Democracy that Delivers&quot;, composed of more than 100 former Presidents and Prime Ministers from all over the world.

<text>Brentwood S. Tolan (November 23, 1855 – June 30, 1923) was an American architect. His most notable works include the National Historic Landmark-designated Allen County Courthouse in downtown Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Whitley County Courthouse in Columbia City, Indiana, the La Porte County Courthouse in La Porte, Indiana, as well as the now-demolished Old National Bank Building and Masonic Temple and Opera House in Fort Wayne.

Tolan was born in Delphos, Ohio to Thomas J. and Harriet Skinner Tolan. With little formal art training, he apprenticed under his father, a marble craftsman-turned architect, starting in 1872 at age 17. In 1874, his father moved the family and architectural practice to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1883, Tolan continued the family architectural practice in Fort Wayne. He became well known during the Progressive Era in the Great Lakes area of the Midwest for designing municipal and local government buildings, including courthouses and jails. He later moved to Lima, Ohio, where he practiced with the firm DeCurtin, Rawson, and Tolan. He is buried in Delphos.

<text>Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier (born 14 March 1949) was President of Costa Rica from 1990 to 1994. He was the presidential candidate of the Social Christian Unity Party for the national elections held in February 2010, but resigned his candidacy on 5 October 2009, when he was sentenced to five years in prison for two counts of corruption.

== Family life==

Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier was born in Diriamba, Nicaragua, on 14 March 1949. 
His father was Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, who served as president from 1940 to 1944. His mother was Maria del Rosario Fournier Mora. He was born while his parents were in exile.

Calderon Fournier is married to Gloria Bejarano Almada, the daughter of Mexican physician and politician, Armando León Bejarano. They have four children: Rafael Ángel, Gloria del Carmen, María Gabriela and Marco Antonio. They also have six grandchildren: Alex, Gloria, Tomás, Felipe, Rafael Ángel and Karolina. Calderon Fournier&#x27;s eldest sister, Alejandra, a trotskyist leader, died in an accident in 1979, at the age of 25.

== Education==

Calderon started his primary education at the Colegio Mexico, led by Marist Fathers, in Mexico City. Calderón Fournier returned to Costa Rica in 1958, when he was nine years old. Mario Echandi Jiménez (president 1958–1962) was elected that year and he allowed the return of political exiles, including former president Calderon Guardia.

He attended his secondary education at the Colegio La Salle in San José, Costa Rica. Calderón Fournier studied law at the University of Costa Rica.

==Political life==

Calderon Fournier was elected secretary of secondary education issues of the Partido Unificacion Nacional (PUN). At 20 he was elected President of the Youth of the PUN. Shortly after the death of his father in 1970, he was appointed to the board of the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social. In that capacity he participated in the drafting of the new regulations of the retirement systems of the country.

He was elected congressman in 1974 and served for two consecutive terms as chairman of the Committee on Social Affairs. Among other important bills, the commission adopted the Law on Social Development and Family Allowances, which gave the country a non-contributory pension scheme, which now covers more than a hundred thousand elderly.

In 1991 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Houston.

Born in Diriamba, Nicaragua, on 14 March 1949, son of Dr. Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, former President of the Republic, who was in exile in that country because of the civil war in 1948. In 1958 he returned to Costa Rica, once President Mario Echandi exile lifted his father.
Quickly climbed Calderon positions within the party, which in later years became the Social Christian Unity Party. In 1982 he was a presidential candidate and was defeated by Luis Alberto Monge Alvarez. In 1986 he tries again, but is defeated again, this time by Oscar Arias Sanchez.
Without thinking twice, he throws back a presidential candidate in the 1990 elections, and was elected. Like his father, came to power at age 40 and took exactly 50 years after he had Calderon Guardia.
During his government initiated a reform of the State of Costa Rica. He promoted a liberal policy in all economic, making fiscal reforms, trade and finance that gave greater economic stability to the country.
Increased the cost of all utilities, fuel and taxes. Reduced the number of public employees, through the system of labor mobility and limited bank lending. Increased production and exports. Increased entry of international currencies. Tourism, mainly ecological, experienced an unprecedented boom, so much, which placed this activity in the first place as a producer of foreign exchange, surpassing bananas and coffee.
He converted the old Central Prison in the Children&#x27;s Museum, a modern and attractive, visited daily by hundreds of children and adults. Eliminated most tax and customs exemptions industrial awards, to remove privileges and vested interests for generations. Modified public pensions to make them more fair. Cedulación enacted the indigenous and introduced reforms to the Labour Code. Inflation stabilized, liberalized and controlled the exchange rate of the dollar and revalued the currency, stocks that attracted more investments to the country.
Granted a free voucher housing that benefited low-income families, but the social sector (health, education and public safety), suffered a deterioration. Liberal economic policy was what characterized his government. It was a great president bargaining.

*Built several parks in coordination with the City of San José.
*Began labor mobility programs.
*Encouraged the creation of community homes for the care of children of working mothers.

==Involvement in corruption scandals, trial and sentence==

After an alleged corruption scandal he was incarcerated in October 2004. He was released from jail and was placed under house arrest.

Calderon Fornier was accused of receiving money from the Finnish firm Instrumentarium in exchange of contracts for the firm with the Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (CCSS). His trial started on 3 November 2008, and the hearings finished in September 2009. In spite of the charges, he officially announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Costa Rica in 2010 elections. On 5 October 2009 Calderón was sentenced to five years in prison. He walked out of the court room and notified the press that he would appeal the sentence and that he was not running for president in order to focus on his appeal.

Calderon Fournier&#x27;s co-defendants received varied sentences. Walter Reiche (an executive from Costa Rican firm Corporación Fischel) was sentenced to serve four years of prison. Eliseo Vargas García, former CEO of CCSS was sentenced to serve a five-year term in prison. Gerardo Bolaños Alpízar, a former member of the CCSS board was sentenced to three and a half years in prison; the same sentence as Juan Carlos Sánchez Arguedas, an executive of CCSS, and Marvin Barrantes, CEO of Corporación Fischel.

On 11 May 2011 Calderon Fournier&#x27;s appeal was rejected by the tribunal (the so-called Sala III). The judges confirmed the previous sentence. However, they reduced the term to serve in prison from five years to three. According to the Costa Rican law, he can be expected not to serve this time in prison. Calderon&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Gloria Bejarano Almada, who currently serves as a deputy at the Asamblea Legislativa (congress of the country) and who is a member of the parliament&#x27;s directorate, was sentenced to pay US$70,000 to the Costa Rican government for her participation in the scandal. According to the ruling, Mrs. Bejarano Almada obtained an economic profit in the scandal. On 13 April, the Costa Rican newspaper &quot;La Nación &quot;informed that Finland&#x27;s attorney general will press charges against three executives from the Finnish firm Instrumentarium. The three executives will be charged of crimes connected with corruption and fraud related to a loan of $39.5 million granted by the Finnish government to the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (the Costa Rican agency in charge of public hospitals) and intended to finance the purchase of medical equipment. According to the Finnish attorney general, the accused executives, who worked for Instrumentarium Medko Medical, later acquired by General Electric, distributed a total of $8.7 million to Costa Rican partners and public servants in kick-backs. The attorney general believes that the trial could begin by September, 2012 and that a sentence would be pronounced early 2013.

<doc id="435769" wikidata="Q1796575" url="?curid=435769" title="Up with People">
<text>Up with People (UWP) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Up with People stages song and dance performances promoting themes such as multiculturalism, racial equality, and positive thinking. Critics, including some former Up with People performers, have accused the organization of exploiting its members and of contributing to moral propaganda and oppression.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
UWP was born out of a split from Moral Re-Armament, a multifaith religious movement. In 1965, J. Blanton Belk dedicated his energies to creating an organization for young adults that enabled them to interact with the world through positivity and music. He created Up with People (UWP) to bring people together for the common good regardless of ideology, political affiliation, ethnicity, race, or religious affiliation. Up with People was officially incorporated as a &quot;501(c)(3)  nonprofit, apolitical, non-sectarian international educational organization&quot; in 1968 under the leadership of Belk.

=== 1970s - 1990s ===
UWP traveled and performed their musical show across several countries. Notable events were performances at the Indianapolis 500, the Cotton Bowl, the White House, Super Bowl X, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the 1980s UWP continued their musical tour, performing at Super Bowls XIV and XVI. They performed at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair, XX, the Jerash Festival, the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, U.S. President George H.W. Bush’s inauguration in Washington, D.C., and Berlin to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall. UWP toured throughout the 1990s, performing at events at the Washington Monument, the Freedom Festival in Philadelphia, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development&#x27;s Earth Summit, and the first Celebration of Peace event with Colin Powell in Denver, Colorado. Companies like Exxon, Halliburton, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, General Electric, Coors, Toyota, Enron and Searle donated tens of millions of dollars to the organization. When that support started to fade, it began to charge tuition to members—up to $5,300 in 1982. By the 1990s, the organization found itself struggling to recruit youth capable of paying tuition rates that exceeded the cost of most private universities, a problem compounded by the mostly indifferent response to the group&#x27;s public performance.

=== 2000s - present ===
UWP suspended touring operations from 2000 until 2004. The program was rebranded with a more academic focus on the benefits of travel, volunteer service, performing arts, and leadership development with the sub-brand &quot;Worldsmart Leadership Program&quot;. Two years after its relaunch, the sub-brand was discontinued. Notable touring appearances during the 2000s were the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the United Nations Culture of Peace Forum at the UN Headquarters, the 400th Anniversary of Bermuda, and the 119th Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. Notable performances during the 2010s were performing for Queen Silvia of Sweden at the Mentor Foundation Gala, Washington, DC; the 122nd Tournament of Roses Parade; and the 100th Anniversary of Kiwanis International in Indianapolis, Indiana. Former director Vernon C. Grigg III was hired as the president and CEO after the retirement of Dale Penny. Grigg was succeeded by Seema Srivastava as CEO in 2022.

=== Archives ===
The UWP Archives is housed at the University of Arizona Special Collections library. The archives include materials from the Up with People organization, the International Alumni Association, as well as the personal papers of the UWP Founder and Chairman Emeritus J. Blanton Belk and his wife Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Belk. Select materials from the UWP archives are accessible on the Up with People digital collection hosted on the University of Arizona Special Collections website.

=== Super Bowl performances ===
In the 1970s, Up with People began to make frequent appearances at the Super Bowl; the group performed in five Super Bowl halftime shows between 1976 and 1986. Only the Grambling State University Marching Band has performed more Super Bowl halftime shows, with a total of six appearances.

== Related and affiliated organizations ==
=== Up with People International Alumni Association ===
Up with People has an alumni group/professional networking organization that goes by the name: the Up with People International Alumni Association (UWPIAA). It was formed in 1988 and is also a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The alumni body is composed of over 20,000 members from over 100 countries. 

=== Common Beat ===
Common Beat is an organization started in Japan by South Korean Han Chu Son. Chu Son traveled as a student in Up with People, took the UWP show ‘A Common Beat’ to Japan, translated it, and performed it there.

== Criticism ==
By the 1990s, Up With People&#x27;s themed, musical-style spectacles were frequently lambasted by critics and mocked by television writers for being dated and seeming phony, if not outright creepy. One critic opined, &quot;Up With People didn&#x27;t lose its way because it lost the ability to control its cast members&#x27; behavior, or because the public suddenly came to recognize that its sickly sweet songs were insufferable. Up With People declined because it became irrelevant, especially after the Cold War ended[.]&quot; Its songs were criticized as naive and childlike, with titles like &quot;You Can&#x27;t Live Crooked And Think Straight&quot; and &quot;To Tell The Truth.&quot;

== &quot;Smile &#x27;Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story&quot; documentary ==
&quot;Smile &#x27;Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story&quot; (2009) is a documentary made by the wife of a former Up With People member, Lee Storey. A water rights attorney who never had training as a filmmaker, Storey felt compelled to make the film when she discovered her husband was keeping a secret from her: he was a former UWP member. The film contains never-before-seen archival footage, and the honest reflections of former members. The filmmakers describe it as &quot;what can happen when ideology, money and groupthink converge to co-opt youthful idealism.&quot; The documentary asserts that the organization, founded on conservative American ideals, was funded by corporate America and was deliberate propaganda to counteract the liberal counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. Former members talk about their experiences in UWP, which ranged from positive to more cult-like regimented rules.

The documentary spawned a lawsuit against the IRS, in which filmmaker Lee Storey asserted the right to deduct her expenses in making the film, even though she derived no profit from it. Storey won the case, with the Tax Court ruling production of the film was a deductible trade or business expense.

== In popular culture ==
Music critics cite Up with People as a stylistic influence for R.E.M&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; and the corresponding music video due to its over-the-top and colorful musical spectacle. In two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart vs. Thanksgiving&quot; and &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;, the show parodied the group as &quot;Hooray for Everything,&quot; a group of &quot;clean-cut young go-getters&quot; that performs ridiculous songs such as a cover of &quot;Get Dancin&quot; dedicated as a &quot;salute to the Western hemisphere, the dancingest hemisphere of all.&quot; The TV show &quot;Cheers&quot; had a character, Loretta, who sang with the fictional group &quot;The Grinning Americans&quot; (a favorite group of another character, Cliff, and his mother). The creators of &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, a musical that satirizes the Latter-Day Saint movement cited Up with People as an inspiration for the cartoonishly joyous style of several of the songs in their musical performance, which sends up the clean-cut image of Mormon culture. In the musical &quot;Ride the Cyclone&quot;, the character Ocean Rosenberg discovers an Up with People record in her left-of-center humanist parents&#x27; record collection at age 8 and starts her on her journey to become the most successful girl in town.

== Notable alumni ==

Elizabeth Birch, attorney and former corporate executive who chaired the board of directors of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1992 to 1994 and served from 1995 until 2004 as the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation&#x27;s largest LGBT organization, travelled one year with UWP in her high school years.

NBC News correspondent Tom Costello of &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, MSNBC, and CNBC traveled with Up with People. He is quoted as saying &quot;For me, the gap year was a big year of growing up, and I changed profoundly.&quot;

Frank Gatson Jr. traveled with Up with People, and he is known for being the creative director for En Vogue, Brandy, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, and Beyoncé. He has also choreographed videos, routines and live performances for artists including Michael Jackson, TLC, Kelly Rowland, Fifth Harmony, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Toni Braxton, and Usher.

Singer-songwriter Steve Poltz toured with Up with People as part of the band when he was 18; the song &quot;Up With People&quot; is on his 2022 album &quot;Stardust and Satellites&quot;.

<text>Luis Alberto Monge Álvarez (December 29, 1925 – November 29, 2016) was the President of Costa Rica from 1982 to 1986. He also served as Costa Rica&#x27;s first Ambassador to Israel from 1963 until 1966.

==Biography==

===Early and personal life===
Monge was born on December 29, 1925, in Palmares, Alajuela Province, to Gerardo Monge Quesada and Elisa Álvarez Vargas.

He married his first wife, Flora Rojas Alvarez, on March 9, 1946, but the marriage was dissolved in January 1960. Luis and Flora had 5 children: Flora, Myriam, Luis Alberto, Jorge, and Alfredo. He met his second wife, Doris Yankelewitz Berger, while both were attending a luncheon at the University of Costa Rica. At the time, Yankelewitz was a college student while Monge was serving as Ambassador to Israel. Monge and Yankelewitz married at a ceremony in San José on November 25, 1965. They had one daughter, Lena.

Monge and Yankelewitz later separated at the end of his presidency in 1986. The couple divorced in June 1988.

===Career===
Before becoming President in 1982, Monge served as Costa Rica&#x27;s first ambassador to Israel from 1963 to 1966 and was one of the founding members of the National Liberation Party (PLN) in 1951. He was also named a deputy in the Legislative Assembly, at age 24, making him one of the youngest to have reached such rank. He was the President of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica from 1973 to 1974.

Monge inherited an impoverished and distraught nation. The biggest issues his presidency dealt with were: the unmanageable economic crisis, the mounting foreign debt and the Sandinista-Contra crisis involving Nicaragua, the United States and Costa Rica&#x27;s northern border region.

In dealing with the country&#x27;s economic situation, he began austere programs on public spending, eliminated many government subsidies to various activities and promoted exports and receptive tourism. He eliminated export and production taxes. Monge also reformed monetary law, and forced all foreign currencies to go through the national bank system. A lot of his efforts paid off, reducing inflation and unemployment. During Monge&#x27;s term, Costa Rica declared an alignment with all &quot;western democracies&quot; and began to work closely with the governments of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, while its relationship with Nicaragua continued to deteriorate.

By then, the United States was involved in suppressing further socialist revolts in the region and saw Costa Rica as a stable ally in which to base their operations against Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista government. The U.S. imposed a commercial embargo against Nicaragua, facilitating the deepening of the rift between Costa Rica and its northern neighbor. Unwillingly, Costa Rica became too involved in the United States&#x27; struggle to topple the Sandinistas and in an attempt to pull away, proclaimed Costa Rica as an active, neutral nation. With Costa Rica still in the midst of a terrible economic recession, Monge opted to exchange sovereignty for economic stability: he gave in to pressure from the United States and accepted American financial assistance in exchange for allowing the CIA to set up small &quot;unofficial&quot; strategic outposts along the northern border.

Shortly after becoming President, Monge traveled to Israel, where, without knowing about the United Nations Security Council Resolution 478, he raised the national flag on Costa Rica&#x27;s embassy building in Jerusalem. He defined his actions as &quot;exercising sovereignty&quot;.

==Death==
On November 29, 2016, Monge suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest at his home in Santa Ana. He was rushed to the San Juan de Dios hospital, where he was declared dead aged 90.

<doc id="435771" wikidata="Q5669689" url="?curid=435771" title="Harry Hill's Fruit Corner">
<text>Harry Hill&#x27;s Fruit Corner was a radio show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom. It ran for four series between 1993 and 1997. The series starred Harry Hill, Al Murray, Burt Kwouk and Martin Hyder, and was the predecessor for Hill&#x27;s breakthrough television series, &quot;Harry Hill&quot;.

==Background==
Hill achieved his big breakthrough in August 1992 when he won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The show was commissioned shortly after he received the award. &quot;Fruit Corner&quot; ran for four series on BBC Radio 4. The first of these, in 1993, contained four episodes, but after the show&#x27;s success, it returned for three further six episode runs in 1994, 1995 and 1997.

The show acted as a springboard for Hill&#x27;s television career, and his Channel 4 show, &quot;Harry Hill&quot;, was similar in style and structure to &quot;Fruit Corner&quot;. A compilation of the best material from Series 1 to 3 was released on audio CD and cassette on 2 October 1995.

===Synopsis===
Hill hosted the show as himself, and each week was joined by a number of characters, including his big brother Alan Hill (Al Murray), his three-year-old adopted son, Alan Hill Jr. (Matt Bradstock), his parents, Jan and Tony Hill, and his grandmother, Nana Hill. Later series of the show often saw the family joined by Burt Kwouk.

The show also enjoyed a variety of other celebrity guests across its run, including, most notably, Ronnie Corbett and Rolf Harris.

The show used surreal humour as the basis for many of its jokes. Its presentation was very conversational, with each item tending to involve one or more members of the family. Later other recurring characters such as scientist Finsbury Park (Steve Bowditch) were included. Each programme was interspersed with surreal jokes from Harry, common ground for anyone familiar with his stand-up routines.

==Episodes==
As well as the regular actors featured on the show, Phill Jupitus and Soo Drouet appeared solely in the first series; Phil Nice and Brenda Gilhooly appeared in both the first and second; Joanna Brooks appeared solely in the second; and Peter Serafinowicz appeared solely in the fourth. Edna Doré starred in at least first and fourth series.

A permanent fixture in both the third and fourth series was Burt Kwouk, who appeared as a guest in series two, and liked it so much that he returned frequently. The third series focused on the main cast, but still included other regular actors and celebrity guests.

<text>Mirosław Hermaszewski (; 15 September 1941 – 12 December 2022) was a Polish cosmonaut, fighter plane pilot, and Polish Air Force officer. He became the first and, at the time of his death in December 2022, only Polish national to ever go to space when he flew aboard the Soviet Soyuz 30 spacecraft in 1978. He was the 89th human to reach outer space.

==Early life and education==
Mirosław Hermaszewski was born on 15 September 1941 into a Polish family in Lipniki, formerly in the Wołyń Voivodeship of Poland, but at the time part of Reichskommissariat Ukraine, and since the end of the Second World War located in Ukraine. The youngest of Roman Hermaszewski and Kamila Bielawska&#x27;s seven children, Mirosław was a survivor of the Volhynian slaughter during which the Ukrainian Insurgent Army murdered 19 members of his family, including his father when they attacked Lipniki on the night of 26–27 March 1943. At the time of the massacre, Hermaszewski was only 18 months old; the youngest victim from his family was 1½ years old, while the oldest—Hermaszewski&#x27;s grandfather—was 90.

Although he has since highlighted the need to depart from nationalist sentiments and to accept responsibility for the genocide, Hermaszewski also condemned discrimination of the Ukrainian nation as a whole based on the actions of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Ukrainian villagers who aided them in the murders. In an April 2015 interview with NaTemat.pl about the massacres, he was quoted as saying:

Hermaszewski pointed out that after his mother barely escaped with her life from Lipniki, it was Ukrainian women from a neighbouring village who were acquainted with her that had given her shelter and looked after her during the ethnic cleansing of Poles and Jews from the region. He also recalled how his mother told him of many Ukrainians that took Poles in and cared for them during this period.

After the incorporation of former Polish territory into the Ukrainian SSR at the end of the war, those of Hermaszewski&#x27;s family who survived were forcibly deported to Wołów near Wrocław, where he completed elementary and high school. From a young age he was interested in aviation, being a skillful self-taught modeller. In 1960, he completed a gliding pilotage course in the Wrocław Aeroklub. He flew at the airports in Oleśnica, Jeżów Sudecki, on the Żar mountain, and in Lisie Kąty.

Hermaszewski finished his airplane pilotage course in Grudziądz in 1961, and in autumn of the same year started studying to be a fighter plane pilot at the &quot;School of Eaglets&quot; in Dęblin. There he mastered the TS-8 Bies trainer aircraft and then earned permission to fly the MiG-15 jet fighter. After graduating from the academy in March 1964 at the top of his class, he was assigned to the air defence regiment in Poznań with the rank of &quot;podporucznik&quot; and continued to study at the General Staff Academy in Warsaw; he learned to fly the MiG-21. In the years that followed, he continued to train while serving the Polish Air Force as the commander of squadrons and regiments in Słupsk, Gdynia and Wrocław. In 1971, he graduated from the Karol Świerczewski Military Academy.

Over the course of his military career, Hermaszewski piloted gliders and training aircraft such as the aforementioned TS-8 Bies, the CSS-13, the TS-11 Iskra, and the PZL-130 Orlik, various piston engine airplanes like the Yak-18, as well as a plethora of jets – such as the MiG-15, MiG-17, Polish derivatives of the latter, several versions of the MiG-21, the F-16, F-18, Mirage 2000-5, the Su-27, MiG-29 and others.

==Interkosmos programme==

In 1976, he was chosen from a pool of 500 Polish military pilots to take part in the Interkosmos space programme. The group of candidates, who initially were not informed about what they were being selected and psychologically tested for, was narrowed down to 120, then just five, and eventually from an elite selection of only several pilots Hermaszewski was finally picked with Zenon Jankowski as his backup to participate in the Soyuz 30 mission. For a period of almost two years, they underwent extensive training for theoretical expertise, physical endurance, and resistance to mental stress (among various other factors) at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, near Moscow. Besides training in weightless conditions, psychological trials took place as well with candidates at one point having to complete 998 tests in one day.

In late June 1978, together with Soviet cosmonaut Pyotr Klimuk from Belarus, Hermaszewski flew from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to spend eight days aboard the Salyut 6 space station (from 17:27 on 27 June to 16:31 on 5 July 1978). The latter fulfilled the role of deck engineer, while the former (having performed two space missions up to this point) served as commander. Minutes before the launch of their spacecraft, Hermaszewski said:

During their time in orbit, Klimuk and Hermaszewski carried out various geoscience experiments and photographed the Earth – orbiting it 126 times. Over the duration of their stay at the space station, Hermaszewski and Klimuk—sometimes with the aid of Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov, the two other cosmonauts who had already been stationed at Salyut 6 prior to the arrival of the Soyuz 30 mission—carried out a total of eleven different experiments while in space that had been planned internationally as part of the programme.

They landed in the steppes of Kazakhstan, 300 km west of Tselinograd. After the spaceflight, Hermaszewski achieved hero status in the countries of the Eastern Bloc (especially the Polish People&#x27;s Republic) and was awarded several high honours, including the rarely-given-to-foreigners Hero of the Soviet Union title for his participation in the mission. A massive information and propaganda campaign around the Soyuz 30 mission and its participants was launched by the Polish government in coordination with the Soviet Union and other allied states in the Warsaw Pact. In 1985, he co-founded the Association of Space Explorers. Hermaszewski later became President of the Polish Astronautical Society (a position he held from 1986 to 1990).

==Later career==

When martial law in Poland was introduced on 13 December 1981, Hermaszewski was named as a member of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON) without his consent or knowledge. He was studying in Moscow at the time and was at first ordered to return to Warsaw when martial law was declared, but after two weeks he was released to continue his studies. In 1982 he advanced to &quot;pułkownik&quot; military rank. Over a year after the end of martial law in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, in November 1984, Hermaszewski was appointed commander of the Fighter Pilots School in Dęblin. By 1987, he became head of that institution and his time as director has since then been assessed very positively, as his superiors noted the progress in team integration, as well as an increase in the didactic and educational level at the university.

In 1988, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and continued to serve in high-ranking positions for the training of new combat pilots. Between 1991 and 1992, Hermaszewski served as second-in-command of the Polish Air Force and Air Defence. He performed his final flight in a MiG-29, in October 2005, and after that retired; in his 40 years of service for the Polish Air Force, he spent 2047 hours in the air.

Following retirement from the military, he unsuccessfully stood in 2001 Polish parliamentary elections as an SLD-UP candidate to the &quot;Senat&quot;. He received 93,783 votes, which translated to 32.46% of the vote in his electoral region. In the 2002 Polish local elections, again as a candidate of the social-democratic SLD-UP party, he was elected into the Mazovian Regional Assembly with 10,463 votes. He then became a member of the SLD party and ran once again in Polish parliamentary elections in 2005, with 5,223 votes but no mandate. In 2009, Universitas published his autobiographical story &quot;Ciężar nieważkości. Opowieść pilota-kosmonauty&quot; (&quot;The Weight of Weightlessness. Story of a Pilot-Cosmonaut&quot;) to positive reception from readers, leading to reprints and several expanded versions being published in the decade that followed.

Hermaszewski was set to try his hand at politics once more as a candidate for the European Parliament, again from the SLD party, in the 2014 elections. Ultimately he decided not to take part, as his son-in-law was also running for office but via an opposing political party. In 2018, the conservative ruling Law and Justice party of Poland—mirroring similar efforts from 2007—tried to vote through a law that would collectively demote all former members of the aforementioned WRON from the early 1980s to the lowest rank of private, including Hermaszewski. The so-called &quot;degradation act&quot; was met with controversy in Polish and foreign media primarily due to the case of Hermaszewski, who was initially included as a member of the WRON without his consent or knowledge. In the end, the proposed law was vetoed by President Andrzej Duda, who used Hermaszewski&#x27;s case as one of the reasons why the &quot;degradation act&quot; needs to be rewritten.

==Personal life==

Hermaszewski was interested in aviation and model aircraft from an early age. He was married to Emilia (née Łazar) Hermaszewska from 1966 until his death; together they had two children, Mirosław (born 1966) and Emilia (born 1974). They also had four grandchildren: Julia, Amelia, Emilia, and Stanisław as well as a pet Yorkshire Terrier Giokonda. Hermaszewski&#x27;s son, &quot;Porucznik&quot; Mirosław Roman Hermaszewski, followed in the footsteps of his father and uncle, graduating from the Polish Air Force University to become a military reserve force officer. Hermaszewski&#x27;s daughter Emilia married politician Ryszard Czarnecki.

During their training and after their joint mission to the Salyut 6 orbital station, Pyotr Klimuk and Mirosław Hermaszewski befriended each other – they stayed in touch and remained close friends ever since. Mirosław also befriended numerous other persons associated with the Soviet space programme during his time in Russia and Kazakhstan, including members of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s family and Alexei Leonov. Hermaszewski continued to express gratitude for being given the opportunity to see the cosmos firsthand and recalled it very fondly, admitting that he missed it and still dreamed about the experience often. He regularly visited schools and spoke with children of all ages, as well as attending interviews with various media outlets; he has been described as a &quot;modest and likeable person&quot;. Hermaszewski said he had an &quot;aesthetic experience&quot; that transformed into a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; while aboard the Soyuz 30 in space, but he viewed faith and religion as an intimate and private matter.

Hermaszewski was highly critical of for-profit spaceflight and viewed space exploration as something that should to be done for science and human progress. In an interview he once stated:
Mirosław Hermaszewski supported Polish engineer Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski during the latter&#x27;s selection process for the 2022 European Space Agency Astronaut Group. In a February 2025 interview, Uznański stated that Hermaszewski was the first person to call him with congratulations in the morning after he was accepted. Uznański would go on to be selected for the European Space Agency&#x27;s &quot;Ignis&quot; part of Axiom Mission 4, citing Hermaszewski as a major inspiration.

==Death==

On 12 December 2022, Hermaszewski died at the age of 81. His son-in-law, Czarnecki, informed news media that Hermaszewski died in a Varsovian hospital due to complications resulting from a surgery he had undergone that morning. On 21 December, after Holy Mass in the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army, the cosmonaut was buried at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. The ceremony was of a state nature with the participation of a Representative Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces; four F-16 fighter jets flew over the necropolis in tribute of the deceased general.

A tombstone monument was unveiled on his grave at 17:20, on 27 June 2024 – the 46th anniversary of Mirosław Hermaszewski&#x27;s spaceflight.

==Cultural significance==

*In the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, after the successful landing of Soyuz 30, numerous items of memorabilia were produced – postage stamps, patches, pins, stickers, coins, medals, pennants, badges, and other small symbols – many of which bared the likeness of Mirosław Hermaszewski. In 1978 alone, books about Hermaszewski and his flight were printed in the following numbers: 90,000 copies of &quot;Polak melduje z kosmosu&quot;, &quot;Polska w kosmosie&quot; (30,000), &quot;Polak w kosmosie&quot; (80,000), and &quot;Droga Polaka na orbitę&quot; (20,000), for a total of 220,000 books. In addition, 92,000 black-and-white postcards, 90,000 copies of two photo-newspapers, and 2,000 sets of photographs, as well as other collectibles were produced. The &quot;Czołówka&quot; film studio put out four documentary-biographical films about the first Pole in space, all made by Bohdan Świątkiewicz.
*Anna German recorded the song &quot;W wielkiej kosmicznej rodzinie&quot; about Hermaszewski&#x27;s mission in 1978.
*In Vietnam, a series of postage stamps was introduced in 1983 to commemorate the Soyuz 30 spaceflight. However, the surnames of the cosmonauts were rendered incorrectly as &quot;Hepmazepski&quot; (Hermaszewski) and &quot;Klimuc&quot; (Klimuk).
*In Wołów, the town in southwest Poland where Hermaszewski&#x27;s family was relocated when he was a child, a monument &quot;To the Glory of Polish Aviators and Cosmonauts&quot; was opened in 1985 on the occasion of the 700th anniversary of Wołów receiving its town privileges. The monument is a Lim-5P attack aircraft that was flown by Hermaszewski during his military career.
*In Vitebsk, present-day northeast Belarus, a monument to cosmonauts Pyotr Klimuk and Mirosław Hermaszewski was opened in 1988.
*Similarly to the one in Wołów, one of the fighter jets that Hermaszewski flew on is used as a monument in Miastko. It was gifted to the town by the cosmonaut in 1989 and unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II; the text on its plaque reads: &quot;To the glory of Polish wings on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War – citizens of Miastko&quot;.
*During his time in space, Hermaszewski wore a digital watch produced by Unitra Warel that was considered an advanced piece of technology for its time and was the first Polish electronic watch. In 2016, the Polish watchmaking company G. Gerlach produced the &quot;Kosmonauta&quot; – their own modernised version of the design, but updated for the capabilities of contemporary technology.
*Mirosław Hermaszewski was also honoured by the Russian Sturmanskie brand of wristwatches with a limited edition automatic chronograph series in 2019; although this watch was not styled after the Unitra Warel, it features unique markings with the badge of Polish military pilots on its face as well as the likeness of the first Polish cosmonaut on its reverse. Only 190 units were produced to reflect the 190 hours Hermaszewski spent in the cosmos, each sold in special capsule packaging with an original certificate of authenticity signed by Hermaszewski.

<text>Alliance 90 () was a political alliance of three non-communist political groups in East Germany. It was formed in February 1990 by the New Forum, Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights. It received 2.9% of the vote in the 1990 Volkskammer elections. For the first all-German federal election it formed a joint list with the East German Green Party. It was this coalition that merged with the West German Green Party in 1993 to form Alliance 90/The Greens.

==History==
On 7 February 1990, the New Forum, Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights agreed upon the creation of the strategic partnership Alliance 90 (&quot;Bündnis 90&quot;) for the 1990 East German general election. On 18 March 1990, in the next and final free election of the former East Germany, the Alliance 90 received 2.9% of the vote, thus securing 12 seats. By far the best result for Alliance 90 was in constituency of Berlin with 6.3%. In the remaining constituencies results ranged from 1.6% in Neubrandenburg to 3.8% in Potsdam. Together with the eight elected mandates from the &quot;Green Party in the GDR&quot;, they created the &quot;Alliance &#x27;90/Greens Party&quot; Faction (&quot;Fraktion Bündnis 90/Grüne&quot;).

In the East German Landtag elections on 14 October 1990 the differently-composed electoral alliances made their entry into every Landtag except Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the New Forum did not participate in the alliance. In Brandenburg, the three civic groups of the Alliance 90 took office alone. In other states, the Greens also successfully took part in the electoral alliances. In Brandenburg from 1990 until 1994, Alliance 90 participated in a traffic light coalition with the Social Democrats and Free Democrats.

In the 1990 federal election held on 2 December 1990, the first election following the reunification of Germany, 6.1% of voters in the Eastern electoral area (1.2% across Germany) cast their &quot;Zweitstimme&quot; (the vote for a party, as opposed to for a person) for the group &quot;Alliance 90/Greens – Citizens&#x27; Movement&quot; (&quot;Bündnis 90/Grüne – BürgerInnenbewegung&quot;), which entered into the German Bundestag with eight East German elected members: Klaus-Dieter Feige, Ingrid Köppe, Gerd Poppe, Christina Schenk, Werner Schulz, Wolfgang Ullmann, Konrad Weiß and Vera Wollenberger. Werner Schultz took over the function of Speaker of the Bundestag group, which he held for the entirety of the legislative period. Its West German partners, the Greens, fell short of election to the parliament.

On 21 September 1991, the party Alliance 90 was founded, which brought together parts of the New Forum, Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights. On 14 May 1993 came the agreement to create the union of &quot;Alliance 90/The Greens&quot; with the Greens which had been a cross-German party since the end of 1990.

One part of the Brandenburg state alliance advocated against a unification with the Greens, including future Minister-President of Brandenburg Matthias Platzeck, Günter Nooke, Ute Platzeck, Peter Schüler, Manfred Kruczek and Gerd Gebhardt. However, they were unsuccessful in their case and founded the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Alliance&quot; (&quot;Bürger Bündnis&quot;), headed by Günter Nooke, Matthias Platzeck und Wolfgang Pohl. The party Alliance 90/The Greens in Saxony had already been established on 27 September 1991, one and a half years before the unification at federal level.

<doc id="435781" wikidata="Q58330" url="?curid=435781" title="Međimurje County">
<text>Međimurje County (; ; ) is a triangle-shaped county in the northernmost part of Croatia, roughly corresponding to the historical and geographical region of Međimurje. It is the smallest Croatian county by size, and the second most densely populated after the City of Zagreb. The county&#x27;s seat and main urban centre is Čakovec.

The county borders Slovenia in the north-west and Hungary in the east; about 20 kilometres of Slovenian territory separate it from Austria. The south-eastern corner of the county is near the town of Legrad and the confluence of the Mura into the Drava. The closest cities include Varaždin and Koprivnica in Croatia, Lendava, Murska Sobota and Maribor in Slovenia, as well as Nagykanizsa in Hungary and Graz in Austria. The Croatian capital of Zagreb is about 90 kilometers south-west of Čakovec.

There are slopes of the Alpine foothills in the north-western part of the county, the Upper Međimurje, making it suitable for vineyards. The south-eastern part of the county, the Lower Međimurje, touches the flat Pannonian Plain. The flat parts of the region are also largely used for agriculture, which mostly includes fields of cereals, maize and potato, as well as orchards, which are mostly planted with apple trees. There are two major hydroelectric power plants along the southern border of the county, on the Drava River.

==Name and symbols==

Besides its Croatian name (Međimurska županija), the county is also known as Muraköz megye in Hungarian, Medžimurska županija in Slovene, and Murinsel in German.

Throughout the past, the historical region of Međimurje was referred to by several names. In Latin, it was called &quot;Insula intra Dravum et Muram&quot;, &quot;Insula Muro-Dravana&quot; and &quot;Hortus Slavoniae Superior&quot; (or &quot;Hortus Croatiae&quot;). The names &quot;Insula intra Dravum et Muram&quot; and &quot;Insula Muro-Dravana&quot; mean &quot;island between the Mura and the Drava&quot;, referring to the two rivers bordering the region. The name &quot;Hortus Croatiae&quot; means &quot;the [flower] garden of Croatia&quot;. In Hungarian, the region is known as &quot;Muraköz&quot;, and in German as &quot;Murinsel&quot;. In Croatian, it was referred to by several names as well, including &quot;Mejmorje&quot;, &quot;Medžmorje&quot; and &quot;Medžimorje&quot; (in Kajkavian), as well as &quot;Međumurje&quot; and &quot;Međimurje&quot; (in Shtokavian).

The Kajkavian toponym &quot;Medžimorje&quot; is believed to have been the original name of the region. It originated in the 6th or 7th century, which makes it older than the Latin toponyms that were first mentioned in feudalism. The name &quot;Medžimorje&quot; is derived from the Proto-Slavic preposition &quot;medji&quot; and the noun &quot;morje&quot;. It literally means &quot;land surrounded by water&quot;, i.e. &quot;island&quot;. &quot;Međimorje&quot; is also an archaic common noun that was used in Kajkavian Croatian, also meaning &quot;island&quot;. However, the names &quot;Međimurje&quot; (Shtokavian Croatian), &quot;Muraköz&quot; (Hungarian), and &quot;Murinsel&quot; (German) all contain the hydronym &quot;Mura&quot; (or &quot;Mur&quot;). The name &quot;Murinsel&quot; means &quot;island on the Mura&quot;. This led to some dilemmas in the usage of the Croatian names &quot;Međimorje&quot; and &quot;Međimurje&quot;. In Kajkavian Croatian the name is &quot;Medžimurje&quot;, or &quot;Medžimorje&quot;, and in the Prekmurje Slovene it is &quot;Medmürje&quot; or &quot;Nedžimurje.&quot;

The region&#x27;s unofficial symbols include the turtle dove (Croatian: &quot;grlica gugutka&quot;, but locally referred to just as &quot;grlica&quot;), which is one of the most common birds in the region, and the violet (&quot;ljubičica&quot;). The region is often called &quot;Međimurje malo&quot;, which is Croatian for &quot;Little Međimurje&quot;.

==Geography==

Međimurje County location in the Pannonian Basin covers the plains between two rivers – the Mura and the Drava. The Mura flows along the county&#x27;s northern border with the Slovenian region of Prekmurje (Municipality of Lendava, Municipality of Ljutomer and Municipality of Ormož) and its eastern border with Hungary&#x27;s Zala County, while the Drava flows along the county&#x27;s southern border with two other Croatian counties – Varaždin County and Koprivnica-Križevci County. The Trnava River flows through the middle of the county.

There are two reservoir lakes on the Drava – Lake Varaždin and Lake Dubrava – both built to serve the two hydroelectric power plants based in the county. Lake Dubrava, located near the city of Prelog, is the biggest artificial lake in Croatia and the second largest lake overall in the country. The power plant using Lake Varaždin is named after the county seat, Čakovec, while the one using Lake Dubrava is named Dubrava, taking its name from the nearby village of Donja Dubrava.

The county&#x27;s elevation ranges between 120 and 344 metres above sea level, the latter being the elevation of its highest hill, Mohokos. Čakovec has an elevation of between 160 and 165 metres above sea level. Throughout the past, there were occasional earthquakes in the region. One of significant strength hit the region in 1880, while another in 1738 devastated Čakovec and particularly the nearby Šenkovec.

Of the county&#x27;s total area of 729.5 km2, around 360 km2 are used in agriculture. Due to the high population density, agricultural land is divided into 21,000 units averaging each. 27.5 km2 are covered with orchards. 11 km2 is the hilly area, located in the north-western part of the county, with villages like Štrigova and numerous vineyards. Grasslands and forests cover an area of around 105 km2. The biggest forest is Murščak, located between Domašinec and Donji Hrašćan.

===Climate===
The climate is continental. Summers are quite hot. Daily temperatures during the summer months usually range between 20 °C and 30 °C, but can reach as high as 40 °C in July and August, when they can also stay above 30 °C for several days. Thunderstorms and rapid weather changes are common throughout the summer months, as well as in late spring, with a particularly stormy period being between mid-June and mid-July, when they often occur on a daily basis.

Springs and autumns are usually calm, although rapid weather changes can also be common during the two seasons. Winters can be very severe, with early-morning temperatures sometimes reaching as low as -20 °C. During the winter months, daily temperatures usually range between -10 °C and 10 °C. January is usually the coldest month, during which daily temperatures can stay below 0 °C for several days. Snowfall usually occurs between late October and early March. Fog can be a common early-morning occurrence between late summer and early spring, with all-day fog sometimes occurring during the coldest months.

Warm weather, with daily temperatures around 15 °C, can occur as early as mid-February and as late as mid-November. In early October and late March, daily temperatures can also reach as high as 20 °C. However, February and November are generally cold months, with occasional heavy snow and daily temperatures around 0 °C, while March and October are generally cool, with occasional light snow and daily temperatures ranging between 0 °C and 15 °C. In March and October, it is also common for the temperature to drop below 0 °C over night, even when the daily temperature is in the range between 10 °C and 15 °C.

==Administrative division==
There are three towns in Međimurje County – Čakovec, Prelog and Mursko Središće. The county seat, Čakovec, has an urban population of around 15,147, with a population of 27,820 in the administrative area.

There are also several municipalities in the county, with their seats including Belica, Dekanovec, Domašinec, Donja Dubrava, Donji Kraljevec, Donji Vidovec, Goričan, Gornji Mihaljevec, Kotoriba, Mala Subotica, Nedelišće, Orehovica, Podturen, Pribislavec, Selnica, Strahoninec, Sveta Marija, Sveti Juraj na Bregu, Sveti Martin na Muri, Šenkovec, Štrigova and Vratišinec. Nedelišće, Pribislavec, Strahoninec and Šenkovec are all located on the outskirts of Čakovec, with Belica approximately 5 kilometers from the city&#x27;s centre.

If not including the City of Zagreb, Međimurje is the smallest Croatian county, with an area of 729.5 km2. Nevertheless, with an average population of 156 people/km2, it is the most densely populated Croatian county, again if the City of Zagreb is not included. 

==Demographics==

In the 2011 census, the total population of the county was 113,804. During the same census, a total of 106,744 residents of the county identified themselves as Croats. The following ethnic minorities were represented by more than 100 people in the 2011 census: Romani (5,107), Slovenes (516), Serbs (249), Albanians (200), and Russians (137). The county has the highest concentration of Romani people in Croatia.

The demographics of the region changed swiftly in the period between 1950 and 1975, with a significant reduction in the size of the family. From the national perspective, the population is moving toward the Istria region, while the seasonal workforce moves toward Zagreb and the southern parts of Croatia. The natural population increase is minimal.

==Language and education==

The official language of Međimurje County, as in the whole of Croatia, is the Shtokavian dialect of Croatian. However, the local dialect is Kajkavian, which is commonly spoken and understood among the people native to the region. In Kajkavian there is a number of Hungarian and German loanwords, but the Međimurian Kajkavian dialect sees the strongest Hungarian and German influence. The Međimurian dialect forms dialect continuum to the Prekmurje Slovene (Southern Dolinsko dialect near Lendava) and the dialect of Prlekija. The artists of the Međimurje seek to cultivate the local dialect, including Franjo Mesarić–Frenki writer and poet, and Vlado Mihaljević, writer, singer, cantor and searcher.

Each municipality seat has an eight-year elementary school. However, there are also local schools in many smaller villages within each municipality, where the pupils can complete the first four years of their primary education. After that, they are moved to the main school of their municipality to complete the remaining four years, usually travelling to the school by a school bus.

Čakovec has three eight-year elementary schools. There are also several high schools in Čakovec, including the Gymnasium and schools offering secondary education for jobs in technology, industry, transport, construction, economy and trade. The smaller city of Prelog also offers secondary education for jobs in catering, tourism and economy.

The city of Čakovec also has two institutions of higher education – the Faculty of Teacher Education (&quot;Učiteljski fakultet&quot;) and the Polytechnic of Međimurje (&quot;Međimursko veleučilište&quot;). The Faculty of Teacher Education in Čakovec is part of the University of Zagreb.

==History==

===Early history===
The first organized human habitations here can be traced back to the Stone Age. There is a Neolithic site called Ferenčica near Prelog. There are archaeological sites that date from the Bronze Age, and 3rd century sites called &quot;Ciglišće&quot; and &quot;Varaščine&quot;.

During the Iron Age, the Indo-European tribes identified in the area were Celts, Serets and Pannons, and the region became part of the Roman empire. In the 1st century, the Romans knew the area as &quot;Insula intra Dravam et Muram&quot; (&quot;island between the Drava and Mura rivers&quot;) according to the geographer Strabo. The most important settlement they established was Halikan (&quot;Halicanum&quot;). The region was part of the Roman province of Pannonia and later part of the Pannonia Superior.

Čakovec was originally called Aquama (&quot;the wet city&quot;), because the area was marshland. During the Migration Period, many different tribes, such as Huns, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, passed through the region. The region was part of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths, the state of the Lombards, the Avar Khaganate, and the Frankish Kingdom. The Slavs, which settled this region in the 6th century, gained independence after destruction of the Avar Khaganate. In the 9th century, it was included in the Slavic state of Lower Pannonia. According to some sources, the area was also part of the Great Moravia.

===Medieval history===
The Hungarians occupied the region in 896 and expanded to the river Sava, but as the Principality of Hungary transformed to the Kingdom of Hungary, the borders with the Kingdom of Croatia were set along the river Drava. In 1102 Croatia entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary. During 13th century tradesmen and merchants (mostly ethnic Germans) started to arrive and began to develop the urban localities that are present today. Prelog (Perlak) was founded in 1264, shortly after the invasion of the Mongols in 1242, and the other settlements followed. Later it was part of Zala County. In the beginning of the 14th century, the area was ruled by powerful semi-independent oligarch Henrik Kőszegi.

Čakovec (Csáktornya) got its name from Count Dimitry Csáky, who at the beginning of the 13th century erected the timber fortification that eventually was &quot;Csáky&#x27;s tower&quot;, mentioned for the first time in 1328. King Charles I named Čakovec as the capitol in 1333. In 1350, King Louis I gave the land to viceroy (Ban) Stjepan I Lacković, a member of the ruling Lacković family of Transylvania. It remained Lacković property until 1397, when King Sigismund executed Stjepan II Lacković, and took back the area to the Crown.

In 1405, the Celje family received Međimurje (Muraköz) as a gift from the Crown, and the land was mortgaged. The monastery in Goričan (Goritsán) managed the administration of the seat of the main territorial dominion as an attorney of the Celje family. King Matthias Corvinus bought the mortgage and donated the land to John I Ernuszt and his son, who were Jewish merchants from Sweden, living in Buda. The monastery in Goričan, which had managed the administration of the seat of the main territorial dominion, was dissolved. The seat of the administration of the main territorial dominion Goričan came under the administration of the Bishop of Ljubljana. It remained in the hands of the Ernušts until 1526, when the family died out without heir.


Since 1526, the region became part of the Habsburg monarchy, as did Kingdom of Hungary along with Croatia. It followed a succession and inheritance dispute between the Keglević family and the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I. Since 1530 until 1790 Goričan was by interdictum under the administration of the Bishop of Zagreb as an attorney of both the Emperor and the Keglević family to prevent any violent confrontations between them both, but Čakovec became the seat of the administration of the main territorial dominion in 1546, because even the Bishop Simon Erdődy (1518–1543, Bishop of Zagreb) could not prevent a violent confrontation between the Emperor and Petar Keglević in 1542/43. In 1546 the Diet in Pressburg (Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava) approved the transfer of Čakovec and Međimurje to Nikola Šubić Zrinski.

Rapid development began in 1547 under the ruling Zrinski family. In 1579 the craftsmen and merchants outside the walls of Čakovec Castle (csáktornyai kastély) were granted the right to trade; this was the beginning of the formal and legal city structure. The area was of importance as a trade center with Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary positioned nearby on the main roads, facilitating the exchange of goods, crafts and ideas. The region was also a military buffer zone against the expanding Ottoman Empire.

Nikola Šubić Zrinski ruled as Nicholas IV (1508–1566). He was a hero of the Battle of Szigetvár of the Habsburg-Ottoman wars. Then followed his son, Juraj IV Zrinski (George IV), until 1603, and his grandson Nikola VI. Zrinski (Nicholas VI) until 1624. Next was another grandson, a brother of Nicholas VI, Juraj V Zrinski (George V). He was poisoned in 1626 by the general Albrecht Wallenstein in Pressburg and was buried in Pauline Monastery of Sveta Jelena (&quot;St. Helen&quot; in English) near Čakovec, next to the graves of his ancestors. He was followed by his son Nikola VII Zrinski (Nicholas VII), (1620–1664), a famous Croatian Ban. At the coronation of Ferdinand IV, he carried the sword of state and was made Captain General of Croatia. He was killed while hunting in the forest near Kuršanec (Kursanecz), apparently by a wounded wild boar, but there were rumors that he had been murdered by the order of the Habsburg court. His brother, Petar Zrinski (Peter IV), was noted for his role in the attempted Croatian-Hungarian rebellion of 1664-1670 which ultimately led to his execution for treason. His wife, Katarina Zrinska, died imprisoned for the same offence on 16 November 1673 in Graz. On 19 August 1691 the son of Nicholas VII, Adam Zrinski, fell at Battle of Slankamen while fighting against the Ottoman Empire. Parts of Međimurje remained in the hands of the Zrinski family until the end of the 17th century. The last male member of the family, Ivan Antun Zrinski (John IV), died in prison in 1703.

In 1715, during the period of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, Count Michael Althan became the owner of Međimurje; he received the land for his loyal services. In 1720 the region was detached from Croatia and was included into the Zala County of the main part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1738 Čakovec Castle was hit by an earthquake, which caused tremendous damage. The owners of the city made some repairs, but in 1741, fire caused additional damage. The castle started to decay.

The Church of St. Jerome was rebuilt in 1749 in Štrigova (Stridóvár) by the famous artist Ivan Ranger following the demolition of the original 15th century-built chapel by an earthquake in 1738.

Ignacije Szentmartony, a Jesuit from Kotoriba (Kottori), was a royal mathematician and astronomer in Lisbon and in 1754 an explorer of Brazil on behalf of the Portuguese government.

In 1791 Count György Festetics bought Međimurje, including Čakovec Castle and Feštetić Castle (Festetics kastély) in the neighboring village of Pribislavec (Zalaújvár), which remained in the property of Feštetić family until 1923.

On 19 April 1848 Josip Jelačić proclaimed a union of Croatian provinces, and their separation from the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1868, the former status quo was restored. Within the years 1860 to 1889 the railroad was introduced, while in 1893 electric power started illuminating most of the city streets. According to the 1910 census, the population of Međimurje numbered 90,387 people, including 82,829 Croats and 6,766 Hungarians.

The Magyarization between the 1870s-1910s introduced the concept of &quot;Međimurian language&quot; (muraközi nyelv). According to this view, the spoken language in Međimurje was not Croatian or Kajkavian, but &quot;Međimurian Slavic&quot;, which is a separate Slavic language-family. József Margitai was the main propagandist of the Međimurian language and he published few Međimurian books. The propagandists exploited idea that the Croatians are dissatisfied with the new Serbo-Croatian language.

Margitai propagated in Međimurian the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the assimilation in the Međimurje and the superiority of the Hungarian nation. The fake &quot;Međimurian literary language&quot; in fact was only little different from the Kajkavian literary language.

===Modern history (after World War I)===

In 1918, after the collapse of the monarchic union of Austria-Hungary, and after the disarmament of the local police, the Međimurje region fell into civil disorder. The National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in Zagreb sent hastily assembled troops, which crossed the river Drava and reached Čakovec where they were defeated. In the second attempt to capture the region in late 1918, troops commanded by Slavko Kvaternik forced the Hungarian troops to abandon the region. On 9 January 1919, Međimurje joined to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia).

In the Southern region, in the Slovene March (today the Prekmurje and Raba March near Szentgotthárd) there emerged independence-autonomy movements. József Klekl expressed the program of the autonomous (or independent) Slovene March. Oszkár Jászi, who supported the Slovene and Croatian minority, completed the program in a proposal: the Slovene March and the Međimurje should be merged. The program did not materialize.

Until 1922 the region was part of Varaždin County. From 1922 to 1929 the region was part of the Maribor Oblast, from 1929 to 1939 part of the Sava Banovina and from 1939 to 1941 part of the Banovina of Croatia.

Upon signing the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia became a member of the Axis powers. In spite of this, after the coup Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis forces on 6 April 1941 and was subsequently occupied and partitioned. Between 1941 and 1945, Međimurje was occupied and annexed by Hungary. At this time some re-settlement of ethnic Croats who were settled in the region after 1918 occurred. Bulgarian troops within the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front captured the region in the spring of 1945, and the region became part of the socialist Croatia within restored Yugoslavia.

==Culture and cuisine==
===Festivals===

One notable traditional festival is the &quot;Fašnik&quot;, a carnival-like event held in February. The event&#x27;s name is derived from the German word &quot;Fasching&quot;, describing similar events mostly held in Austria and Bavaria. The festival has been observed for centuries, with masked people participating in public parades and celebrations to drive off the demons of darkness and winter. The main festivities of the &quot;Fašnik&quot; period are usually held in the centre of Čakovec, with a parade of masked people from the entire region walking through the city&#x27;s streets to reach its central square, where a hanged hay doll representing the &quot;Fašnik&quot; is traditionally burned down to signify victory over the demons of darkness and winter, as well as to mark the end of festivities.

Another notable and highly attended festival held in Čakovec is the &quot;Porcijunkulovo&quot;, an annual fair which takes place on the streets around the city&#x27;s centre between 30 July and 5 August. At the fair, many of the region&#x27;s traditional products, such as baskets, can be purchased and people can also see how some of the products are made. Many of the region&#x27;s traditional foods are served during the festivities and there is a daily entertainment program at a temporary stage set up at the city&#x27;s central square.

===Food===
For many centuries, Međimurje was part of Hungary, whose influence is evident in its history and culture.

The traditional food during the &quot;Fašnik&quot; period are a type of doughnuts known in Croatian as &quot;krafne&quot;, although the local people also use several similar names for the food. As well as being the traditional food of the &quot;Fašnik&quot; period, &quot;krafne&quot; are also a popular everyday food in the region and are sold in local stores and bakeries throughout the year. The traditional food of the &quot;Porcijunkulovo&quot; festivities is lángos, whose name is spelled &quot;langoš&quot; in Croatian. Another notable sweet food is a type of nut roll called &quot;orehnjača&quot;, which is filled with walnut cream. Its name is derived from &quot;oreh&quot;, meaning &quot;walnut&quot; in the local Kajkavian dialect. A similar cake filled with poppy seed is called &quot;makovnjača&quot;, with its name derived from &quot;mak&quot;, the Croatian word for poppy.

There is also a type of corn mush called &quot;žganci&quot;, which is usually served with liquid sour cream, buttermilk or warm milk. Cottage cheese is also a popular food in the region. It can either be served with liquid sour cream to form a dish known in the local dialect as &quot;sir z vrhnjom&quot;, which translates as &quot;cheese with cream&quot;, or used to make &quot;turoš&quot;, in which case it is cone-shaped and dried. &quot;Sir z vrhnjom&quot; is often spiced with red paprika, which is also one of the main ingredients in &quot;turoš&quot;. Cottage cheese is also used as one of the fillings in a pastry called &quot;štrukli&quot;. Another condiment popular in the region is the pumpkin seed oil, which is used as a dressing for many local vegetable salad varieties.

Some of the other traditional foods of the region include a type of pasta called &quot;mlinci&quot;, white and black sausages, known as &quot;čurke&quot;, which is served with sour cabbage, as well as other dried or otherwise preserved meat, such as &quot;meso z tiblice&quot;, which is stored in a small, usually wooden barrel called &quot;tiblica&quot;. There are also some vegetable dishes, while the production of wine is ubiquitous in the hilly landscape of the region&#x27;s northwest. The diet of the region is part of the Croatian cuisine, which is known for its diversity.

===Recreation===
There are spas used for recreation in Vučkovec and around Sveti Martin na Muri, both in the northern part of the county and near the Mura. There are also more than 200 clubs for various sporting and recreational activities such as mountaineering, fishing, bowling, CB radio, parachuting and flying small aircraft, including unpowered gliders and powered hang gliders. Hunting also attracts numerous hunters in low game and birds.

===Other cultural notes===

The Škola Animiranog Filma is a school of animation based in Čakovec.

In Čakovec Castle, there is a museum and an art gallery. In Šenkovec, in the chapel of &quot;Sveta Jelena&quot;. and in the church of &quot;Sveti Jeronim&quot; in Štrigova, there are Baroque frescoes of Ivan Ranger dating between 1776 and 1786. Prelog is home to the beautiful church of &quot;Sveti Jakob&quot;, built in 1761.

More than 15,000 local songs have been collected here by ethnomusicologist Vinko Žganec. He was influenced in his work by Franjo Kuhač, and encouraged by Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. The German national anthem, Das Lied der Deutschen, composed by Joseph Haydn, is thought by some scholars to be derived from the folk song known in Međimurje under the name &quot;Stal Se Jesem&quot;; for details, see Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser. An Austrian national song was composed by Franz von Suppé, who was born in Split, and the lyrics of the Austrian national anthem were written by Paula von Preradovic, granddaughter of poet Petar Preradović, born near Pitomača.

==Transport==

The region of Međimurje is a strong transport hub. The main roads and railroads going through the county connect several Central and Eastern European countries with the Croatian cities of Varaždin, Zagreb (the country&#x27;s capital), Karlovac, and Rijeka (the country&#x27;s principal seaport), as well as the rest of the Croatian part of the Adriatic coast, which is a popular summer destination for tourists.

Međimurje had three railroads. M501 railway is the line of international significance that connects Međimurje with Hungary and Slovenia. M501 railway was part of first railroad in the county that was built in 1860, connecting Budapest with the Adriatic ports of Rijeka and Trieste, and this was first railroad ever built in the present-day Croatia. The village of Kotoriba, located near the Hungarian border in the south-eastern part of the county, was the site of the first railway station building in Croatia. R201 railway connects Čakovec with Varaždin and Zagreb. L101 railway connects Čakovec with Mursko Središće and with Slovenian town of Lendava.

Around 21 kilometers of the A4 motorway, built in the 1990s, is located within the county&#x27;s borders. The highway connects Hungary with Zagreb, and is also an important connection from Čakovec and Prelog to Zagreb, as it can be accessed near the village of Sveti Križ, located approximately halfway between the two cities. The Goričan Border Crossing and the Zrinski Bridge are also located on the highway. Near Zagreb, the A4 highway is connected with the A1 motorway, from which several cities along the Adriatic coast can be reached, as well as the A3 motorway, which goes through the southern parts of Slavonia all the way to the Serbian border.

A small sports airfield with one grassy runway is located near the village of Pribislavec, just outside Čakovec. It is mainly used by light aircraft and unpowered gliders. Panoramic flights over the region are also organised from the airfield. Occasionally, the airfield is also used by powered hang gliders, although these aircraft more commonly use a smaller airfield on the shores of the Drava, just outside Prelog. For many years, the airfield in Pribislavec also hosted an annual air show in August, which, however, was not held in 2009 and 2010. There are plans in the works to build a bridge over the Mura River to connect the villages of Kerkaszentkirály in Hungary and Podturen in Međimurje County.

==Business, economy and resources==



An estimated 22,000 people are employed in the county, with around 60% of them in bigger companies. Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, more than 17,000 people from the region have been employed abroad, in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and beyond. The region is considered one of the nation&#x27;s richest and most prosperous.

===Agriculture and food production===
Throughout its history, the region was heavily agricultural and even today many work in that sector. The total percentage of people involved in agriculture is 12.7%, which is above the national average.

Since the 4th century BC, there have been ship mills in use, particularly along the Mura River, some of which remained in use until the 20th century. The last surviving ship mill in the county is also located on the Mura River, between Sveti Martin na Muri and Mursko Središće. It is now a historic monument and a well-known regional tourist attraction. The famous Međimurje horse (&quot;Međimurski konj&quot;) breed of horses was for many years harnessed to the streetcars of Vienna.

Some of the largest food companies in the region include &quot;Agromeđimurje&quot;, &quot;Čakovečki mlinovi&quot; and &quot;Vajda&quot;. &quot;METSS&quot;, formerly called &quot;Trgocentar&quot;, operates a large number of convenience stores in the region. In Čakovec, many people are also employed in a number of shopping malls run by local, national and international companies.

===Manufacturing===
Industry has mostly developed in and around Čakovec, as well as in the south-eastern parts of the county. &quot;Međimurska trikotaža Čakovec&quot; or &quot;MTČ&quot; was one of the most successful textile and clothing companies in northern Croatia for years. Some of the other well known clothing companies in the region include &quot;Čateks&quot; and the Mursko Središće-based &quot;Modeks&quot;. There are also some footwear companies based in the region, the most prominent of them being &quot;Jelen&quot;.

The Čakovec-based &quot;Zrinski&quot; is a printing and publishing company. Nedelišće was home to one of the first Croatian printing presses, operating there as early as 1570. The production of metal and PVC is significant in the region. There are several construction companies based in the region. Some of the largest local companies in these businesses include &quot;Ferro-Preis&quot;, &quot;TMT&quot;, &quot;Tehnix&quot;, &quot;Meplast&quot;, &quot;Muraplast&quot;, &quot;Tegra&quot; and &quot;Beton&quot;. Basket weaving is one of the oldest businesses in the region, with &quot;Međimurjeplet&quot; being the largest local company. Chairs, small items of furniture and other decorative items are also woven in addition to baskets. The most common weaving materials include twigs, rattan and bamboo.

===Mining===
There are deposits of coal around Mursko Središće, Peklenica and Lopatinec. Lopatinec got its name from &quot;lopata&quot;, the Croatian word for &quot;shovel&quot;. Coal mining was part of the local economy between 1946 and 1972, but has eventually become unprofitable. The total output at that time was close to 4,600,000 tonnes. Estimated reserves are 200,000,000 tonnes, although new technologies and approaches would be needed to extract it profitably. The village of Križovec might be the only place in the world where people extract coal by pulling it by hand from the bottom of the river.

Gold can be found in the sands of both the Mura and Drava Rivers. In 1955, a geological survey calculated the concentration of gold in the Drava to be between 2.5 and 24.4 mg/m3, occasionally reaching 111 to 150 mg/m3. On the banks of Drava river near Donji Vidovec, one can still witness the process of gold prospecting as it used to be practiced during the gold rush.
In historical times, Prelog was the center for distribution of rock salt for this part of the kingdom.

===Oil and gas===
The region was the first in Croatia where deposits of gas and crude oil were found, in 1856, around the villages of Selnica and Peklenica. The latter even got its name from &quot;pekel&quot;, the word for &quot;hell&quot; in the local Kajkavian dialect, since the people quickly noticed the peculiar properties of the dark, greasy liquid in small ponds appearing spontaneously on the ground. The reserves were initially calculated to be around 170,000 tonnes. There was exploitation from 1886 to 1889 and into the 20th century.

The first crude oil pipeline built in this part of Europe was between Mursko Središće and the nearby town of Selnica in 1901. At that time the annual production was less than 7,000 tons. Today, a modern pipeline stretches from Omišalj on the Adriatic island of Krk and Sisak toward the oil refinery in the Slovenian city of Lendava, not far from Mursko Središće. There are also gas deposits in Mihovljan, a suburban village on the northern outskirts of Čakovec.

===Hydroelectric and geothermal resources===
There are three hydroelectric power plants with dams and two reservoir lakes built on the Drava. The Varaždin Hydroelectric Power plant fed from Lake Ormož, Čakovec Hydroelectric Power Plant is fed from the smaller Lake Varaždin and opened in 1982, while the Dubrava Hydroelectric Power Plant is fed from the larger Lake Dubrava and opened in 1989. The latter two hydroelectric power plants provide 161,6 MW of electric power. Their dams, levees, canals and reservoirs are also used for flood control and irrigation.

The extraction of gravel is also significant for the region. There is currently around 10 gravel pits, located in the southern and eastern parts of the region. During the 1990s, some of the gravel pits also became popular bathing and entertainment resorts during the summers, with restaurants and sports grounds built around them. Nowadays, the Totomore resort near the village of Totovec is the most notable resort of this kind, while a couple of other similar resorts closed during the early 2000s.

Geothermal resources also exist in the region, although they cannot be considered a profitable energy source. Instead, they are used for leisure and recreation.

<text>U.S. Route 285 is a north–south United States highway, running 846 miles (1,362 km) through the states of Texas, New Mexico and Colorado. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in Sanderson, Texas at an intersection with U.S. Route 90. US 285 has always had an endpoint in Denver, Colorado, although the original US 285 went north from Denver (that segment is now a part of U.S. Route 287). Today the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Denver, at exit 201 on Interstate 25.

US 285 is a secondary route of US 85, which it crosses in metro Denver, and technically crosses again in Santa Fe, New Mexico (today its parent route is largely concurrent with Interstate 25 through New Mexico, and as a result US 85 is no longer signed in New Mexico). US 285 also intersects a sibling route, US 385, in Fort Stockton, Texas.

Trucking makes up a large portion of the route&#x27;s traffic, but along much of its route the road is also used for local travel from one town to the next. The northern section of US 285, from Santa Fe to Denver, traverses mountainous and rocky terrain; with that in mind, anyone using the road should check weather conditions during the winter months.

===Texas===

The southern terminus of US 285 is at U.S. 90 in Sanderson. Proceeding northward, it crosses I-10 at Fort Stockton, then meets I-20 at Pecos on its way to New Mexico.

===New Mexico===

As 285 traverses north on the eastern plains of New Mexico, it passes through Carlsbad, Artesia and then Roswell. In Artesia the route intersects with U.S. Route 82. In Roswell, the route intersects with U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 380. The route next heads northwest to Vaughn where it has a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 60. The route then continues northwest and has a junction with Interstate 40 at Clines Corners.

Heading north out of Clines Corners, the route continues towards the state capital. At the outskirts of Santa Fe, the route becomes concurrent with I-25, U.S. Route 84, and its unsigned parent (U.S. Route 85) for several miles heading west through the foothills of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains to Santa Fe. After exiting I-25, US 285 follows Saint Francis Drive through Santa Fe. The route continues north by northwest to Española and Chamita, where the concurrency with US 84 ends. The route then traverses the Carson National Forest where 285 now makes a long climb up to the Colorado Plateau, passing through Ojo Caliente as it ascends to the San Luis Valley. After crossing US 64, the highway passes through the village of Tres Piedras, New Mexico at the south end of the valley, then proceeds north to the Colorado border.

On March 7, 2019, the Legislature of the State of New Mexico, in a unanimous vote, named the 27 mile section between Clines Corners and Encino the &quot;Representative Lorenzo &quot;Larry&quot; Larrañaga Corridor&quot;.

===Colorado===
Heading north from the Colorado border, US 285 passes through the main part of the San Luis Valley, eventually reaching Alamosa. As the highway heads north, it begins to ascend to the northern end of the valley and eventually climbs over Poncha Pass, elevation , and drops sharply down the other side into the Arkansas River Valley.

The highway brushes Salida and follows the Arkansas River north up the valley, then takes a sharp eastward turn just before the small town of Buena Vista. 285 then climbs over Trout Creek Pass, elevation , and enters the high-altitude South Park basin.

A few miles north, the highway passes through Fairplay and the historic South Park City site, then reaches its highest elevation: , at the summit of Red Hill Pass. US 285 then leaves the South Park basin and climbs over Kenosha Pass, elevation , and skirts the south side of the Mount Evans massif as it descends its way through the foothills range towards Denver.

As the highway leaves the Rocky Mountains and reaches Denver&#x27;s southwest suburbs, it becomes Hampden Avenue, an important artery in the Denver metro area, then reaches its northern terminus at I-25.

On March 14, 2008, both houses of the Colorado legislature, in a unanimous vote, named the section between Kenosha Pass and C-470 the Ralph Carr Memorial Highway.

==History==
The short segment between US 50 at Salida and US 24 at Buena Vista closely parallels the original U.S. Route 650, which was designated in 1926, but eliminated in 1936 when US 285 was commissioned along its present extent from Sanderson to Denver, mostly replacing state-numbered highways.

Between Bailey and Nathrop, south of Buena Vista, Colorado, US 285 mostly follows the route of the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad. The highway passes by the historic community of Como, which became in its day, the natural central hub for the Denver South Park &amp; Pacific. This town was the junction point of three main lines run by the railroad: from Denver to Como across Kenosha Pass; from Como to Leadville via Boreas and Fremont Passes; and from Como to Gunnison and beyond via Trout Creek Pass and the famous Alpine Tunnel. At Kenosha Pass in Park County, CO, remains part of a wye used by the railroad to turn around helper locomotives that assisted trains to ascend the steep mountain passes.

==In popular culture==
US-285 appeared in the Season 2 episode of Stargate SG-1 called &quot;1969&quot;. When the military convoy that SG-1 was being transported in breaks down, a sign in the background clearly shows they are on US-285. They would travel back east largely following US-66.

<text>The Green Party () in East Germany was founded in February 1990. At the first free Volkskammer elections it stood with the Independent Women&#x27;s Association () and received 2.0% of the vote. They received 8 seats but could not resolve how to allocate them. The Women&#x27;s Association pulled out and the Green Party formed a joint parliamentary group with Bündnis 90.

<doc id="435787" wikidata="Q5176402" url="?curid=435787" title="Council of Fifty">
<text>&quot;The Council of Fifty&quot; (also known as &quot;the Living Constitution&quot;, &quot;the Kingdom of God&quot;, or its name by revelation, &quot;The Kingdom of God and His Laws with the Keys and Power thereof, and Judgment in the Hands of His Servants, Ahman Christ&quot;) was a Latter Day Saint organization established by Joseph Smith in 1844 to symbolize and represent a future theocratic or theodemocratic &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; on the earth. Smith prophetically claimed that this Kingdom would be established in preparation for the Millennium and the Second Coming of Jesus.

The political Kingdom of God, organized around the Council of Fifty, was meant to be a force of peace and order in the midst of this chaos. According to Latter-day Saint teachings, while Jesus himself would be king of this new world government, its structure was in fact to be quasi-republican and multi-denominational; therefore, the early Council of Fifty included both members and non-members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Although the Council played a significant role during the last few months of Joseph Smith&#x27;s life, particularly in his campaign for President of the United States, the Council&#x27;s role was mostly symbolic throughout the 19th century within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This was largely because the Council was primarily meant for a time when secular governments had ceased to function. Regular meetings of the Council ended in 1884 after the church publicly abandoned its theocratic aspirations. Some contend that the organization was technically extinguished when member Heber J. Grant died in 1945.

==Establishment==
In early Mormonism, God&#x27;s Kingdom was thought of as an amalgamation between two distinct yet intimately related parts. The first is the Spiritual Kingdom of God which is represented on earth by the Church of Christ. This, latter-day saints believe, was described in the Book of Daniel 2:44–45 as the stone &quot;cut out of the mountain without hands&quot; that will roll forth to fill the whole earth. In Daniel, this kingdom was never to &quot;be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.&quot; However, in conjunction with this Spiritual Kingdom, Joseph Smith and other early Latter Day Saint leaders believed that Jesus would establish a Political Kingdom of God in the turbulent times leading up to His second coming. God&#x27;s Political Kingdom was to be centered around the Council of Fifty.

Like many in the mid-19th century, the Latter-Day Saints believed that the second coming of Jesus was imminent, and would be attended by great destruction. After this destruction occurred, some structure would be necessary to politically organize the survivors. Joseph Smith said he received a revelation on April 7, 1842 calling for the establishment of an organization called the Living Constitution, or later the Council of Fifty. This would serve as the foundation for the establishment of Christ&#x27;s Millennial government. 

Initially, the Council of Fifty organized to discuss potential plans for resettling Latter-day Saints somewhere further West if departing Nauvoo became necessary; they also coordinated Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign. 

On March 26, 1844, may Smith may have conferred the keys of ecclesiastical authority on the Twelve Apostles during a meeting of the Council of Fifty.

==Composition and organization==
Unlike other purely religious organizations formed by Joseph Smith, members of the Council of Fifty were not necessarily Latter Day Saints. At its formation, there were three non-Mormon members: Marenus G. Eaton, who had revealed a conspiracy against Smith by Nauvoo dissenters; Edward Bonney, whose brother was a Mormon but who later acted as prosecutor against Smith for his role in the destruction of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;; and Uriah Brown. Their admittance reflected Mormon teachings that the Millennial theocracy would be multi-denominational, though Jesus himself would be king. Although Brigham Young did not admit non-Mormons to the Council during his administration, he invited both Mormons and non-Mormons to be part of the theocracy, and even part of the theocratic government. All three nonmembers would be expelled in early 1845 once Brigham Young became chairman of the council.

The Council of Fifty met irregularly for most of its forty-year existence, including March–June 1844, 1845–1846, more regularly from 1848 to 1850, then only a handful of times between 1851 and 1868. The council was reconstituted under President John Taylor in April 1880 and met more regularly for another five years.

Alpheus Cutler referred to an executive council within the Council of Fifty, which he termed the &quot;Quorum of the Seven&quot;. Willard Richards served as historian/recorder from 1844 to his death in 1854. George Q. Cannon was the final recorder for the Council and served from 1867 to his death in 1901. William Clayton served as clerk of the Kingdom from 1844–1879. In 1880, he was followed in office by L. John Nuttall. John Taylor&#x27;s son William Whittaker Taylor was assistant clerk from 1880-1884.

There are forty-six known members of the pre-martyrdom Council of Fifty. It included all members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the time in which it was active both in Nauvoo and in Utah. Notably, it did not include the two counselors to the First Presidency in Nauvoo, Sidney Rigdon and William Law. Other members included:

* John Milton Bernhisel
* William Clayton
* Alpheus Cutler
* David Fullmer
* Benjamin F. Johnson
* John D. Lee (Scribe)
* Cornelius P. Lott
* William Marks
* Isaac Morley
* John E. Page
* W.W. Phelps
* Charles C. Rich
==Role of the Council in Joseph Smith&#x27;s administration==
While much of the rhetoric in Council of Fifty meetings focused on the council&#x27;s millennial reign, in practice, the council performed two duties during its brief existence under Joseph Smith. First, it sought out territorial lands for Mormons to settle, primarily in Texas and Oregon territory. The council sent emissary and council member Lucien Woodworth to meet with Sam Houston and the Texas government, then an independent nation. The council also sent emissaries to Washington, D.C. to meet with members of Congress in the hopes of passing a resolution to allow Joseph Smith to be appointed General and march 100,000 volunteers to Oregon Territory.

The second duty of the Council was to assist in Joseph Smith&#x27;s 1844 campaign for President of the United States. Smith ran on a platform among church members of bringing restitution for land and property lost in Missouri, eliminating slavery, compensating slave-owners with the sale of public lands, reducing the salaries of members of Congress, eliminating debt imprisonment, etc. Members of the Council campaigned throughout the United States. Besides sending out hundreds of political missionaries to campaign for Smith throughout the U.S., they also appointed fellow members of the Fifty as political ambassadors to Russia, the Republic of Texas, Washington D.C., England, and France. However, Smith was murdered by a large mob in the midst of his presidential campaign. The campaign was meant to draw greater attention to the plight of the Mormons, who had received no state or federal restitution for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property lost to mob violence in relation to the 1838 Mormon War. However, the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot; incident, Smith&#x27;s Presidential campaign, and even hyperbolic and inaccurate rumors about the Council of Fifty helped create the local unrest that led to his assassination.[citation]

==Role of the Council in the Utah Territory and state of Utah==
After Smith&#x27;s death, the Council anointed Brigham Young its leader, and as the &quot;king and president&quot; of the Kingdom of God. Under Young, the council helped organize the trek west from Nauvoo in 1846, and it largely governed the unorganized territory of Utah until Congress granted territorial status in 1850.

The Council assisted in the Mormon Exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois and the eventual migration to the Great Basin area of what is now Utah. Young relied upon the results of scouting missions by members of the Council in choosing the Great Basin as a destination for their exodus from Nauvoo, over several alternate possibilities including Texas, California, Oregon, and Vancouver Island.

The council was to act as a legislative body in the Kingdom of God, and in Utah, the Council became a provisional legislative body in the government. This continued until September 1850 when Congress organized the Utah Territory upon petition by the church. After Utah became a territory, the American expectation for a separation between church and state sharply diminished the Council&#x27;s official role in government. The Council then suspended meetings in October 1851. The council met again only briefly in 1867 and 1868 and voted for the establishment of Zion&#x27;s Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI).

The Council resurfaced during the administration of John Taylor, to combat federal involvement in overseeing Utah elections. The Council&#x27;s last recorded meeting was in 1884.

==Publication of minutes==
In 2013, the First Presidency of the LDS Church approved the publication of the minutes of the Council of Fifty as one of the upcoming volumes of the ongoing Joseph Smith Papers project. The minutes were published in September 2016.

<doc id="435788" wikidata="Q6772542" url="?curid=435788" title="Marquess of Headfort">
<text>Marquess of Headfort is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Thomas Taylour, 2nd Earl of Bective.

The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles of Earl of Bective (1766), Viscount Headfort (1762), Baron Headfort, of Headfort in the County of Meath (1760), and Baron Kenlis, of Kenlis in the County of Meath (1831), all but the last in the Peerage of Ireland. He is also an Irish baronet. Before the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, the Marquess sat in the House of Lords as Baron Kenlis in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The family descends from Thomas Taylor, who came to Ireland during the 1650s from Sussex in England to oversee on behalf of Parliament the fiscal expenditure of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s campaign in Ireland and later undertook the duties of a cartographer assisting with Sir William Petty&#x27;s project of mapping Ireland, known as the Down Survey.

Taylor&#x27;s son also Thomas Taylor represented Kells in the Irish House of Commons and in 1704, he was created a Baronet, of Kells, County Meath, in the Baronetage of Ireland. His grandson, the third Baronet, also sat for Kells in the Irish House of Commons. In 1760 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Headfort, of Headfort in the County of Meath. Two years later he was created Viscount Headfort, of Headfort, in the County of Meath and in 1766 he was even further honoured when he was made Earl of Bective, of Bective Castle, in the County of Meath. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was one of the 28 original Irish representative peer in the House of Lords. In 1800 he was created Marquess of Headfort in the Peerage of Ireland. His son, the second Marquess, assumed the surname of Taylour in lieu of Taylor. In 1831 he was created Baron Kenlis, of Kenlis in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This gave the Marquesses an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Headfort served as a Government Whip in the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne and was also Lord Lieutenant of Cavan. His son, the third Marquess, represented Westmorland in Parliament as a Conservative and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Meath. His son from his first marriage, Thomas Taylour, Earl of Bective, also sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament. However, he predeceased his father and on Lord Headfort&#x27;s death the titles passed to his son from his second marriage, the fourth Marquess. He was a Senator of the Irish Free State. , the titles are held by his great-grandson, the seventh Marquess, who succeeded his father in 2005.

As of 12 June 2023 the present holder of the Marquessate has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2005.

Another member of the Taylor family was Clotworthy Rowley, fourth son of the first Earl of Bective and younger brother of the first Marquis. He assumed the surname of Rowley in lieu of Taylor and was created Baron Langford of Summerhill in the Peerage of Ireland in 1800. Also, the Honourable the Reverend Henry Edward Taylor, fifth son of the first Earl of Bective, was the father of the Conservative politician Thomas Edward Taylor, who served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1868 and from 1874 to 1880.

The family seat was Headfort House, near Kells, County Meath in Ireland.

<text>USS &quot;Galena&quot; was a wooden-hulled broadside ironclad built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was initially assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and supported Union forces during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862. She was damaged during the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff because her armor was too thin to prevent Confederate shots from the guns of Fort Darling from penetrating her hull. Widely regarded as a failure, &quot;Galena&quot; was reconstructed without most of her armor in 1863 and transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in 1864. The ship participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan in August. She was briefly transferred to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron in September before she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs in November.

Repairs were completed in March 1865 and &quot;Galena&quot; rejoined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in Hampton Roads the following month. After the end of the war, the ship was decommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in June. She was transferred to Hampton Roads in 1869, condemned in 1870, and broken up for scrap in 1872.

==Background==
After the United States received word of the construction of the Confederate casemate ironclad, , Congress appropriated $1.5 million on 3 August to build one or more armored steamships. It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into armored ships. The U.S. Navy advertised for proposals for &quot;iron-clad steam vessels of war&quot; on 7 August and Gideon Welles, the Secretary of the Navy, appointed the three members of the Ironclad Board the following day. Their task was to &quot;examine plans for the completion of iron-clad vessels&quot;.

Well before this date, Cornelius Bushnell had commissioned a design for an armored sloop from naval architect Samuel H. Pook in June for $1,500 anticipating an order from the Union Navy to counter the Confederate ironclad already known to be under construction. Bushnell expected that order because his bid, at a higher cost, for building the steam had already been accepted provided that he subcontract the construction to Charles Mallory &amp; Sons Shipyard of Mystic, Connecticut. In exchange, the Navy asked if Bushnell could give a price on an armored gunboat. He could and subcontracted the building of his design to Maxson, Fish &amp; Co., also of Mystic, on 20 July, the day after a bill to authorize construction of a number of armored ships was introduced in the Senate. The building of the &quot;Galena&quot;″s wooden hull began two days later.

The Ironclad Board initially accepted two of the sixteen designs submitted in early September, the armored frigate that became and Bushnell&#x27;s design. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and he needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor to that end. Cornelius H. DeLamater recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend John Ericsson. The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate &quot;Galena&quot;″s design and give his guarantee. During this second meeting Ericsson showed Bushnell his own design, the future . Bushnell got Ericsson&#x27;s permission to show the model of his design to Welles and the latter told Bushnell to show it to the board. Despite a preliminary rejection, the board accepted Ericsson&#x27;s proposal on 16 September after he explained his design in person the previous day.

The three ironclad ships differed substantially in design and degree of risk. The &quot;Monitor&quot; was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson&#x27;s guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved. The wooden-hulled &quot;Galena&quot;″s most novel feature was her armor of interlocking iron rails. &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was much influenced by the and was the most conservative design of the three, which copied many of the features of the French ship.

==Design and description==
&quot;Galena&quot;&#x27;s original design, dated 28 June, was for a schooner-rigged corvette with three masts, long at the waterline with a beam of , a depth of hold of and an estimated displacement of . The ship&#x27;s sides were protected by wrought iron plates thick, backed by of india rubber and the side of the hull. The ship&#x27;s deck consisted of armor . A revised design was submitted to the Ironclad Board, for which a contract was awarded on 28 September, in which the sloop was enlarged, probably because it was uncertain if the original design could support the proposed armor&#x27;s weight.

As built, &quot;Galena&quot; was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of , a depth of hold of , and a draft of . The ship displaced and had 738 tons burthen. The number of masts was reduced to two and the amount of tumblehome greatly increased. Her crew numbered 150 officers and enlisted men. On her only ocean voyage in her original configuration, &quot;Galena&quot; rolled heavily.

While under construction, the armor scheme was modified. The rubber backing was replaced by an additional of iron although Commodore Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and Pook were uncertain if the ship could support this weight. To reduce the weight several alternatives were proposed. One proposal was to reduce the thickness of the protection to for a distance from from the bow and stern and the other was to reduce the armor&#x27;s thickness above the sills of the gun ports to and the deck armor&#x27;s thickness to 1/2-inch over 2 1/2 inches of wood. It is unknown exactly how the situation was resolved, but one report on 31 March 1862 suggests that the two proposals were combined as it said that the armor was two inches thick above the gun ports, except around the stern where it was 1/2-inch thick.

&quot;Galena&quot; was powered by a single-cylinder horizontal Ericsson vibrating-lever steam engine, which drove one propeller. The engine used steam generated by two boilers and gave the ship a top speed of . It had a bore of and a stroke of . During her trip to Hampton Roads after commissioning, the ship reached a speed of using her sails.

The ship was armed with two , 100-pounder Parrott rifles in pivot mounts fore and aft and four smoothbore Dahlgren guns. Each nine-inch gun weighed approximately . They could fire a shell to a range of at an elevation of 15°. The muzzle-loading Parrott rifles fired a shell and had a maximum range of approximately . The 20-caliber guns weighed about each.

==Career==
&quot;Galena&quot;″s keel was laid down by Maxson, Fish &amp; Co. in 1861 and she was launched on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. &quot;Galena&quot; arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough&#x27;s North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts on the inside of her hull to be covered with sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.

&quot;Galena&quot; prepared for action on 4 and 7 May when the ironclad &quot;Virginia&quot; sortied into Hampton Roads, but the &quot;Virginia&quot; did not attack. On 8 May, the ship, together with the gunboats and , sailed up the James River with orders to cooperate with Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army in Peninsula Campaign and harass retreating Confederate forces. The ships silenced one battery and ran past another covering the river without damage before &quot;Galena&quot; ran aground later that day. She was not damaged, although she required a day and a half of work before she was freed. Rodgers&#x27; ships were reinforced by the ironclads and on 12 May and they reached City Point the following day.

===Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff===
On the morning of 15 May, &quot;Galena&quot; led her squadron up to Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, about from Richmond, where the Confederates had blocked the river and placed a battery on the bluff to cover the obstacles. &quot;Galena&quot; anchored some from the bluff and opened fire at 07:45, while the wooden ships remained further downriver. &quot;Monitor&quot; attempted to fire on the battery as well, but her guns could not elevate enough to reach it. &quot;Galena&quot; engaged the Confederate position for over three hours, until her ammunition was nearly exhausted. Her fire was largely ineffective, although her shells did manage to kill seven and wound eight members of the battery. In return, the ship was hit an estimated 44 times on her port side, of which 13 hits penetrated her armor and she had three large holes punched through her spar deck. She suffered 13 crewmen killed and a further 11 wounded. In a letter to his wife, Rodgers said that &quot;her sides look as though she had an attack of smallpox&quot;. Two sailors and one marine aboard &quot;Galena&quot; were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle: Fireman Charles Kenyon, Quartermaster Jeremiah Regan, and Corporal John F. Mackie. Mackie was the first member of the U.S. Marine Corps to receive the medal.

&quot;Galena&quot; remained on the James River after the battle and returned to City Point. She shelled Confederate soldiers along the river banks and bombarded City Point to cover a landing force which set fire to the depots. On 27 June, Major General McClellan came aboard the ship to locate a new camp which was later established near Harrison&#x27;s Landing. On 30 June, McClellan was compelled to withdraw down the James, covered by gunfire from &quot;Galena&quot; and the other gunboats. They continued to support his forces until they were transferred to Northern Virginia. &quot;Galena&quot; patrolled the river to defend transports and supply ships against Confederate raids and ambushes until she was detached from the James River Flotilla in September 1862 &quot;Galena&quot; and &quot;Monitor&quot; were retained at Newport News, Virginia, in case the Confederate ironclads building at Richmond sortied into Hampton Roads.

&quot;Galena&quot; departed Hampton Roads on 19 May 1863 and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two days later, where she was decommissioned for repairs and reconstruction. Most of her ineffective armor was removed, except around the engines and boilers; her armament was increased to eight nine-inch Dahlgren guns and a single 100-pounder Parrot rifle, and she was rebuilt as a ship-rigged sloop with three masts.

Recommissioned on 15 February 1864, &quot;Galena&quot;, now under the command of Lieutenant Commander C. H. Wells, sailed on 18 February for the Gulf of Mexico and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The ship became icebound at New Castle, Delaware, until she was towed out to sea by an ice boat, and was forced to put into port for repairs. She departed Norfolk on 10 May and arrived at Pensacola, Florida on 20 May for blockade duty off Mobile, Alabama, during which she shelled Fort Morgan and fired upon various blockade runners as they attempted to evade the blockade.

===Battle of Mobile Bay===
Rear Admiral David Farragut, commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, was to split his ships into two columns. The four monitors would comprise the starboard column, closest to Ft. Morgan, and their mission was to bombard the fort while the wooden ships in the other column passed by, and to sink the ironclad ram . Once past the fort the wooden ships were to prevent the escape of the Confederate wooden gunboats to Mobile. To ensure that his wooden ships could get past Ft. Morgan, Farragut ordered that they be lashed together in pairs so that one ship could pull the other if the Confederates succeeded in knocking out its boilers or engines.

&quot;Galena&quot; was tied to the port side of the larger sloop and the pair were the last ships in the port column when the battle began on the morning of 5 August. While passing the fort, &quot;Oneida&quot; had her starboard boiler disabled by a shell hit and her crew was attempting to reroute her steam to both engines when she was engaged by &quot;Tennessee&quot; at a range of . The ironclad only managed to fire three shots that did little damage. &quot;Galena&quot; was struck six times while passing the fort with little damage, although her rigging was badly cut up. Two crewmen were wounded and another died of his wounds. Four of &quot;Galena&#x27;s&quot; sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle: Seaman William Gardner, Quartermaster Thomas Jordan, Quartermaster Edward S. Martin, and Coxswain Edward B. Young.

&quot;Galena&quot; intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan until it surrendered on 23 August and sailed from Mobile Bay on 31 August to temporarily serve as a part of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron at Key West, Florida. The transfer was made permanent on 24 September and she was ordered to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repair a month later. The ship did not arrive until 4 November and repairs did not begin until 22 November. &quot;Galena&quot; was recommissioned on 29 March 1865 and was reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She reached Newport News on 2 April where the ship patrolled the mouth of the Nansemond River and in the James River until her departure on 6 June for Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

&quot;Galena&quot; was decommissioned there on 17 June until she was recommissioned on 9 April 1869 for transfer to back to Hampton Roads, where she was again decommissioned on 2 June. Condemned by survey in 1870, &quot;Galena&quot; was broken up in 1872 at the Norfolk Navy Yard.

<text>The Triumph of Technique: The Industrialization of Agriculture and the Destruction of Rural America is a 2004 book by Robert Wolf.

&quot;The Triumph of Technique&quot; examines contemporary agriculture and its impact on rural economies. This book has been hailed by leaders of the sustainable agriculture movement as a significant contribution to understanding the depth of the current crisis in agriculture and its implications.

The “technique” of the title refers not only to technologies but to any methods developed for the purpose of achieving predetermined ends. Wolf argues that technique, as he defines it, has taken the art out of farming by transforming it into agribusiness, on a much larger scale. He claims that this transformation has led to the decline of rural communities.

<text>Marquess of Sligo is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for John Browne, 3rd Earl of Altamont. The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles of Baron Mount Eagle, of Westport in the County of Mayo (created 10 September 1760), Viscount Westport, of Westport in the County of Mayo (created 24 August 1768), Earl of Altamont, in the County of Mayo (created 4 December 1771), Earl of Clanricarde (created 1800) and Baron Monteagle, of Westport in the County of Mayo (created 20 February 1806). All these titles are in the Peerage of Ireland, except the Barony of Monteagle, which is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The latter peerage entitled the Marquesses to a seat in the House of Lords prior to the House of Lords Act 1999. The Earldom of Clanricarde was inherited by the sixth Marquess in 1916 according to a special remainder in the letters patent.

==History==
The Browne family descends from Colonel John Browne, younger son of Sir John Browne, 1st Baronet, of The Neale, County Mayo, whose eldest son, the second Baronet, was the ancestor of the Barons Kilmaine. The baronetcy was created in 1636. Colonel John Browne&#x27;s grandson John Browne represented Castlebar in the Irish House of Commons. He was created Baron Mount Eagle in 1760, Viscount Westport in 1768 and Earl of Altamont in 1771, the titles of Mount Eagle and Altamont deriving from Croagh Patrick near Westport. Both his son, the second Earl, and grandson, the third Earl, represented County Mayo in the Irish Parliament. In 1800 the latter was elected as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer and later that year he was created Marquess of Sligo.

In 1806, he was made Baron Monteagle in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave the Marquesses an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He was Lord Lieutenant of County Mayo from 1842 to 1845. Lord Sligo married Lady Hester Catherine de Burgh, eldest daughter of John Thomas de Burgh, 13th Earl of Clanricarde.

In 1800, Lord Clanricarde was given a new Earldom of Clanricarde, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to the heirs male of his two daughters. Lord Sligo&#x27;s younger son, the fourth Marquess, represented County Mayo in Parliament from 1857 to 1868. His nephew, the sixth Marquess, succeeded to the Earldom of Clanricarde (1800 creation) in 1916 on the death of his cousin Hubert George de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde. As of 2014, the titles are held by his great-nephew, the twelfth Marquess, who succeeded his first cousin in 2014. He is a property consultant living in the central highlands of regional Victoria, Australia.

The family seat was Westport House, near Westport, County Mayo in Ireland. After the death of the 11th Marquess, it passed to his five daughters, in accordance with a private legislation passed by the Irish Senate in 1993. Westport House was sold by Lord Sligo&#x27;s daughters in October 2017, breaking the formal link between Westport House and the family which had been ongoing for 380 years. The house was sold to the Hughes family, a local family of entrepreneurs with Portwest clothing manufacturing operations and a hotel in Westport.

==Present peer==
Sebastian Ulick Browne, 12th Marquess of Sligo (born 27 May 1964), is the son of Lord Ulick Browne and his wife, Fiona Glenn, and a first cousin of the 11th Marquess. He was educated at Rugby School.

On 13 July 2014, Browne succeeded as Marquess of Sligo (I., 1800), Earl of Altamont (I., 1771), Earl of Clanricarde (I., 1800), Viscount Westport, of Westport (I., 1768), Baron Mount Eagle of Westport (I., 1760), and Baron Monteagle of Westport (U.K., 1806).

Lord Sligo did not inherit Westport House and the Altamont estate in Ireland, as his predecessor, the 11th Marquess, had successfully petitioned to have an Act of the Oireachtas (an Irish Act of Parliament) passed which enabled him to break the family trust and leave the estate to his five daughters. They were forced to sell the property in 2017.

In 1984, the current Lord Sligo married firstly Christina Maria Suaznabar, daughter of Luis Suaznabar; they were divorced in 1992, after having two children:
*Lady Camilla Browne (born 1986)
*Christopher Ulick Browne, Earl of Altamont and Clanricarde (born 1988), heir apparent

On 22 January 2016, at Wollongong, New South Wales, he married secondly Claire Suzanne van Middelkoop.

<text>U.S. Route 90 or U.S. Highway 90 (US 90) is an east–west major United States highway in the Southern United States. Despite the &quot;0&quot; in its route number, US 90 never was a full coast-to-coast route. It generally travels near Interstate 10 (I-10) and passes through the southern states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. US 90 also includes part of the DeSoto Trail between Tallahassee and Lake City, Florida.

With the exception of a short-lived northward extension to US 62/US 180 near Pine Springs, Texas, that existed for less than one year, its western terminus has always been at Van Horn, Texas; this is an intersection with I-10 Business (formerly US 80) just north of an interchange with I-10. Its eastern terminus is at Florida State Road A1A in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean.

On August 29, 2005, a number of the highway&#x27;s bridges in Mississippi and Louisiana were destroyed or damaged due to Hurricane Katrina, including the Bay St. Louis Bridge, the Biloxi Bay Bridge, and the Fort Pike Bridge which have been replaced.

===Texas===
US 90 begins at an intersection with BL I-10 and SH 54 in downtown Van Horn. It then heads south-southeast towards Marfa, where the route begins to head generally east. The route mostly consists of two lanes west of Uvalde. At this point, it becomes a four-lane surface road until it reaches western Bexar County where it becomes a freeway, joining I-10 in Downtown San Antonio. This concurrency with I-10 continues intermittently into western Houston, where US 90 follows the Katy Freeway. The section of US 90 that is multiplexed with I-10 through Houston is the only section of the route that is unsigned. In eastern Houston, US 90 splits from I-10 and heads northeast towards Liberty, eventually traveling through downtown Beaumont where it rejoins I-10 for the rest of its routing through Texas.

The speed limit on US 90 between Van Horn and Del Rio is mainly . Beginning at Seguin, US 90 Alternate splits from US 90 and travels parallel to the south, rejoining the main route in northeast Houston.

In 1991, the construction on a four- to six-lane freeway northeast of Houston in Harris County was completed along a new routing for US 90; that portion was designated the Crosby Freeway. This segment traveled from just inside Beltway 8 to east of the town of Crosby. Construction began in 2006 to extend the freeway westward to the intersection of I-10 (East Freeway) and the I-610 (East Loop). On January 24, 2011, the new extension officially opened. Due to lack of funds, overpasses were not built over Greens Bayou and over future Purple Sage Road, leaving traffic to briefly exit to the frontage roads before rejoining the freeway.

===Louisiana===
Entering Louisiana from the west, US 90 and I-10 travel side by side through Lake Charles to Lafayette. In Lafayette, US 90 and I-10 part ways: I-10 proceeds east to Baton Rouge, while US 90 takes a southern turn and passes through New Iberia, Franklin, Morgan City, and the Houma – Bayou Cane – Thibodaux metropolitan area before reaching New Orleans. The four-laning of US 90 was pushed in the 1990s by former State Senator Carl W. Bauer through his role as the chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Interstate 49 Task Force while also a member of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce.

The portion of US 90 from Lafayette to New Orleans is designated to become the corridor for I-49. In New Orleans, US 90 again meets up with I-10, and the two highways follow a similar path into Mississippi.

===Mississippi===

The description of US 90&#x27;s route in Mississippi is explained in State Code § 65-3-3.

Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi&#x27;s portion of US 90 was entirely four-lanes except for a very short segment at the state&#x27;s west end leading to the old Pearl River Bridge into Louisiana. That segment of old highway is obviated for most purposes by an extension of the four-lane roadway from its split with US 90 to I-10 just east of the much newer Pearl Bridge.

Before Hurricane Camille in 1969, the stretch of US 90 from the Bay St. Louis Bridge at the west end to the Biloxi Bay Bridge at the east was one of the most scenic roadways in the south, offering beautiful views of the Gulf of Mexico on its south side and lovely mansions — some antebellum — on its north. The median featured many old, stately oak trees, a good number of which survived the storm.

Many segments and important bridges were heavily damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. With the opening of two lanes of the Biloxi Bay Bridge on November 1, 2007, the entire route is now restored. Reconstruction projects continue on much of the highway and lane closures are common. Substantial completion of all US 90 Katrina-related road work in this state was scheduled to have been completed by now.

&#x27;US Highway 90 Project History&#x27; recounts in some detail this roadway&#x27;s colorful past in Mississippi, dating back to the early 20th century when it was part of the Old Spanish Trail. The pdf document is available at the &#x27;Project Updates&#x27; page of the Mississippi Department of Transportation&#x27;s website (www.gomdot.com).

===Alabama===
US 90, internally designated by the Alabama Department of Transportation as State Route 16 (SR 16), is a major east–west state highway across the southern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. US 90/SR 16 crosses the extreme southern part of the state, covering approximately . The routes pass through Baldwin County before entering the city of Mobile where it gains a wrong way concurrency with US 98. and later joins US Truck Route 98, briefly also overlapping Interstate 165. The portion of US 90 that crosses Mobile Bay is locally referred to as the &quot;Causeway&quot;. With the completion of I-10, US 90/SR 16 serves primarily as a local route connecting the towns along its path.

===Florida===

As it enters the Sunshine State, US 90 shifts south towards Pensacola while US 90 Alternate stays to the north of the city. This stretch of highway is also known as Nine Mile Road. After Hurricane Ivan destroyed the I-10 Bridge in Northwest Florida, motorists waited as long as two hours to cross the Escambia bridge between Santa Rosa and Escambia counties.

The highway&#x27;s route continues to the north of I-10 as a two-lane highway through most of the sparsely-populated inland areas of the panhandle, becoming four lanes through and near several towns. In Gadsden County, US 90 cuts to the southeast toward downtown Tallahassee, where it passes the north entrance of Florida State University and expands to six lanes until its intersection with US 27. The portion of the highway that extends through Midway has been designated as the Alfred Lawson, Jr. Highway. Continuing east, the highway is a two-lane road north of I-10 along the rest of its route, except as it turns to the south to pass through Lake City at I-75. After going through the Osceola National Forest, it passes I-295 heading into Jacksonville, becoming four lanes through the industrialized west side as Beaver Street, and through downtown as Union Street. It crosses the St. Johns River on the Main Street Bridge and continues east as Beach Boulevard to its terminus at Florida State Road A1A in Jacksonville Beach.

US 90 passes through the county seats of 15 counties on its course in Florida, and is never more than from I-10 throughout the state. The highway&#x27;s hidden state road designation is primarily Florida State Road 10 (Florida State Road 10A in Pensacola), but along Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville it becomes Florida State Road 212.

The speed limit is for all rural points west of Monticello, Florida, and it is on all rural points beginning in Madison County to Glen St. Mary.

==History==

===Hurricane Katrina===

The US 90 bridge between Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, and Pass Christian, Mississippi, as well as the bridge between Biloxi, Mississippi, and Ocean Springs, Mississippi, were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. During the storm, the St. Louis Bay bridge was under water and destroyed. Portions of US 90 were damaged along the Battleship Parkway on Mobile Bay in Baldwin County, Alabama. Sections of the highway in Harrison County, Mississippi, including other bridges and much of the roadbed, were damaged or destroyed. Both the Rigolets Bridge and the Chef Menteur Bridge across Chef Menteur Pass in New Orleans East were damaged, but have since been reopened. Some sections of the highway in New Orleans were impassable under flood waters for weeks due to the general flooding of that city; see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. The Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River in Sector 49, also known as US 90 Business, remained intact and was the only usable route out of that city in the immediate aftermath of the storm until the section of Leake Avenue/River Road between New Orleans and Metairie was able to be cleared of heavy debris, but was blocked off by Jefferson Parish and Gretna law enforcement officials in a politically controversial move to prevent the looting and general anarchy from spreading to the relatively intact west bank of the Mississippi River.
In mid-2006, construction began on the replacement for the Bay St. Louis bridge. It was completed on January 4, 2008, and includes four traffic lanes plus emergency shoulders and a bicycle/pedestrian path. It also stands high at its highest point. Two-way traffic resumed on the eastbound lanes of the bridge on May 17, 2007, after an afternoon ceremony, effectively ending the temporary ferry service. The remaining half of the bridge opened to traffic on January 4, 2008.

On June 6, 2006, a $338.6 million contract was let for the Biloxi-Ocean Springs replacement. The bridge will be tall at its highest point and will carry six traffic lanes, inside and outside shoulders, and a bicycle/pedestrian path. To many area residents&#x27; and leaders&#x27; delight, the bridge&#x27;s westbound lanes opened to two-way traffic after a ceremony and parade on November 1, 2007, two weeks ahead of schedule. Total bridge construction, including the opening of all six lanes of traffic, was scheduled to be completed by April 2008.

After it was closed due to storm damage, the 1929 vintage bridge carrying US 90 over Chef Menteur Pass was repaired and opened to traffic on August 11, 2006.

===Florida State Road 1===

The Florida State Road No. 1 (also known as the Old Brick Road, Red Brick Road, U.S. Highway 90, or Old Spanish Trail) is a historic road near Milton, Florida. It is located, roughly, in three sections east of Milton, parallel to US 90, between Marquis Bayou and Harold. On June 23, 1994, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) is a federal body operating under the United States Secretary of the Interior. The purpose of the board is to establish and maintain uniform usage of geographic names throughout the federal government of the United States.

==History==
Following the American Civil War, more and more American settlers began moving westward, prompting the U.S. federal government to pursue some sort of consistency for referencing landmarks on maps and in official documents. As such, on January 8, 1890, Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, wrote to 10 noted geographers &quot;to suggest the organization of a Board made up of representatives from the different Government services interested, to which may be referred any disputed question of geographical orthography.&quot; President Benjamin Harrison signed executive order 28 on September 4, 1890, establishing the &quot;Board on Geographical Names&quot;. &quot;To this Board shall be referred all unsettled questions concerning geographic names. The decisions of the Board are to be accepted [by federal departments] as the standard authority for such matters.&quot; The board was given authority to resolve all unsettled questions concerning geographic names. Decisions of the board were accepted as binding by all departments and agencies of the federal government.

In 1906, the board&#x27;s powers were expanded by President Theodore Roosevelt from establishing consistency to being responsible for standardizing geographic names for use across the federal government.

The board has since undergone several name changes. 

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt dissolved the board and transferred its responsibilities directly to the Department of the Interior. Shortly after the end of World War II congress reversed this decision and restored the board.

The Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names was established in 1943 as the Special Committee on Antarctic Names (SCAN). In 1963, the Advisory Committee on Undersea Features was started for standardization of names of undersea features.

Its present form derives from a 1947 law, Public Law 80-242.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the board pursued a policy to eliminate the use of derogatory terms related to Japanese and Black people.

Deb Haaland, U.S. secretary of the interior under the Biden administration, used the board to eliminate what she considered &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; names such as changing the name of Mount Evans to Mount Blue Sky due to its namesake&#x27;s, John Evans participation in the 1864 Sand Creek massacre or the removal of the word &quot;squaw&quot; from nearly 650 place names on U.S. federal lands as part of an effort to reckon with the nation&#x27;s racist past.

The Board was assigned notable provisions of the 2025 executive order Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness during the second presidency of Donald Trump.

== Operation ==
The 1969 BGN publication &quot;Decisions on Geographic Names in the United States&quot; stated the agency&#x27;s chief purpose as:

The board has developed principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of domestic and foreign geographic names, including underseas. The BGN also deals with names of geographical features in Antarctica via its Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names.

The Geographic Names Information System, developed by the BGN in cooperation with the US Geological Survey, includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps which confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded.

The BGN has members from six federal departments as well as the Central Intelligence Agency, the US Government Publishing Office, the Library of Congress, and the US Postal Service. The BGN rules on hundreds of naming decisions annually and stores over two million geographical records in its databases at geonames.usgs.gov. State and local governments and private mapping organizations usually follow the BGN&#x27;s decisions.

The BGN has an executive committee and two permanent committees with full authority: the 10- to 15-member Domestic Names Committee and the 8- to 10-member Foreign Names Committee. Both comprise government employees only. Each maintains its own database.

The BGN does not create place names but responds to proposals for names from federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and the public. Any person or organization, public or private, may make inquiries or request the board to render formal decisions on proposed new names, proposed name changes, or names that are in conflict. Generally, the BGN defers federal name use to comply with local usage. There are a few exceptions. For example, in rare cases where a locally used name is very offensive, the BGN may decide against adoption of the local name for federal use.

=== Special situations ===

The BGN does not translate terms, but instead accurately uses foreign names in the Roman alphabet. For non-Roman languages, the BGN uses transliteration systems or creates them for less well-known languages.

The BGN does not recognize the use of the possessive apostrophe and has only granted an exception five times during its history, including one for Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

In federal mapping and names collection efforts, there is often a phase lag where a delay occurs in adoption of a locally used name. Sometimes the delay is several decades. Volunteers in the Earth Science Corps are used to assist the US Geological Survey in collecting names of geographic features.

== Other authorities ==
* The United States Census Bureau defines census designated places, which are a subset of locations in the Geographic Names Information System. 
* The names of post offices have historically been used to back up claims about the name of a community. US Postal Service Publication 28 gives standards for addressing mail. In this publication, the Postal Service defines two-letter state abbreviations, street identifiers such as &quot;boulevard&quot; (&quot;BLVD&quot;) and &quot;street&quot; (&quot;ST&quot;), and secondary identifiers such as &quot;suite&quot; (&quot;STE&quot;).

==Publications==
The BGN currently publishes names on its website. In the past, the BGN issued its decisions in various publications under different titles at different intervals with various information included. In 1933, the BGN published a significant consolidated report of all decisions from 1890 to 1932 in its &quot;Sixth Report of the United States Geographic Board 1890–1932&quot;. For many years, the BGN published a quarterly report under the title &quot;Decisions on Geographic Names&quot;.

<doc id="435796" wikidata="Q4686349" url="?curid=435796" title="Advanced meat recovery">
<text>Advanced meat recovery (AMR) is a slaughterhouse deboning process by which the last traces of skeletal muscle meat are removed from animal bones after the primal cuts have been carved off manually. The machinery used in this process separates meat from bone by scraping, shaving, or pressing the meat from the bone without breaking or grinding the bone. AMR meat typically is used as an ingredient in products requiring further processing, such as hot dogs. Unlike mechanically separated meat, AMR meat is comparable in appearance, texture, and composition to meat trimmings and similar meat products derived by hand.

In the US, products produced by advanced meat recovery machinery can be labeled using terms associated with hand-deboned product (i.e., &quot;beef&quot;, &quot;pork&quot;, &quot;beef trimmings&quot;, etc.) USDA regulations for procurement of frozen fresh ground beef products state that &quot;Beef that is mechanically separated from bone with automatic deboning systems, advanced lean (meat) recovery (AMR) systems or powered knives, will not be allowed&quot;.

The equivalent technology is known as &quot;low pressure mechanical meat separation&quot; in the European Union, and its product governed as a subset of mechanically separated meat. The product was formerly known as desinewed meat (DSM).

==Regulation ==
=== In the United States===
In the United States, USDA regulations stipulate that AMR machinery cannot grind, crush, or pulverize bones to remove edible meat tissue, and bones must emerge intact. The meat produced in this manner can contain no more than 150(±30) milligrams of calcium per 100 grams product, as calcium in such high concentrations in the product would be indicative of bone being mixed with the meat. Products that exceed the calcium content limit must instead be labeled &quot;mechanically separated beef or pork&quot; in the ingredients statement.

In 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a rule allowing such meat to be labeled as meat for human consumption, providing that the bones from which it was removed were still intact after processing. In 1997, following tests indicating that central nervous system (CNS) tissue was showing up in mechanically removed meat, FSIS issued a directive to its inspectors instructing them to ensure that spinal cord tissue was removed from bones before the AMR process. Following the identification of a BSE-infected U.S. dairy cow in December 2003, FSIS issued new regulations expanding the definition of prohibited CNS tissue to include additional cattle parts. Furthermore, all AMR-processed product from cattle more than 30 months old now is prohibited from being used for food, and such product from younger cattle and from other
livestock species also is prohibited if it contains CNS material.

The USDA&#x27;s AMR guidelines restrict the processing of the parts of cattle that may contain central nervous tissue from AMR systems in cattle over 30 months of age. However, non-CNS tissue meat can be processed and is considered meat, as are the muscle cuts. Although some sources claim AMR systems use ammonia (or anhydrous ammonia, ammonia hydroxide, etc.) to treat the meat, this appears to be due to confusion between AMR and the production of lean finely textured beef (LFTB, commonly referred to as pink slime). LFTB is in fact treated with ammonia, and so is substantially more restricted than most AMR products.

=== In Europe===

Prior to 2012, desinewed meat (DSM) could be called &quot;meat&quot; in the UL. In 2012, European Commission reclassified DSM as a kind of mechanically recovered meat (MRM). The downgrade of DSM took effect in the UK in May 2012. Unlike other types of MRM, which have the appearance of a paste, DSM resembled minced meat.

The new regulation treats DSM as &quot;low-pressure mechanically separated meat&quot;. As a result, many of the regulations governing conventional (high-pressure, paste) MSM/MRM applies, including the 2004 ban on MSM produced from ruminants. However, low-pressure MSM is still subject to looser rules in recognition of the lower microbial risk. While high-pressure MSM needs to be frozen immediately after production, low-pressure MSM only needs to be chilled. Low pressure MSM is also allowed in some uncooked products, while high-pressure MSM is not.

<doc id="435799" wikidata="Q1146093" url="?curid=435799" title="Mechanically separated meat">
<text>Mechanically separated meat (MSM), mechanically recovered/reclaimed meat (MRM), or mechanically deboned meat (MDM) is a paste-like meat product produced by forcing pureed or ground beef, pork, mutton, turkey or chicken under high pressure through a sieve or similar device to separate the bone from the edible meat tissue. When poultry is used, it is sometimes called white slime as an analog to meat-additive pink slime and to meat extracted by advanced meat recovery systems, both of which are different processes. The process entails pureeing or grinding the carcass left after the manual removal of meat from the bones and then forcing the slurry through a sieve under pressure.

The resulting product is a blend primarily consisting of tissues not generally considered meat, along with a much smaller amount of actual meat (muscle tissue). In some countries such as the United States, these non-meat materials are processed separately for human and non-human uses and consumption. The process is controversial; &quot;Forbes&quot;, for example, called it a &quot;not-so-appetizing meat production process&quot;.

Mechanically separated meat has been used in certain meat and meat products, such as hot dogs and bologna sausage, since the late 1960s. However, not all such meat products are manufactured using an MSM process.

== Safety and regulation ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, mechanically separated poultry has been used in poultry products since 1969, after the National Academy of Sciences found it safe. Questions about safety arose in the 1980s, leading to a 1982 report by the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) which concluded that mechanically separated meat is safe and established a standard of identity. The standard of identity puts a cap on the concentration of calcium, which indicates the presence of bone. It also limits the maximum size of bone particles, the maximum fat content (and its peroxidation value), and the minimum amount of protein and essential amino acids. Mechanically separated meat can only be used in a limited number of products (hot dogs are allowed, but hamburgers are not) up to 20% under the 1982 rule, and must be clearly labeled.

In 1995, a U.S. Department of Agriculture-FSIS &quot;final rule&quot; (see 60 FR 55962, 60 FR 55982–3) established separate standards for mechanically separated poultry and other meat. Mechanically separated poultry still has calcium content and bone size limits, but no longer any limits on fat and protein levels. It is now considered safe to use without restriction on proportion, but still needs to be labeled clearly. The rule took effect in 1996.

Significant restrictions were later placed on mechanically separated beef due to concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as &quot;mad cow disease&quot;. Ultimately, products with mechanically separated beef were prohibited for human consumption since 2004:
=== European Union / United Kingdom ===

Concerns over BSE first arose in 1986 in the United Kingdom. Since mechanically separated beef often contained small amounts of spinal cord tissue, which can carry the BSE prion, consuming mechanically separated meat from bovine carcasses carried an increased risk of transmitting BSE to humans. The EU tightened restrictions multiple times starting in 1989, to decrease the risk of spinal cord tissue getting into mechanically separated bovine meat. In the mid-1990s the UK banned mechanically separated meat from cattle backbone, which was expanded to include backbone from any ruminant in 1998 (under European Commission Decision 97/534/EC), and any ruminant bone in 2001. In 2004, under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, MSM from all ruminants are banned for human consumption.

As of 1997, the European Union regulates MSM by the source material, fat (and peroxidation value), protein, and calcium content, bone particle sizes, and by how it is produced and stored. Since 2010, the European Union distinguishes between low-pressure MSM and high-pressure MSM. &quot;Low pressure&quot; MSM is produced by advanced meat recovery (AMR) and is similar to mince meat in terms of appearance and the extent of muscle fiber damage. In a conventional high-pressure process, the meat is pressed through a sieve and the result is the typical paste. High-pressure MSM comes with more risk of microbial growth. However, if European regulations are followed (high-pressure MSM must be immediately frozen and can only be used in cooked products), there is no additional risk compared to conventional meat products. Low-pressure MSM corresponds to the class of AMR meat in US regulation, while high-pressure MSM corresponds to the class of MSM.

<doc id="435800" wikidata="Q736161" url="?curid=435800" title="Tournament (medieval)">
<text>A tournament, or tourney (from Old French &quot;torneiement&quot;, &quot;tornei&quot;), was a chivalrous competition or mock fight that was common in the Middle Ages and Renaissance (12th to 16th centuries), and is a type of hastilude. Tournaments included mêlée, hand-to-hand combat, contests of strength or accuracy, and sometimes jousts. Some considered the tournaments to be frivolous pursuits of celebrity, even a potential threat to public order. But the shows were popular and often put on in honor of coronations, marriages, or births; to celebrate recent conquests or peace treatises; or to welcome ambassadors, lords, or others considered to be of great importance. Other times tournaments were held for no particular reason at all, simply for entertainment. Certain tournaments are depicted throughout the &quot;Codex Manesse&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tournament&quot; evolved from the Middle English &quot;tornement&quot; which entered the English lexicon from the Old French &quot;torneiement&quot; around the 12th century. That noun and its associated verb, &quot;tornoier&quot;, ultimately derive from the Latin (&quot;to turn&quot;) which also gave rise to the Italian , the modern French , and modern English&#x27;s &quot;tourney&quot;. &quot;Tournament&quot; and its derivates had been adopted in English (via Anglo-Norman) by 1300.

The Old French &quot;tornoier&quot; originally meant &quot;to joust and tilt&quot;, but came to refer to the knightly tournament more generally while &quot;joster&quot;, meaning &quot;approach, meet&quot; (also adopted before 1300), came to refer to jousting specifically.

By the end of the 12th century, &#x27; and Latinized &#x27; had become the generic term for all kinds of knightly hastiludes or martial displays. Roger of Hoveden writing in the late 12th century defined &#x27; as &quot;military exercises carried out, not in the knight&#x27;s spirit of hostility (&#x27;), but solely for practice and the display of prowess (&quot;&quot;).&quot;

==Origins==
Medieval equestrian warfare and equestrian practices hark back to Roman antiquity, just as the notion of &quot;chivalry&quot; goes back to the rank of &quot;equites&quot; in Roman times. There may be an element of continuity connecting the medieval tournament to the &quot;hippika gymnasia&quot; of the Roman cavalry, but due to the sparsity of written records during the 5th to 8th centuries this is difficult to establish. It is known that such cavalry games were central to military training in the Carolingian Empire, with records of Louis and Charles&#x27; military games at Worms in 843. At this event which was recorded by Nithard, the initial chasing and fleeing was followed by a general mêlée of all combatants.

Documentation of equestrian practice during the 9th to 10th centuries is sparse, but it is clear that the tournament was a development of the High Middle Ages. It is recognized by several medieval historical sources: a chronicler of Tours in the late 12th century attributes the &quot;invention&quot; of the knightly tournament to an Angevin baron, Geoffroi de Preulli, who supposedly died in 1066. In 16th-century German historiography, the setting down of the first tournament laws is attributed to Henry the Fowler (r. 919–936); this tradition is cited by Georg Rüxner in his &quot;Thurnierbuch&quot; of c. 1530 as well as by Paulus Hector Mair in his &quot;De Arte Athletica&quot; (c. 1544/5).

The earliest known use of the word &quot;tournament&quot; comes from peace legislation by Count Baldwin III of Hainaut for the town of Valenciennes, dated to 1114. It refers to the keepers of the peace in the town leaving it &quot;for the purpose of frequenting javelin sports, tournaments and such like.&quot;

A pattern of regular tournament meetings across northern France is evident in sources for the life of Charles, Count of Flanders (1119–27). The sources of the 1160s and 1170s portray the event in the developed form it maintained into the 14th century.

== During the High Middle Ages ==
Tournaments centered on the &quot;mêlée&quot;, a general fight where the knights were divided into two sides and charged at each other, fighting with blunted weapons. Jousting, a single combat of two knights riding at each other, was a component of the tournament but was never its main feature.

The standard form of a tournament is evident in sources as early as the 1160s and 1170s, notably &quot;The History of William Marshal&quot; and the Arthurian romances of Chrétien de Troyes. Tournaments might be held at all times of the year except the penitential season of Lent (the forty days preceding the Triduum of Easter). The general custom was to hold them on Mondays and Tuesdays, though any day but Friday and Sunday might be used. The site of the tournament was customarily announced a fortnight before it was to be held. The most famous tournament fields were in northeastern France (including between Ressons-sur-Matz and Gournay-sur-Aronde near Compiègne, in use between the 1160s and 1240s) which attracted hundreds of foreign knights from all over Europe for the &#x27;lonc sejor&#x27; (the tournament season).

Knights arrived individually or in companies to stay at one or other of the two settlements designated as their lodgings. The tournament began on a field outside the principal settlement, where stands were erected for spectators. On the day of the tournament one side was formed of those &#x27;within&#x27; the principal settlement, and another of those &quot;outside.&quot;

Parties hosted by the principal magnates present were held in both settlements, and preliminary jousts (called the &quot;vespers&quot; or &quot;premières commençailles&quot;) offered knights an individual showcase for their talents. On the day of the event, the tournament was opened by a review () in which both sides paraded and called out their war cries. There was then a further opportunity for individual jousting carried out between the , the two lines of knights. The opportunity for jousting at this point was customarily offered to the new, young knights who were present.

At some time in mid-morning the knights would line up for the charge (&quot;estor&quot;). At the signal which was usually a bugle or herald&#x27;s cry, the two knights would ride at each other and meet with levelled lances. Those remaining on horseback would turn quickly (the action which gave the tournament its name) and single out knights to attack. There is evidence that squires were present at the lists (the staked and embanked line in front of the stands) to offer their masters up to three replacement lances. The mêlée would tend then to degenerate into running battles between parties of knights seeking to take ransoms, and would spread over several square miles between the two settlements which defined the tournament area. Most tournaments continued until both sides were exhausted, or until the light faded. A few ended earlier, if one side broke in the charge, panicked and ran for its home base looking to get behind its lists and the shelter of the armed infantry which protected them. Following the tournament the patron of the day would offer lavish banquets and entertainment. Prizes were offered to the best knight on either side and awarded during the meals.

===Melee===


&quot;Melee&quot; ( or /ˈmeleɪ/, French: &quot;mêlée&quot; ; in English frequently spelled as &quot;mêlée,&quot; &quot;melée,&quot; or simply &quot;melee&quot;) is a term for a type of mock combat in medieval tournaments. The &quot;mêlée&quot; was the &quot;mass tournament&quot; where two teams, either on foot or horse, clashed in formation. The aim was to smash into the enemy in massed formation, with the aim of throwing them back or breaking their ranks. Following a successful maneuver of this kind, the rank would attempt to turn around without breaking formation ( or ); this action was so central that it would become eponymous of the entire tradition of the &quot;tourney&quot; or &quot;tournament&quot; by the mid-12th century. Weapons were often blunted before fights in order to prevent serious injury. 

The Middle High German term for this type of contest was (adopted in French as ); some sources may also make a distinction between &quot;mêlée&quot; or mass tournament and , as the latter could refer to a wider class of equestrian games not necessarily confined to the formal tournament reserved to nobility.

The Old French &quot;meslee&quot; &quot;brawl, confused fight; mixture, blend&quot; (12th century) is the feminine past participle of the verb &quot;mesler&quot; &quot;to mix&quot; (ultimately from Vulgar Latin &quot;misculāta&quot; &quot;mixed&quot;, from Latin &quot;miscēre&quot; &quot;to mix&quot;; compare &quot;mélange&quot;; &quot;meddle, medley&quot;). The modern French form &quot;mêlée&quot; was borrowed into English in the 17th century and is not the historical term used for tournament mock battles.
The term &quot;buhurt&quot; may be related to &quot;hurter&quot; &quot;to push, collide with&quot; (cognate with English &quot;to hurt&quot;) or alternatively from a Frankish &quot;bihurdan&quot; &quot;to fence; encompass with a fence or paling&quot;).

Tournaments often contained a mêlée consisting of knights fighting one another on foot or mounted, either divided into two sides or fighting as a free-for-all. The object was to capture opposing knights so that they could be ransomed, and this could be a very profitable business for such skilled knights as William Marshal.

The mêlée or &quot;buhurt&quot; was the main form of the tournament in its early phase during the 12th and 13th centuries. The joust, while in existence since at least the 12th century as part of tournaments, did not play the central role it would acquire later by the late 15th century.

===Jousting===
As has been said, jousting formed part of the tournament event from as early a time as it can be observed. It was an evening prelude to the big day, and was also a preliminary to the grand charge on the day itself. In the 12th century, jousting was occasionally banned in tournaments. The reasons given are that it distracted knights from the main event, and allowed a form of cheating. Count Philip of Flanders made a practice in the 1160s of turning up armed with his retinue to the preliminary jousts, and then declining to join the mêlée until the knights were exhausted and ransoms could be swept up.

But jousting had its own devoted constituency by the early 13th century, and in the 1220s it began to have its own exclusive events outside the tournament. The biographer of William Marshal observed c.1224 that in his day noblemen were more interested in jousting than tourneying. In 1223, we have the first mention of an exclusively jousting event, the Round Table held in Cyprus by John d&#x27;Ibelin, lord of Beirut. Round Tables were a 13th-century enthusiasm and can be reconstructed to have been an elimination jousting event. They were held for knights and squires alike. Other forms of jousting also arose during the century, and by the 14th century the joust was poised to take over the vacancy in aristocratic amusement caused by the decline of the tournament.

===Popularity===
The first English mention of tourneying is in a charter of Osbert of Arden, Lord of Kingsbury of Warwickshire, which reveals that he travelled to both Northampton and London, but also crossed the English Channel to join in events in France. The charter dates to the late 1120s. The great tournaments of northern France attracted many hundreds of knights from Germany, England, Scotland, Occitania, and Iberia. There is evidence that 3000 knights attended the tournament at Lagny-sur-Marne in November 1179 promoted by Louis VII in honour of his son&#x27;s coronation. The state tournaments at Senlis and Compiègne held by Philip III in 1279 can be calculated to have been even larger events.

Aristocratic enthusiasm for the tournament meant that it had travelled outside its northern French heartland before the 1120s. The first evidence for it in England and the Rhineland is found in the 1120s. References in the Marshal biography indicate that in the 1160s tournaments were being held in central France and Great Britain. The contemporary works of Bertran de Born talk of a tourneying world that also embraced northern Iberia, Scotland and the Empire. The chronicle of Lauterberg indicates that by 1175 the enthusiasm had reached the borders of Poland.

Despite this huge interest and wide distribution, royal and ecclesiastical authority was deployed to prohibit the event. In 1130, Pope Innocent II at a church council at Clermont denounced the tournament and forbade Christian burial for those killed in them. The usual ecclesiastical justification for prohibiting them was that it distracted the aristocracy from more acceptable warfare in the defense of Christianity elsewhere. However, the reason for the ban imposed on them in England by Henry II was most likely because of its persistent threat to public order. Knights going to tournaments were accused of theft and violence against the unarmed. Henry II was keen to re-establish public order in England after the disruption during the reign of King Stephen (1135–1154). He did not prohibit tournaments in his continental domains, and indeed three of his sons were avid pursuers of the sport.

Tournaments were allowed in England once again after 1192, when Richard I identified six sites where they would be permitted and gave a scale of fees by which patrons could pay for a license. But both King John and his son, Henry III, introduced fitful and capricious prohibitions which much annoyed the aristocracy and eroded the popularity of the events. In France, Louis IX prohibited tourneying within his domains in 1260, and his successors for the most part maintained the ban.

===Equipment===
It is a debated issue as to what extent specialized arms and armor were used in mêlée tournaments, and to what extent the military equipment of knights and their horses in the 12th and 13th centuries was devised to meet the perils and demands of tournaments, rather than warfare. It is, however, clear from the sources that the weapons used in tournaments were initially the same as those used in war. It is not by any means certain that swords were blunted for most of the history of the tournament. This must have changed by the mid 13th century, at least in jousting encounters. There is a passing reference to a special spear for use in jousting in the &quot;Prose Lancelot&quot; (c. 1220). In the 1252 jousting at Walden, the lances used had , curved ring-like punches instead of points. Edward I of England&#x27;s &quot;Statute of Arms&quot; of 1292 says that blunted knives and swords should be used in tournaments.

==Late Middle and Early Modern Ages==


The tournament had a resurgence of popularity in England in the reign of the martial and crusading king, Edward I (), and under his grandson, Edward III (), yet nonetheless the tournament died out in the latter&#x27;s reign. Edward III encouraged the move towards pageantry and a predominance of jousting in his sponsored events. In one of the last true tournaments held in England (in 1342 at Dunstable), the mêlée was postponed so long by jousting that the sun was sinking by the time the lines charged.

A tournament took place in Norwich in 1350 which was attended by Edward III&#x27;s son, commonly known as the Black Prince. The tournament, held at the expense of the citizens of Norwich, cost £37.4s.6d.; approximately 5 years&#x27; wages for a skilled craftsman. The tournament survived little longer in France or Burgundy. The last known tournament at Bruges took place in 1379. That same year the citizens of Ghent rioted when the count of Flanders announced a tournament to be held at their city. The cause of their discontent was the associated expense for them.

By using costumes, drama, and symbolism tournaments became a form of art, which raised the expenses for these events considerably. They had political purposes: to impress the populace and guests with their opulence, as well as with the courage of the participants. Loyalty to a lord or lady was expressed through clothes and increasingly elaborate enactments. Tournaments also served cultural purposes. As the ideals of Courtly Love became more influential, women played a more important role in the events. Events often took place in honor of a lady, and ladies participated in the playacting and symbolism.

Edward III of England regularly held tournaments, during which people often dressed up, sometimes as the Knights of the Round Table. In 1331, the participants of one tournament all wore green cloaks decorated with golden arrows. In the same year at a tournament at Cheapside, the king and other participants dressed as Tartars and led the ladies, who were in the colors of Saint George, in a procession at the start of the event. Edward III&#x27;s grandson, Richard II (), would first distribute his livery badges with the White Hart at a tournament at Smithfield.

Mythology and storytelling were popular aspects of tournaments. An example of this is the tournament in 1468 that Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy organised to celebrate his marriage with Margaret of York. The tournament was supposedly at the bidding of the &#x27;Lady of the Hidden Ile&#x27;. A golden tree had been erected with all the coats of arms of the participating knights. They were dressed like famous figures from legend and history, while their squires were dressed as harlequins. A notable example of an elaborate costume was that of Anthony of Luxembourg. Chained in a black castle he entered the lists. He could only be freed with a golden key and approval of the attending ladies.

In Florence, the military aspect of the tournaments was secondary to the display of wealth. For a tournament honoring his marriage to Clarice Orsini in 1469, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici had his standard designed by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Verrocchio. He also wore a large amount of jewelry, including the famous Medici diamond &#x27;Il Libro&#x27;.

Royalty also held tournaments to stress the importance of certain events and their nobility&#x27;s loyalty. King Henry VII of England and his queen Elizabeth of York presided over a series of tournaments when their infant son Henry became Duke of York in 1494. These tournaments were noted for their display of wealth. On the first day, the participants showed their loyalty by wearing the King&#x27;s colors on their bodies and the Queen&#x27;s colors on their helmets. They further honored the royal family by wearing the colors of the King&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort, on the next day.

In 1511, at the court of King Henry VIII of England, a tournament was held in honor of the king&#x27;s wife Catherine of Aragon. Charles Brandon came out of a tower which was moved onto the battlefield, dressed like a pilgrim. He only took off his pilgrim&#x27;s clothes after the queen had given him permission to participate. In 1559, King Henry II of France died during a tournament when a sliver from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the Scottish Guard at the French Court, pierced his eye and entered his brain. The death of Henry II caused his 15-year-old son Francis II to take the throne, beginning a period of political instability that ultimately led to the French Wars of Religion.

Spanish knights in the 16th century also practised a team fight known as the &quot;cane game&quot;.
In Spanish Italy, tournaments could include an equivalent .

The decline of the true tournament, as opposed to the joust, was not a straightforward process, although the word continued to be used for jousts until the 16th century - forced by the prominent place that tourneying occupied in popular Arthurian romance literature.

<doc id="435802" wikidata="Q457737" url="?curid=435802" title="Trisomy 18">
<text>Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of a third copy of all or part of chromosome 18. Many parts of the body are affected. Babies are often born small and have heart defects. Other features include a small head, small jaw, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and severe intellectual disability.
Most cases of trisomy 18 occur due to problems during the formation of the reproductive cells or during early development. The chance of this condition occurring increases with the mother&#x27;s age. Rarely, cases may be inherited. Occasionally, not all cells have the extra chromosome, known as mosaic trisomy, and symptoms in these cases may be less severe. An ultrasound during pregnancy can increase suspicion for the condition, which can be confirmed by amniocentesis.
Treatment is supportive. After having one child with the condition, the risk of having a second is typically around one percent. It is the second-most common condition due to a third chromosome at birth, after Down syndrome for a third chromosome 21.
Trisomy 18 occurs in around 1 in 5,000 live births. Many of those affected die before birth. Some studies suggest that more babies that survive to birth are female. Survival beyond a year of life is around 5–10%. It is named after the English geneticist John Hilton Edwards, who first described the syndrome in 1960.

==Signs and symptoms==

Children born with Edwards&#x27; syndrome may have some or all of these characteristics: kidney malformations, structural heart defects at birth (e.g., ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus), intestines protruding outside the body (omphalocele), esophageal atresia, intellectual disability, developmental delays, growth deficiency, feeding difficulties, breathing difficulties, and arthrogryposis (a muscle disorder that causes multiple joint contractures at birth).

Some physical malformations associated with Edwards&#x27; syndrome include small head (microcephaly) accompanied by a prominent back portion of the head (occiput), low-set, malformed ears, abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), cleft lip/cleft palate, upturned nose, narrow eyelid openings (blepharophimosis), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis), a short breast bone, clenched hands, choroid plexus cysts, underdeveloped thumbs and/or nails, absent radius, webbing of the second and third toes, clubfoot or rocker bottom feet, and in males, undescended testicles.

&quot;In utero&quot;, the most common characteristic is cardiac anomalies, followed by central nervous system anomalies such as head shape abnormalities. The most common intracranial anomaly is the presence of choroid plexus cysts, which are pockets of fluid on the brain. These are not problematic in themselves, but their presence may be a marker for trisomy 18. Sometimes, excess amniotic fluid or polyhydramnios is exhibited. Although uncommon in the syndrome, trisomy 18 causes a large portion of prenatally diagnosed cases of Dandy–Walker malformation.

==Genetics==

Trisomy 18 is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 18th chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 18) or in part (such as due to translocations). The additional chromosome usually occurs before conception. The effects of the extra copy vary greatly, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic history, and chance. Trisomy 18 occurs in all human populations but is more prevalent in female offspring.

A typical egg or sperm cell contains individual chromosomes, each of which contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human karyotype of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at either of the two meiotic divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells (nondisjunction). This results in an extra chromosome, making the haploid number 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.

Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event. In nondisjunction, a pair of chromosomes fails to separate during cell division; thus, a gamete (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of a chromosome (for a total of 24 chromosomes). When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the resulting embryo has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of the problematic chromosome (in this case, chromosome 18). (Although an embryo could inherit a trisomy from both parents, it is, as a rule, extremely rare, and worse in terms of clinical perspective and prognosis.)

A small percentage of cases occur when only some of the body&#x27;s cells have an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called mosaic trisomy 18. Very rarely, a piece of chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical trisomy 18.

==Diagnosis==
Ultrasound can increase suspicion of the condition, which can be confirmed by CVS or amniocentesis.

Levels of PAPP-A, AFP, and uE3 are generally decreased during pregnancy, and free beta HCG is elevated.

==Prognosis==
About 60% of pregnancies that are affected do not result in a live birth. Major causes of death include hypoxia and heart abnormalities. It is impossible to predict an exact prognosis during pregnancy or the neonatal period. Half of the live infants do not survive beyond the first week of life without interventions. The median lifespan is five to 15 days without interventions. About 8–12% of infants survive longer than 1 year without interventions. One percent of children live to age 10. However, a retrospective Canadian study of 254 children with trisomy 18 demonstrated ten-year survival of 9.8%, and another found that 68.6% of children with surgical intervention survived infancy. Though rare, some persons with Trisomy 18 survive into their twenties and thirties with the current eldest being well over 50 years. Current ongoing research at the University of Michigan shows survival rate with full interventions is about 90% until the first birthday, and 80% until 5 years. 
==Epidemiology==
Trisomy 18 occurs in about 1 in 5,000 live births, but more pregnancies are affected by the syndrome as the majority of those diagnosed with the condition prenatally will not survive to birth. Although women in their 20s and early 30s may conceive babies with trisomy 18, the risk increases with age. The average maternal age for conceiving a child with this disorder is 32.5.

==History==
Trisomy 18 was first identified by John Hilton Edwards in 1960, although he originally believed it to be caused by a trisomy of chromosome 17. Klaus Patau and Eeva Therman reported another two cases shortly thereafter. They identified the extra chromosome as being part of what Patau&#x27;s lab called &quot;group E&quot;, containing chromosomes 16, 17, and 18, but were unable to determine which chromosome was responsible at the time. Analyzing 5 more cases, they were able to determine that the extra chromosome was chromosome 18.

<doc id="435803" wikidata="Q6522252" url="?curid=435803" title="Lenapehoking">
<text>Lenapehoking () is widely translated as &#x27;homelands of the Lenape&#x27;, which in the 16th and 17th centuries, ranged along the Eastern seaboard from western Connecticut to Delaware, and encompassed the territory adjacent to the Delaware and lower Hudson river valleys, and the territory between them.

Beginning in the 17th century, European colonists started settling on traditional Lenape lands. Combined with the concurrent introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases and encroachment from the colonists, the Lenape were severely depopulated and lost control over large portions of Lenapehoking. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the United States government forcibly removed the Lenape to the American Midwest, including the state of Oklahoma.

Lenape nations today control lands within Oklahoma (Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians), Wisconsin (Stockbridge-Munsee Community), and Ontario (Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations).

== Meaning ==
Lenape speakers in Oklahoma called their northeastern homelands translating to: in the land of the Lenape. It was popularized when Nora Thompson Dean shared the term with conservationist Theodore Cornu in 1970, and later with archaeologist Herbert C. Kraft. This term has gained widespread acceptance and is found widely in recent literature on the Lenape and in New York institutions today as part of land acknowledgement.

Another historical Lenape term for much of the same region is &quot;Scheyischbi&quot; or &quot;Scheyichbi&quot;, although this is also often cited as referring specifically to New Jersey.

==Range and bounds==
At the time of the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Lenape homeland ranged along the Atlantic&#x27;s coast from western Connecticut to Delaware, which generally encompassed the territory adjacent to the Delaware and lower Hudson river valleys, as well the hill-and-ridge dominated territory between them. Relatives of the Algonquian Amerindians whose territories ranged along the entire coast from beyond the Saint Lawrence River in today&#x27;s Canada, and the tribes throughout all of New England, down into northern South Carolina, the Delaware Confederation stretched from the southern shores of modern-day Delaware along the Atlantic seaboard into western Long Island and Connecticut, then extended westwards across the Hudson water gap into the eastern Catskills part of the Appalachians range around the headwaters of the Delaware River and along both banks of its basin down to the mouth of the Lehigh River.

Inland, the tribe had to deal with the fierce and territorial Susquehannocks; the Delawares&#x27; territory has generally been plotted with boundaries along mountain ridges topped by the drainage divides between the right bank tributaries of the Delaware River on the east—and on the west and south—the left bank tributaries of the Susquehanna and Lehigh Rivers; bounds which included the Catskills, parts of Northeastern Pennsylvania through the entire Pocono Mountains along the left bank of the Lehigh River. The Schuylkill River and its mouth in the present-day Philadelphia area or right bank of the Lehigh River were contested hunting grounds, generally shared with the Susquehannock and the occasional visit by a related Potomac tribe when there wasn&#x27;t active tribal warfare. The greater Philadelphia area was known to host European to Indian contacts from the Dutch traders contacts with the Susquehanna (1600), English traders (1602), and both tribes with New Netherland traders after 1610.

Along the left bank Delaware valley, the territory extended to all of present-day New Jersey, and the southern counties of New York State, including Rockland, Orange, Westchester, and Putnam Counties, Nassau County, and the five boroughs of New York City.

==Present day==
Several indigenous peoples from diverse tribes, both from the region historically and from elsewhere, live in the Northeast megalopolis or Eastern Seaboard. Many of people from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy moved into the area in the 1920s to 1960s and were employed as skyscraper construction workers (many belonged to the Mohawk Tribe) and played an important role in building the skyline of Philadelphia and New York City. In the University City section of West Philadelphia, there has been some political activity by Urban Indian residents of the area, who adapted the namesake to where they live.

Lenape nations today control lands within Oklahoma (Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians), Wisconsin (Stockbridge-Munsee Community), and Ontario (Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations).

==Lenape place names==
Lenape place names are used throughout the region. The following are merely examples and the list is by no means exhaustive.

===New York===
====Manhattan====
* Manhattan is derived from , a Dutch version of a Lenape place name, as written in the 1609 logbook of Robert Juet, an officer on Henry Hudson&#x27;s yacht &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (Half Moon). A 1610 map depicts the name Manahata twice, on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River (later named the North River, and now called the Hudson River). The word &quot;Manhattan&quot; has been translated as &#x27;island of many hills&#x27; from the Lenape language. &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; offers other derivations, including from the Munsee dialect of Lenape: (&#x27;place of general inebriation&#x27;), (&#x27;place where timber is procured for bows and arrows&#x27;), or (&#x27;island&#x27;). Nora Thompson Dean (Touching Leaves Woman) defined it as: &#x27;place that is an island&#x27;, from Lenape .
* Sapokanikan – habitation site and cultivated area by the cove on the Hudson River at present day Gansevoort Street, Greenwich Village.
* Nechtanc – habitation site along the East River site of Jacob Van Corlaer&#x27;s plantation at Corlaer&#x27;s Hook, near the present location of the Williamsburg Bridge, in the part of the Lower East Side that is near Chinatown.
*Indirectly named after Lenape shell middens: Pearl Street and Collect Pond

====Staten Island====
* – name for Staten Island
* – name for Staten Island
* – habitation site and cultivated area along Great Kills Harbor

====Brooklyn====
* or – habitation in Bay Ridge near the present location of the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge
* Gowanus Canal – originally named by early settlers as &quot;Gowanes Creek&quot; after , sachem of the local Lenape tribe called the Canarsee, who lived and farmed along the shores of the creek. Also source of the neighborhood Gowanus and the Heights of Guan.
* – habitation site in present Red Hook

====Queens====
* Rockaway, evolved from the Lenape word , which apparently referred to &#x27;a sandy place&#x27;.
* Maspeth originally Mas-pet were a part of the Rockaway band that lived along Maspeth Creek.

====Westchester County====

<doc id="435804" wikidata="Q6772535" url="?curid=435804" title="Marquess of Ely">
<text>Marquess of Ely, of the County of Wexford, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Charles Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely. He was born Charles Tottenham, the son of Sir John Tottenham, 1st Baronet, who had been created a baronet, of Tottenham Green in the County of Wexford, in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1780, by Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus, sister and heiress of Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely (see Viscount Loftus and Earl of Ely for earlier history of the Loftus family). 

In 1783, he succeeded to the Loftus estates on the death of his maternal uncle the Earl of Ely and assumed the same year by Royal licence the surname of Loftus in lieu of his patronymic. In 1785, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Loftus, of Loftus Hall in the County of Wexford. The Hall itself was sold by the family in 1917 and is today owned by the Quigley family.

He was further honoured when he was made Viscount Loftus, of Ely, in 1789, Earl of Ely, in the Kingdom of Ireland, in 1794, and Marquess of Ely, of the County of Wexford, in 1800, all in the Peerage of Ireland, becoming one of the few persons to rise to the rank of Marquess without having inherited any peerages. In 1801 he was created Baron Loftus, of Long Loftus in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, by which title the Marquesses of Ely sat in the House of Lords until the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. Lord Ely also succeeded his father as second Baronet in 1786.

Lord Ely was succeeded by his eldest son, John, the second Marquess. He had previously represented County Wexford in both the Irish and British Parliaments. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, John, the third Marquess. He briefly represented Woodstock in Parliament in 1845. This line of the family failed on the early death of his son, John, the fourth Marquess, in 1889. The late Marquess was succeeded by his first cousin John Loftus, the fifth Marquess. He was the eldest son of Reverend Lord Adam Loftus, third son of the second Marquess. The fifth Marquess died childless in 1925 and was succeeded by his youngest brother, George, the sixth Marquess. 

The latter&#x27;s only surviving son, George, the seventh Marquess, was High Sheriff of County Fermanagh. On his death in 1969 without surviving children the line of the second Marquess failed. The late Marquess was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, Charles Tottenham, who became the eighth Marquess. He was the great-grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles John Tottenham, DL, JP, eldest son of the Right Reverend Lord Robert Tottenham (who had not assumed the surname Loftus), second son of the first Marquess. The eighth Marquess lived in Canada. Since 2006, the titles are held by his eldest son, the ninth Marquess. As of 28 February 2014, the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2006.

Several other members of the family may also be mentioned. Charles Tottenham, father of the first Baronet, represented New Ross in the Irish House of Commons. Charles Tottenham, brother of the first Baronet, also represented New Ross in the Irish Parliament. The aforementioned the Right Reverend Lord Robert Tottenham, second son of the first Marquess, was Bishop of Clogher. Jane Loftus (1820–1890) was the wife of the second Marquess, and Lady of the Bedchamber and great friend of Queen Victoria. Henry Loftus Tottenham (1860–1950), son of John Francis Tottenham, son of Lord Robert Tottenham, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Sir Alexander Robert Loftus Tottenham (1873–1946), son of John Francis Tottenham, was the administrator of Pudukkottai in British India. The Very Reverend George Tottenham (1825–1911), son of Lord Robert Tottenham, was Dean of Clogher. Lord Augustus Loftus, fourth son of the second Marquess, was a prominent diplomat. The Right Reverend Ann Tottenham, daughter of the eighth Marquess, was a bishop in the Anglican Church of Canada.

The title refers to Ely in County Wicklow, not to the City of Ely in Cambridgeshire, and the second syllable is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;lee&quot; rather than &quot;lie&quot; (the title is not pronounced in the same way as the first name Eli).

The similar title Marquess of the Isle of Ely was created with the Dukedom of Edinburgh in 1726.

The family seat was Loftus Hall, near Hook, County Wexford.

<doc id="435805" wikidata="Q406273" url="?curid=435805" title="U.S. Route 5">
<text>U.S. Route 5 (US 5) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway running through the New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. Significant cities along the route include New Haven, Connecticut; Hartford, Connecticut; and Springfield, Massachusetts. From Hartford northward to St. Johnsbury, Vermont, the road closely follows the route of the Connecticut River.

The entire route of US 5 is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 (I-91). US 5 now serves as the local business route and alternate route for the Interstate Highway. The northern terminus of US 5 is in Derby Line, Vermont, at the Canada–United States border, where it continues past the Derby Line–Stanstead Border Crossing into Quebec as Route 143, which was Route 5 until renumbered in the mid-1970s. Its southern terminus is in New Haven, Connecticut, at an intersection with I-91.

US 5 runs through three states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, with the latter containing over half of US 5&#x27;s total distance. Throughout nearly all of US 5&#x27;s entire length, it remains its own road entirely separate from I-91, which has largely replaced it as a through route (and now carries most of the traffic). It is only cosigned onto I-91 for less than half of a mile () in Springfield, Massachusetts, before splitting off alone again.

===Connecticut===

US 5 begins in the city of New Haven, heading north through Hartford to Massachusetts. It generally parallels I-91. From Meriden northward through Wethersfield, it runs concurrent with Route 15 and is known locally as the Berlin Turnpike. Much commerce is located there resulting in high traffic. The Berlin Turnpike leaves the roadway south of the Hartford city line.

After an interchange in Hartford with I-91, US 5/Route 15 travels over the Charter Oak Bridge, which spans the Connecticut River, into East Hartford. US 5 then splits off to head toward downtown East Hartford. It then has a short overlap with US 44, which joins it from the west as Connecticut Boulevard. US 44 continues to the east along Burnside Avenue as US 5 continues northward into South Windsor, East Windsor, and Enfield. It leaves the state soon after a junction with I-91, heading into Longmeadow, Massachusetts (a part of the Springfield metropolitan area).

===Massachusetts===

US 5 stays very close to the Connecticut River. It enters the state at the town of Longmeadow on the east bank of the river going up to Springfield. In Springfield, US 5 then overlaps with I-91 for about , then separates as its own freeway crossing the Connecticut River on the South End Bridge into Agawam. The freeway portion runs for about up to West Springfield. From the town of Northampton up to Bernardston, US 5 overlaps Route 10 (for ). US 5 also passes through Holyoke, Hatfield, Whately, Deerfield, and Greenfield. As in Connecticut, US 5 has many interchanges with the parallel I-91.

===Vermont===
US 5 follows the Connecticut River valley from the southern border of Vermont, traveling along the west bank of that river until it reaches St. Johnsbury.

US 5 enters the state at the town of Guilford. It passes through the counties of (from south to north) Windham, Windsor, Orange, Caledonia, and Orleans. Near the town of St. Johnsbury, US 5 continues northward, following the Passumpsic River valley until it reaches Sheffield Heights. After crossing the heights, it follows the Barton River valley until it reaches Orleans. It then turns north-northwest and crosses the divide near the Airport Road in Irasburg and follows the Black River valley into Newport. US 5 ends at the Canada–United States border in the village of Derby Line, where the roadway continues into Canada as Route 143.

As in Connecticut and Massachusetts, US 5 has many interchanges with I-91, with a total of 22 junctions over its length in the state.

==History==

Prior to the U.S. Numbered Highway System, the route was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system that existed between 1922 and 1927. When US 5 was first commissioned, it took over the entirety of Route 2. In 1927, US 5 had still not been paved in Vermont. Paving in Vermont was completed by 1933.
===Connecticut===

Originally, the route began at the New Haven Green in downtown New Haven (at US 1). Between New Haven and North Haven, it originally ran east of the Quinnipiac River along modern-day Middletown Avenue (part of Route 17) and Route 103 (the modern alignment was then designated as US 5A).

In Hartford, US 5 passed by Central Row in the downtown area, entering the city via Maple Avenue and exiting on the Bulkeley Bridge with US 6.

The southern terminus of US 5 has been realigned several times. By 1938, US 5 bypassed downtown New Haven via the Prospect Hill, Dixwell, and West River neighborhoods, ending at Davenport and Columbus Avenues. In the mid-1950s, US 5 was instead routed through the Mill River neighborhood ending at East Street and Forbes Avenue. The modern New Haven to North Haven designation was also in place around this time. When I-91 opened in 1967, the alignment was truncated to its current terminus at exit 5 of I-91.

===Massachusetts===
The Massachusetts Highway Commission noted in 1912 that between Longmeadow and Agawam, the traffic between the Pioneer Valley and Connecticut was heavier on the east side.

The western route from Hartford to West Springfield, via what is now River Road in Agawam and Route 159 in Connecticut, was designated US 5 Alternate.

The main route, US 5, was originally designated to run on the east side of the river from Hartford into downtown Springfield, over the Memorial Bridge, along Memorial Avenue, up a four-lane Main Street, and then to Park Street (and Park Avenue going in the opposite direction), and up what is now Elm Street, to Riverdale Street. Riverdale Street at that time followed the northern part of the current Elm Street and ended at Witch Path.

In 1938, due to congestion in the West Springfield town center, US 5 was moved to a newly constructed bypass from the North End Bridge to East Elm Street, where it continued north along the modern Elm Street and Riverdale Road.

In 1941–1942, a four-lane highway was built from East Elm Street to the current Elm Street fork just south of Morgan Road. The designations of both Riverdale Road and US 5 were moved to the new more easterly route.

In 1952–1953, construction was started on the modern four-lane highway from the new South End Bridge in Agawam to the existing bypass at the North End Bridge. Tunnels were built under the rotaries at the Memorial and North End bridges so US 5 traffic and local traffic would not intersect. In 1971, the Riverdale Road portion of US 5 was upgraded to a divided highway, with the installation of a steel median, and in 1987–1988, a new lane was added to accommodate the new Riverdale Shops at Daggett Drive.

The 1953 Massachusetts Department of Public Works Master Plan would have relocated US 5 between Morgan Road in West Springfield and Mount Tom in Holyoke to a right-of-way similar to the current path of I-91, but this was never implemented.

===Vermont===

US 5 in Vermont mostly followed the Route 2 alignment when it was first designated. Minor deviations from the current route are found in the urban compacts of White River Junction, Burke, Coventry, and Derby Center.

From 1927 to 1929, US 5 was temporarily routed into New Hampshire along part of what is now New Hampshire Route 12 between North Walpole and Charlestown. The US 5 designation was removed when the road opposite the Connecticut River in Vermont had been improved. In 1931, US 5 in Vermont was taken over by the state, which began paving the road. Over the years a few minor reroutings within populated centers have taken place. The current alignment was in place by 1975.
