== History ==
=== 19th century ===
Deere &amp; Company began when John Deere, born in Rutland, Vermont, United States, on February 7, 1804, moved to Grand Detour, Illinois, in 1836, to escape bankruptcy in Vermont. Already an established blacksmith, Deere opened a shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of tools such as pitchforks and shovels.
Tools were just a start; the item that set him apart was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere&#x27;s steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so they had to be cleaned frequently. Deere created a highly polished steel surface that allowed the soil to slide easily. This tool addressed the difficulty of tilling the Prairie State&#x27;s soil and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The traditional way of doing business was to make the product as, and when, it was ordered. This style was very slow. As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.


In early 1843, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the Rock River in Illinois. It used water power to operate machineries. This factory, named the &quot;L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer&quot;, produced about 100 plows in 1842, and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere&#x27;s partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to Moline, Illinois, to have access to the railroad and the Mississippi River. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and built a factory the same year. John Gould was later brought in to manage the accounts. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate &amp; Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.

Deere bought out Tate and Gould&#x27;s interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son Charles Deere. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company&#x27;s production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. During this period, the company announced its work on a steam engine that will pull its plow but the product did not materialize. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere turned over his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father&#x27;s managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until his retirement in April 1886, but died one month later in May 1886 in Moline, Illinois. The company was reorganized again in 1868 when it was incorporated as Deere &amp; Company. While the company&#x27;s original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company&#x27;s sales nationwide. This same year, Deere &amp; Company won &quot;Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety&quot; at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won $10 and a silver medal.

The core focus remained on the agricultural implements, but John Deere also made a few bicycles in the 1890s.

=== 20th century ===

Increased competition during the early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of gasoline tractors came to define Deere &amp; Company&#x27;s operations during the 20th century.
In 1912, Deere &amp; Company president William Butterworth (Charles&#x27; son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company&#x27;s expansion into the tractor business. Deere &amp; Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere &amp; Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.

The company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. This featured improvements and modifications to Model D such as higher power level due to increased cylinder bore. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.

On an episode of the Travel Channel series &quot;Made in America&quot; that profiled Deere &amp; Company, host John Ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from American farmers during the Great Depression.

During World War II, the great-grandson of John Deere, Charles Deere Wiman, was president of the company, but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army. Burton F. Peek was hired as president during this period. Before Wiman returned to work at the company in late 1944, he directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the War Production Board. In addition to farm machinery, John Deere manufactured military tractors, and transmissions for the M3 tank. They also made aircraft parts, ammunition, and mobile laundry units to support the war effort.

In 1947, John Deere introduced its first self-propelled combine, model 55. It was soon followed by the smaller models 40 and 45, the larger model 95, and an even larger model 105 was introduced in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, Deere introduced an attachable corn head, allowing corn producers to use their combine to pick, shell, and clean corn in one smooth operation.

In 1956, Deere &amp; Company bought-out the German tractor manufacturer, Heinrich Lanz AG (see Lanz Bulldog).

In the last months of 1958, John Deere constructed a factory in northern Rosario, Argentina. In Argentina, the make was managed by Agar Cross &amp; Co.
John Deere made the following models of tractors in Argentina: 445, 730; the models of the series 20 like 1420, 2420, 3420, 4420; the models of the serie 30 like 2330, 2530, 2730, 3330, 3530, 4530; the models of the serie 40 like 2140, 3140 / 3140 DT, 3440, 3540 and the last made in Baigorria of the serie 50 like 2850, 3350, 3550 until 1994.
Seventeen years later, (in 2011) the Argentinian plant returns the assembly of tractors with the following models: 5036C, 5045D (45 HP) Serie 5D, 5045E (45 HP) Serie 5E, 5065E (65 HP) Serie 5E, 5075E (75 HP) Serie 5E, 5425N (77 HP) Serie 5000, 5725 (92 HP) Serie 5025, 5725HC (92 HP) Serie 5025, 5090E, 5090EH, 5076EF, 6110J, 6130J, 6145J and 6165J.

Plus, in 2012, added in SKD/CKD format, the assembly of combine harvesters 9570 STS Serie 70, 9470 STS, 9670 STS and 9770 STS.

Also, with the green line, the Argentinian facility made some backhoe loaders and motor graders like 570 A/B, 544 A/B, 507, 308, 200 and the 627, 727 model tractors.

On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers from around the world converged on Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the &quot;New Generation of Power&quot;, the company&#x27;s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus, a popular Dallas-based department store.

According to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the &quot;largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted&quot;. During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and salespeople from all over the United States and Canada to Love Field in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere &amp; Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see &quot;a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor&quot;.

Since entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were far more powerful than Deere&#x27;s two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.

The 4010 was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the 4020, which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere&#x27;s optional Power Shift, enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.

In addition to the advanced engine technology, the &quot;10&quot; series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the &quot;10&quot; series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the &quot;10&quot; series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.

In 1972, Deere introduced its new Generation II &#x27;Sound Idea Tractors&#x27;, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator&#x27;s cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body. This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An 8-track tape player was also available as an option. The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere&#x27;s &#x27;Iron Horses&#x27; series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and 8-speed Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.

In 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850. These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed PowerShift transmission and were available with an optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius. They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, instead of the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed in the late 80s by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by Deere&#x27;s completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.

In the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th-anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total workforce of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopeston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:

* John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements 
* John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment 
* John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings
* John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements 
* John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements
* John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements

The John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopeston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city&#x27;s entire population.

In 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a better cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combines imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.

In 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned &#x27;Maximizer&#x27; combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered &#x27;10 series&#x27; upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.

In the late 1970s, International Harvester had pioneered rotary combines with their Axial flow machines and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.

=== 21st century ===
In 2014, the Smithsonian Museum named John Deere&#x27;s original plough design as one of the objects that changed American history.

, Deere &amp; Company employed about 67,000 people worldwide, of which half are in the United States and Canada, and is the largest agriculture machinery company in the world. In August 2014, the company announced it was indefinitely laying off 600 of its workers at plants in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas due to less demand for its products. Inside the United States, the company&#x27;s primary locations are its World Headquarters in Moline, Illinois, and manufacturing factories in central and southeastern United States. , the company experiments with an electric farm tractor.

The logo of the leaping deer has been used by this company for over 155 years. Over the years, the logo has had minor changes and pieces removed. Some of the older style logos have the deer leaping over a log. The company uses different logo colors for agricultural vs. construction products. The company&#x27;s agricultural products are identifiable by a distinctive shade of green paint, with the inside border being yellow. By contrast, the construction products are identifiable by a shade of black with the deer being yellow, and the inside border also being yellow.

In September 2017, Deere &amp; Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Blue River Technology, which is based in Sunnyvale, California, and is applying machine learning to agriculture. Blue River has designed and integrated computer vision and machine learning technology that will enable growers to reduce the use of herbicides by spraying only where weeds are present.

On August 29, 2019, it was announced that Samuel R. Allen will step down as CEO and president of John Deere. John May, president of the Worldwide Agriculture and Turf and Integrated Solutions divisions will replace him in November 2019.

In October 2021, about 10,000 employees, unionized with the United Auto Workers, went on strike following an impasse in contract negotiations.

In January 2022, the company introduced a self-driving tractor at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, designed for large-scale farming as opposed to existing comparable tractors designed for small-scale agriculture. It was part of a larger effort to develop so-called smart machines to make farming faster and more efficient than it would be relying on human labor, including through software, which would mean higher margins. The company said it wanted to &quot;connect 1.5 million machines in service and a half billion acres in use to its cloud-based John Deere Operations Center.&quot;

In June 2022, Deere announced it would cease production of its model 3710 moldboard plow but would continue to offer its model 995 reversible plow.

In July 2024, Deere announced it would lay off 600 employees in its midwest facilities and is considering moving the production of some components to Mexico. The move shocked many as the company comes off an impressive 2023 financial year topping $10Bn in profits. Donald Trump said he would impose 200% tariffs on Mexican made equipment.

==Non-serviceability by owners or third parties==

Late model John Deere farm equipment has been criticized for being impossible to be serviced or repaired by owners or third parties; only John Deere has access to computer code required for this and to accept non-John-Deere replacement parts. Remote locking by the manufacturer may also be possible. This effectively makes the equipment unusable without the continued involvement of John Deere. It was reported that during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Russian troops stole Ukrainian farm equipment and took it back to Russia, but that the dealers who owned the equipment locked it remotely.

John Deere&#x27;s license covering the internal software on tractor control computers does not allow users or independent mechanics to modify the software. This prevents repairs by farmers and creates a monopoly for John Deere dealerships. John Deere claims user repair is forbidden by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, through bypassing of digital rights management. Groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised this activity, being contrary to the right to repair. Some farmers use Ukrainian versions of John Deere software to circumvent restrictions on repair. In February 2022, the US Senate introduced a bill to allow farmers to perform their own repairs. , right-to-repair bills had been introduced in 26 states.

On January 9, 2023, John Deere signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in which the company agreed to allow farmers and independent repair shops to purchase access to John Deere software, manuals, and other information needed to fix John Deere equipment. Walter Schweitzer, President of the Montana Farmers Union, however, expressed skepticism about the agreement, pointing out that the private-sector MOU lacks a legal enforcement mechanism and allows the company to pull out of the MOU if any right-to-repair legislation is enacted. Moreover, as part of the MOU, the AFBF agreed to encourage state farm bureaus to &quot;refrain from introducing, promoting, or supporting federal or state &#x27;Right to Repair&#x27; legislation that imposes obligations beyond the commitments in this MOU.&quot;

The issue addressed by the MOU is still a problem for users of John Deere farm equipment in other countries such as Australia, where agricultural machinery is not covered by the country&#x27;s first right to repair law, a federal statute providing for mandatory data sharing in the automotive sector. In Australia, agricultural industry bodies have been and are lobbying for right to repair laws covering agricultural machinery. Additionally, in November 2024 that country&#x27;s federal and state treasurers entered into a 10-year intergovernmental agreement on national competition policy that the federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said was &quot;an important first step towards delivering broader &#x27;right to repair&#x27; reforms ... especially in agriculture and farming&quot;.

=== Legal issues concerning repair policies ===
In June 2022, 13 lawsuits from farms and farmers, alleging that John Deere and its affiliated dealerships had unlawfully conspired to monopolize and restrain the market for repair and maintenance services of John Deere equipment, were consolidated in federal court in Illinois. In February 2023, the United States Department of Justice filed a &quot;statement of interest&quot; in the case opposing a motion by John Deere to dismiss the case, arguing that restrictions on repair can harm both consumers and the public. In November 2023, U.S. District Judge Iain Johnston denied John Deere&#x27;s motion to dismiss the case, finding that the plaintiffs&#x27; complaint &quot;is chock-full of factual allegations to support&quot; the conclusion that &quot;Deere has the ultimate control of the repair services market&quot; for John Deere equipment.

In January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed suit against Deere over the company&#x27;s restrictive repair policies. In its lawsuit, the FTC argued that Deere inflated repair costs for farmers by preventing independent shops from repairing Deere equpment.

&quot;Green Magazine&quot; is a publication devoted to John Deere enthusiasts. It was begun in November 1984 by Richard and Carol Hain of Bee, Nebraska.

The first issue was mailed in early November 1984 to 135 paid subscribers and had 10 black-and-white pages with features on tractors, letters from readers, and advertisements. At the time, the magazine was published bimonthly. It was written in Lincoln, Nebraska, and it was mailed from the Bee post office.

The magazine grew rapidly, and in 1990, bowing to public demand, it became a monthly. Circulation continued to increase, and currently hovers around 30,000. The magazine now generally contains 88 full-color pages and is perfect bound. It is now printed in Michigan and mailed from several post offices throughout the country.

Current content usually includes a &quot;Tip of the Month&quot; article covering New Generation restoration written by Dan Brotzman, a &quot;Youngtimer&quot; article written by Tyler Buchheit, &quot;Shop Talk&quot; by Ron and JoAnn O&#x27;Neill, &quot;Saw It On eBay&quot; by Adam Smith and Benjamin Hain, &quot;Scale Models&quot; by Bill Proft, &quot;What&#x27;s New and Old&quot; by Greg Stephen, &quot;Feature Model&quot; by Benjamin Hain, &quot;Do You Have One of These&quot; by Richard Hain, and &quot;Mr. Thinker&quot;, which is said to be written by &quot;a variety of experts&quot;.

<text>HMAS &quot;Ararat&quot; (K34/M34), named for the city of Ararat, Victoria, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

&quot;Ararat&quot; is the only ship of the &quot;Bathurst&quot; class to carry a pennant number with the flag superior &#x27;K&#x27;: to honour &quot;Flower&quot;-class corvette lead ship , which was sunk in October 1941.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Ararat&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Ararat&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin &amp; Co in Brisbane on 6 July 1942. She was launched on 20 February 1943 by the wife of Arthur Fadden, then leader of the Australian Country Party and the Federal Opposition, and commissioned on 16 June 1943.

&quot;Ararat&quot; entered active service in August 1943 escorting convoys firstly along the east coast of Australia, and later between Queensland and New Guinea. She continued in this role until March 1944, when she was transferred to Langemak, New Guinea for two months, performing escort and patrol duties in the waters of New Guinea and New Britain. During this time, she was the first ship of her class to visit several recently recaptured areas in New Britain.

The corvette was under refit in Melbourne from May until July 1944, and on completion returned to New Guinea. She was transferred to United States Naval command on 11 August 1944, and was used to patrol the forward areas of the Allied offensive. During this time, &quot;Ararat&quot; was involved in the transportation of survivors from sister ship following her collision with United States tanker &quot;York&quot; on 19 October. &quot;Ararat&quot; left US command at the end of 1944, and spent the early part of 1945 operating in the Morotai area. She briefly visited Townsville in March 1945, and in June, the corvette was deployed to Borneo to support Australian troops. &quot;Ararat&quot; returned to Australia on 22 July for refits, and was in dock when the war ended. The corvette&#x27;s wartime service was recognised by the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

&quot;Ararat&quot; was assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla on 22 October 1945, and was involved in clearing mines laid during the war; first in Australian waters, then around New Britain, New Ireland, and the Solomon Islands. This assignment was completed in November 1946, and on 11 April 1947 was decommissioned into reserve.

&quot;Ararat&quot; remained in reserve until 6 January 1961, when she was sold to Burns Philip &amp; Co Ltd of Darwin. She was later sold on to the Fujita Salvage Company of Japan, who used her to perform salvage operations in Darwin Harbour. &quot;Ararat&quot; left Darwin for Japan on 20 July 1961, towing a crane. After arriving in Japan, she was broken up for scrap.

<text>Michelle Sung Wie West (; born October 11, 1989) is an American professional golfer who plays on the LPGA Tour. At age 10, she became the youngest player to qualify for a USGA amateur championship. Wie also became the youngest winner of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links and the youngest to qualify for an LPGA Tour event. She turned professional shortly before her 16th birthday in 2005, accompanied by an enormous amount of publicity and endorsements. She won the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year in 2004 and her first and only major at the 2014 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open.

==Early life, family and education==
Wie was born on October 11, 1989, in Honolulu, Hawaii. She is the only child of immigrant parents from South Korea who came to the United States in the 1980s. Her father, Byung-wook Wie, is a former professor of travel industry management at the University of Hawaii. Her mother, Bo, was South Korea&#x27;s women&#x27;s amateur golf champion in 1985, and competed in a Miss Korea beauty pageant. Her paternal grandfather, Sang-Kyu Wie, a resident of Jangheung, Jeollanam-do, was an emeritus professor at Seoul National University. When she was born, Wie was a dual citizen of South Korea (by &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;) and the United States (by &quot;jus soli&quot;). She renounced her South Korean citizenship in February 2013.

Wie graduated from Punahou School in Honolulu in June 2007. On December 19, 2006, she announced that she would be attending Stanford University, where there are family ties. Her paternal grandfather was a visiting professor, and an aunt and uncle are both graduates. She enrolled in September 2007 as a freshman, but as a professional golfer, Wie was not eligible under NCAA rules to play for Stanford&#x27;s golf team. During her first three years at Stanford, she attended only during the fall and winter quarters, running from late September through mid-March each year. She took leaves of absence during the rest of the year to play professional golf. Wie completed her studies at Stanford in March 2012 with a major in communications. She participated in the university&#x27;s graduation ceremony in June 2012.

==Amateur career (2000–2005)==
Wie began playing golf at the age of four. In 2000, at the age of ten, she became the youngest player ever to qualify for the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links Championship. Eight years later, Wie&#x27;s mark was surpassed by fellow Hawaiian Allisen Corpuz, who qualified when she was five months younger than Wie had been when she set the record. Wie remained the youngest player to advance to match play in this tournament, until 2014 when Lucy Li surpassed her by one week. In 2001, at the age of 11, she won both the Hawaii State Women&#x27;s Stroke Play Championship and the Jennie K. Wilson Women&#x27;s Invitational. The Jennie K. Wilson Women&#x27;s Invitations is the oldest and most prestigious women&#x27;s amateur tournament in Hawaii. She also advanced into match play at the Women&#x27;s U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship.

In 2002, she won the Hawaii State Open Women&#x27;s Division by thirteen shots. She also became the youngest player to qualify for an LPGA event, the Takefuji Classic held in Wie&#x27;s home state of Hawaii. While she went on to miss the cut, her record stood for five more years until it was broken in 2007 by 11-year-old Ariya Jutanugarn.

At the 2003 Kraft Nabisco Championship, Wie became the youngest player to make an LPGA cut. She carded a 66 in the third round, tying the amateur record for a women&#x27;s major championship and qualifying her to play in the final group of the championship. In June 2003, Wie won the Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links tournament, becoming the youngest person ever, male or female, to win a USGA adult event. Later that summer, she made the cut at the US Women&#x27;s Open when she was still just 13, the youngest player ever to do so.

Wie was given a sponsor&#x27;s exemption to the 2004 Sony Open in Hawaii, becoming the fourth, and youngest, female to play a PGA Tour event. Her second round score of 68 was the lowest ever by a woman in a PGA Tour event, though she went on to miss the cut in the tournament. While missing the cut by 1 stroke she bettered the 36 hole score of 47 men including 4 major winners and matched the scores of 15 more men including 3 more major winners. At age 16, 2 years later she shot another round of 68 in the men&#x27;s tour Sony open and bettered the 36 hole score of 18 men including 2 major winners and matched the score of 9 others including 1 major winner. She again played in the LPGA Kraft Nabisco Championship, finishing fourth. As part of the victorious U.S. team, she became the youngest woman ever to play in the Curtis Cup tournament. Wie started her 2005 season by accepting another sponsor&#x27;s invitation to play on the PGA Tour at the Sony Open in Hawaii, where she again missed the cut. She played five more LPGA Tour events that year as well as a PGA Tour event, the John Deere Classic. It was her third outing at a PGA Tour event; she missed the cut by two strokes. She entered qualifying for the U.S. Amateur Public Links and became the first female golfer to qualify for a USGA national men&#x27;s tournament, tying for first place in a 36-hole qualifier for the U.S. Amateur Public Links. Wie made the top 64 in the stroke play rounds to qualify for match play. She lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Clay Ogden.

On October 5, 2005, a week before her 16th birthday, Wie announced that she was turning professional. She signed sponsorship contracts with Nike and Sony reportedly worth more than $10 million per year.

==Professional career==

===Pre-LPGA membership (2005–08)===
When Wie turned professional, she was not a member of any professional tour. LPGA Tour membership age requirements require a golfer to be 18, although some players such as Morgan Pressel and Aree Song have successfully petitioned for an exemption to join at age 17. Wie chose not to request an exemption and was thus only allowed to participate in a limited number of LPGA Tour events when given a sponsor&#x27;s exemption from 2005 until 2008.

Wie played her first professional event in the 2005 LPGA Samsung World Championship, where she was disqualified from a fourth-place finish for signing an incorrect scorecard. A journalist, Michael Bamberger, reported a day after Wie had completed her round that she had illegally dropped the ball closer to the hole than its original lie. Wie would later go on to tally four top-5 finishes on the LPGA tour, including a second at the Evian Masters, a tie for third at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, and a tie for 5th at the LPGA Championship. In the initial Rolex World Golf Rankings in February 2006, Wie was placed third, behind Annika Sörenstam and Paula Creamer, but eventually dropped to 7th, partially due to a limited schedule.

2006 also involved several competitions against male competitors, starting with the PGA Tour Sony Open, where she again missed the cut, this time by four strokes. In May she became the first female medalist in a local qualifier for the men&#x27;s U.S. Open, but did not advance past the New Jersey final stage qualifier. At the PGA John Deere Classic, after a 6-over-par first round, and 10 strokes off the projected cut, midway through round two, she withdrew from the tournament, citing heat exhaustion and tiredness.

Wie also played on both the European and Asian tours. At the SK Telecom Open, a men&#x27;s tournament in South Korea, she became the second woman (after Se Ri Pak) to make the cut on the Asian Tour, and in addition, reportedly received appearance fees exceeding the event&#x27;s total prize money. However, Wie finished the season with several disappointing performances in both male and female tournaments, including the Omega European Masters, PGA 84 Lumber Classic, LPGA Tour Samsung World Championship and the Casio World Open. At this point, Wie had played 14 consecutive rounds of tournament golf without breaking par and had missed the cut in 11 out of 12 tries against men and remained winless against the women.
In 2007, Wie&#x27;s slump continued, including a four-month hiatus, due to injuries to both wrists, a disqualification, and several missed cuts and withdrawals. At the LPGA Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika, she was 14 over par through 16 holes in the first round before withdrawing, citing the injury. The withdrawal was controversial owing to the LPGA Rule of 88, which states that a non-LPGA member shooting a score of 88 or more is forced to withdraw and banned from LPGA co-sponsored events for the rest of the year. Later that year, after finishing one stroke off the lead during the second round of the State Farm Classic, she was disqualified for walking outside of the official tournament area before returning to sign her scorecard. Despite the lack of victories, Wie was ranked #4 in the 2007 Forbes Top 20 Earners Under 25, with an annual earnings of $19 million.

Wie finally became eligible to play full-time on the LPGA Tour in 2009, when she tied for 7th place at the LPGA qualifying tournament in Daytona Beach.

===LPGA membership (2009–2023)===
After passing LPGA Qualifying School in December 2008, Wie declared that she still planned to play in tournaments against men. However, for the second consecutive year, she did not receive a sponsor exemption to play in the Sony Open in Hawaii where she had played four years in a row from 2004 through 2007. Her first tournament as an LPGA member was the season-opening SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she shot 66, 70 to move into a tie with Angela Stanford going into the final round of the tournament. Wie held a three-stroke lead with eight holes remaining, but ended up losing to Stanford by three strokes.

It was reported in early March, 2009, that Wie had left the William Morris Agency, the Hollywood talent agency that had represented her since she turned pro in 2005, and would be signing with sports agency IMG.

At the second major of the year, the LPGA Championship, she finished tied for 23rd, her best finish in a major since 2006. During this tournament she also scored her first recorded hole-in-one as a professional. However, the day after her final round of the LPGA Championship, she failed to qualify for the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open due to a mediocre performance at a sectional qualifying tournament.

In August, at Rich Harvest Farms golf course in Sugar Grove, Illinois, Wie was a captain&#x27;s pick for the United States team in Solheim Cup competition, where she led the American squad to victory with a 3-0-1 performance, the best record on the American team.

On November 15, 2009, Wie won her first professional individual tournament, the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Guadalajara, Mexico, an event on the LPGA Tour limited to the top 36 female golfers in the world as determined by the LPGA money list and Rolex women&#x27;s world golf rankings, posting a score of thirteen under par 275 for a two-stroke margin over fellow American Paula Creamer, and beating Jiyai Shin, Cristie Kerr and Morgan Pressel by two strokes. She then finished second in the Ladies European Tour season-ending Dubai Ladies Masters tournament on December 9–12, 2009, shooting a 15-under-par 273, which put her three shots behind winner In-Kyung Kim.

On August 29, 2010, she posted a three-shot win over a full field at the CN Canadian Women&#x27;s Open, held at St. Charles Country Club in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for her second career professional victory. In her next LPGA event two weeks later, she finished second in the 54-hole P&amp;G NW Arkansas Championship shooting 201 (−12) and losing to Yani Tseng by one stroke after giving up an overnight three-stroke lead.

On April 19, 2014, Wie won her third LPGA Tour event – and her first in the United States – the LPGA Lotte Championship. She was four strokes behind Angela Stanford after 54 holes but shot a 67 to Stanford&#x27;s 73 to win by two strokes.

On June 22, 2014, Wie won her fourth LPGA Tour event and first major championship, the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. She was tied for the lead with Amy Yang after 54 holes at two-under-par. She double-bogeyed the 16th hole to fall within one shot of Stacy Lewis, but birdied the next hole and parred the last hole for a final round par-70 to win by two strokes over Lewis. The win, coupled with her second-place finish in the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, resulted in her winning the inaugural Rolex Annika Major Award. In 2014, she was also named one of ESPNW&#x27;s Impact 25.

Wie will contribute to CBS Sports&#x27; multimedia golf coverage, including the Masters starting in 2020.

In May 2022, Wie West announced that she would be stepping away from the game following the 2022 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links on July 6–9.

==Controversies==
From the beginning of her public career, Michelle Wie was the subject of controversy expressed by fans, media, peers, and other observers.

===Performances in men&#x27;s events===
Despite the publicity her appearances garnered, Wie made only one cut in a men&#x27;s tournament: at the rain-shortened 2006 SK Telecom Open on the Asian Tour. She made no cuts on the PGA Tour. After she missed the cut at the 2007 Sony Open by 14 shots, many sports critics began to doubt whether she ever would.

Wie&#x27;s last appearance in a men&#x27;s professional event was at the 2008 Legends Reno-Tahoe Open, an alternate event on the PGA Tour. Wie shot rounds of 73 and 80, missing the cut by nine strokes.

===Use of exemptions===
Professional golfers, fans, and media critics remarked that allowing Wie to compete in PGA events took away opportunities from more deserving golfers. By late 2007, the criticism over the use of exemptions had extended to Wie&#x27;s participation in women&#x27;s events on the LPGA Tour as well. Wie declined to enter LPGA Tour qualifying school after turning 18 and therefore would have to depend on sponsor exemptions to play in future LPGA tournaments. This decision drew criticism from golf fans and commentators. Such criticism ended after Wie qualified for the LPGA Tour through the 2008 qualifying tournament.

===Caddie turnover===
Early in her career, Wie employed many different caddies after her father stopped being her caddie in 2004. She created controversy when, after finishing tied for 26th at the 2006 British Open, her caddie Greg Johnston was fired over the phone by Wie&#x27;s then-agent Ross Berlin. Johnston said he was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; at the firing and at the fact that &quot;no one named Wie gave me the news.&quot; Wie employed several other professional caddies after Johnston, and also returned to using her father for the remainder of the 2007 season, parting ways with caddie David Clarke after she missed the cut at that year&#x27;s British Open. For much of 2009, Wie used on-loan caddie Patrick Tarrant, who worked for then-injured PGA pro Brett Wetterich; however, at the end of that year but prior to her first LPGA victory, Tarrant recommended that she work with his friend Brendan Woolley, who continued as her exclusive caddie through the 2010 season. Woolley and Wie parted ways in December 2012 after Wie finishing 64th on the LPGA Money List and earning just $158,546 that season. In January 2013, Wie employed Mark Wallington, who caddied for another LPGA professional and European Solheim Cup player, Sophie Gustafson, for three tournaments. Wie then began working with Duncan French, who has continued caddying for her exclusively since.

===2007 wrist injury===
In the first week of February 2007, it was reported that Wie hurt her left wrist in a fall while running. However, little information was provided to the public due to concerns about her privacy. Initially, her public relations staff reported that she would be away from golf for four to six weeks but the injury lasted until the end of May.

In response to the lack of information and prolonged absence, Brittany Lincicome questioned whether Wie and her parents had fabricated the injury in order to give her a reason to take a break from golf. At the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika in May 2007, Wie&#x27;s playing partner, Alena Sharp, questioned Wie&#x27;s withdrawal from the tournament due to wrist injury. However, Wie&#x27;s other playing partner, Janice Moodie, stated that she heard Wie say &quot;Ouch!&quot; after hitting her tee shot, and confirmed &quot;She didn&#x27;t swing as hard from that point on.&quot;

In April 2008, she announced that she had three broken bones in her wrist, despite her agent&#x27;s March 2007 announcement that the wrist was not broken. A 2009 article about Wie&#x27;s injury stated that the original misinformation resulted from Wie and her family failing to &quot;understand or accept the severity of the injury,&quot; and that during the entire 2007 season, Wie played under a great deal of pain, taking four to five pain killers a day.

==Personal life==
In March 2019, Wie announced that she was engaged to Jonnie West, who is Director of Basketball Operations for the Golden State Warriors and the son of NBA legend Jerry West. They married on August 10, 2019, at a private home in Beverly Hills, California. In January 2020, she announced she was pregnant, while expressing interest in eventually returning to competitive golf. On June 19, 2020, she gave birth to a daughter named Makenna. In October 2024, she gave birth to her second child, a son.

==Amateur wins==
*2002 Hawaii State Open, Women&#x27;s Division (67-71-70=208 −8), 13 strokes over Cindy Rarick
*2003 U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur Public Links (Stroke play: 73-71=144 (E). 18-hole matches: 2&amp;1, 2&amp;1, 5&amp;4, 6&amp;5, 5&amp;4. 36-hole final: 1 up over Virada Nirapathpongporn)

Wie won several other Hawaiian local and junior events during the years 2000 through 2002.

Wie played her first professional event while still an amateur in February 2002. Prior to her first win in a professional tournament, on November 15, 2009, she played in a total of 80 professional events as either an amateur or a professional: 
*66 against women: 64 on the LPGA Tour, 1 on the Ladies European Tour, and 1 on the LPGA of Korea Tour. 
*14 against men: 8 on the PGA Tour, 2 on the Japan Golf Tour, 1 on the European Tour, 1 on the Asian Tour, 1 on the Nationwide Tour, and 1 on the Canadian Tour.

<doc id="432417" wikidata="Q5475096" url="?curid=432417" title="Four Corners (Australian TV program)">
<text>Four Corners is an Australian investigative journalism/current affairs documentary television program. Broadcast on ABC TV, it premiered on 19 August 1961 and is the longest-running Australian television program in history. The program is one of only five in Australia inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.

==History==
&quot;Four Corners&quot; is based on the concept of British current affairs program &quot;Panorama&quot;. The program addresses a single issue in depth each week, showing either a locally produced program or a relevant documentary from overseas. The program has won many awards for investigative journalism. Including 23 Logie Awards and 62 Walkley Awards. It has broken high-profile stories. A notable early example of this was the show&#x27;s 1962 exposé on the appalling living conditions endured by many Aboriginal Australians living in rural New South Wales. Founding producer Robert Raymond (1961–62) and his successor Allan Ashbolt (1963) did much to set the ongoing tone of the program.

The program celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2021.

==Notable episodes ==
In sharp contrast to print media, television was the medium for critical accounts of Australia&#x27;s role in the war in Vietnam. &quot;Four Corners&quot;, regardless of modest ratings, favoured the viewpoint of the antiwar and anti-conscription movements.

===1980s===
In 1983, &quot;Four Corners&quot; aired allegations that then New South Wales Premier Neville Wran had tried to influence the magistracy over the dropping of fraud charges against Kevin Humphreys, charged with misappropriation of funds from the Balmain Leagues Club. Wran stood down and the Street Royal Commission, headed by the Chief Justice of NSW, Sir Laurence Street, was set up to inquire into this matter. Street found that the chief magistrate, Murray Farquhar, had used the Premier&#x27;s name to get the Humphreys case dismissed, but exonerated Wran of any involvement. Farquhar was subsequently sent to prison.
Together with articles in &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, a 1987 &quot;Four Corners&quot; story entitled &quot;The Moonlight State&quot; reported on police corruption in Queensland. The subsequent Royal Commission, known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry, found systematic corruption in various levels of government and led to the gaoling of police commissioner Terry Lewis, and the resignation and subsequent criminal trial of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

The program has investigated other cases of corruption in the New South Wales and Victorian police forces. Another report from 1985 helped to reveal that the French secret service had been responsible for the bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;.

===2000s===
A 2006 episode titled &quot;Greenhouse Mafia&quot; exposed the influence of the fossil fuel lobby on Australian climate change policy.

In March 2009, an episode titled &quot;The Dishonouring of Marcus Einfeld&quot; aired; it detailed the events leading up to the conviction and sentencing of an Australian former federal court judge, Marcus Einfeld. Einfeld was convicted on charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice over a speeding ticket.

&quot;The Code of Silence&quot;, which aired 11 May 2009, was an investigative report on the attitudes towards and the treatment of women by National Rugby League players. The report focused primarily on two incidents involving NRL players and women who felt they had been exploited sexually. The mainstream media reported heavily on the subject for a number of weeks following the airing of &quot;The Code of Silence&quot;.

The &quot;Four Corners&quot; website has also won multiple awards, including two Walkley Awards and three AIMIA Awards for its &quot;Broadband Editions&quot; of the programs, which include exclusive interviews, analysis and background information on selected programs.

===2010s===
On 8 March 2010, a program was aired shedding light on ex-members of the controversial Church of Scientology, many speaking of abuse and other forms of inhumane treatment, for example coerced abortions and disconnection. The program was of note due to Church spokesperson Tommy Davis &quot;categorically [denying]&quot; all allegations put forward by ex-members. All interviews were conducted by &quot;Four Corners&quot; journalist Quentin McDermott, and aired the same week that a Parliamentary vote was held for an inquiry into the Church after South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon brought Church abuse to light in November 2009.

On 30 May 2011, the program aired an exposé on cruelty inflicted on Australian cattle exported to Indonesian abattoirs. As a result, there was a major public outcry at the practices and a petition launched by activist group GetUp! received more than 10,000 signatures overnight. This petition has received over 200,000 signatures. The next day, independent MP Andrew Wilkie and independent Senator Nick Xenophon lobbied for an immediate ban on live export to Indonesia, which was backed by the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Joe Ludwig. There was an immediate ban on the abattoirs featured in the graphic &quot;Four Corners&quot; program, which was followed by a six-month ban on all live trade to Indonesia.

In February 2015, &quot;Four Corners&quot; uncovered widespread live baiting in the greyhound racing industry. The investigation revealed the use of live piglets, possums and rabbits to train racing greyhounds in three states. The revelation led to suspensions, resignations, inquiries and condemnation of the practice. The NSW Greyhound racing board was dismissed, and the Queensland Government dissolved all the Racing Queensland boards.

On 28 March 2016, &quot;Four Corners&quot; in an episode called State of Fear: Murder and Money in Malaysia, aired new allegations about the large sums of money that have flowed into the bank accounts of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

On 26 July 2016, &quot;Four Corners&quot; aired graphic footage of systematic physical and verbal abuse of young Indigenous children and teenagers in the Northern Territory at Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. The episode caused outrage from the Australian public, prompting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to announce a Royal Commission into the abuse occurring in the Northern Territory. This episode also resulted in the NT Corrections Minister, John Elferink, being stood down from his position.

On 4 February 2019, &quot;Four Corners&quot; aired a report documenting the status of women&#x27;s rights in Saudi Arabia. The episode also chronicled Rahaf Mohammed who eventually found asylum in Canada, Dina Ali Lasloom who was unsuccessful in her attempt to secure asylum in Australia, and featured prominent activist Mona Eltahawy and Manal al-Sharif.

===2020s===
On 16 March 2020, the program aired a report documenting allegations of war crimes, including execution of war prisoners, by members of Australia&#x27;s Special Air Service Regiment deployed to Afghanistan.

In May 2021, ABC managing director, David Anderson delayed a &quot;Four Corners&quot; story about the relationship between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and a supporter of QAnon, in spite of &quot;(a) lot of detail is already in the public domain&quot;. The story aired on &quot;Four Corners&quot; the following week.

In December 2022, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) criticised the program&#x27;s non impartial reporting, and found two breaches of the ABC’s Code of Practice in a program about the role of Fox News in the US elections. ACMA Chair Nerida O’Loughlin said that &quot;Both audiences and participants are entitled to the full picture. In this case, by omitting information the ABC did not do justice to the story or provide all relevant facts to its audience.”

<doc id="432418" wikidata="Q108615838" url="?curid=432418" title="Traditional music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias">
<text>Northwest Iberian folk music is a traditional highly distinctive folk style, located along Spain&#x27;s north-west Atlantic coast, mostly Galicia and Asturias, that has some similarities with the neighbouring area of Cantabria. The music is characterized by the use of bagpipes.

==History==

It has long been thought that Galician and Asturian music might owe their roots to the ancient Celtic history of the region, in which it was presumed that some of this ancient influence had survived despite the long evolution of the local musical traditions since then, including centuries of Roman and Germanic influences. Whether or not this is the case, much modern commercial Galician and Asturian traditional and folk-rock of recent years has become strongly influenced by modern Irish, Scottish and Welsh &quot;folk&quot; styles. Galicia is nowadays a strong player on the international Celtic folk scene. As a result, elements of the pre-industrial Galician tradition have become integrated into the modern Celtic folk repertoire and style. Many, however, claim that the &quot;Celtic&quot; appellation is merely a marketing tag; the well known Galician bagpipe player Susana Seivane, said &quot;I think [the &#x27;Celtic&#x27; moniker is] a label, in order to sell more. What we make is Galician music&quot;. In any case, due to the Celtic brand, Galician music is the only non- Castilian-speaking music of Spain that has a significant audience beyond the country&#x27;s borders. Some Galicians and Asturians have complained that the &quot;Celtic boom&quot; was the final death blow to once highly distinctive musical traditions.

Celtic culture is known to have extended over a large part of the Iberian Peninsula as early as 600BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, the Roman Empire slowly conquered Iberia, which they called Hispania. The Celtic regions put up a long and fierce struggle to maintain their independence but were eventually subdued. In the centuries that followed, the language of the Romans, Latin, came to gradually supplant nearly all the earlier languages of the peninsula, including all Celtic languages, and is the ancestor of most of the current languages of Spain and Portugal other than Basque, including Galician and Astur-Leonese-Mirandese. The departure of the Romans in the 5th century led to the invasions of Germanic tribes. The Suebi people conquered the northwest but the poor documentation from the period has left their cultural impact on the region unclear. In the 6th century, a final small Celtic influx arrived from Britain; the Britons were granted their own diocese, Britonia, in northern Galicia. Galicia was then taken over by the Visigothic Kingdom when the Suebian kingdom fell apart. Galicia came under the control of the Moors after they defeated the Visigoths in 717 but Moorish rule was little more than a short lived military occupation, although an indirect Moorish musical influence arrived later, through Christian troubadours. Moorish rule ended after two decades when their garrison was driven out by a rebellion in 739. The region was incorporated into the Kingdom of Asturias and, after surviving the assaults of the Moors and Vikings, became the springboard for the Reconquista.

In 810, it was claimed that the remains of Saint James, one of the apostles, had been found at a site which soon became known as Santiago de Compostela. It became Europe&#x27;s premier pilgrimage destination in the Middle Ages. This is assumed to have had a significant effect on the folk culture of the area, as the pilgrims brought with them musical instruments and styles from as far afield as Scandinavia and Hungary.

Like the earlier periods, little is known about musical traditions from this era. Just a few manuscripts from the time are known, such as those by the 13th-century poet and musician Martín Codax, which indicate that some of the distinctive elements of today&#x27;s music, such as the bagpipes and flutes, were common at the time. The Cantigas de Santa Maria, a collection of manuscripts written in old Galician, also show illustrations of people playing bagpipes.

===Revival===

The Galician folk revival drew on early 20th century performers like Perfecto Feijoo, a bagpipe and hurdy-gurdy player. The first commercial recording of Galician music had come in 1904, by a &quot;corale&quot; called Aires d&#x27;a Terra from Pontevedra. The middle of the century saw the rise of Ricardo Portela, who inspired many of the revivalist performers, and played in influential bands like Milladoiro.
During the regime of Francisco Franco, honest displays of folk life were appropriated for politicised spectacles of patriotism, causing a sharp decline in the popularity of the traditional styles in favour of modern music. When Franco&#x27;s regime ended in 1975, Galician and Asturian music experienced a strong revival and recordings flourished. The establishment of the Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta (1977), which helped establish some Galician bands. Aspiring performers began working with bands like Os Areeiras, Os Rosales, Os Campaneiros and Os Irmáns Garceiras, learning the folk styles; others went to the renowned workshop of Antón Corral at the Universidade Popular de Vigo. Some of these musicians then formed their own bands, like Milladoiro.

In the 1980s and 1990s, some Galician and Asturian performers began to win fame within Spain and the international Celtic folk scene. Galician musicians of this period included Uxía, a singer originally with the band Na Lúa, whose 1995 album &quot;Estou vivindo no ceo&quot; and a subsequent collaboration with Sudanese singer Rasha, gained her an international following. The appearance of Fía na Roca, (that means &quot;Spin in the spinning wheel&quot;) was undoubtedly one of the key events of the Galician musical scene in the 90&#x27;s. Fía na Roca was also the name of their debut album released in 1993. Its mixture of tradition and modernity led BBC to choose the music of this album as the soundtrack of the TV program that broadcast the Galician image to Europe in the 1993 Xacobeo Celebration (Santiago de Compostela&#x27;s Holy Year).

It was Carlos Núñez, however, who has done the most to popularize Galician traditions. His 1996 &quot;A irmandade das estrelas&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies and saw major media buzz, partially due to the collaboration with well-known foreign musicians like La Vieja Trova Santiaguera, The Chieftains and Ry Cooder. His follow-up, &quot;Os amores libres&quot;, included more fusions with flamenco, Celtic music (especially Breton) and Berber music. The album received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album.

Other modern Galician bagpipe players include Xosé Manuel Budiño and Susana Seivane. Seivane is especially notable as the first major female player, paving the way for many more women in a previously male-dominated field. Galicia&#x27;s most popular singers are also mostly female, including Uxía, Sonia Lebedynski and Mercedes Peón.

A revival of traditional Asturian music also occurred during this period. Artists such as the popular bagpiper Hevia and music groups such as Llan de cubel and Tejedor helped to bring attention to Asturian folk music both within Asturias itself, and in the wider realm of the &quot;Celtic&quot; and world music scenes. Musicians from Asturias have become increasingly prominent at events such as the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in France.

===Present===
In current times, the most traditional forms of traditional music have their audience, as well as the variations that emerged in the 80s and 90s. In recent years, new trends have also emerged that mix traditional Galician music with electronics. The first hit song that mixes Galician traditional music with electronics dates back to 1978, when the group Son Lalín launched their version of Muiñeira de Chantada, created by the producer Gustavo Ramudo. Nowadays Mercedes Peón and Baiuca stand out.

==Traditional instruments==
Traditional instruments in Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria include the well-known &quot;Gaita&quot;, a kind of bagpipe, as well as an array of percussion and wind instruments.

===Wind instruments===
Folk wind instruments of the area include the Cantabrian &quot;pitu montañés&quot;, a kind of conical-bored shawm with seven holes in the front and one in the back, which is played in a similar manner to the bagpipe chanter. While it was traditionally made in E-flat, the instrument has been revitalized by Antón Corral, who makes them in D. A transverse flute with six holes is called a &quot;requinta&quot;; it is similar to the fife. It is usually in G, or sometimes a high C. 
Traditional Galician wind instruments include the &quot;pito pastoril (galego)&quot;, literally (Galician) shepherd&#x27;s whistle. Despite the similarity in name, this instrument belongs to a different family than the Cantabrian pitu montañés, namely that of the fipple flutes, which also includes the tin whistle and the recorder. The instrument has seen a revival in the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, finding a place in traditional music ensembles. 
Other wind instruments include &quot;chifre&quot;, &quot;ocarina&quot; and the imported clarinet and accordion. Cantabria has a rich dance repertoire for soprano clarinet, also known as &quot;pitu&quot; or &quot;requinto&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;requinta fife&quot;).

===String instruments===
Plucked stringed instruments are common throughout Spain and Portugal, but they were proscribed in Galician or Asturian commercial folk music until recent years. Modern guitarists like Xesús Pimentel often use strong flamenco influences in their sound. The violin has a long tradition in the area, common since the early 20th century, when blind fiddlers traveled to fairs to play traditional and self-composed songs, as well as pieces by composers like Sarasate. The hurdy gurdy (&quot;zanfona&quot;) has been played in the area for many centuries, but had mostly died out by the middle of the 20th century before being revived by Faustino Santalices, Xosé Lois Rivas and the like. Though the instrument is now more closely associated with French music, the first recordings of the hurdy gurdy were by Galician Perfecto Feijoo in 1904. Harps had been used in the Middle Ages, but were not revived until the 1970s, when Emilio Cao used the instrument to accompany his compositions. Modern harpists have been encouraged by the use of the Celtic harp in Scotland, Ireland and Brittany, and include Quico Comesaña and Rodrigo Romaní.

===Percussion===
Percussion instruments include the &quot;tamboril&quot;, a snare drum that hangs from the player&#x27;s belt and is played with two sticks. It is small, natural-skinned and features snares made usually of gut. Along with the &quot;bombo&quot;, a bass drum played with one stick, the &quot;tamboril&quot; is typically found as accompaniment to bagpipes. The &quot;pandeiro&quot; (Asturian: &quot;panderu&quot;) is a double-faced, square frame drum, similar to the Portuguese and Castilian &quot;adufe&quot;. It usually contains some beans that rattle inside. It is often played alongside the &quot;pandeireta&quot;, a large tambourine, in small groups or by a single female singer. A pair of &quot;vieira&quot; shells (&quot;cunchas&quot;) are rubbed together, and accompany dancing. &quot;Tarrañolas&quot; (Asturian and Spanish: &quot;tejoletas&quot;) are strips of wood held between the fingers. &quot;Charrasco&quot; consists of a pole with a frame on the top adorned with tambourine rattles; it is played by rubbing a string along the pole with a stick. Other percussion instruments are &quot;canaveira&quot; and &quot;carraca&quot;.

===Gaita===
The term &quot;gaita&quot; may refer to a variety of different pipes, shawms, recorders, flutes and clarinets in different areas of Spain and Portugal, but in Galicia it refers to bagpipes, with the bag inflated with bellows or by a blowpipe. Outside of Galicia and Asturias, bagpipes are also traditionally played in other parts of Spain, including Aragon, Catalonia, León, Majorca, Zamora and in Portugal in Minho, Trás-os-Montes and Estremadura.

Records show that the gaita was already common in the 13th century but suffered a decline in popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries until the 19th century renaissance of the instrument. The early 20th century saw another decline. Then, beginning in about the 1970s, a roots revival heralded another rebirth. The folk revival may have peaked in the late 1990s, with the release of acclaimed albums by Galician Carlos Núñez (&quot;A Irmandade Das Estrelas&quot;) and Asturian Hevia (&quot;Tierra De Nadie&quot;). Both releases broke records, and &quot;Tierra De Nadie&quot; sold more than a million copies.

In the 18th century, an important teaching school was opened in Asturias, created by José Remis Vega. Musicians of that era included the legendary Ramón García Tuero, while the 20th century produced performers like Vega&#x27;s son, José Remis Ovalle and José Antonio García Suárez. The best-known modern Asturian player is Hevia, whose 1998 &quot;Tierra De Nadie&quot; was a landmark recording that smashes record sales and became the darling of the Spanish music media. Other modern performers and bands include Tejedor and Xuacu Amieva.

Traditional use include both solo performances or with a snare-drum known as &quot;tamboril&quot; (a wooden natural-skinned drum with gut snares), and the &quot;bombo&quot;, a bass drum. The Council of Ourense sponsors a bagpipe band, the Real Banda de Gaitas da Excma. Deputación de Ourense (Royal Pipe Band of the Council of Ourense). The Royal Pipe Band, founded by José Lois Foxo, uses blowpipe bagpipes in B flat, bagpipes with bellows tuned in F sharp, and a percussion section of snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, tambourines and tarrañolas. Its repertoire covers both traditional Galician music as well as music from other Celtic countries. It is the source of some controversy in Galacian music, as the blowpipe bagpipes employed by the band are felt by critics to be too similar to Highland bagpipes rather than traditional Galacian giatas. The drums are modern and not in a Galacian tradition, and the band marches military-style in parades which is also not a tradition in Galacian gaita music.

Galician bagpipes come in three main varieties, though there are exceptions and unique instruments. These include the &quot;tumbal&quot; (B-flat), &quot;grileira&quot; (D) and &quot;redonda&quot; (C). Asturian bagpipes are usually played along with a &quot;tambor&quot; (snare drum). Asturian bagpipes usually have only one drone and follow a different fingering pattern.

====Description====
The player inflates the bag using his mouth through a tube fitted with a non-return valve. Air is driven into the chanter (; Asturian: &quot;punteru&quot;) with the left arm controlling the pressure inside the bag. The chanter has a double reed similar to a shawm or oboe, and a conical bore with seven finger-holes on the front. The bass drone (&quot;ronco&quot; or &quot;roncón&quot;) is situated on the player&#x27;s left shoulder and is pitched two octaves below the key note of the chanter; it has a single reed. Some bagpipes have up to two more drones, including the &quot;ronquillo&quot; or &quot;ronquilla&quot;, which sticks out from the bag and plays an octave above the &quot;ronco&quot;, or the smaller &quot;chillón&quot;. This two extra drones are placed by the right arm of the player.

The finger-holes include three for the left hand and four for the right, as well as one at the back for the left thumb. The chanter&#x27;s tonic is played with the top six holes and the thumb hole covered by fingers. Starting at the bottom and (in the Galician fingering pattern) progressively opening holes creates the diatonic scale. Using techniques like cross-fingering and half-holding, the chromatic scale can be created. With extra pressure on the bag, the reed can be played in a second octave, thus giving range of an octave and a half from tonic to top note. It is also possible to close the tone hole with the little finger of the right hand, thus creating a semitone below the tonic.

====Songs====
Tunes using the gaita are usually songs, with the voice either accompanying the instrumentation or taking turns with it.

The most common type is the &quot;muiñeira&quot;, found in both Asturias and Galicia, a sprightly 6/8 rhythm. Other 6/8 Galician tunes use different steps; they include the &quot;carballesa&quot;, &quot;ribeirana&quot;, &quot;redonda&quot;, &quot;chouteira&quot; and &quot;contrapaso&quot;.

The asturian &quot;alborada&quot; usually-instrumental tune, most often in 2/4, though sometimes 3/4, and is characterized by a series of descending turning phrases. It is used to begin a day&#x27;s celebrations, and is played at sunrise. Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov included three asturian movements (two &quot;Alboradas&quot; and one &quot;Fandango Asturiano&quot;) in his famous orchestral work &quot;Capriccio espagnol&quot;, Op. 34, written in 1887.

The &quot;foliada&quot; is a joyful 3/4 jota-type song, often played at &quot;romerías&quot; (community gatherings at a local shrine).

==Songs==
The oldest and best-known form of Galician music is the &quot;alalá&quot;, a form of chanting that has been associated with Galician nationalism. They share characteristics with those of Castile as well as the Celtic nations. Their origin is shrouded in mystery, with some scholars asserting Gregorian chants as a major source, while others fancily point to Greek or Phoenician rowing songs called &quot;alelohuías&quot;.

&quot;Alalás&quot; are , and based on a single, short theme that repeats the melody, separated by instrumental bagpipes or a cappella interludes. Melodies are based on a continuous drone and are almost always diatonic. Over time, alalas have adapted to include choral polyphony which has added harmony and rhythms (most typically in 2/4 or 3/4 time) to the tradition. A distinct feature of &quot;alalas&quot; is that the first cadence is also the last. They end in an enlarged coda that fades into a sustained and undefined sound. In contrast to the typically slow &quot;alalá&quot; there are also swift songs called &quot;pandeirada&quot;.

Marching tunes (Galician: &quot;ruadas&quot;, Asturian: &quot;pasucáis&quot;, Spanish: &quot;pasacalles&quot;) are also known, as well as the local variation of &quot;jota&quot;.

Other Asturian dances include &quot;saltón&quot;, &quot;diana&quot;, &quot;respingu&quot;, &quot;pericote&quot;, &quot;fandango&quot;, &quot;pasodoble&quot;, &quot;marcha procesional&quot;, &quot;rebudixu&quot;, &quot;corri-corri&quot;, &quot;baile de los pollos&quot;, &quot;giraldilla&quot; and &quot;xiringüelu&quot;.

==Dances==
&quot;Baile&quot; is the term for social dances, though there are also weapon dances like &quot;danzas de palillos&quot; (stick dances), &quot;danzas de espadas&quot; (sword dances) and &quot;danzas de arcillos&quot; (dances with decorated arches) a hallmark of Cantabrian folk tradition. Other popular dance songs in the area include the &quot;jota&quot;, &quot;pasacorredoiras&quot; (&quot;pasacalles&quot;, Asturian: &quot;pasucáis&quot;), and the imported &quot;fandango&quot;, &quot;mazurka&quot;, polka, rumba and &quot;pasodoble&quot;.

<text>Steam frigates (including screw frigates) and the smaller steam corvettes, [[Screw sloop|steam sloops]], steam gunboats and steam schooners, were steam-powered warships that were not meant to stand in the line of battle. The first such ships were paddle steamers. Later on the invention of screw propulsion enabled construction of screw-powered versions of the traditional frigates, corvettes, sloops and gunboats.

==Evolution==
===First steam warships===
The first small vessel that can be considered a steam warship was the &quot;Demologos&quot;, which was launched in 1815 for the United States Navy. From the early 1820s, the British Navy began building a number of small steam warships including the armed tugs and , and by the 1830s the navies of America, Russia and France were experimenting with steam-powered warships. Hellenic sloop-of-war &quot;Kartería&quot; (Καρτερία; Greek for &quot;Perseverance&quot;) was the first steam-powered warship to be used in combat operations in history. It was built in 1825 in an English shipyard for the revolutionary Hellenic Navy during the Greek War of Independence, on the order of Capt Frank Abney Hastings, a former Royal Navy officer who had volunteered his services to the Hellenic Navy.

===Frigate classification===
The frigate and corvette were &#x27;ships&#x27;. For a vessel to be called a &#x27;ship&#x27; it had to have full rigging, i.e. square rigs on three masts. If it had only fore-and-aft rig on the mizzen mast, it was not a ship. Ships were classified as: ships of the line, frigates and corvettes.

The upper limit for a ship to be still considered a frigate was that it had only one covered gun deck. If a ship had two covered gun decks, it was no longer a frigate, but a ship of the line. A confusing circumstance arose when in the early nineteenth century the forecastle and quarterdecks of most big ships were joined to become a complete flush deck above. These ships continued to be frigates, e.g .

The lower limit for a ship to still be considered a frigate was that its gun deck was covered. If a ship had only a single open gun deck it was considered to be &#x27;corvette build&#x27;. If a ship had a single &quot;covered&quot; gun deck, it was at least a frigate.

In general a frigate was commanded by a captain and a corvette by a lieutenant.

==Paddle frigates==
This first generation of steam warships were &quot;paddle warships&quot; (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other). They used paddlewheels mounted on either side or in the center. Paddle steamers were severely limited in the armaments they could mount. Paddle wheel propulsion also had very serious effects on sailing quality. The placement of the machinery and wheels in the middle of the ship conflicted with having the main mast there, and so the sail plan of paddle frigates was less than ideal. Another characteristic that slowed down these vessels was that the paddle wheels would rotate in the water freely when the ship was sailing.

The armament of paddle frigates compared badly with their sail-only counterparts. Paddle frigates could not have a traditional full broadside because of the space taken by the machinery and the paddle wheels. The weight of the machinery and coal these ships carried was a perhaps even more serious problem. It meant that the designers had to limit the weight of all other &#x27;cargo&#x27;, including artillery. Therefore the armament of steam vessels had to follow a different concept: Because of their ability to move against the wind they could be assumed to be able to choose their distance to sail-only ships. Under these circumstances the very heavy guns that were deemed to fire too slowly for close-quarters combat did become useful because they had a high effective range. Meanwhile, the development of heavy shell guns like the ML 8-inch shell gun provided a long range weapon that could sink a ship with a single hit. The only means to counter it was to develop heavier solid shot cannon that had an even higher effective range. All this generally led to equipping early steamers with only a few very heavy guns, both shell guns and solid shot guns. These were often mounted on pivots and slides.

Paddle frigates were used extensively during the Opium Wars, Mexican–American War, Crimean War and American Civil War. An unintended quality was that the lack of broadside batteries gave them very spacious decks. Combined with being immune to contrary winds, this made them ideal for large scale troop transport. By 1870 most had been scrapped or sold into civilian service.

===Royal Navy===
By 1840 the Royal Navy had commissioned two ships that had been designed as steam paddle frigates. and the slightly larger had both been constructed to have a full battery on their gun deck, next to carrying guns on their upper decks. However, &quot;Gorgon&quot; was so deep in the water that her gun ports had to be shut permanently. &quot;Cyclops&quot; had been designed to carry 16 32-pounders on the main deck, but these could not be fitted. Both ships therefore failed to become true frigates, but were nevertheless very successful. The &quot;Cyclops&quot; would be taken as a model to build six more of these steam frigates (&quot;Vulture&quot;, &quot;Firebrand&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Sampson&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot;). On 31 May 1844 the Admiralty then officially adopted the term &#x27;Steam frigate&#x27;. All these ships became steam (paddle) frigates of the second class, except for &quot;Gorgon&quot;, which became a sloop.

The rating of &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a &#x27;steam frigate&#x27; was surprising: she was rigged as a brig (with only two masts), and carried all her guns on the upper deck Other aspects did explain this classification. The &quot;Cyclops&quot; was commanded by a captain and had at least been planned to have a &#x27;complete&#x27; covered gun deck. The crew of 175 men was a &quot;reduced&quot; crew. By counting 13 men for every two 32-pounders, the designed complement would be 175 + (8*13) = 284 men, almost matching that of a fifth rate frigate. Another reason to rate the Cyclops as a frigate was that with her size of 1,190 bm tons, she was of the same size as the fifth rate frigates like those of the Seringapatam-class frigate of 1,150 bm tons. As the RN lacked a corvette category, the alternative would have been to rate her as a sloop, but even ship-rigged sloops did not get near her size. When the RN started to use the designation corvette, the Cyclops and her six near sisters were re-classified as corvettes in the 1850s.

In 1844 the Admiralty also discerned steam frigates of the first class, these steam frigates had guns on two decks. The steam frigates of the &#x27;first class&#x27; were comparable to regular fourth rate sailing frigates in terms of size, and got near them in armament. The first of these was the paddle steamer commissioned in 1843. She had been the sailing fifth rate frigate &quot;Penelope&quot; of 1829. In 1842 she was lengthened by 63 feet, and was fitted with the largest naval steam engines yet seen, generating nearly 700 horsepower. She had a 330 men crew, and was armed with 10 68-pounders on the main deck, and on the forecastle and quarterdeck: two 85 cwt pivot guns, 10 42-pounders carronades and 4 howitzers.

&quot;Penelope&quot; was followed by even bigger ships like and . Other steam frigates first class, like were a bit smaller. Only five first class steam paddle frigates would be built by the Royal Navy. The RN also built some more steam frigates of the second class, surprisingly with guns on two decks.

===United States Navy===
The United States Navy likewise started with a general &#x27;steamer&#x27; class. In 1842 it consisted of of 4 guns, commissioned in 1837, and (with a horizontal submerged paddle). &quot;Union&quot; was not yet armed, but would later also have 4 guns. was a smaller craft that would later be armed with 2 guns. By then the U.S. Navy already had the screw corvette under construction.

The first steam frigates of the United States were and . These were two very big steam paddle frigates commissioned in 1841 and 1842. They each displaced 3,220t and had 10 big Paixhans guns. By 1850 the U.S. paddle steamers were divided into classes. &quot;Mississippi&quot; was designated a steam frigate, and so were and , each with 9 heavy guns, and and each with 6 heavy guns. The next class were the &#x27;steamers first class&#x27;, containing &quot;Fulton&quot;, and . Seven other steamers were &#x27;less than first class&#x27;

===Russian Navy===
The Russian Tsarist Navy also had a sizable fleet of paddle steam frigates. The first of these were imported from America, but by the time of the Crimean War the Russians were producing their own steamships. The 1841 steam frigate &quot;Kamchatka&quot; had 16 guns on two decks, and was therefore comparable to the big frigates of the English and American navies. See also List of Russian steam frigates.

===French Navy===
The first useful steam vessel of the French Navy was &quot;Sphinx&quot; of 160 hp and 913t displacement. She was used in the invasion of Algiers in 1830. She was not very useful as a warship, but she was very useful for maintaining communications with Algeria. The subsequent campaign caused a huge demand for frequent and reliable communication with Algeria, and so about two dozen ships were built to the model of &quot;Sphinx&quot;. The side effect was a stagnation in French steam vessel engineering. Continuing the &quot;Sphinx&quot; type meant that France was not developing something that resembled a steam frigate.

Later on, the French state wanted to establish packet boat lines to New York, the West Indies and Brazil. The French navy wanted to have big steam frigates with heavy artillery. In 1840 these ideas were combined in a law that granted a credit of 28,400,000 francs for the construction of 14 ships of 450 hp, and 4 of 220 hp. The frigates built for this service soon proved to be no match for the ships of the Cunard Line. A project that lent four of them to a commercial company soon failed. &quot;Gomer&quot; was the first of these large frigates, and created quite a sensation. She was 70.5 m long between perpendiculars, had a beam of 12.7 m and displaced about 2,800 t. On the trial run she was armed with 20 30-pounders on the main deck, and on the upper deck 2 22 cm and 2 16 cm, and had a complement of 300 men. However, in actual use this artillery proved to be way more than what &quot;Gomer&quot; could handle. It had to be reduced to 2 80s and 6 30s. It meant that &quot;Gomer&quot; had failed as a steam frigate. The same could be said of her (near) sisters of 450 hp, &quot;Asmodéee&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;Infernal&quot;.

==Screw frigates==
Screw warships were built with steam engines and screw propellers for propulsion. The first functional propeller, a shortened version of the Archimedes&#x27; screw, was invented independently by Francis Pettit Smith and John Ericsson in 1835. The technology of propeller or &#x27;screw&#x27; propulsion was proven by 1845 after the Royal Navy evaluated the performance of Smith&#x27;s seagoing steamship in comparison with their own fleet of paddle steamers. The basic fighting capabilities of the screw warship were almost as good as those of the traditional sailing ship. Apart from spending weight on machinery and coal, the screw ship retained the full broadside battery lay-out. It therefore had a nearly as powerful armament as a sail-only ship. Unlike the paddle ship it had no vulnerable paddle-boxes. The ability to pick a fight or to evade a fight was what made the screw frigate superior to any sail-only ship.

The screw frigate retained a full sail-plan, and this was not only due to conservatism. The primary reason was a lack of coal supplies around the globe. This was an especially important consideration for frigates, which often operated independently on the far side of the world. The insufficient reliability of early steam engines was also a reason to maintain at least some sails. An often overlooked reason to have sails was the cost of coal. In 1848 the sail frigate was estimated to cost 64 GBP daily to operate. , of the same weight of armament, was estimated to cost 88 GBP daily. But, the latter was without the cost of coal, estimated at 4 pounds 5 shillings per hour of steaming.

The &#x27;screw frigates&#x27;, built first of wood and later of wrought iron, continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century.

By the late 1840s many navies were building screw-driven warships or converting sailing ships to include screw propulsion. In 1852 the French navy commissioned the &quot;Napoleon&quot;, the first screw driven battleship. With that all sailing warships had gotten a screw driven equivalent.

===Royal Navy===
By the time that the Royal Navy launched its first screw frigate, , it already had two screw sloops in commission. The 9 gun sloop , launched in 1843, was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and featured an advanced two-bladed propeller that influenced the design of his later passenger steamer . &quot;Amphion&quot; had 28 32-pounders and 8 heavier guns. The size and armament of British wooden screw frigates then rapidly increased. of 1853 was 65 m long, displaced 3,125 t, had twenty-eight 8 inch 65 cwt shell guns and twenty-two 32-pounders. The RN&#x27;s first battleship designed for steam propulsion was . She was 70 m long, displaced 4,614 t, and had thirty-four 8-inch 65 cwt and fifty-six 32-pounders. In 1852–1853, the distinction between battleship and frigate was still a matter of size and number of gun decks.

The improved screw propeller invented by Brunel also enabled the Victorian Royal Navy to extend the service life of obsolete sail-powered ships of the line. and , first commissioned during the War of 1812, were fitted with steam locomotive boilers in 1845 for the Franklin expedition. The paddle sloop was later rebuilt with a propeller for service in the Crimean War.

In the late 1850s the screw frigate began to take a different form than traditional ships of the line. The RN&#x27;s last battleship, the 91 gun laid down in 1858, was 75 m long and displaced 5,700 t. The screw frigate was much smaller at 3,915 t, but nevertheless much longer at 87 m. This development of much longer frigates culminated in of 1858. &quot;Mersey&quot; had 40 heavy shell guns, reached an overall length of over 100 m and displaced 5,463 t. A wooden construction proved to be too weak for a ship of this length. The next steps were frigates with an iron or composite hull: the armored frigate and the unarmored frigate.

===French Navy===
The &quot;Pomone&quot; of 1842 was the first French screw frigate. She was 52 m long, 13.5 m wide, and had a slightly changed sail plan of a 46 gun frigate. She had 18 30-pounders on the gun deck, and 8 80-pounders and 8 other guns on the upper decks. The engine of the &quot;Pomone&quot; was 220 hp, giving her a speed of 7.5 knots. Using both sail and engine she could make 10.5 kn. Sailing before the wind, however she reached 12 kn without engines.

The French navy next built the &quot;L&#x27;Isly&quot;, converted a number of sailing frigates, and built a range of successful corvettes. In 1852 a program for a number of first rate frigates was started. The &quot;Impératrice Eugénie&quot; class of 5 ships was built according to a design by Henri Dupuy de Lôme. Georges Baptiste François Allix designed the &quot;Souveraine&quot;. On average these ships displaced 3,800 t and reached 12 kn on trials. In 1857 the French government decided to have 6 big and 14 smaller frigates.

==Armored frigates==
From 1859, armor was added to ships based on existing frigate and ship of the line designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase &#x27;armoured frigate&#x27; remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad. For a time, they were the most powerful type of vessel afloat.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the term &#x27;frigate&#x27; fell out of use. Armoured vessels were designated as either &#x27;battleships&#x27; or &#x27;armoured cruisers&#x27;, while unarmoured vessels including frigates and sloops were classified as &#x27;unprotected cruisers&#x27;.

==Survivors==
The only surviving screw frigate is the Danish &quot;Jylland&quot;.

The steam sloop HMS &quot;Gannet &quot; spent many years as a training ship and is now preserved at Chatham.

The Dutch gunvessel HNLMS &quot;Bonaire&quot; is currently undergoing restoration as a museum ship.

ARA &quot;Uruguay&quot; of the Argentinian navy is the last surviving steam and sail corvette.

A replica of the Japanese frigate &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot; was built as a museum ship in 1990 after the original wreck was salvaged for preservation.

<doc id="432420" wikidata="Q15672" url="?curid=432420" title="Four Corners">
<text>Four Corners is a region of the Southwestern United States consisting of the southwestern corner of Colorado, southeastern corner of Utah, northeastern corner of Arizona, and northwestern corner of New Mexico. Most of the Four Corners region belongs to semi-autonomous Native American nations, the largest of which is the Navajo Nation, followed by Hopi, Ute, and Zuni tribal reserves and nations. The Four Corners region is part of a larger region known as the Colorado Plateau and is mostly rural, rugged, and arid.

The Four Corners area is named after the quadripoint at the intersection of approximately 37° north latitude with 109° 03′ west longitude, where the boundaries of the four states meet, and is marked by the Four Corners Monument. It is the only location in the United States where four states meet. In addition to the monument, commonly visited areas within Four Corners include Monument Valley, Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Canyon, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The most populous city in the Four Corners region is Farmington, New Mexico, followed by Durango, Colorado.

==History==
The United States acquired the four corners region from Mexico after the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. In 1863 Congress created the Arizona Territory from the western part of New Mexico Territory. The boundary was legally defined as a line running due south from the southwest corner of Colorado Territory, which had been created in 1861. This was an unusual act of Congress, which almost always defined the boundaries of new territories as lines of latitude or longitude, or following rivers, but seldom as extensions of other boundaries.

By defining one boundary as starting at the corner of another, Congress ensured the eventual creation of four states meeting at a point, regardless of the inevitable errors of boundary surveying. The area was first surveyed by the U.S. Government in 1868 as part of an effort to make Colorado Territory into a state, the first of the Four Corners states formed. While the US Congress in 1863 intended the corners of Colorado to be placed at the intersections of lines of specific latitude and longitude, due to a &quot;standard&quot; survey error of the time, the originally surveyed location of the &quot;Four Corners&quot; point, along with the corresponding survey marker, was unintentionally placed by its initial surveyor east of the intended location.

In 1925, some 57 years after Congress had first attempted to specify the spot, the problems surrounding the originally misplaced marker were brought up before the US Supreme Court. In order to amicably remedy this original surveying error, the US Supreme Court then redefined the point of the Four Corners, officially moving the Four Corners point roughly east, to where the original survey had first held it to be all along, and where it remains to this day, duly marked. This initial survey error has resulted in some longstanding misunderstandings about the correct location of the Four Corners marker, some of which remain to this day. 

The first Navajo tribal government was established in 1923 to regulate an increasing number of oil exploration activities on Navajo land in the Four Corners area.

==Geography==
The Four Corners Monument is located at .

The Four Corners is part of the high Colorado Plateau. This makes it a center for weather systems, which stabilize on the plateau then proceed eastward through Colorado and into the central states. This weather system creates snow- and rainfall over the central United States.

Federally protected areas in the Four Corners area include Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, Mesa Verde National Park, and Canyons of the Ancients National Monument. Mountain Ranges in the Four Corners include Sleeping Ute Mountains, Abajo Mountains, and the Chuska Mountains.

==Politics==
Six governments have jurisdictional boundaries at the Four Corners Monument: the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, as well as the tribal governments of the Navajo Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The Four Corners Monument itself is administered by the Navajo Nation Department of Parks and Recreation. Other tribal nations within the Four Corners region include the Hopi and other Ute. The Four Corners is home to the capital of the Navajo tribal government at Window Rock, Arizona. The Ute Mountain Ute tribal headquarters are located at Towaoc, Colorado. The US federal government also has a large presence in the area, particularly the Department of the Interior with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Agriculture with the Forest Service.

==Cities==
The Four Corners region is mostly rural. The economic hub, largest city, and only metropolitan area in the region is Farmington, New Mexico. The populated settlement closest to the center of Four Corners is Teec Nos Pos, Arizona. Other cities in the region include Cortez and Durango in Colorado; Monticello and Blanding in Utah; Kayenta and Chinle in Arizona; and Shiprock, Aztec, and Bloomfield in New Mexico.

== Counties ==

* San Juan County, New Mexico
* Montezuma County, Colorado
* San Juan County, Utah
* Apache County, Arizona

==Transportation==
Air service is available via the Durango-La Plata County Airport in Durango, Colorado, Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington, New Mexico, and Cortez Municipal Airport in Cortez, Colorado. Interstate 40 passes along the southern edge of the Four Corners region. The primary U.S. Highways that directly serve the Four Corners include U.S. Route 64, U.S. Route 160 (which serves the Four Corners Monument itself), U.S. Route 163, U.S. Route 191, U.S. Route 491 (previously U.S. Route 666), and U.S. Route 550.

The main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, now operated by the BNSF Railway, passes along the southern edge of Four Corners. The area is home to remnants of through railroads that are now heritage railways. These include the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. The Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad, which connects a power plant with a coal mine near Kayenta, comes near the Four Corners.

==Helium==

The Four Corners region was one of the first locations in the United States in which helium was extracted, and the area is increasingly important as a source of helium supply, with the region being noted for its abundance of high-grade &#x27;green&#x27; helium.

The most notable helium field in the region is Arizona&#x27;s Holbrook basin.

<text>Emily &quot;Mickey&quot; Hahn ( ( pronunciation in Shanghainese /項ɦɑ͂ 美me麗li/), January 14, 1905 – February 18, 1997) was an American journalist and writer. Considered an early feminist and called &quot;a forgotten American literary treasure&quot; by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, she was the author of over 50 books and more than 200 articles and short stories.

Her novels in the 20th century played a significant role in opening up Asia and Africa to the west. Her extensive travels throughout her life and her love of animals influenced much of her writing. She was the first woman to receive a degree in Mining Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, then after living in Florence and London in the mid-1920s, she traveled to the Belgian Congo and hiked across Central Africa in the 1930s. In 1935 she traveled to Shanghai, where she taught English for three years and became involved with prominent figures, such as The Soong Sisters and the Chinese poet, Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau).

== Early life ==
Emily Hahn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 14, 1905, as one of the six children of Isaac Newton Hahn, a dry goods salesman, and Hannah (Schoen) Hahn, a free-spirited suffragette. Her family is of German-Jewish origin. Affectionately nicknamed &quot;Mickey&quot; by her mother after a cartoon comic strip character of the day named Mickey Dooley, she was known by this nickname to close friends and family. In her second year of high school, she moved with her family to Chicago, Illinois.

With a love for reading and writing, she initially enrolled in a general arts program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but decided to change her course of study to mining engineering after being prevented from enrolling in a chemistry class predominately taken by engineering students. In her memoir, &quot;No Hurry to Get Home&quot;, she describes how the mining engineering program had never had a female enroll. After being told by a Professor in her mining engineering program that &quot;The female mind is incapable of grasping mechanics or higher mathematics or any of the fundamentals of mining taught&quot; in engineering, she was determined to become a mining engineer. Despite the coolness of the administration and her male classmates, in 1926 she was the first woman to receive a degree in Mining Engineering at the University. Her academic accomplishments were a testament to her intelligence and persistence so that her lab partner grudgingly admitted, &quot;You ain&#x27;t so dumb!&quot;

In 1924, prior to graduating from mining engineering school, she traveled across the United States in a Model T-Ford dressed as a man with her friend, Dorothy Raper. During her drive across New Mexico, she wrote about her travel experiences to her brother-in-law, who, unbeknownst to her, forwarded the letters she wrote to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. This jump-started her early career as a writer. Hahn wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1929 to 1996.

In 1930 she traveled to the Belgian Congo, where she worked for the Red Cross, and lived with a pygmy tribe for two years, before crossing Central Africa alone on foot.

Her first book, &quot;Seductio ad Absurdum: The Principles and Practices of Seduction -- A Beginner&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was published in 1930. It was a tongue-in-cheek exploration of how men court women. Maxim Lieber was her literary agent, 1930-1931.

== China and Hong Kong ==
Her years in Shanghai, China (from 1935 to the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941) were the most tumultuous of her life. There she became involved with prominent Shanghai figures, such as the wealthy Sir Victor Sassoon, and was in the habit of taking her pet gibbon, Mr. Mills, with her to dinner parties, dressed in a diaper and a small dinner jacket.

Supporting herself as a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, she lived in an apartment in Shanghai&#x27;s red light district, and became romantically involved with the Chinese poet and publisher Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau). He gave her the &quot;entrée&quot; that enabled her to write a biography of the famous Soong sisters, one of whom was married to Sun Yat-sen and another to Chiang Kai-shek.

Hahn frequently visited Zau&#x27;s house, which was highly unconventional for a Western woman in the 1930s. The Treaty of the Bogue was in full effect, and Shanghai was a city divided by Chinese and Westerners at the time. Zau introduced her to the practice of smoking opium, to which she became addicted. She later wrote, &quot;Though I had always wanted to be an opium addict, I can&#x27;t claim that as the reason I went to China.&quot;

After moving to Hong Kong, she began an affair with Charles Boxer, the local head of British army intelligence. According to a December 1944 &quot;Time&quot; article, Hahn &quot;decided that she needed the steadying influence of a baby, but doubted if she could have one. &#x27;Nonsense!&#x27; said the unhappily-married Major Charles Boxer, &#x27;I&#x27;ll let you have one!&#x27; Carola Militia Boxer was born in Hong Kong on October 17, 1941&quot;.

When the Japanese marched into Hong Kong a few weeks later Boxer was imprisoned in a POW camp, and Hahn was brought in for questioning. &quot;Why?&quot; screamed the Japanese Chief of Gendarmes, &quot;why ... you have baby with Major Boxer?&quot; &quot;Because I&#x27;m a bad girl,&quot; she quipped. Fortunately for her, the Japanese respected Boxer&#x27;s record of wily diplomacy. She was not interned since she had stated she was legally married to Shao Xunmei on a document, and therefore the Japanese treated her as, in the words of Taras Grescoe of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;an honorary Asian&quot;. Hahn stated that Shao&#x27;s wife approved of the document since it was a possible method of saving his press and that Shao had not been married &quot;according to foreign law&quot;.

As Hahn recounted in her book &quot;China to Me&quot; (1944), she was forced to give Japanese officials English lessons in return for food, and once slapped the Japanese Chief of Intelligence in the face. He came back to see her the day before she was repatriated in 1943 and slapped her back. 
&quot;China to Me&quot; was an instant hit with the public. According to Roger Angell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Hahn &quot;was, in truth, something rare: a woman deeply, almost domestically, at home in the world. Driven by curiosity and energy, she went there and did that, and then wrote about it without fuss.&quot;

==England, and return to the US==
In 1945 she married Boxer who, during the time he was interned by the Japanese, had been reported by American news media to have been beheaded; their reunion (their love story had been reported faithfully in Hahn&#x27;s published letters) made headlines throughout the United States. They settled in Dorset, England at &quot;Conygar&quot;, the estate Boxer had inherited, and in 1948 had a second daughter, Amanda Boxer (now a stage and television actress in London).

Finding family life too constraining, however, in 1950 Hahn took an apartment in New York, and from then on visited her husband and children in England only occasionally. She continued to write articles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as well as biographies of Leonardo da Vinci, Aphra Behn, James Brooke, Fanny Burney, Chiang Kai-shek, D. H. Lawrence, and Mabel Dodge Luhan. According to biographer Ken Cuthbertson, while her books were favorably reviewed, &quot;her versatility, which enabled her to write authoritatively on almost any subject, befuddled her publishers, who seemed at a loss as to how to promote or market an Emily Hahn book. She did not fit into any of the usual categories&quot; because she &quot;moved effortlessly...from genre to genre.&quot;

In 1978 she published &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;, which dealt with the controversial subject of animal-human communication; this was her personal favorite among her non-fiction books. She wrote her last book, &quot;Eve and the Apes&quot;, in 1988 when she was in her eighties.

Hahn reportedly went into her office at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; daily until just a few months before she died. She died on February 18, 1997, at Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92, and died from complication from her surgery for a shattered femur.

==Legacy==
&quot;Chances are, your grandmother didn&#x27;t smoke cigars and let you hold wild role-playing parties in her apartment&quot;, said her granddaughter Alfia Vecchio Wallace in her affectionate eulogy of Hahn. &quot;Chances are that she didn&#x27;t teach you Swahili obscenities. Chances are that when she took you to the zoo, she didn&#x27;t start whooping passionately at the top of her lungs as you passed the gibbon cage. Sadly for you ... your grandmother was not Emily Hahn.&quot;

In 1998, Canadian author Ken Cuthbertson published the biography &quot;Nobody Said Not to Go: The Life, Loves, and Adventures of Emily Hahn&quot;. &quot;Nobody said not to go&quot; was one of her characteristic phrases.

In 2005, &quot;Xiang Meili&quot; (the name given to Hahn by Zau Sinmay) was published in China. It looks back at the life and loves of Hahn in the Shanghai of the 1930s.

In 2009, Janice Y. K. Lee published &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot;, a novel whose main character is loosely based on Hahn.

<text>HMAS &quot;Archer&quot; (P 86) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats, replacing a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. The design was developed based on lessons learned from the use of s for patrol duties off Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. Initially, nine boats were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force. Subsequently, another six ships were ordered which brought the class to 20 vessels. The class had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the class were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and needed to be able to utilise locally available mechanical components.

&quot;Archer&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 2 December 1967 and commissioned on 15 May 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Archer&quot; paid off on 21 October 1974. She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed &quot;Siliman&quot;, and was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Ardent&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland in October 1967, launched on 27 April 1968, and commissioned on 26 October 1968.

==Australian service==
&quot;Ardent&quot; suffered a major fire in August 1969, raising questions about the design of the &quot;Attack&quot; class. The fire damage was repaired at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. She underwent refits at Cockatoo Island in 1970, 1974 and 1976.

In November 1977, &quot;Ardent&quot; intercepted a boat carrying 180 Vietnamese asylum seekers.

On 23 July 1980, &quot;Ardent&quot; apprehended two Indonesian fishing boats poaching in Australian waters off Derby.

&quot;Ardent&quot; was transferred to the Hobart Port Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve on 18 June 1982.

===Decommissioning===
The patrol boat was decommissioned on 6 January 1994 and redesignated as a General Purpose Vessel with the pennant number A243. It was assigned as a navigation training ship for junior warfare officers based in Sydney. &quot;Ardent&quot; was replaced by the Defence Maritime Services vessel .

===Disposal===
&quot;Ardent&quot; was withdrawn from service in December 1998 and offered to the government of the Northern Territory, which considered placing it in the Darwin Military Museum, but remained moored at until the NT government declined the offer in August 2000. She was then sold to Britton Marine (Australia) Pty Ltd as MV &quot;Ardent&quot; in January 2001 for $150,000.

==Indonesian service==
MV &quot;Ardent&quot; was sold to the Indonesian Navy in 2002 and commissioned as KRI &quot;Tenggiri&quot; (865) on 2 January 2003. In December 2013 it was patrolling the Strait of Malacca, and in February 2018 detained three vessels illegally mining tin off the Bangka Belitung Islands.

<text>Ormoc (IPA: ), officially the City of Ormoc (; ; ), is a independent component city in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 230,998 inhabitants, making it the second most-populous city in the province of Leyte after the provincial capital of Tacloban. Ormoc is the economic, cultural, commercial and transportation hub of western Leyte.

Ormoc is an independent component city, not subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Leyte. However, the city is part of the 4th Congressional District of Leyte together with Albuera, Kananga, Merida, Palompon and Isabel, and statistically grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority. On November 8, 2013, the city was extensively damaged by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), having previously suffered severe destruction and loss of life in 1991 from torrential flooding during Tropical Storm Thelma (Uring).

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;ogmok&quot;, an archaic Visayan term for &quot;lowland&quot; or &quot;depressed plain&quot;. The city also celebrates an annual thanksgiving festival called the &quot;Piña Festival&quot; in honor of the saints Peter and Paul in thanks for the bountiful pineapple harvest.

==History==
=== Early History ===
This place was used during the Spanish occupation and the migration of the neighboring towns to settle in the more fertile plains of Ormoc. Much of the settler in the town were the Malayans. These people had a constant trading with the Chinese, Javans and Indonesians. Their living, however, was always threatened by the attack of the Moro pirates. It is said that the people in Ormoc developed a warning system communication through people manning watch towers to inform and warn the people of the coming of these pirates.

=== Spanish Period ===
July 16, 1595, Jesuit missionaries arrived in Leyte. On May 1597, a mission in Ormoc was established by these missionaries. That year, the locals were converted to Christianity. Their years of peace was shortly felt when in year 1634, a ruler of Sulu by the name of Raja Bungsu captured 300 natives from Ormoc after the invasion of the notorious pirates in the town. The towns of Sogod, Kabalian, Inopacan and Baybay were also invaded and plundered. More locals of Ormoc still fought Raja and his men but because they were outnumbered, they were massacred up to the last man.

=== Philippine Revolution ===
Ormoc is a hotbed of revolutionaries seeking independence from Spanish rule. The revolutionary leader Faustino Ablen inspired locals to join the Pulahan Movement.

=== Early American Period ===
In 1903, the municipality of Albuera was consolidated into Ormoc.

=== World War II ===

After the Japanese Occupation and a rule of Second Philippine Republic. Ormoc is a garrison of small divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army. With the Allies near the City. Japan begin to reinforce the city and the Battle of Ormoc Bay begins. The city is liberated afterwards.

=== Cityhood ===

Ormoc became a city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 179&quot; on October 20, 1947, becoming the fifteenth city in the Philippines and the first in the Eastern Visayas region.

Kananga was created in 1950 from the barrios of Lonoy, Kananga, Rizal, Tugbong, Montebello, Aguiting, Tagaytay, Montealegre, Libungao, Naghalin, and Masarayao which all used to be part of Ormoc City.

===1991 Flash Flood===

On the morning of November 5, 1991, the Ormoc region was inundated by Tropical Storm Uring. The city government recorded 4,922 deaths, 3,000 missing persons, 14,000 destroyed houses and more than P600 million worth of damaged property. None of the 3,000 missing persons were ever found and are now presumed dead. Illegal logging and &quot;kaingin&quot; (slash-and-burn farming) were blamed as the reasons of the flood. Heavy rainfall caused water to collect upstream the Anilao and Malbasag rivers until it poured to the lowlands in Ormoc, particularly District 26, also known as Isla Verde.

On November 5, 2011, a monument by national artist Francis Cinco commemorating the 20th anniversary of the event was inaugurated. It sits on top of the mass grave at the Ormoc City Public Cemetery where an estimated 4,900 victims are buried. The sculpture, entitled &quot;Gift of Life&quot;, is an abstract depicting a life taken to heaven.

=== 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan ===

On November 7, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, made a landfall in the Philippines. While it killed far fewer people as Tropical Storm Uring, it left widespread devastation to the city with destruction and damages in 90% of its structures.

===2022 plebiscite===
On January 19, 2021, the City Council enacted &quot;Ordinance 52 Series of 2021&quot; to merge the numbered barangays (all in Poblacion) and renaming them:
* Barangays 1–8, 12, 13, 15, 17, 23 &amp; 27 shall be merged to form a single unit to be named as Barangay South;

==Demographics==

The natives of this city are called Ormocanons, with most being Cebuano speakers, as with the whole western and southern parts of the island of Leyte. A definite number of Waray speakers is also present within the city.

Like most Filipinos, Ormocanons are predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city celebrates its annual fiesta in honour of the patron saints Saint Peter and Saint Paul on June 28 and 29.

==Economy==


Ormoc&#x27;s economic base is a mix of agriculture, aquaculture, industry, tourism, and commercial services. Sugar cane, rice and pineapple are the major agricultural production.

The city enjoys economic growth because it supplies a large part of the country&#x27;s power needs with its abundant geothermal power resources from the Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant in Barangay Tongonan and the neighbouring Kananga town. Ormoc is also the gateway to the Leyte Industrial Development Estate in the nearby town of Isabel, home of the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, the largest fertilizer factory in Asia, and the Philippine Associated Smelter and Refining Company, the country&#x27;s biggest copper processing plant, among other industries.

<text>Food sovereignty is a food system in which the people who produce, distribute, and consume food also control the mechanisms and policies of food production and distribution. This stands in contrast to the present corporate food regime, in which corporations and market institutions control the global food system. Food sovereignty emphasizes local food economies, sustainable food availability, and centers culturally appropriate foods and practices. Changing climates and disrupted foodways disproportionately impact indigenous populations and their access to traditional food sources while contributing to higher rates of certain diseases; for this reason, food sovereignty centers indigenous peoples. These needs have been addressed in recent years by several international organizations, including the United Nations, with several countries adopting food sovereignty policies into law. Critics of food sovereignty activism believe that the system is founded on inaccurate baseline assumptions; disregards the origins of the targeted problems; and is plagued by a lack of consensus for proposed solutions.

==Definition==

The term &quot;food sovereignty&quot; was first coined in 1996 by members of Via Campesina, an international farmers&#x27; organisation, and later adopted by several international organisations, including the World Bank and United Nations. In 2007, the &quot;Declaration of Nyéléni&quot; provided a definition which was adopted by 80 countries; in 2011 it was further refined by countries in Europe. As of 2020, at least seven countries had integrated food sovereignty into their constitutions and laws.

== History ==
Aligned somewhat with the tenets of the Slow Food organization, the history of food sovereignty as a movement is relatively young. However, the movement is gaining traction as more countries take significant steps towards implementing food systems that address inequities.

=== Global gatherings ===
At the 2007 Forum for Food Sovereignty in Sélingué, Mali, 500 delegates from more than 80 countries adopted the &quot;Declaration of Nyéléni&quot;, which says in part:

Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations. It defends the interests and inclusion of the next generation. It offers a strategy to resist and dismantle the current corporate trade and food regime, and directions for food, farming, pastoral and fisheries systems determined by local producers. Food sovereignty prioritises local and national economies and markets and empowers peasant and family farmer-driven agriculture, artisanal fishing, pastoralist-led grazing, and food production, distribution and consumption based on environmental, social and economic sustainability.

In April 2008 the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), an intergovernmental panel under the sponsorship of the United Nations and the World Bank, adopted the following definition: &quot;Food sovereignty is defined as the right of peoples and sovereign states to democratically determine their own agricultural and food policies.&quot;

=== Government food sovereignty policy ===
Issues of food production, distribution and access are seldom apolitical or without criticism. For example, the adoption of the Green Revolution in countries across the globe has increased world food production but has not &quot;solved&quot; the problem of world hunger. Food sovereignty advocates argue this is because the movement did not address access to land or distribution of economic power. Others argue that food sovereignty is based on incorrect baseline assumptions around the role of subsistence farming in government policy. Agrarian aspects of food sovereignty put the movement in conflict with globalisation, industrialisation, and urbanisation trends.

After Hugo Chávez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, a new constitution was approved by the people of Venezuela which included the right to food as one of its basic civil rights. The government set up missions to deliver the various constitutional rights. Several missions related to food and farming were established by Chávez&#x27; government to provide equitable food access. Among these were the Misión Alimentación, Misión Vuelvan Caras, Misión Mercal and Misión Zamora. Later the Gran Misión AgroVenezuela was created to increase domestic agricultural production. Among the strategies used to increase food sovereignty for Venezuelans were land reform, agroecology, use of traditional crops and biological pest control and the establishment of subsidised food outlets such as Arepera Socialista, Café Venezuela and Cacao Venezuela.

In September 2008, Ecuador enshrined food sovereignty in its constitution. As of late 2008, a law is in the draft stages that is expected to expand upon this constitutional provision by banning genetically modified organisms, protecting many areas of the country from extraction of non-renewable resources, and to discourage monoculture. The law as drafted will also protect biodiversity as collective intellectual property and recognize the Rights of Nature.

Since then Mali, Bolivia, Nepal, Senegal and Egypt (2014 Constitution) have integrated food sovereignty into their national constitutions or laws.

== Indigenous food sovereignty ==

=== Global Issues ===

==== Climate ====
Climate change is impacting the food security of indigenous communities as well, including Pacific Islanders and those in the Circumpolar North, due to rising sea levels or erosion.

==== Cuisine ====
Activists claim that native food sovereignty is also appropriated as a cuisine for mainstream dining because indigenous foods are framed to be culturally authentic, desired by those outside of these communities. Ingredients that are cultural staples, which are harder for these populations to find, are displaced due to a greater demand for access outside of indigenous populations.

=== Indigenous food sovereignty in the United States ===

Native Americans have been directly impacted in their ability to acquire and prepare their food and this disruption of traditional diets has resulted in health problems, including diabetes and heart disease. Indigenous food sovereignty activists in the United States assert that the systematic displacement of indigenous communities has led to mass food insecurity. Activist groups advocate for revitalization of traditional practices, development of local food economies, the right to food, and seed sovereignty.

Indigenous people&#x27;s food sovereignty and food security are closely related to their geographical location. Traditional indigenous foodways in the United States are tied to the ancestral homelands of Native American populations, especially for those with strong subsistence traditions. For instance, it is taught among the Muckleshoot that “the land that provides the foods and medicines we need are a part of who we are.&quot;

The disruption of traditional foodways is described to be tied to the disruption of the connection between traditional Native land and their people, a change Rachel V. Vernon describes as being tied to “racism, colonialism, and the loss of autonomy and power.” Pre-colonial lands were expansive and thriving with traditional foods. Because of disease and war, Native peoples in the early 20th century were directly impacted in their ability to acquire and prepare their food. In addition to this, relocation away from ancestral lands further limited traditional foodways. Many indigenous people in the United States now live in food deserts. Due to inadequate or inhibited access to food, indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately from food insecurity compared to the rest of the US population. At reservations, the “‘highly processed, high sugar, high fat, and processed foods,’” further contributed to health issues in Native populations, leading to indigenous peoples in the United States having the highest rates of diabetes and heart disease in the nation. In addition to this, a majority of Native peoples also live off-reservation, and so are even further removed from traditional foodways.

Because Native American nations are sovereign from the United States, they receive little help in rehabilitating traditional foodways. As defined by the National Congress of American Indians, tribal sovereignty ensures that any decisions about the tribes with regard to their property and citizens are made with their participation and consent. The United States federal government recognizes Native American tribes as separate governments, opposed to “special interest groups, individuals, or ... other type of non-governmental entity.”

==== History ====

Prior to the colonization of the Americas, Native Americans had a diverse diet and food culture, procuring food in various ways across tribes. Depending on the region, Indigenous people sourced their food by hunting, fishing, gathering, and farming. Native food pathways revolved around the “three sisters,” or corn, beans, and squash, as staples in their diet. Hunting, gathering, and fishing were the primary means of collecting food.

These balanced ecosystems were disrupted by European settler colonialism following Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of America in 1492. Upon European arrival, the Indigenous peoples of America were stripped of their supplies and even starved out as a tactic for colonial control over Native lands. Domesticated animals were introduced into America by European settlers, bringing with them new diseases. Colonizers targeted food stores specifically and drastically changed Native American diets, their ability to acquire resources, and produce food.

New food systems put in place by American settlers, have over time forced a dependency upon processed and mass-produced food on Indian reservations and indigenous communities at large. Native tribes have been forced into a position of food insecurity and put in a place in society where there is no ability to afford other sources of healthy or food that is organically farmed. With a loss of food sovereignty, there was also a loss of land, as Indians were relocated and forcibly assimilated. Following Congress&#x27; passing of the Indian Appropriations Act in 1851, all Indigenous people were forced onto Indian reservations, losing the ability to cultivate the earth and rely on traditional means of living.

==== Activism ====
Native Americans today fight for food sovereignty as a means to address health, returning to culturally traditional foods for healing. Returning to traditional eating is challenging, considering an extensive history of relocation and cultural genocide. Many Native American histories of traditional culture foods have been lost or are now difficult to recreate.

Indigenous food sovereignty activists in the United States assert that indigenous communities have been systematically displaced from their traditional foodways, which has led to mass food insecurity. It is argued that the most effective way to achieve food security for indigenous groups is to increase their agency in food production. Some activists also argue for food sovereignty as a means of healing historical trauma and as a means of decolonizing their communities. In the United States the Indigenous Food Systems Network and the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance work towards education and policy-making concerned with food and farming security. Another group focused on requiring food and energy sovereignty is the White Earth Anishnaabeg from Minnesota, who focus on a variety of foods, planting and harvesting them using traditional methods, a form of decolonization. Such groups meet to establish policies for food sovereignty and to develop their local food economies at summits such as the Diné Bich’iiya’ Summit in Tsaile, Arizona, which focused on Navajo traditional foods.

Indigenous food sovereignty activists also often advocate for seed sovereignty, and more generally for plant breeders’ rights. Seed saving is important to indigenous communities in the United States because it provides those communities with a stable food source and holds cultural importance. In addition, seed sovereignty advocates often argue that seed saving is an important mechanism in creating agricultural systems that can adapt to climate change.

==== Food sovereignty research and projects ====
In 2021, a comprehensive literature review of IFS (Indigenous Food Sovereignty) and the effectiveness of food sovereignty principles concluded that Indigenous people in the United States and Canada have higher rates of obesity, food insecurity, and Type 2 diabetes than the general population.

Government projects supporting indigenous food systems are new attempts to uplift indigenous communities and are in amateur stages of development. Other countries adopted Indigenous food programs years before the U.S., including Canada. The Canadian Food Guide (CFG) was created in January 2019 as a means to include multicultural diets, instead of basing food standards on one or few cultures — the guide includes Indigenous diets and involved Indigenous populations in consultation.

In 2021, the United States&#x27; Department of Agriculture launched the Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative. This initiative is designed to &quot;promote traditional food ways&quot; as, similar to Canada, USDA programs have not historically encompassed Indigenous food pathways and diets. The USDA has partnered with organizations already serving Indigenous tribes: The Indigenous Seed Keepers Network, Linda Black Elk &amp; Lisa Iron Cloud, InterTribal Buffalo Council, North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems, Intertribal Agriculture Council, and the University of Arkansas - Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative.

Non-governmental projects, such as the “Good Life” project in Ecuador, are spearheaded by independent organizations and Indigenous community members. The &quot;Good Life&quot; suggests that there are alternative methods of action through Indigenous community development that do not involve governmental funding or state provisioning. In Ecuador, the Indigenous community has developed the “Good Life” project which drifts away from capitalist and western understandings of what a community needs, and rather focuses on cultivating community success through harmony with the people, nature, and defending their land — essentially working directly within an Indigenous community to reclaim food sovereignty.

Organizations in the United States have adopted similar models to Ecuador&#x27;s &quot;Good Life&quot; project. In California, the UC Berkeley organization, CARES (the Community Assessment of Renewable Energy and Sustainability) works with the PPN (Pinoleville Pomo Nation) in Ukiah, California, to support their tribal sovereignty. This Indigenous community has been working with CARES over the years to design sustainable housing and energy that reflect its culture.

Narragansett people exercised their own food sovereignty initiative by reappropriating landscapes, seascapes, estuaries, spaces, and built places from a Rhode Island &quot;Farm&quot;, which had, in earnest after 1690, sustained southern New England proprietorship, land banks, and currency within a Greater Caribbean plantation complex. This carrying trade became a potential leg of the Triangular trade, although historians also argue that the self-contained carrying trade belied the triangle as a sequential circuit. By 1769, the woodlands and wetlands of the Narragansett tribal reserve near Charlestown, Rhode Island, had been reduced to less than five square miles, with multivalent consequences for resource allocation, survivance, religiosity, and race. Census and missionary records appraised the reserve population at approximately 600 tribal members, on the eve of Narragansett tribal veterans&#x27; return from the Seven Years&#x27; War. But these same records did not address the seasonal fishing exodus and indicated that, for example, the Narragansett &quot;have for ages been intermixing with Whites and Blacks...a number of others, of mixed nations, live among them, who, by their customs, are not of the tribe.&quot; One missionary later observed that less than a third of the reserve was available for tillage and sustenance, with the remainder devoted to tenancy and the maintenance of woodlands for timber (sales, etc.).

Previous debts to &quot;Farmers&quot;, especially for gunpowder during hunting sojourns and for compensating &quot;seasoned slaves&quot; in assistance with fishing canoe transportation, had resulted in a mid-eighteenth-century emphasis on horticulture and agriculture, with limited animal husbandry. Historian Daniel Mandell argues that, compared to Eastern Woodland Algonquian communities in similar circumstances, &quot;the Narragansetts had even less: in 1810, the tribe told [congregational missionary Curtis] Coe that they had no oxen to plow their fields or haul manure and held only about four cows; he had already noted that families on the reserve generally farmed only about an acre.&quot; Despite the antebellum rise of &quot;Greater Northeast&quot; industrial agriculture, the southern New England &quot;Farms&quot; and the carrying trade in Caribbean sugar, molasses, rice, coffee, indigo, mahogany, and pre-1740 &quot;seasoned slaves&quot;, began to dissipate by the Election of 1800 and largely collapsed into agrarian ruins by the War of 1812.

The expansion of the Narragansett tribal project garnered media coverage and incited scholars to reevaluate a diminished focus on, or complete absence of, such &quot;Farms&quot;, their proprietors, their multipurpose Pacers, seaport carriers, land banks, and Narragansett foodways in extant studies on Eastern Woodland Algonquian communities by both historians and anthropologists.

== Seed sovereignty ==
Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right “to breed and exchange diverse open-sourced seeds.&quot; It is closely connected to food sovereignty, as seed sovereignty activists argue for the practice of seed saving partly as a means of increasing food security. These activists argue that seed saving allows for a closed food system that can help communities gain independence from major agricultural companies. Seed sovereignty is distinct from food sovereignty in its emphasis on seed saving specifically, rather than food systems in their entirety. Seed sovereignty activists often argue for seed saving based on environmental reasoning, not just food justice ones. They argue that seed saving fills an important role of restoring biodiversity to agriculture, and producing plant varieties that are more resilient to change climatic conditions in light of climate change.

== Food sovereignty versus food security ==

=== Food sovereignty ===
Movements to reclaim sovereignty over food have existed around the world for centuries; however, the concept of &quot;food sovereignty&quot; itself emerged in 1996. Food sovereignty was initially defined by &quot;small-scale producers [who] organized as the transnational social movement La Vía Campesina (LVC), and was launched globally at the 1996 United Nations World Food Summit.&quot; It is a concept that explains how the industrialization of food pathways has decreased one&#x27;s freedom to choose one&#x27;s own food source.&quot;Food sovereignty movements work hard to increase local community control of the production, processing, and distribution of food, as this is seen as a necessary condition for liberating communities from oppression,&quot; which has transformed food movements toward building more overall security.

In fall 2003, Peter Rosset argues in &quot;Food First&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Backgrounder&quot; that &quot;food sovereignty goes beyond the concept of &quot;food security&quot;... [Food security] means that... [everyone] must have the certainty of having enough to eat each day[,] ... but says nothing about where that food comes from or how it is produced.&quot; Food sovereignty includes support for smallholders and for collectively owned farms, fisheries, etc., rather than industrializing these sectors in a minimally regulated global economy. In another publication, &quot;Food First&quot; describes &quot;food sovereignty&quot; as &quot;a platform for rural revitalization at a global level based on equitable distribution of farmland and water, farmer control over seeds, and productive small-scale farms supplying consumers with healthy, locally grown food.&quot;

=== Food Security ===

In the 90’s the Food and Agriculture Organization defined food security as “all people, at all times, hav[ing] physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.&quot; Despite the fact that food security has become more widely understood in the US as availability and access to nutritious foods all the time, this definition is not universally applicable. For instance, in the European Union, &quot;the official food insecurity indicator includes the unaffordability of ‘a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day&#x27;&quot; This definition differs greatly from food insecurity measurements of the US for instance. The existence of contradicting markers of food insecurity happening globally reflects different research and interpretations of that research.

Food security, emphasises access to adequate nutrition for all, which may be provided by food from one&#x27;s own country or from global imports. In the name of efficiency and enhanced productivity, it has therefore served to promote what has been termed the &quot;corporate food regime&quot;: large-scale, industrialised corporate farming based on specialized production, land concentration and trade liberalisation. Critics of the food security movement claim that its inattention to the political economy of the corporate food regime blinds it to the adverse effects of that regime, notably the widespread dispossession of small producers and global ecological degradation.

== Criticisms of the Green Revolution ==
The Green Revolution, which refers to developments in plant breeding between the 1960s and 1980s that improved yields from major cereal crops, is upheld by some proponents of food security as a success story in increasing crop yields and combating world hunger. The policy focused primarily in research, development and transfer of agricultural technology, such as hybrid seeds and fertilisers, through massive private and public investment that went into transforming agriculture in a number of countries, starting in Mexico and India. However, many in the food sovereignty movement are critical of the green revolution and accuse those who advocate it as following too much of a Western culture technocratic program that is out of touch with the needs of majority of small producers and peasants.

While the green revolution greatly increased food production and averted famine, world hunger continues because it did not address the problem of access. Food sovereignty advocates argue that the green revolution failed to alter the highly concentrated distribution of economic power, particularly access to land and purchasing power. Critics also argue that the green revolution&#x27;s increased use of herbicides caused widespread environmental destruction and reduced biodiversity in many areas.
== Academic perspectives ==

=== Food Regime theory ===

According to Philip McMichael, a &quot;world agriculture&quot; under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (&quot;food from nowhere&quot;) represents one pole of the &quot;central contradiction&quot; of the present regime. He is interested in the food sovereignty movement&#x27;s potential to escalate the tension between this and its opposing pole, the agroecology-based localism (&quot;food from somewhere&quot;) advocated by various grassroots food movements. Offering slightly different conclusions, recent work by Harriet Friedmann suggests that &quot;food from somewhere&quot; is already being co-opted under an emergent &quot;corporate-environmental&quot; regime (cf. Campbell 2009).

=== Criticisms ===

==== Wrong baseline assumptions ====
Some scholars argue that the Food Sovereignty movement follows wrong baseline assumptions, citing that small-scale farming is not necessarily a freely chosen lifestyle and farmers in least developed and highly developed countries do not face the same challenges. These critics claim the Food Sovereignty movement may be right about the mistakes of neoliberal economic ideology, but it is silent about the fact that many famines actually occurred under socialist and communist regimes that pursued the goal of food self-sufficiency (cf. Aerni 2011).

==== Political-jurisdictional model ====
There is a lack of consensus within the food sovereignty movement regarding the political or jurisdictional community at which its calls for democratisation and renewed &quot;agrarian citizenship&quot; are directed. In public statements, the food sovereignty movement urges strong action from both national governments and local communities (in the vein of the indigenous rights movement, Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) . Elsewhere it has also appealed to global civil society to act as a check against abuses by national and supranational governing bodies.

Those who take a radically critical view on state sovereignty would argue against the possibility that national sovereignty can be reconciled with that of local communities (see also the debate about multiculturalism and indigenous autonomy in Mexico ).

==== Crisis of the peasantry? ====
In its strong reassertion of rural and peasant identities, the food sovereignty movement has been read as a challenge to modernist narratives of inexorable urbanisation, industrialisation of agriculture, and de-peasantisation. However, as part of ongoing debates over the contemporary relevance of agrarianism in classical Marxism, Henry Bernstein is critical of these accounts. He claims that such analyses tend to present the agrarian population as a unified, singular and world-historical social category, failing to account for:
* a population&#x27;s vast internal social differentiation (North/South, gender and class positionalities);
* the conservative, cultural survivalist tendencies of a movement that has emerged as part of a backlash against the perceived homogenising forces of globalisation (Boyer discusses whether food sovereignty is a counter or anti-development narrative) Berstein claims that these accounts cannot escape a certain agrarian populism (or agrarianism). For a response to Bernstein, see McMichael (2009).

<doc id="432449" wikidata="Q1889017" url="?curid=432449" title="Mandaue">
<text>Mandaue (), officially the City of Mandaue (; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 364,116 people.

It is geographically located on the central-eastern coastal region of Cebu by Philippine Statistics Authority but administratively independent from the province. Its southeast coast borders Mactan Island where Lapu-Lapu City is located and is connected to the island via two bridges: the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge and Marcelo Fernan Bridge. Mandaue is bounded on the north by the town of Consolacion, to the east by the Camotes Sea, and to the west and south by Cebu City.

It is one of three highly urbanized cities on Cebu island and forms a part of the Cebu Metropolitan area and was part of the sixth district of Cebu joined with the municipalities of Consolacion and Cordova - it was qualified for a lone district since 1991. On April 5, 2019, the city became a lone legislative district. As of June 30, 2022, Mandaue had its first representation in the 19th Congress of the Philippines.

== History ==

A community was established in Mandaue by a flourishing group of Austronesian people. The Venetian chronicler Antonio Pigafetta wrote of a settlement called &quot;Mandaui&quot; which existed in the area with a chieftain named Apanoaan some called him Lambuzzan in other accounts.

Mandaue natives were forced into a town as decreed by the Spanish authorities. This may have started off as a mission village (which included present day Consolacion, Liloan and Poro) serving as a bulwark for the church in the northern Cebu and was managed by the Jesuit in 1638 then a century later by the Recollects.

The Philippine Revolution of 1898 gave the town a new form of administration in accordance with the organic decree of the Central Revolutionary Government. The short-lived revolution was overthrown by the American troops and a battle nearly destroyed the town in 1901, killing Presidente Benito Ceniza.

Mandaue was a semi-autonomous functioning town. Semi-autonomous as it was still under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Despite having been developed and organized by the Spaniards throughout the ages and its population increasing as the years gone by, the Spaniards did not make an initiative to elevate the town into an independent municipality. It was only after the death of Presidente Ceniza and the establishment of American Rule in Mandaue that the dream of becoming an independent municipality came true. In 1901, Mandaue became an independent municipality.

Mandaue became independent from being an American Commonwealth and a Japanese garrison on July 4, 1946, along with the entire nation.

=== Cityhood ===
On August 30, 1969, Mandaue became a chartered city and decades later it was recognized as a highly urbanized city on February 15, 1991. In early-April 2019, Mandaue separated from the sixth district and, since 2022, is represented under its lone district.
== Geography ==

The city has a total area of . According to the 2020 census, the population density is .

The city is the 6th smallest government unit in terms of land area; among the Metro Cebu local government units the city is the second smallest next to the municipality of Cordova in the island of Mactan. The city&#x27;s land area is only 4.5% of the total land area of Metro Cebu and less than 1% of the total land of the province of Cebu.

The North Reclamation Project, now known as the North Special Administrative Zone, currently has about reclaimed land. Of the 180 hectares, about belong to the city.

It is one of the two (the other one being the municipality of Consolacion) local government units located within the mainland Metro Cebu where the elevation of land is less than .

Many of the areas of the city are extremely flat. About 77.37% is within the 0-8% slope category. Barangays belonging to this region are Centro, Looc, South Special Administrative Zone, Cambaro, Opao, Umapad, Paknaan, Alang-alang, Tipolo, Ibabao, Guizo, Subangdaku, Mantuyong, Maguikay and Tabok. The greater portion of the city, comprising about 70%, is dominated by the Mandaue Clay Loam soil series. This is found in the 0-2% and 2-5% slope ranges. Faraon clay loam characterizes the rest of the land with slope range from 5-8% and up to 25-40%.

=== Fiestas ===

Mandaue Fiesta: Celebrated on May 8 in honor of the town patron, Saint Joseph. Activities that are typically held during this feast are the procession, inter-barangay sports competition, Miss Mandaue (the longest-running beauty competition in the province), rodeos, street festival (Mantawi Festival), bailes, fairs, and many more.

Panagtagbo sa Mandaue: This is Mandaue&#x27;s current major festival in honor of the Holy Family. This is celebrated every 2nd week of January on the eve of the &quot;Traslacion&quot; (Transfer of Relic), of one of the significant religious events of the Sinulog Festival which commemorates the union of the Holy Family.

Associate degree, Baccalaureate Degrees, Master&#x27;s and Doctoral programs.

Mandaue has institutionalized learning with the Cabahug Medal which was started on 1923 by Sotero Cabahug as a medal of academic excellence annually. The Mandaue Fraternal Society was also created in the early part of the 19th century to provide a community for the professionals during the time when Mandaue was still a sleepy town.

Cebu&#x27;s part-time Japanese school, the Cebu Japanese School (CJS; セブ補習授業校 &quot;Sebu Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), is located on the fifth floor of the Clotilde Commercial Center in Barangay Casuntingan, Mandaue City.

<doc id="432450" wikidata="Q2145211" url="?curid=432450" title="Round-off error">
<text>In computing, a roundoff error, also called rounding error, is the difference between the result produced by a given algorithm using exact arithmetic and the result produced by the same algorithm using finite-precision, rounded arithmetic. Rounding errors are due to inexactness in the representation of real numbers and the arithmetic operations done with them. This is a form of quantization error. When using approximation equations or algorithms, especially when using finitely many digits to represent real numbers (which in theory have infinitely many digits), one of the goals of numerical analysis is to estimate computation errors. Computation errors, also called numerical errors, include both truncation errors and roundoff errors.

When a sequence of calculations with an input involving any roundoff error are made, errors may accumulate, sometimes dominating the calculation. In ill-conditioned problems, significant error may accumulate.

In short, there are two major facets of roundoff errors involved in numerical calculations:
# The ability of computers to represent both magnitude and precision of numbers is inherently limited.
# Certain numerical manipulations are highly sensitive to roundoff errors. This can result from both mathematical considerations as well as from the way in which computers perform arithmetic operations.

== Representation error ==

The error introduced by attempting to represent a number using a finite string of digits is a form of roundoff error called representation error. Here are some examples of representation error in decimal representations:

Increasing the number of digits allowed in a representation reduces the magnitude of possible roundoff errors, but any representation limited to finitely many digits will still cause some degree of roundoff error for uncountably many real numbers. Additional digits used for intermediary steps of a calculation are known as guard digits.

Rounding multiple times can cause error to accumulate. For example, if 9.945309 is rounded to two decimal places (9.95), then rounded again to one decimal place (10.0), the total error is 0.054691. Rounding 9.945309 to one decimal place (9.9) in a single step introduces less error (0.045309). This can occur, for example, when software performs arithmetic in x86 80-bit floating-point and then rounds the result to IEEE 754 binary64 floating-point.

== Floating-point number system ==

Compared with the fixed-point number system, the floating-point number system is more efficient in representing real numbers so it is widely used in modern computers. While the real numbers formula_1 are infinite and continuous, a floating-point number system formula_2 is finite and discrete. Thus, representation error, which leads to roundoff error, occurs under the floating-point number system.

=== Notation of floating-point number system ===
A floating-point number system formula_2 is characterized by formula_4 integers:
*formula_5: base or radix
*formula_6: precision
*formula_7: exponent range, where formula_8 is the lower bound and formula_9 is the upper bound

Any formula_10 has the following form: 
formula_11
where formula_12 is an integer such that formula_13 for formula_14, and formula_15 is an integer such that formula_16.

=== Normalized floating-number system ===

* A floating-point number system is normalized if the leading digit formula_17 is always nonzero unless the number is zero. Since the significand is formula_18, the significand of a nonzero number in a normalized system satisfies formula_19. Thus, the normalized form of a nonzero IEEE floating-point number is formula_20 where formula_21. In binary, the leading digit is always formula_22 so it is not written out and is called the implicit bit. This gives an extra bit of precision so that the roundoff error caused by representation error is reduced.
* Since floating-point number system formula_2 is finite and discrete, it cannot represent all real numbers which means infinite real numbers can only be approximated by some finite numbers through rounding rules. The floating-point approximation of a given real number formula_24 by formula_25 can be denoted.
** The total number of normalized floating-point numbers is formula_26 where
*** formula_27 counts choice of sign, being positive or negative
*** formula_28 counts choice of the leading digit
*** formula_29 counts remaining significand digits
*** formula_30 counts choice of exponents
*** formula_22 counts the case when the number is formula_32.

=== IEEE standard ===

In the IEEE standard the base is binary, i.e. formula_33, and normalization is used. The IEEE standard stores the sign, exponent, and significand in separate fields of a floating point word, each of which has a fixed width (number of bits). The two most commonly used levels of precision for floating-point numbers are single precision and double precision. 
== Machine epsilon ==

Machine epsilon can be used to measure the level of roundoff error in the floating-point number system. Here are two different definitions.

* The machine epsilon, denoted formula_34, is the maximum possible absolute relative error in representing a nonzero real number formula_24 in a floating-point number system. formula_36
* The machine epsilon, denoted formula_34, is the smallest number formula_38 such that formula_39. Thus, formula_40 whenever formula_41.

== Roundoff error under different rounding rules ==

There are two common rounding rules, round-by-chop and round-to-nearest. The IEEE standard uses round-to-nearest.

* Round-by-chop: The base-formula_42 expansion of formula_24 is truncated after the formula_44-th digit. 
** This rounding rule is biased because it always moves the result toward zero.
* Round-to-nearest: formula_25 is set to the nearest floating-point number to formula_24. When there is a tie, the floating-point number whose last stored digit is even (also, the last digit, in binary form, is equal to 0) is used. 
** For IEEE standard where the base formula_42 is formula_27, this means when there is a tie it is rounded so that the last digit is equal to formula_32. 
** This rounding rule is more accurate but more computationally expensive. 
** Rounding so that the last stored digit is even when there is a tie ensures that it is not rounded up or down systematically. This is to try to avoid the possibility of an unwanted slow drift in long calculations due simply to a biased rounding.
* The following example illustrates the level of roundoff error under the two rounding rules. The rounding rule, round-to-nearest, leads to less roundoff error in general. 
=== Calculating roundoff error in IEEE standard ===

Suppose the usage of round-to-nearest and IEEE double precision.

* Example: the decimal number formula_50 can be rearranged into formula_51 
Since the 53rd bit to the right of the binary point is a 1 and is followed by other nonzero bits, the round-to-nearest rule requires rounding up, that is, add 1 bit to the 52nd bit. Thus, the normalized floating-point representation in IEEE standard of 9.4 is 
formula_52

* Now the roundoff error can be calculated when representing formula_53 with formula_54. 
This representation is derived by discarding the infinite tail formula_55 
from the right tail and then added formula_56 in the rounding step. 
:Then formula_57. 
:Thus, the roundoff error is formula_58.
=== Measuring roundoff error by using machine epsilon ===

The machine epsilon formula_34 can be used to measure the level of roundoff error when using the two rounding rules above. Below are the formulas and corresponding proof. The first definition of machine epsilon is used here.

==== Theorem ====
# Round-by-chop: formula_60
# Round-to-nearest: formula_61

==== Proof ====
Let formula_62 where formula_63, and let formula_25 be the floating-point representation of formula_24. 
Since round-by-chop is being used, it is
formula_66
In order to determine the maximum of this quantity, there is a need to find the maximum of the numerator and the minimum of the denominator. Since formula_67 (normalized system), the minimum value of the denominator is formula_22. The numerator is bounded above by formula_69. Thus, formula_70. Therefore, formula_71 for round-by-chop.
The proof for round-to-nearest is similar.
* Note that the first definition of machine epsilon is not quite equivalent to the second definition when using the round-to-nearest rule but it is equivalent for round-by-chop.

== Roundoff error caused by floating-point arithmetic ==

Even if some numbers can be represented exactly by floating-point numbers and such numbers are called machine numbers, performing floating-point arithmetic may lead to roundoff error in the final result.

=== Addition ===

Machine addition consists of lining up the decimal points of the two numbers to be added, adding them, and then storing the result again as a floating-point number. The addition itself can be done in higher precision but the result must be rounded back to the specified precision, which may lead to roundoff error.

* For example, adding formula_22 to formula_73 in IEEE double precision as follows,formula_74This is saved as formula_75 since round-to-nearest is used in IEEE standard. Therefore, formula_76 is equal to formula_22 in IEEE double precision and the roundoff error is formula_73.

This example shows that roundoff error can be introduced when adding a large number and a small number. The shifting of the decimal points in the significands to make the exponents match causes the loss of some of the less significant digits. The loss of precision may be described as absorption.

Note that the addition of two floating-point numbers can produce roundoff error when their sum is an order of magnitude greater than that of the larger of the two.

* For example, consider a normalized floating-point number system with base formula_79 and precision formula_27. Then formula_81 and formula_82. Note that formula_83 but formula_84. There is a roundoff error of formula_85.

This kind of error can occur alongside an absorption error in a single operation.

=== Multiplication ===

In general, the product of two p-digit significands contains up to 2p digits, so the result might not fit in the significand. Thus roundoff error will be involved in the result.

* For example, consider a normalized floating-point number system with the base formula_86 and the significand digits are at most formula_27. Then formula_88 and formula_89. Note that formula_90 but formula_91 since there at most formula_27 significand digits. The roundoff error would be formula_93.

=== Division ===

In general, the quotient of 2p-digit significands may contain more than p-digits.Thus roundoff error will be involved in the result.

* For example, if the normalized floating-point number system above is still being used, then formula_94 but formula_95. So, the tail formula_96 is cut off.

=== Subtraction ===

Absorption also applies to subtraction.

* For example, subtracting formula_97 from formula_22 in IEEE double precision as follows, formula_99 This is saved as formula_100 since round-to-nearest is used in IEEE standard. Therefore, formula_101 is equal to formula_22 in IEEE double precision and the roundoff error is formula_103.

The subtracting of two nearly equal numbers is called subtractive cancellation. 
When the leading digits are cancelled, the result may be too small to be represented exactly and it will just be represented as formula_32. 

* For example, let formula_105 and the second definition of machine epsilon is used here. What is the solution to formula_106? It is known that formula_107 and formula_108 are nearly equal numbers, and formula_109. However, in the floating-point number system, formula_110. Although formula_111 is easily big enough to be represented, both instances of formula_38 have been rounded away giving formula_32.

Even with a somewhat larger formula_38, the result is still significantly unreliable in typical cases. There is not much faith in the accuracy of the value because the most uncertainty in any floating-point number is the digits on the far right. 

* For example, formula_115. The result formula_116 is clearly representable, but there is not much faith in it.

This is closely related to the phenomenon of catastrophic cancellation, in which the two numbers are &quot;known&quot; to be approximations.

== Accumulation of roundoff error ==

Errors can be magnified or accumulated when a sequence of calculations is applied on an initial input with roundoff error due to inexact representation.

=== Unstable algorithms ===

An algorithm or numerical process is called stable if small changes in the input only produce small changes in the output, and unstable if large changes in the output are produced. For example, the computation of formula_117 using the &quot;obvious&quot; method is unstable near formula_118 due to the large error introduced in subtracting two similar quantities, whereas the equivalent expression formula_119 is stable.

=== Ill-conditioned problems ===

Even if a stable algorithm is used, the solution to a problem may still be inaccurate due to the accumulation of roundoff error when the problem itself is ill-conditioned.

The condition number of a problem is the ratio of the relative change in the solution to the relative change in the input. A problem is well-conditioned if small relative changes in input result in small relative changes in the solution. Otherwise, the problem is ill-conditioned. In other words, a problem is ill-conditioned if its conditions number is &quot;much larger&quot; than 1.

The condition number is introduced as a measure of the roundoff errors that can result when solving ill-conditioned problems.

<text>Toledo ( ), officially the City of Toledo (; ), is a component city in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 207,314 people.

On June 18, 1960, Toledo became a chartered city under Republic Act No. 2688.

Its patron saint is John of Sahagun and his feast day is celebrated every June 12.

It is widely known for its huge mining industry owned by Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, which is the umbrella of Carmen Copper Corporation and its Toledo Mine.

==History==
===Founders of Hinulawan===

Toledo City came from Old Hinulawan and New Hinulawan.
Old Hinulawan, presently called Daanglungsod, was founded by Mariano Libre, Fulgencio Lebumfacil, Areston Macapaz, Adriano Blanco, and Tranquilino Blanco.

New Hinulawan, presently called Toledo (on the present site), was founded by Fermin Poloyapoy, Máximo Macapobre, Jacinto López, Jestoni P. Estrada,Servando de Jesus, Juan Libre, Agapito Nieves, Francisco Blanco,Geresola,Compra,Amaquin, Paraba,Concina,Camoro,Laspoña, and Sñr. Noel Dayot

===Destruction of Old Hinulawan===
On June 3, 1863 a series of earthquakes shook Hinulawan.
The first tremor toppled the newly built school, leveled several houses to the ground, and caused the church facade to collapse. It caused injuries and death to several residents from falling debris.

The quake that followed brought greater damage: complete destruction of the church and the convent; cracking of the lowlands in all directions; crumbling of the stonewalls along the Hinulawan river bank; and sagging of the ground, causing water from the sea and the river to rush in and flood the settlement to waist level.

A third temblor totally destroyed Pueblo Hinulawan.

The survivors were rescued by residents of neighboring highland localities.

===New Hinulawan===
The refugees who survived the Hinulawan earthquakes slowly rebuilt their lives in the days that followed. With the help of the people of Barangay Tubod, some of the survivors cleared portions of the virgin forest and plateau in the vicinity of Tubod and constructed houses with roof made of cogon grass. Those who did now want to live in the new clearings built their homes at the foot of the Tubod highlands. They buried their dead in a cemetery in a certain part of the plateau not far from where they lived.

The area occupied by this particular group, a majority of the survivors, subsequently evolved into the New Hinulawan.

A minority of the refugees decided to migrate to other places: the hinterlands of Da-o, Bulok-bulok, Landahan, and Sam-ang as well as the pioneering settlements in the seafronts of Cabito-onan and Batohanon.

In those days pirate attacks against pueblos situated near the shores of Tañon Strait were rampant. To protect themselves against such attacks, the residents of New Hinulawan built a baluarte, or bulwark, made of chopped stone blocks piled along the shoreline. With the passage of time, however, the bulwark became dilapidated and fell apart, its remnants forever buried in the sand during the construction of the first municipio, or Municipal Hall building. The municipio itself was destroyed by Philippine Commonwealth troops and Cebuano guerrillas in World War II.

Many years later, a few among those who resettled in New Hinulawan decided to return to their former homes in Old Hinulawan when the depressed lowlands gradually became habitable. Old Hinulawan is the present-day Barangay Daanglungsod.

The majority who opted to remain in New Hinulawan worked hard to regain the prosperity they had achieved before Old Hinulawan was wiped out by catastrophe.

===Pueblo Toledo===
Two significant events happened in mid-1869 which led to the change of name of New Hinulawan:

Carlos María de la Torre (1869-1872) became the new Spanish Governor-general of the Philippines.
Father Mariano Brazal (1869-1876), who championed the Filipinization of parishes, assumed the duties as parish priest of New Hinulawan, replacing Father Servando Seoane who was transferred to another parish.
Fr. Brazal and the new Governor-general were proponents of political liberalism which was on the rise in Spain during that period following the fall of Queen Isabel II.

Meanwhile, the alcalde mayor of Cebu (equivalent to the modern-day Cebu Provincial Governor), Esteban Perez, was the boyhood friend of governor-general De la Torre in their hometown Toledo, Spain. Perez was married to a Philippine woman and used to spend his vacation with his family in Talavera, a part of New Hinulawan, where he owned a beach resort. He and Fr. Brazal were also good friends.

A welcome banquet was given in the governor-general&#x27;s palace in Manila in the evening of July 12, 1869 which was attended by students, priests, and Filipino leaders to express their gratitude to De la Torre&#x27;s liberal policies.

During that happy occasion Carlos Maria de la Torre and Esteban Perez had the opportunity to reminisce their boyhood days in Spain in the presence of Fr. Mariano Brazal. In the course of their recollection of the happy past, Perez told the governor-general about New Hinulawan and his special affection for the place because his Filipina wife was a native of Talavera, a barangay of New Hinulawan. He told De la Torre about how similar the environment of New Hinulawan was to their homeland Toledo, Spain and how the winding river of Hinulawan was comparable to Rio Tagus Tajo in Spain.

That evening Perez and Fr. Brazal recommended to the governor-general that the name of New Hinulawan be changed to Toledo.

Governor-general De la Torre delightfully approved the recommendation at once. He even announced to all people present in the banquet the promulgation of a decree changing the name of pueblo New Hinulawan in the province of Cebu into pueblo Toledo, the name of his beloved birthplace in Spain.

===Second World War===
In 1942 the Japanese Imperial forces captured and occupied the town of Toledo.

In 1945, local Filipino forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army from the 8th, 82nd, 83rd, 85th and 86th Infantry Division aided by Cebuano guerrilla resistance fighters, battled against the Japanese Imperial forces and liberated the town of Toledo.

===Cityhood===

On June 19, 1960, Toledo became a chartered city under Republic Act No. 2688. It was made into a city through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel A. Zosa, representative of the old Sixth District Cebu, who authored Republic Act No. 2688.

Although not as progressive as Cebu&#x27;s other cities, it is unique in that it is the only city in the province on the western seaboard facing Negros Oriental – and therefore strategically located. (Danao, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, Cebu City, Talisay, Naga, and Carcar are on the east. One more city, Bogo, is in the north, on the eastern side.)

===Shrine of Saint Pedro Calungsod===
Following the canonization on October 21, 2012, of Visayan teen martyr Pedro Calungsod (1672), the hilltop parish of Cantabaco became the first shrine and church named after the second Filipino saint.

==Geography==
Toledo City is bordered to the north by the town of Balamban, to the west is the Tañon Strait, to the east is Cebu City and Naga and the town of Minglanilla, and to the south is the town of Pinamungajan. It is from Cebu City, from Talisay, and from Naga.

===Malubog Lake===
Toledo has been the source of water for Metro Cebu, Cebu City Water District. It uses Vacuum Type Water Systems, the Pipes from this lake go up the mountain and go down to Cebu Proper, Malubog Lake is situated and located more higher than Cebu City Proper.

===Barangays===
It is composed of thirty-eight (38) barangays, ten (10) of which are urban and twenty-eight (28) are rural barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<text>HMAS &quot;Arrow&quot; (P 88) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation), and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. The main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Arrow&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 17 February 1968, and commissioned on 3 July 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Arrow&quot; was transferred to the Melbourne Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve in mid-1968, then was returned to active service in the early 1970s.

==Fate==
During Cyclone Tracy on 25 December 1974, &quot;Arrow&quot; was driven ashore and sank at Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin with the loss of two sailors: Petty Officer Leslie Catton and Able Seaman Ian Rennie.

== Memorial ==
On 24 April 2019, a memorial, to HMAS &quot;Arrow&quot; and the sailors that lost their lives, was unveiled at the Royal Flying Doctor Service and The Bombing of Darwin Tourist Facility at Stokes Hill Wharf by two surviving crew members and family of the two sailors that died.

<text>La Vía Campesina (from , meaning the peasant way) is an international farmers organization founded in 1993 in Mons, Belgium, formed by 182 organisations in 81 countries, and describing itself as &quot;an international movement which coordinates peasant organizations of small and middle-scale producers, agricultural workers, rural women, and indigenous communities from Asia, Africa, America, and Europe&quot;.

La Via Campesina advocates for family farm-based sustainable agriculture, and was the group that coined the term &quot;food sovereignty&quot;. La Vía Campesina carries out campaigns to defend farmer&#x27;s right to seeds, to stop violence against women, for agrarian reform, and generally for the recognition of the rights of peasants.

==History==

=== Background and approach ===

Starting in the 1980s governments were intervening less in the rural countryside, which weakened corporate control over peasants&#x27; organizations while making a living in agriculture become more difficult. As a result, national peasant groups began to form ties with transnational organizations, starting in Latin America and then on a global scale.

The peasants&#x27; rights movement emerged from the new rights advocacy which had arisen in the 1990s; during that time, human rights and development agendas became integrated which expanded from political and civil rights to include social and economic rights. The agrarian peasants&#x27; movement moved to challenge the hegemonic ideology of neoliberalism in global economics and to find alternatives that would protect the rights of workers around the world.

In Europe, Via Campesina members participated the 2024 &quot;tractorada&quot; farm protests, when agricultural vehicles blocked main roads in Western Europe; it briefly allied with COPA-COGECA which they claimed represented major producers and suppliers of low-cost, widely sourced food. Such organizations may, some have said, be linked or financed by far right groups since they also advocate for less official interference in environmental and social areas such as worker-protection. 

=== Relation to international entities ===
The organization was founded in 1993 by farmers organizations from Europe, Latin America, Asia, North America, Central America and Africa. The foundation followed the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), where the World Trade Organization (WTO)&#x27;s Agreement on Agriculture and the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) were signed and approved. These agreements caused backlash from many people around the world for focusing on technical problems rather than the human right to access to food, especially for those living in the Global South. Globalization was under way at this time, affecting many industries including agriculture. La Vía Campesina gave small farmers a platform to have their voices heard about how these changes were impacting their lives.

The movement has grown and is now recognized as a part of the global dialogue on food and agriculture. It has presented in several international fora, such as:
* The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO);
* The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV);
* The UN Human Rights Council (HRC);
* The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

Via Campesina has been involved in the negotiations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other people living in Rural areas, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2018.

=== Priorities ===
According to La Via Campesina&#x27;s webpage, the movement&#x27;s main issues are promoting food sovereignty; demanding agrarian reform; people&#x27;s control over land, water, territories; resisting free-trade; promoting popular peasant feminism; upholding human rights, rights of migrant workers; promoting agroecology; promoting peasant seeds systems; increasing the participation of youth in agriculture.

In recent years, the movement has placed greater emphasis on gender issues and women&#x27;s rights, and strengthened its opposition to transnational corporations. It has also focused on gaining recognition for the discourse around food sovereignty, reclaiming the term &quot;peasant&quot; and recreating a shared peasant identity across national borders and cultures. La Vía Campesina also partners with other social movements and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to strengthen its international presence.
Democratic decision-making is central to the mission of La Vía Campesina, and it has been dedicated to fair representation and engagement of all participants, making structural changes when necessary. The perspectives of people around the world are needed to assess and improve global food production and sovereignty. Part of this effort for equality among movement members is creating a shared peasant identity. The reclaiming of this identity has been called &quot;re-peasantization&quot;. According to Desmarais (2008), the term &quot;peasant&quot; in English has a connotation related to feudalism, but in other languages and contexts, the meaning is broader; &quot;campesino&quot; comes from the word &quot;campo&quot;, meaning &quot;countryside&quot;, which ties the people to the land. This feudalist connotation is one reason why the organization chose not to translate its name into English.

=== Awards ===
In November 2018, La Vía Campesina received the XV Navarra International Prize for Solidarity (Premio Internacional Navarra a la Solidaridad).

In June 2018, the autonomous, pluralist and multicultural movement, which is entirely independent of any political or economic affiliation, was awarded the Lush Spring Prize Influence Award

In 2015, the organization received an award from the Latin American Scientific Society for Agroecology (SOCLA) &quot;in recognition of its example of tireless struggle in favor of agroecology and the rights of peasants, in carrying out its mission to take care of the earth, feed the world, conserve biodiversity and cool the planet, through its constant search for food sovereignty in Latin America.&quot;

In 2004, La Vía Campesina was awarded the International Human Rights Award by Global Exchange, in San Francisco.

==Organization==
 La Vía Campesina is a grassroots movement, with activism at the local and national level. Members come from 81 countries, organised into 9 regions. The International Coordinating Committee is represented by one man and one woman per region and one youth per continent, each elected by their respective region&#x27;s member organisations. With about 182 local and national organisations as part of the movement, La Via Campesina represents an estimated 200 million farmers around the world.

According to Michael Menser, La Via Campesina is an example of the success and expansion of transnational movements in regards to participatory democracy due to its organization model and adaptation to ensure fair representation.

=== Meetings ===
Representatives from each region meet at International Conferences roughly every four years. Past meetings were held in Mons in 1993, Tlaxcala City in 1996, Bangalore in 2000, São Paulo in 2004, Maputo in 2008, Jakarta in 2013, and Derio in 2017. The international secretariat changes its central location every 4 years based on the decision made at the International Conference. Past locations were Belgium (19931996), Honduras (19972004), Indonesia (20052013) and Harare (20132021).

Since November 2021, the secretariat has been in Bagnolet, France. The current General Coordinator is Morgan Ody, a vegetable producer from Bretagne, France, member of La Confédération paysanne and European Coordination Via Campesina (ECVC).

=== Women&#x27;s involvement ===
Gender was ignored as a consideration at the start of the movement. At the signing of the Managua Declarationthe precursor to La Vía Campesinaall 8 people present were men. Peasant women started to become more involved and pushing for women&#x27;s rights at the International Conference in Tlaxcala in 1996. At this meeting, they decided to form a committee dedicated to women&#x27;s rights and gender issues, which eventually became the Vía Campesina&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Commission. The women on the committee were also heavily involved in editing the draft of the cornerstone position on food sovereignty that was presented at the World Food Summit in 1996. They included health as a consideration for food production without agro-chemicals, as well as the importance of women&#x27;s involvement in policy changes because women typically were barred from political involvement. The women of La Vía Campesina are still working for greater representation and engagement of peasant women, especially in leadership positions.

==Food sovereignty==
La Vía Campesina introduced the right of food sovereignty at the World Food Summit in 1996 as &quot;the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.&quot; The phrase &quot;culturally appropriate&quot; signifies that the food that is available and accessible for the population should fit with the cultural background of the people consuming it. For example, subsidised and imported wheat products would not fall under this category in a country where corn-based foods were the basis of traditional meals.

=== Food sovereignty vs. food security ===
Food sovereignty differs from food security. Food security was defined as &quot;physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food... at all times to meet [the population&#x27;s] dietary and food preferences for an active and healthy life&quot; by D. Moyo at the American Society of International Law annual meeting in 2007. Food security is more focused on the provision of food for all by whatever means necessary, whether by local production or global imports. As a result, economic policies concerned with food security typically emphasize industrial farming that can produce more food cheaper.

=== Food regimes ===
Friedmann defines a food regime as a “rule governed structure of production and consumption of food on a world scale”. A food regime is marked by a period of transition in food production that results in significant social, political, and economic change. The current situation of global food production can be called the &quot;corporate food regime&quot; due to the concentration of supplying and processing food in the private sector. For example, US corporations have control over food production by subcontracting smaller farmers, which allows them to participate and profit without taking on the risks of farming, such as weather and disease. Food regimes are the result of “political struggles among contending social groups” for control over how food production is framed and conceptualized, according to McMichael. The corporate food regime came about with the neoliberal economic theory which is motivated by efficiency and trade liberalization, and states that nations should focus their efforts and resources on producing goods and services where they have an advantage relative to other nations (that is, goods that they are best at producing), as cited by Philip McMichael. The corporate food regime has existed for only the last 100 years, as compared to the millennia prior to industrialization and the Green Revolution.

<text>Bullying is the use of force, coercion, hurtful teasing, comments, or threats, in order to abuse, aggressively , or intimidate one or more others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) that an imbalance of physical or social power exists or is currently present. This perceived presence of physical or social imbalance is what distinguishes the behavior from being interpreted or perceived as &quot;bullying&quot; from instead being interpreted or perceived as &quot;conflict&quot;. 
Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by hostile intent, the goal (whether consciously or subconsciously) of addressing or attempting to &quot;fix&quot; the imbalance of power, as well as repetition over a period of time.

Bullying can be performed individually or by a group, typically referred to as &quot;mobbing&quot;, in which the bully may have one or more followers who are willing to assist the primary bully or who reinforce the bully&#x27;s behavior by providing positive feedback such as laughing. Bullying in school and in the workplace is also referred to as &quot;peer abuse&quot;. Robert W. Fuller has analyzed bullying in the context of rankism. The Swedish-Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus stated that bullying occurs when a person is &quot;exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons&quot;, and that negative actions occur &quot;when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways&quot;. Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person using coercive, intimidating, or hurtful words or comments, exerting threatening or intimidating behavior, or using harmful physical force in order to gain power over another person.

A bullying culture can develop in any context in which humans regularly interact with one another. This may include settings such as within a school, family, or the workplace, the home, and within neighborhoods. When bullying occurs in college and university settings, the practice is known as ragging in certain countries, especially those of the Indian subcontinent. The main platform for bullying in contemporary culture involves the use of social media websites. In a 2012 study of male adolescent American football players, &quot;the strongest predictor [of bullying] was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player&#x27;s life would approve of the bullying behavior.&quot; A study by &quot;The Lancet&quot; Child &amp; Adolescent Health medical journal in 2019 showed a relationship between social media use by girls and an increase in their exposure to bullying.

Bullying may be defined in many different ways. In the United Kingdom, there is no legal definition of the term &quot;bullying&quot;, while some states in the United States currently have laws specifically against it. Bullying is divided into four basic types of abuse: psychological (sometimes referred to as &quot;emotional&quot; or &quot;relational&quot;), verbal, physical, and cyber (or &quot;electronic&quot;), though an encounter can fall into more than one of these categories.

Behaviors used to assert such domination may include physical assault or coercion, verbal harassment, or the use of threats, and such acts may be directed repeatedly toward particular targets. Rationalizations of such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size, or ability.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;bully&quot; was first used in the 1530s, meaning &quot;sweetheart&quot;, applied to either sex, from the , &quot;lover, brother&quot;, probably diminutive of , &quot;brother&quot;, of uncertain origin (compare with the German word &quot;buhle&quot; &quot;lover&quot;). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through &quot;fine fellow&quot;, &quot;blusterer&quot;, to &quot;harasser of the weak&quot;. This may have been as a connecting sense between &quot;lover&quot; and &quot;ruffian&quot; as in &quot;protector of a prostitute&quot;, which was one sense of &quot;bully&quot; (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb &quot;to bully&quot; was first attested in 1710.

In the past, in the American culture, the term has been used as an exclamation and exhortation. The term has been especially known famously in association with Theodore Roosevelt. In 1907, Roosevelt coined the phrase as a deprecating term, &quot;bully for him&quot;. Currently, in the present day, the bully pulpit refers to the use of a high position to influence the general public&#x27;s thoughts and to initiate changes. The term &quot;bully&quot; has been significantly modified through the years, and through language translations, it has shifted from terms of endearment to a form of sarcastic jesting, and then to one or more actions made against others, as well as behavior or activity to be fearful of.

== Types ==
Bullying has been classified by the body of literature into different types. These can be in the form of nonverbal, verbal, or physical behavior. Another classification is based on the perpetrators or the participants involved, so that the types include individual and collective bullying. Other interpretation also cite emotional and relational bullying in addition to physical harm inflicted towards another person or even property.

This is present in extreme forms of bullying, such as hate crimes. A hate crime is when a perpetrator harms a victim because they perceive them to be a member of an outgroup that they are biased against. Perpetrators often harm victims that are perceived as belonging to a group based on their race, ethnicity, skin color, religion, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and or disability. Both bullying and hate crimes involve the devaluing and disrespecting of another person for what is deemed or determined by the perpetrator to be justified reasons. Yet, not all bullying is considered to be a hate crime. Bullies often select their victims because of specific characteristics that the bully views as nonconforming to their specific requirements or sense of belonging. This means that individuals in minority groups are more likely to be targeted. However, bullies usually choose victims that are more available and or vulnerable. This is a more broad approach or motivation than with the engagement of hate crimes.

There are also cases being researched now and in the more recent years regarding the phenomenon called &quot;cyberbullying&quot;, which takes place in the virtual or electronic world, typically over the internet. Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier while continuing into later stages of individual&#x27;s lives. The cases of cyberbullying usually start in early adolescence, when the possession, ownership, or occurrence of cellular or mobile devices are more common.

=== Individual ===
Individual bullying tactics are perpetrated by a single person against one or more victims. Individual bullying can be classified into four types.

==== Physical ====
Physical bullying is any bullying that physically harms someone&#x27;s body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, pantsing, and intentionally destroying someone&#x27;s property are examples of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a victim will experience. Often, bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying, the main weapon the bully uses is their body, or some part thereof; or an object as a weapon when attacking their victim. Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and &quot;beaten up&quot; by their classmates. Physical bullying will often escalate over time, and can lead to a detrimental or fatal ending, and therefore many try to stop it quickly when such cases are reported or observed in order to prevent any further escalation.

==== Verbal ====
Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking, other use of the voice, or some form of body language, and does not involve any form of physical contact. Bullying usually begins at this stage and includes any of the following:
* Derogatory name-calling and nicknaming
* Spreading rumors or lying about someone
* Making threats or engaging in threatening behavior toward someone
* Yelling at or talking to someone in a rude or unkind tone of voice, especially without justifiable cause
* Mocking someone&#x27;s voice or style of speaking
* Laughing at someone
* Use of body language (i.e., the middle finger) to torment someone
* Making insults or otherwise making fun of someone

In verbal bullying, the main weapon the bully uses is their voice. In many cases, verbal bullying is common in both genders. However, girls are more likely to perform this type of bullying compared to boys. Girls, in general, are also more subtle with insults than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power, often to try to impress someone they idolize. Many boys are subtle enough to use verbal techniques for dominance, and often exhibit this type of bullying when they want to avoid the trouble or possible consequences that can come with physically bullying someone else.

==== Relational ====
Relational bullying (sometimes referred to as social aggression) is the type of bullying that uses relationships to hurt others. The term also denotes any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody&#x27;s reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational bullying is a form of bullying common among youth, but more particularly upon girls. Social exclusion (slighting or making someone feel &quot;left out&quot;) is one of the most common types of relational bullying. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and in order to control others. Unlike physical bullying, which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed.

==== Cyber ====

Cyberbullying involves the use of technology (typically the internet) in order to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of cyber-harassment or cyberstalking, a crime that can have legal consequences and possibly involve penalties such as jail time when cases are reported and the perpetrators are legally prosecuted. This includes bullying by use of email, instant messaging, social media websites (such as Facebook), text messages, and phone calls from cell phones or mobile devices. It is stated that Cyberbullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.

The internet provides people with limited accountability and often with no filter. Bullying can feel easier and less restrictive through the use of the internet. This phenomenon is described and detailed in a principle (or effect), called &quot;the online disinhibition effect&quot;. The use of technology for purposes of bullying can be detrimental to someone&#x27;s online reputation. The information published online will often remain there indefinitely, unless it is taken down or removed by the person who published it, or by moderators of the website or web platform, or (if allowed) by other users. Future employers and other people with access to the internet will be able to see others&#x27; digital footprint and how individuals behaved or treated other people - especially if concerted efforts are allocated in order to search for and find any posts, webpages, or content that may negatively impact the target person&#x27;s evaluation or eligibility for a position. Another problem with cyberbullying is the possibility that other people are able to get involved. Technology, especially the use of social media, allows others to repost or share published content, whether it is positive or negative.

=== Collective ===
Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against one or more victims. Collective bullying is known as &quot;mobbing&quot;, and can include any of the individual types of bullying. Trolling behavior on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by casual readers, is sometimes a result of organized efforts made by sponsored astroturfers.

==== Mobbing ====

Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a family, peer group, school, workplace, neighborhood, community, or online. When it occurs as emotional abuse in the workplace, such as &quot;ganging up&quot; by co-workers, subordinates or superiors, to force someone out of the workplace through rumor, innuendo, intimidation, humiliation, discrediting, and isolation, it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial/racial, general harassment.

== Characteristics ==

=== Bullies and accomplices ===
Studies have shown that envy and resentment may be motives for bullying. Research on the self-esteem of bullies has produced equivocal results. While some bullies are arrogant and narcissistic, they can also use bullying as a tool to conceal shame or anxiety or to boost self-esteem: by demeaning others, the abuser feels empowered. Bullies may bully out of jealousy or because they themselves are bullied. Psychologist Roy Baumeister asserts that people who are prone to abusive behavior tend to have inflated but fragile egos. Because they think too highly of themselves, they are frequently offended by the criticisms and lack of deference of other people, and react to this disrespect with violence and insults.

Researchers have identified other risk factors such as depression and personality disorders, as well as quickness to anger and use of force, addiction to aggressive behaviors, mistaking others&#x27; actions as hostile, concern with preserving self-image, and engaging in obsessive or rigid actions. A combination of these factors may also be causes of this behavior. In one study of youth, a combination of antisocial traits and depression was found to be the best predictor of youth violence, whereas video game violence and television violence exposure were not predictive of these behaviors.

Bullying may also result from a genetic predisposition or a brain abnormality in the bully. While parents can help a toddler develop emotional regulation and control to restrict aggressive behavior, some children fail to develop these skills due to insecure attachment with their families, ineffective discipline, and environmental factors such as a stressful home life and hostile siblings. Moreover, according to some researchers, bullies may be inclined toward negativity and perform poorly academically. Dr. Cook says, &quot;A typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers.&quot;

Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers, while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized. Peer groups often promote the bully&#x27;s actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another as a source of entertainment. Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in-turn bullied, enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick.

Research indicates that adults who bully have authoritarian personalities, combined with a strong need to control or dominate. It has also been suggested that a prejudicial view of subordinates can be a particularly strong risk factor.

In a recent study, bullies showed lower school performance-related self-esteem than non-involved students. They also showed higher social self-esteem than victims of traditional bullying.

Brain studies have shown that the section of the brain associated with reward becomes active when bullies are shown a video of someone inflicting pain on another.

=== Bystanders ===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully&#x27;s ability to create the illusion they have the support of the majority present that instills the fear of &quot;speaking out&quot; in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the &quot;bully mentality&quot; is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, norm within the group.

Unless action is taken, a &quot;culture of bullying&quot; is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own &quot;friendship group&quot; or &quot;support group&quot; have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research to suggest interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression.

The Bystander effect can be detrimental to the person being bullied. People are less likely to stand up for someone or something when others are around. In the case of cyberbullying, people that see bullying happen on social media are less likely to say something back, whether online or in person. People can have good intentions and want to help, but with no action, nothing will be accomplished. &quot;The act of others stepping in is what will stop bullying&quot;. To stop the Bystander effect, people should be confident and stand up for what they believe in. Do not worry what people think of you, rather think of what the benefits can be for the person being bullied.

=== Victims ===
Dr. Cook says, &quot;A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers.&quot; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically and mentally weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.

Low levels of self-esteem has been identified as a frequent antecedent of bullying victimization. Victims of traditional bullying tend to have lower global, social, body-related, and emotional self-esteem compared to uninvolved students.
Victims of cyberbullying, on the other hand, may not have lower self-esteem scores than uninvolved students but might have higher body-related self-esteem than both victims of traditional bullying and bullies.

It has also been shown that victims are more likely to employ self-defeating or self-deprecating humor intended to entertain others at the expense of themselves and their own feelings.

The results of a meta-analysis conducted by Cook and published by the American Psychological Association in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also for becoming bullies, are the lack of social problem-solving skills.

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities, or in spending time with friends or family, reluctance to go out in public for fear they may encounter their bullies in public places other than school, and having an overall sense of sadness.

== Effects ==
Mona O&#x27;Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre at Trinity College in Dublin, has written, &quot;There is a growing body of research which indicates that individuals, whether child or adult, who are persistently subjected to abusive behavior are at risk of stress related illness which can sometimes lead to suicide.&quot;
Those who have been the targets of bullying can develop long-term emotional and behavioral problems. Bullying can cause loneliness, depression, anxiety, lead to low self-esteem and increased susceptibility to illness. Bullying has also been shown to cause maladjustment in young children, and targets of bullying who were also bullies themselves exhibit even greater social difficulties. A mental health report also found that bullying was linked to eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and other negative psychological effects. Both victims and perpetrators have been shown to exhibit higher levels of loneliness.

=== Suicide ===

Even though there is evidence that bullying increases the risk of suicide, bullying alone does not cause suicide. Depression is one of the main reasons why kids who are bullied die by suicide. It is estimated that between 15 and 25 children die by suicide every year in the UK alone because they are being bullied. Certain groups seem to incur a higher risk for suicide, such as Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, and LGBT people. When someone feels unsupported by family or friends, it can make the situation much worse for the victim.

In a self-report study completed in New York by 9th through 12th graders, victims of bullying reported more depressive symptoms and psychological distress than those who did not experience bullying. All types of involvement in bullying among both boys and girls is associated with depression even a couple years later. Another study that followed up with Finnish teens two years after the initial survey showed that depression and suicidal ideation is higher with teens who are bullied than those who did not report experiencing bullying. A Dutch longitudinal study on elementary students reported that boys who are bully-victims, who play both roles of a victim and a bully, were more likely to experience depression or serious suicidal ideation than the other roles, victims or bullies only, while girls who have any involvement in bullying have a higher level of risk for depression. In a study of high school students completed in Boston, students who self reported being victims of bullying were more likely to consider suicide when compared to youth who did not report being bullied. The same study also showed a higher risk of suicidal consideration in youth who report being a perpetrator, victim, or victim-perpetrator. Victims and victim-bullies are associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts. The place where youth live also appears to differentiate their bullying experiences such that those living in more urban areas who reported both being bullied and bullying others appear to show higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. A national survey given to American 6th through 10th grade students found that cyberbullying victims experience a higher level of depression than victims experiencing other forms of bullying. This can be related to the anonymity behind social media. If a teen is being bullied and is displaying symptoms of depression it should be questioned and interventions should be implemented. The Danish study showed that kids who are bullied talked to their parents and teachers about it and some reported a decrease in bullying or a stop in the bullying after a teacher or parent intervened. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing program-collaborations in schools to have programs and anti-bullying interventions in place to prevent and properly intervene when it occurs. The study also shows the importance of having parents and teachers talk to the bullies about their bullying behavior in order to provide the necessary support for those experiencing bullying.

While some people find it very easy to ignore a bully, others may find it very difficult and reach a breaking point. There have been cases of apparent bullying suicides that have been reported closely by the media. These include the deaths of Ryan Halligan, Phoebe Prince, Dawn-Marie Wesley, Nicola Ann Raphael, Megan Meier, Audrie Pott, Tyler Clementi, Jamey Rodemeyer, Kenneth Weishuhn, Jadin Bell, Kelly Yeomans, Rehtaeh Parsons, Amanda Todd, Brodie Panlock, Jessica Haffer, Hamed Nastoh, Sladjana Vidovic, April Himes, Cherice Moralez and Rebecca Ann Sedwick. According to the suicide awareness voices for education, suicide is one of the leading causes of death for youth from 15 to 24 years old. Over 16 percent of students seriously consider suicide, 13 percent create a plan, and 8 percent have made a serious attempt.

=== Strength and wisdom ===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child &quot;how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others&quot;, and that teachers should not intervene but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves. Others, however, have pointed out that this is only true for normal peer conflicts but not for bullying cases.

The teaching of anti-bullying coping skills to children, carers and teachers has been found to be an effective long-term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.

=== Testosterone production ===
Statistically controlling for age and pubertal status, results indicated that on average verbally bullied girls produced less testosterone, and verbally bullied boys produced more testosterone than their nonbullied counterparts.

== Dark triad ==

Research on the dark triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.

Studies have shown that bullying behavior is positively correlated with Dark Triad traits. Out of the three traits of the Dark Triad, psychopathy is most strongly correlated to bullying. It is posited that this is because aggression related to psychopathy is more likely to be unprovoked than Machiavellianism and narcissism. This holds true in traditional bullying as well as with cyberbullying. Psychopathy has the strongest correlations, followed by Machiavellianism, and narcissism. Although the lower of the three, narcissism is still correlated, being more prevalent in types of indirect bullying than physical bullying.

== Projection ==

A bully may project their own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully&#x27;s typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully&#x27;s targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully&#x27;s own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability. Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.

== Emotional intelligence ==

Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence (EI). Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as &quot;accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion&quot;. The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.

== Context ==

=== Internet ===

Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of authoritative (including parental) supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, and social networking sites. Particular watchdog organizations have been designed to contain the spread of cyberbullying.

=== Disability ===

Disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime. The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled, such as wheelchair users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip, but also those with developmental disabilities such as autism and developmental coordination disorder.

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.

=== Homosexuality ===

Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect verbal or physical actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying, as well as be bullied.

=== Law ===

Legal bullying is the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person. Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant&#x27;s request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant&#x27;s position, but principally due to the defendant&#x27;s inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP). It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the protests against SOPA and PIPA in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

=== Military ===

In 2000, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) defined bullying as &quot;the use of physical strength or the abuse of authority to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments&quot;.

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which &quot;soldiering&quot; is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.

=== Parenting ===

Parents who may displace their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and control upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.
The American Psychological Association advises on its website that parents who may suspect their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.

=== Prison ===

The prison environment is known for bullying. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus, the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

=== School ===
It is important to distinguish school bullying that per definition has the goal of harming the victim from normal peer conflict that is an inherent part of everyday school life and often promotes social development. Unlike normal conflict, bullying is a systematic and repeated abuse committed intentionally by another student who has more power (physical, social, or otherwise). School bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. The 2011 documentary &quot;Bully&quot; showcases the lives of five American public school students who face bullying in school and while on the school bus. The bullying is shown to affect the students both at school and in their homes.

Teachers play an important role in bullying prevention and intervention because they are the adults who spend most of their time with the students.
Bullying can, however, also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse (relational aggression or passive aggression), humiliation, or exclusioneven while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.

In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the &quot;duty of care&quot; that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (&quot;Oyston v. St. Patricks College&quot;, 2013).

=== Gendered ===
Sexual bullying is &quot;any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person&#x27;s sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person&#x27;s face, behind their back or through the use of technology.&quot;

=== Transsexuality ===

Trans bashing is the act of victimizing a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are transgender or transsexual. Unlike gay bashing, it is committed because of the target&#x27;s actual or perceived gender identity, not sexual orientation.

=== Work ===

Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of school bullying, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. Bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.

The first known documented use of &quot;workplace bullying&quot; is in 1992 in a book by Andrea Adams called &quot;Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It&quot;.

Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture. A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review has found very low quality evidence to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace.

==== Academia ====

Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.

==== Blue-collar jobs ====
Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue-collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a vicious circle. This is often used in combination with manipulation and coercion of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking administrators.

==== Information technology ====

A culture of bullying is common in information technology (IT), leading to high sickness rates, low morale, poor productivity, and high staff-turnover. Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT workers.

==== Courts ====

Bullying in the legal profession is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this. Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more affected, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.

==== Medicine ====

Bullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

Even though The American Nurses Association believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.

==== Teaching ====

School teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== Machines ===
Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots&#x27; paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as &quot;human-like&quot; yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot did so &quot;for enjoyment&quot;.

== Prevention ==

Bullying prevention is the collective effort to prevent, reduce and stop bullying. Many campaigns and events are designated to bullying prevention throughout the world. Bullying prevention campaigns and events include Anti-Bullying Day, Anti-Bullying Week, International Day of Pink, International STAND UP to Bullying Day and National Bullying Prevention Month. Anti-bullying laws in the U.S. have also been enacted in 23 of its 50 states, making bullying in schools illegal.

A 2019 study by McCallion &amp; Feder found that school-based anti-bullying programs may lower the incidence of bullying by 25%.

Bullying prevention programs allow schools to help decrease cyberbullying within the realm of school. The prevention methods are targeted mainly for middle schoolers, where we see the most bullying occur. To help decrease cyberbullying, people need to take preventative measures. One preventative method was implemented to determine the effectiveness against cyberbullying. This program called &quot;Media Heroes&quot; showed how educating teachers on bullying behaviors in school can help them educate and stop students from bullying. This educational program decreased bullying in their schools. Having trusted adults become educated on what can go on online, can help prevent further cyberbullying.

== Responses ==
Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour. Common responses are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies, or to turn to an authority figure.

Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.
It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.
Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.

Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents or teachers in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings. In the school context, teachers who set clear boundaries, communicate seriously that bullying behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated, and involve school administrators have been shown to reduce bullying. Discussing bullying and its consequences with the whole class is also an important intervention that not only reduces bullying, but also encourages other students to step in and stop bullying even before it reaches its full form. In general, authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment that does not encourage or promote bullying.

In many situations, authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.
In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.
Some of the most effective ways to respond are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and to create an environment where it will not continue.

<doc id="432460" wikidata="Q1141474" url="?curid=432460" title="Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi">
<text>was one of the most famous and romanticized of the samurai in Japan&#x27;s feudal era.

==Life==
Very little is known about the actual life of Yagyū Mitsuyoshi as the official records of his life are very sparse. Yagyū Jūbē Mitsuyoshi (born &quot;Shichirō&quot;) grew up in his family&#x27;s ancestral lands, Yagyū no Sato, now in Nara. He was the son of Yagyū Tajima no Kami Munenori, master swordsman of the Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot;, especially Ieyasu and Tokugawa Iemitsu, who prized Munenori as one of his top Counselors .

Munenori fought for the first Tokugawa shōgun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, at the Battle of Sekigahara, expanding the shōgun&#x27;s territory. For his efforts, Munenori was made the shōgun&#x27;s sword instructor and a minor &quot;daimyō&quot; (provincial ruler), by extending his family hereditary domain up to 10,000 koku. Despite not being the heir of his father as the headmaster of the Yagyū style (and thus far from being an unrivaled swordsman under the Heaven), he received the post for its importance in Japanese politics and Court intrigues, at which Munenori was better than the other members of his clan. Munenori would go on to train three successive Shoguns: Ieyasu, Hidetada, and Iemitsu.

In 1616, Mitsuyoshi became an attendant in the court of the second Tokugawa Shōgun, Tokugawa Hidetada and became a sword instructor for the third Tokugawa Shōgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, occasionally filling his father&#x27;s role. Records of Yagyū Jūbē Mitsuyoshi, however, do not appear again until 1631, when Jūbē, by now regarded as the best swordsman from the Yagyū clan, is summarily and inexplicably dismissed by the Shōgun either due to Jūbē&#x27;s boldness and brashness or his decision to embark on a Warrior&#x27;s Pilgrimage (, &quot;Musha Shugyō&quot;).

His whereabouts are then unknown over the next twelve years—even the Yagyū clan&#x27;s secret chronicles, which contained lengthy passages on numerous members, has little solid information on Jūbē—until Yagyū Jūbē reappears at the age of 36 at a demonstration of swordsmanship in front of the Shōgun. Following this exhibition, Jūbē was reinstated and serves for a short time as a government-inspector (, &quot;Gosho Inban&quot;), taking control over his father&#x27;s lands until Yagyū Tajima no Kami Munenori&#x27;s death in 1646.

Jūbē also authored a treatise known as &quot;Tsuki no Shō&quot; () or &quot;The Art of Looking at the Moon&quot; outlining his school of swordsmanship as well as teachings influenced by the monk Takuan Sōhō who was a friend of his father&#x27;s. In this work he briefly provides hints on his whereabouts during his absence from Edo Castle from 1631 to 1643 – traveling the countryside in perfecting his skills.

==Death==
After residing in Edo for several years after his father&#x27;s death, Jūbē left his government duties and returned to his home village where he died in early 1650 under uncertain circumstances. Some accounts say he died of a heart attack; others say he died while falcon hunting; some during fishing, while still others presume he was assassinated by his half-brother Yagyū Tomonori&#x27;s attendants.

Jūbē was laid to rest in his home village of Yagyu behind the family temple of Hotojukuji alongside his father and brother. In keeping with tradition, Yagyū Jūbē was buried alongside his grandfather, Yagyū Munetoshi, and was survived by two daughters and his brother and successor Yagyū Munefuyu. Jūbē was given the Buddhist posthumous name of Sohgo.

==Eyepatch legend==
Legend has it that Yagyū Jūbē had the use of only one eye; most legends state that he lost it in a sword sparring session where his father, Yagyū Munenori, struck him accidentally. However, portraits from Jubei&#x27;s time portray him as having both eyes. Several authors of late have chosen to portray Jūbē as having both eyes, though the classical &quot;eyepatch&quot; look remains standard. Others have chosen to have Jūbē lose an eye as an adult in order to incorporate the eyepatch legend.

==Fictional appearances==
Due to Yagyū Jūbē&#x27;s frequent disappearances and the fact of little existing records of his whereabouts, his life has bred speculation and interest and has been romanticized in popular fiction.

<text>Pokémon Pikachu, also known as in Japan, is a limited series of two portable &quot;Pokémon&quot; digital pets (similar to Tamagotchi) featuring the famous yellow electric-type Pokémon, Pikachu. It debuted on March 27, 1998, in Japan, on November 2, 1998 in North America, and in December 1998 in Europe.

==Gameplay==
The first release, a yellow unit resembling a Game Boy, features a black and white LCD screen used to display animations of Pikachu&#x27;s activities. Gameplay differs slightly from other portable virtual pets in that Pikachu does not need to be fed, watered, or cleaned up after. Instead, the Pokémon Pikachu unit can be strapped to a belt and used as a pedometer. With every twenty steps it counts, the Pokémon Pikachu credits its user with one watt, a virtual currency used to buy Pikachu presents. Additional activities become available as the player spends more time with their virtual Pikachu. If neglected, Pikachu will express anger and eventually refuse to recognize the player.

The second release, Pokémon Pikachu 2, is available in six different variants. In the United States, the device was produced with new text, &#x27;GS&#x27; and &#x27;Pokémon Pikachu 2&#x27;. The shell is silver with a sparkle effect and has a Pikachu silhouette. In Japan, there were four different shells released. The standard release was a see-through shell with &#x27;Pocket Pikachu&#x27; and &#x27;Color&#x27; on the screen, with white buttons and a Pikachu silhouette (different than the USA release). Additionally, there was a silver/white &#x27;Pearl&#x27; shell with a Pikachu silhouette sold at Pokémon Centers, a clear blue shell sold at Ito Yokado 7-Eleven, and a limited edition solid &#x27;Italian blue&#x27; shell with white buttons sold at Halomac. In Europe, the device was similar to the Japanese release with &#x27;Pocket Pikachu&#x27; and &#x27;Color&#x27; on the screen. It featured a transparent shell with black buttons and a Pikachu silhouette (the same as the USA release). 

The Pokémon Pikachu 2 features more animations. It also features an infrared port for interacting with &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot; via the Mystery Gift option, which utilizes the Game Boy Color&#x27;s built-in infrared communication port. This allows players to trade watts for items in the Game Boy games. Although there is a limitation on how much the Mystery Gift mode can be used between Game Boy cartridges, Pokémon Pikachu&#x27;s only limit is that of available watts (and it is region locked). Watts can also be sent to other &quot;Pokémon Pikachu 2&quot; units.

==Other models==
&quot;Pokémon&quot; and its character Pikachu are not the only media franchises that are used by this Nintendo-made device. Sakura Taisen, a media franchise of SEGA and licensed by RED Entertainment released a virtual-pet with pedometer, in the same style as the Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, called Pocket Sakura (ポケットサクラ) and Sakura Taisen GB, developed by Jupiter. Sega could not publish either, due to their rivalry with Nintendo.

Similarly, Sanrio, responsible for the Hello Kitty franchise, licensed to Nintendo the development of the Pocket Hello Kitty. This featured a similar design to the first Pokémon Pikachu, with a game based on Hello Kitty and her friends, available in a pink-colored case. Pocket Hello Kitty was released in Japan on August 21, 1998.

==Pokéwalker==
In 2009, a device similar to the Pokémon Pikachu called the Pokéwalker, came packaged with &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot; which communicates directly with the Nintendo DS game cards via infrared. It allowed the player to transfer one Pokémon at a time from their &quot;HeartGold&quot; or &quot;SoulSilver&quot;. The user is able to catch Pokémon and find items by spending watts.

<text>HMAS &quot;Assail&quot; (P 89) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Assail&quot; was built by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland, launched on 18 November 1967, and commissioned on 12 July 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Assail&quot; paid off on 18 October 1985, and was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed KRI &quot;Sigurot&quot; (864). The patrol boat was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

<text>HMAS &quot;Attack&quot; (P 90) was the lead ship of the s used by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Launched in April 1967 and commissioned in November that year, the ship was largely commercial in design and was used to protect fisheries in Australia&#x27;s northern waters, and to support the survey ship . The vessel remained in RAN service until 1985 when it was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed &quot;Sikuda&quot;.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were later ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. The vessels&#x27; propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers, producing a top speed of and a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Its main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Attack&quot; was built by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland, launched on 8 April 1967 and commissioned on 17 November 1967. Although it was the lead ship of the class, &quot;Attack&quot; was the second ship commissioned into the RAN, four days behind .

==Operational history==
Following its commission, &quot;Attack&quot; served in the RAN for 17 years, during which time it was employed mainly in the waters to Australia&#x27;s north, protecting fisheries. It was also used to support survey work conducted by . &quot;Attack&quot; paid off on 21 February 1985. She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy on 24 May 1985 and renamed &quot;Sikuda&quot;.

<doc id="432482" wikidata="Q3892190" url="?curid=432482" title="Music of Cornwall">
<text>Cornwall is a Celtic nation with a long musical history. Strengthened by a series of 20th century revivals, traditional folk music has a popular following. It is accompanied by traditions of pipers, brass and silver bands, male voice choirs, classical, electronic and popular music.

==History==
In medieval Cornwall there are records of performances of ‘Miracle Plays’ in the Cornish language, with considerable musical involvement. Also (as frequently mentioned in the Launceston borough accounts) minstrels were hired to play for saints day celebrations. The richest families (including Arundell, Bodrugan, Bottreaux, Grenville, and Edgcumbe) retained their own minstrels, and many others employed minstrels on a casual basis. There were vigorous traditions of Morris dancing, mumming, guise dancing, and social dance.

During the Twelve Days of Christmas between 1466-67, the household accounts of the Arundells of Lanherne, Mawgan-in-Pydar, record expenditures to buy white bonnets for minstrels, cloth and bells for Morris dancers, as well as materials for costumes for the &quot;disgysing&quot; (mummers or guise dancers), an activity which involved music and dancing.

Then followed a long period of contention which included the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, the 1549 Prayer Book Rebellion, the Persecution of Recusants, the Poor Laws, and the English Civil War and Commonwealth (1642–1660). The consequences of these events disadvantaged many gentry who had previously employed their own minstrels or patronised itinerant performers. Over the same period in art music the use of modes was largely supplanted by use of major and minor keys. Altogether it was an extended cultural revolution, and it is unlikely that there were not musical casualties.

===18th and 19th centuries===
A number of manuscripts of dance music from the period 1750 to 1850 have been found which tell of renewed patronage, employment of dancing masters, and a repertoire that spanned class barriers. Seasonal and community festivals, mumming and guise dancing all flourished.

In the 19th century, the nonconformist and temperance movements were strong: these frowned on dancing and music, encouraged the demise of many customs, but fostered the choral and brass band traditions. Some traditional tunes were used for hymns and carols. Church Feast Days and Sunday School treats were widespread—a whole village processing behind a band of musicians leading them to a picnic site, where &quot;Tea Treat Buns&quot; (made with smuggled saffron) were distributed. This left a legacy of marches and polkas. Records exist of dancing in farmhouse kitchens, and in fish cellars Cornish ceilidhs called troyls were common, they are analogous to the fest-noz of the Bretons. Some community events survived, such as at Padstow and at Helston, where to this day, on 8 May, the townspeople dance the Furry Dance through the streets, in and out of shops, even through private houses. Thousands converge on Helston to witness the spectacle. The &quot;Sans Day Carol&quot; or &quot;St Day Carol&quot; is one of the many Cornish Christmas carols written in the 19th century. This carol and its melody were first transcribed from the singing of a villager in St Day in the parish of Gwennap: the lyrics are similar to those of &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;.

In Anglican churches the church bands (a few local musicians providing accompaniment in services) were replaced by keyboard instruments (harmonium, piano or organ) and singing in unison became more usual.

===Vocal music===
Folk songs include &quot;Sweet Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Little Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Lamorna&quot;. Few traditional Cornish lyrics survived the decline of the language. In some cases lyrics of common English songs became attached to older Cornish tunes. Some folk tunes have Cornish lyrics written since the language revival of the 1920s. Sport has also been an outlet for many Cornish folk songs, and &quot;Trelawny&quot;, the unofficial Cornish national anthem, is often sung by Cornish rugby fans, along with other favourites such as &quot;Camborne Hill&quot; and &quot;The White Rose&quot;. The Cornish anthem that has been used by Gorseth Kernow for the last 75 plus years is &quot;Bro Goth Agan Tasow&quot; (&quot;The Land of My Fathers&quot;, or, literally, &quot;Old Country of our Fathers&quot;) with a similar tune to the Welsh national anthem (&quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;) and the Breton national anthem (&quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot;). &quot;Bro Goth Agan Tasow&quot; is not heard so often, as it is sung in Cornish. Other popular Cornish anthems are &quot;Hail to the Homeland&quot; and Cornwall My Home by Harry Glasson written in 1997.
Sabine Baring-Gould compiled &quot;Songs of the West&quot;, which contains folk songs from Devon and Cornwall, in collaboration with Henry Fleetwood Sheppard and F. W. Bussell. &quot;Songs of the West&quot; was published by Methuen in conjunction with Watey and Willis; the first edition appeared both as a four-part set, undated, and as one volume dated 1895. In a new edition songs omitted from the first edition were listed, and the music was edited by Cecil Sharp. The second edition mentions the third collaborator, the Rev. Dr. F. W. Bussell, a scholarly eccentric who later became Vice-President of Brasenose College, Oxford. Sheppard was Rector of Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, and his parochial duties limited the amount of time he could spend on the work. In Plymouth City Library are two manuscript volumes containing the material as collected, in all 202 songs with music. In the published work it was necessary to bowdlerise some songs so that the book would be acceptable to respectable Victorians.

In Cornwall, the carol &quot;While shepherds watched their flocks&quot; is popularly sung to &quot;Lyngham&quot;, a tune usually associated with &quot;O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing&quot;. Another tune traditionally used for it in Cornwall is &quot;Northrop&quot;.

===Dances===

Cornish dances include community dances such a &#x27;furry dances&#x27;, social (set) dances, linear and circle dances originating in carols and farandoles, and step dances – often competitive. Among the social dances is &#x27;Joan Sanderson&#x27;, the cushion dance from the 19th century, but with 17th-century origins.

The English composer Sir Malcolm Arnold composed &quot;Four Cornish Dances&quot; in 1966 which is influenced by characteristically Cornish types of music.

===Breton connection===
Cornish music is often noted for its similarity to that of Brittany; some older songs and carols share the same root as Breton tunes. From Cornwall, Brittany was more easily accessible than London. Breton and Cornish were (and are) mutually intelligible. There was much cultural and marital exchange between the two countries and this influenced both music and dance.

== Instrumentation ==
Cornish musicians have used a variety of traditional instruments. Documentary sources and Cornish iconography (as at Altarnun church on Bodmin Moor and St. Mary&#x27;s, Launceston) suggest a late-medieval line-up might include a crwth (or &quot;crowd&quot;, similar to a violin), bombarde (&quot;horn-pipe&quot;), bagpipes and harp. The &quot;crowdy crawn&quot; (a drum) with a crwth or fiddle were popular by the 19th century. In the 1920s there was a serious school of banjo playing in Cornwall. After 1945 accordions became progressively more popular, before being joined by the instruments of the 1980s folk revival. In recent years Cornish bagpipes have enjoyed a progressive revival.

==Modern==
Modern Cornish musicians include the late Brenda Wootton (folksinger in Cornish and English), Dalla who specialised in Cornish Celtic dance music and also traditional songs in Cornish and in English, the Cornish-Breton family band Anao Atao, the late 1960s band The Onyx and the 1980s band Bucca. Recently bands Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have begun performing British folk rock in the Cornish language.

Kyt Le Nen Davey, a multi-instrumental Cornish musician, established a not-for-profit collaborative organisation, Kesson, to distribute Cornish music to a world audience. Today, the site has moved with the times, and now provides individual track downloads, alongside traditional CD format.

Pioneering Techno artist Richard D. James (aka Aphex Twin) from Lanner is a contemporary Cornish musician, frequently naming tracks in the Cornish language. Along with friend and collaborator Luke Vibert and business partner Grant Wilson-Claridge, James has crafted a niche of &#x27;Cornish Acid&#x27; affectionately identified with his home region.

Bands such as Dalla and Sowena are associated with the &quot;nos lowen&quot; style of Cornish dance and music, which follows the Breton style of uncalled line dances. Troyls, usually called in a ceilidh style, occur across Cornwall with bands including the North Cornwall Ceilidh Band, The Brim, the Bolingey Troyl band, Hevva, Ros Keltek and Tros an Treys.Skwardya and Krena play rock, punk and garage music in the Cornish language. The &quot;Cornwall Songwriters&quot; organisation has since 2001 produced two folk operas &#x27;The Cry of Tin&#x27; and &#x27;Unsung Heroes&#x27;. Also Cornwall has a selection of up and coming young bands such as &quot;Heart in One Hand&quot; and &quot;The small print&quot;.

3 Daft Monkeys (Tim Ashton, Athene Roberts, and Jamie Waters) combine vocals, fiddle, 12-string guitar, bass guitar and foot drum to play a fusion of Celtic, Balkan, Gypsy, Latino, dance, dub, punk, reggae and traditional folk music. The band have played at venues and festivals all over the UK and Europe, including Eden Project, the 2008 BBC Proms, Guilfest, Glastonbury Festival and the Beautiful Days festival, as well as supporting The Levellers..

Black Friday, a six piece Celtic-folk-punk band have been a constant part of the live music scene in Cornwall for two decades and a popular highlight of a number of Cornwall festivals including Port Eliot Festival, Little Orchard and Boardmasters as well a number of major UK and European festivals such as Donous Insel Fest, Electric picnic, Boomtown and Glastonbury. The band have led mass sing a longs to songs popular in the Cornish singing traditions such as Little Eyes and South Australia and they have supported Madness, Ralph McTell and The Mahones. The band performs across numerous smaller venues every weekend of the year, sometimes up to five or six times and there industrious live schedule and constant touring is perhaps why they have only ever released live recordings and never produced a studio album yet have managed to achieve a Guinness world record playing 30 gigs in twelve hours. 

Crowns are a &#x27;fish-punk&#x27; band originating from Launceston, playing a mix of traditional Cornish songs and their own compositions. They have played Reading and Leeds festivals, the Eden Sessions and gained support slots with The Pogues, Blink 182 and Brandon Flowers. Their music has featured on Radio 1 and XFm.

The underground scene includes rappers Hedluv + Passman, multi-instrumentalist Julian Gaskell and alternative folk/skiffle duo Zapoppin’.

Sic, the singer of the Dutch pagan folk band Omnia hails from Cornwall and wrote a song named &quot;Cornwall&quot; about his homeland. During gigs by Omnia the Cornish flag is displayed on stage when this song is performed.

In 2012 the folksinger and writer Anna Clifford-Tait released &#x27;Sorrow&#x27;, a song written in Cornish and English.

Fisherman&#x27;s Friends is a male vocal group from Port Isaac specialising in the sea shanty repertoire.

The Cornwall Folk Festival has been held annually for more than three decades and in 2008 was staged at Wadebridge. Other festivals are the pan-Celtic Lowender Peran and midsummer festival Golowan. Cornwall won the PanCeltic Song Contest three years in a row between 2003 and 2005.

The Welsh musician Gwenno Saunders has written and recorded songs in Cornish, notably Amser on her album Y Dydd Olaf, while her album Le Kov was recorded entirely in Cornish. Gwenno&#x27;s sister, Ani Glass, also records in Cornish, and the title song of her album Mirores is in Cornish. Both are bards of the Cornish Gorsedh. 

Classical musicians from Cornwall include baritone Benjamin Luxon, born in Redruth, and composer Graham Fitkin, born in Crows-an-Wra.

<text>The Battle of Scimitar Hill (Turkish: Yusufçuk Tepe Muharebesi, literally: &quot;Battle of the Dragonfly Hill&quot;) was the last offensive mounted by the British at Suvla during the Battle of Gallipoli in World War I. It was also the largest single-day attack ever mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli, involving three divisions. The purpose of the attack was to remove the immediate Ottoman threat from the exposed Suvla landing and to link with the ANZAC sectors to the south. Launched on 21 August 1915 to coincide with the simultaneous attack on Hill 60, it was a costly failure, in which the Turks were forced to use all their reserves in &quot;severe and bloody fighting&quot; far into the night, with some Turkish trenches lost and retaken twice.

==Prelude==
Paralysis had set in to the British campaign in the Dardanelles after repeated failures to advance at Helles on the tip of the peninsula since the original 25 April landings. In August a new offensive, known as the Battle of Sari Bair, was opened at Suvla in an attempt to regain the initiative from the Ottomans. Two divisions of Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford&#x27;s IX Corps were landed at Suvla on the night of 6 August while a simultaneous breakout was made from the long-stagnant Anzac sector to the south of Suvla.

Scimitar Hill, so named because of its curved summit, and the neighbouring W Hills to the south were part of the Anafarta Spur that marked the southern edge of the Suvla sector. Their capture had originally been first-day (7 August) objectives but General Stopford was exceedingly hesitant about making any major advances without artillery support. Consequently, the troops of the British 11th (Northern) Division (which had made the initial landing on the night of 6 August) and the 10th (Irish) Division (which had landed the following morning) did not advance from the immediate environs of the beach until 8 August, by which time they were already exhausted from lack of water and being under constant shrapnel and sniper fire.

On the morning of 9 August, the British made their first effort to advance towards the high ground to the east, a ridge called Tekke Tepe. Scimitar Hill, which guarded the approach to this ridge from the southwest along the Anafarta Spur, had been captured unopposed by the 6th Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment, on 8 August but was then abandoned. The British attempted to recapture the hill on 9 August and in the intense fighting it changed hands a number of times before the British were forced off around midday. Despite the arrival of reinforcements in the form of the 53rd (Welsh) Division on 9 August and the 54th (East Anglian) Division on 10 August, any hopes the British had of a swift victory at Suvla were now gone as the Ottomans consolidated their hold on the surrounding ridges.

On 10 August the 53rd Division made another attack at Scimitar Hill, which was another massive failure for the British and effectively ruined the division as a fighting unit within two days of its landing.

==Battle==
On 15 August Stopford was sacked and Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle, commander of the 29th Division, was made temporary commander of IX Corps until Lieutenant-General Julian Byng could be sent from France. De Lisle abandoned any immediate thoughts of a major offensive — preparations for a major push by the 54th Division had been made at great cost but little effect on 12 August. Instead, he intended to secure the ground he held and make a strong link to Anzac to the south, where, as at Suvla, the original August objectives had proven unreachable. This required the capture of Scimitar Hill, the W Hills and Hill 60.

To make the attack from Suvla, De Lisle had the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division and the 29th Division, which had moved from Helles where it had borne the brunt of the fighting since the landings of 25 April. The plan for 21 August was to attack Scimitar Hill with the 29th Division and the W Hills with the 11th Division, keeping the yeomanry in reserve near the beach. As was so often the case at Gallipoli, the preliminary artillery barrage looked impressive but achieved little. The British had no sight of their targets, which were obscured by mist and smoke, whereas the Ottoman artillery had a clear view of the entire Suvla battlefield and ample opportunity to register their targets.

The 11th Division attempt to capture the W Hills, collapsed in confusion when confronted by an Ottoman strong-point and artillery fire. As a consequence when the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers managed to capture the summit of Scimitar Hill, they found themselves under fire from the defenders higher up the Anafarta Spur to the east and from the W Hills to the south. The Irish retreated from the summit while the undergrowth around them was set ablaze by the shellfire, incinerating the wounded as they lay helpless.

Around the troops of the 2nd Mounted Division were ordered forward from their reserve position on Lala Baba, near the beach. They advanced, marching in formation, across the bed of a dry salt lake. By this time the air was clouded by mist and smoke so that they had little idea of where they were going. The of the five brigades formed in columns by regiment and, marching in extended order, were easy targets for the shrapnel. Most of them halted in the cover of Green Hill, west of Scimitar Hill but Brigadier-General Lord Longford, led his 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade in a charge over Green Hill and up to the summit of Scimitar Hill. Continuing on, Lord Longford was cut off and killed. The yeomanry too were driven from the summit. The attack at Scimitar Hill on 21 August was the last attempt by the British to advance at Suvla. The front line remained between Green Hill and Scimitar Hill for the remainder of the campaign until the evacuation on 20 December.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
In one day of fighting the British suffered 5,300 casualties out of the 14,300 soldiers who participated.

===Victoria Cross===
The only two Victoria Crosses awarded at Suvla were made for rescuing of wounded at Scimitar Hill, one on 9 August by Captain Percy Hansen and the other following the 21 August battle by Private Frederick Potts.

<text>Cana of [[Galilee]] (; ) is the location of the Wedding at Cana, at which the miracle of turning water into wine took place in the Gospel of John. 

The location is disputed, with the four primary locations being Kafr Kanna, Khirbet Qana and Reineh in Lower Galilee and Qana in Upper Galilee in Lebanon. The Arabic name &quot;Qana al-Jalil&quot; has been said to apply to a number of sites. 
The name possibly derives from the Hebrew or Aramaic word for &quot;reeds&quot;.

== Written references to Cana ==

===Biblical references===

Among Christians and other students of the New Testament, Cana is best known as the place where, according to the Fourth Gospel, Jesus performed &quot;the first of his signs&quot;, his first public miracle, the turning of a large quantity of water into wine at a wedding feast (John 2, ) when the wine provided by the bridegroom had run out. Although none of the synoptic gospels record the event, mainstream Christian tradition holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus.

The other biblical references to Cana are also in John: John 4 (), which mentions that Jesus is visiting Cana when he is asked to heal the son of a royal official at Capernaum; and John 21 (), where it is mentioned that Nathanael (sometimes identified with the Bartholomew included in the synoptic gospels&#x27; lists of apostles) comes from Cana.

The Book of Joshua mentions one city () and one brook (; ) named Kanah (Cana) – neither is likely to be the Cana of Galilee.

===Other references===
In secular history, the annals of Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III, who conquered the Galilee in a 733 BC campaign, contain a badly preserved list of cities that had been thought to mention a certain &quot;Kana&quot;. It relates that six hundred fifty captives were taken there. However, a revised transliteration revealed the one well-preserved syllable to be &quot;Ku&quot;, not &quot;Ka&quot;.

Flavius Josephus mentions more than one place named Cana. In the context of the Galilee, there are two mentions in his &quot;Life&quot;: one is a place on the road from Iulias, and the other is a place where he resided, about a day&#x27;s walk from Tiberias.

==Locating Cana==

There has been much speculation about where Cana might be. In his Gospel, the author makes no claim to have been at the wedding. Many would regard the story of the wedding at Cana as of theological rather than historical or topographical significance; it is the first of the seven miraculous &quot;signs&quot; by which Jesus&#x27;s divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured.

The consensus of modern scholarship is that the Fourth Gospel was addressed to a group of Jewish Christians, and very possibly a group living in Judea province; so it is unlikely that the evangelist would have mentioned a place that did not exist. There is a minority view that the gospel was written for a gentile audience, and those who take this view assert that the description in the passage about the marriage at Cana of &quot;six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification&quot;, in spite of reflecting good knowledge of the ritual washing habits among Jews at the time, is specifically for a gentile audience, who would not know the topography of the Holy Land. On this hypothesis, the name &quot;Cana&quot; might have some purely symbolic significance.

There are four primary locations which have been under consideration as the New Testament Cana:

*Upper Galilee
** Qana, Lebanon 
*Lower Galilee
** Kafr Kanna, Israel (also spelled Kefar Kenna)
*** Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna
** Khirbet Qana, Israel
** Ain Qana, Israel

===Qana, Lebanon===
The village of Qana, about from Tyre, Lebanon, is traditionally held to be the correct site by most Christians, and is Eusebius&#x27;s pick in his 4th century &quot;Onomasticon&quot;. It is a popular tourist site commemorating the miracle.

===Kafr Kanna and Karm er-Ras===
The first time this site is associated with New Testament Cana is in a mid-17th century report to the Pope by Francesco Quaresimo, the papal emissary to Palestine, where he noted there were two possible candidates: Khirbet Qana and Kafr Kanna. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, a tradition dating back to the 8th century identifies Cana with the modern Arab town of Kafr Kanna, at the foot of the Nazareth range, about northeast of Nazareth.

Some scholars believe, according to archaeological evidence, that the identification of Kafr Kanna was the result of the decline of Khirbet Qana beginning in the Mamluk period. They note that it was a common practice for new and more affluent and easily accessible sites to be established in place of old ones to accommodate increases in pilgrim traffic, particularly in the late Medieval and Ottoman periods.

Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna, was recently excavated by Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre. The excavation revealed evidence of a substantial Roman village with a Jewish population which declined considerably in the Late Roman period, and which was finally abandoned in the Byzantine Period, explaining why the pilgrim route was shifted to Kafr Kanna. Alexandre believes the site is precisely identified by Josephus, but other scholars disagree.

===Khirbet Kana, Israel===
Another possible candidate is the ruined village of &quot;Khirbet Qana&quot;, meaning &quot;the ruins of Cana.&quot; Overlooking the Beit Netofa Valley from the north, it is located about north of Kafr Kanna and has been noticed by pilgrims since the 12th century or earlier. However, this could either be an ancient retention, as Edward Robinson maintained, or may have been attached to the place in conversation with querying pilgrims.

This site is located on a limestone outcropping that rises above the floor of the Bet Netofa Valley, from Nazareth and northeast of Sepphoris in lower Galilee. It also has long been identified as the true location of New Testament Cana. Excavations by archaeologist Douglas Edwards of the University of Puget Sound and archaeologist Tom McCollough reveal architectural and numismatic remains demonstrating that the site contained a modest-sized village from the Hellenistic period onward (c. 200 BCE–650 CE), including a structure that bears similarities to Roman-period synagogues, and several &quot;mikveh&quot; pools for Jewish ceremonial bathing. Most importantly, they uncovered a cave complex on the south slope of the site that showed indications of use as a center for worship, including a sarcophagus lid or altar and a shelf that held two stone vessels &quot;in situ&quot;, and space for another four vessels, suggesting that Khirbet Kana was regarded as New Testament Cana from a very early time. Remains of an Arab village and a church or monastery were also uncovered immediately south of the cave complex.

Other historical evidence from the Byzantine and Medieval periods show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by Theodosius between 517 and 527 CE titled &quot;The Layout of the Holy Land&quot; identifies Khirbet Kana and indicates that two of the vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by Saewulf in 1101 to 1103 CE also identifies the site, as do Belard of Ascoli (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar Burchard of Mount Sion (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer Petrus Vesconte in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion describes a cave complex located there that was used as a veneration site: &quot;the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and the dining-room where the tables were placed.&quot;

===&#x27;Ain Kanah, Reineh, Israel===
Just about 1.5 miles northeast from Nazareth is the Arab town of Reineh, and on the way out of it toward Mount Tabor there is a small spring named &#x27;Ain Kânah, which was identified by Claude Reignier Conder his &quot;Tent Work in Palestine&quot; (1878) as the better candidate for the location of Cana, based on etymological grounds. Some early Christian pilgrim reports mention a spring in association with the Cana of Galilee, but no excavations have been conducted there yet.

<text>Washburn University (WU), formally Washburn University of Topeka, is a public university in Topeka, Kansas, United States. It offers undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as professional programs in law and business. Washburn has 550 faculty members, who teach more than 6,100 undergraduate students and nearly 800 graduate students. The university&#x27;s assets include a $158 million endowment. As of 2008, Washburn also took over overseeing the technical school in the area, Washburn Tech.

==History==
Washburn University was established at Topeka, Kansas, in February 1865 as &quot;Lincoln College&quot;, by a charter issued by the State of Kansas and the General Association of Congregational Ministers and Churches of Kansas; the land on which the college stood was donated by abolitionist John Ritchie. The institution was renamed &quot;Washburn College&quot; in 1868, after Ichabod Washburn pledged $25,000 to the school. Washburn was a church deacon, , and industrialist who lived in Worcester, Massachusetts.

 Washburn College adopted a variation of the Washbourne arms as its emblem, substituting the school colors for the tinctures of the arms. Since becoming a university, however, Washburn has abandoned use of the family arms. Instead, the university now employs a stylized &quot;W&quot; as the emblem of the institution. The school mascot, &quot;The Ichabod&quot;, is still in use.

&quot;The Ichabod&quot; honors the namesake and early benefactor of the institution, Ichabod Washburn. &quot;The Ichabod&quot; existed only in name until 1938, when alumnus (and later prominent graphic artist) Bradbury Thompson (B.A., 1934) created the studious-looking, tailcoat-wearing figure the university uses today. The athletic teams are nicknamed &quot;Ichabods&quot;, although women&#x27;s teams did not use that nickname until the 2013–14 school year.

In 1913, the medical department of Washburn College closed. The medical school had become infamous on December 10, 1895, when the public discovered that some of the bodies used for anatomical study had been stolen from local cemeteries. As the news was being printed (eventually across the country), the governor, fearing riots, called out state troops to protect the school. Three of the doctors, including the dean of the school, and a student-janitor from the school were arrested, as was one man who was not a member of the school. Charges against the doctors were discharged, the janitor was convicted but had his conviction reversed on appeal, and the fifth man was convicted but later pardoned.

During World War II, Washburn Municipal University was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation taking part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

On June 8, 1966, only a few days after classes were dismissed for the summer, much of the campus was demolished by a tornado, and completely denuded of trees. Three months before the tornado struck, the Washburn board of trustees had reinsured every building on campus for the maximum amount. A week after the tornado struck, summer classes began at Topeka West High School. By the fall of 1966, Stoffer Hall was repaired, and trailers were in place. It took years to reconstruct the campus, with students attending classes in trailers well into the early 1970s.

Formerly a municipal university, the university&#x27;s primary funding was moved from city property tax to county sales tax sources in 1999, with the school retaining status as a municipal subdivision of the state. Washburn is governed by its own nine-member Board of Regents.

==Leadership==
Washburn University is governed by a nine-member board of regents. Three, who must be residents of the state of Kansas, are appointed by the governor. Three residents of the City of Topeka, one from each of the state senatorial districts, are appointed by the mayor. One is the mayor or a member of the governing body of the city designated by the mayor. The Shawnee County Commission appoints one member, who must be a resident of Shawnee County but not of the City of Topeka. The Kansas Board of Regents annually selects one of its members to serve on the Washburn Board. Members of the board (with the exception of the Kansas Board of Regents&#x27; appointee) serve staggered four-year terms.

===Presidents===
These persons have served as presidents or interim presidents of Washburn College (1869–1940), Washburn Municipal University of Topeka (1941–1952), and Washburn University (1952–present).
===Law school===
Formed in 1903, the Washburn School of Law was one of the first in the country to have a legal clinic where students are able to actively practice the legal profession. Today, it is in the minority of law schools to employ a full-time faculty for its law clinic. The Washburn School of Law had the highest pass rate of the Kansas bar examination of any law school in Kansas. The Washbum Law Library houses over 380,000 volumes and is the largest in the state. Notable alumni include Bob Dole, Roy Wilford Riegle, Dennis Moore, Kay McFarland, Bill Kurtis, and Fred Phelps.

==Buildings==
The main buildings of Washburn University are all dedicated to someone or are an important part of Washburn&#x27;s history.

== Athletics ==


The Washburn athletic teams are called the Ichabods. The university is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) since the 1989–90 academic year. The Ichabods previously competed in the Central States Intercollegiate Conference (CSIC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1976–77 to 1988–89; in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) from 1972–73 to 1975–76; in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) from 1968–69 to 1971–72; in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIC) from 1940–41 to 1967–68 (which they were a member on a previous stint from 1923–24 to 1932–33); as an Independent from 1933–34 to 1939–40; and in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1902–03 to 1922–23.

Washburn competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

=== Athletic director ===
The current athletics director is Loren Ferré, who has held the position since 1996.

=== Nickname ===
The &quot;Ichabods&quot; nickname is named after the university&#x27;s contributor Ichabod Washburn, who was also the founder of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Prior to the 2013–14 season, the women&#x27;s athletic teams were known as the &quot;Lady Blues&quot;. On May 24, 2013, President Farley announced that all athletic teams will be known as the Ichabods for the first time in history.

==Greek life==
Greek Life at Washburn University has existed since 1909. Currently, the four Interfraternity Council and the three Panhellenic Council organizations are housed on or near campus.

== Campus attractions ==
* Crane Observatory houses an 1898 Warner &amp; Swasey refracting telescope.
* KTWU, a non-commercial, public television station authorized by the Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C., and licensed to Washburn University. KTWU, the first public television station in Kansas, commenced telecasting October 21, 1965.

<text>HMAS &quot;Aware&quot; (P 91) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==
The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Aware&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane in Queensland in July 1967, launched on 7 October 1967 and commissioned on 21 June 1968.

==Operational history== 

&quot;Aware&quot; was transferred to the Adelaide Port Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve in November 1982. 

On November the 24th 1970 while with HMAS Adroit on SAR duties HMAS Aware assisted in an attempt to salvage a ditched helicopter from HMAS Albatross after a Westland Wessex crashed.
==Decommissioning and civilian service==
HMAS &quot;Aware&quot; was the last of her class to be withdrawn from service, decommissioned on 17 July 1993. She was sold to a private owner sometime before 1998, and after modification in Melbourne (including an extension of the superstructure to cover the quarterdeck), was used as a diving and salvage ship.

In 2006, &quot;Aware&quot; was acquired by a group of investors, and sailed to Bundaberg, Queensland by a former crewmember. The investors withdrew support shortly after, and the former crew member took over ownership of the vessel. &quot;Aware&quot; fell into disrepair, and in 2010, the Bundaberg Magistrates Court fined the owner for failing to have the ship insured. According to the owner, the lack of facilities capable of handling the former patrol boat has made insurance inspections almost impossible. A buyer for the vessel could not be found and in December 2011 the vessel was scrapped.

<doc id="432494" wikidata="Q836676" url="?curid=432494" title="Kingdom of Majorca">
<text>The Kingdom of Majorca (, ; ; ; ) was an insular realm off the east coast of modern day Spain, which included the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. The islands were conquered from the Almohad Caliphate by James I of Aragon. The king became known as &quot;James the Conqueror&quot; due to the Conquest of Majorca. 
When James I died in 1276, he divided his territories between his three surviving sons. Peter, the eldest, succeeded his father in the mainland as Peter III of Aragon or &quot;Peter the Great.&quot; The Kingdom of Majorca passed to the younger son James, who reigned as James II of Majorca. 

After 1279, Peter III of Aragon decreed that the King of Majorca was to be a vassal of the King of Aragon. Naturally, this led to conflict between the two brothers. Finally, in 1344, the Kingdom of Majorca was invaded by King Peter IV of Aragon and brought under the Crown of Aragon. It remained a separate Kingdom, but with the same King, until its dissolution in 1715 by the Nueva Planta decrees.

==Geography==
The kingdom included the Balearic Islands: Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. The king was also lord of the mainland counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya, and the territories James I kept in Occitania: the signory of Montpellier, the viscountcy of Carlat in Auvergne, and the barony of Aumelas, contiguous with Montpellier.

==History==

The legacy of James I included the creation of a strategic Mediterranean enclave, including territories between two large kingdoms, the Capetians of France and the Crown of Aragon, which were in constant conflict at the time. Conscious of the fragility of the Kingdom of Majorca, James I undertook the conquest of Cerdanya to unify the new kingdom. He also entered into negotiations to arrange the marriage of his son James to Beatrice of Savoy, daughter of Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy. Neither plan was successful.

The King of Majorca, James II initially tried to remain independent of the Aragonese crown. The weakness of the Majorcan state, lacking any parliament or other unifying institutions, however, brought it close to collapse. In 1279, the Majorcan monarch reconciled and recognized the King of Aragon as his overlord. The resulting Treaty of Perpignan re-established the centralised state that existed before the death of James I.

At this point, James II of Majorca found himself in the awkward position of opposing his overlord, having allied himself with Pope Martin IV and the French. Alfonso, son of the Aragonese king, invaded the realm of his uncle and conquered the island of Majorca in 1286. Some 10 years later, a new treaty - the Treaty of Anagni - ordered the return of the islands to King James II of Majorca.

On the death of James II in 1324, his son Sancho succeeded him. Relations between Aragon and Majorca were strained: despite the Treaty of Anagni, the descendants of Alfonso had not renounced their claim to the Majorcan throne. In 1325, deep in debt from his invasion of Sardinia, Sancho agreed to appoint the kings of Aragon as his heirs to the crown of Majorca. 

While this act may have solved the problem of succession, the kingdom was plunged into a severe financial crisis. Majorca was forced to develop policies similar to those of Aragon. The war against the Republic of Genoa (1329–1336) resulted in the loss of various overseas markets. It was necessary to impose new taxes and fines, which were levied on the Jewish community; despite this, the financial crisis continued. 

In 1341, Peter IV of Aragon broke off relations with the Kingdom of Majorca as a prelude to invasion. In May 1343, Peter IV invaded the Balearic Islands and followed that in 1344 with the invasions of the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya. James III of Majorca was left with only his French possessions. Selling these to the King of France, in 1349 James III set out to reconquer his kingdom. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Llucmajor on 25 October 1349. From then on, the Kingdom of Majorca remained in personal union with the Crown of Aragon.

==Fall of Majorca==
The extinction of the Kingdom of Majorca was inevitable given the conflicts by which it was affected: the Hundred Years War between France and England; the War with the &quot;Benimerines&quot;, which involved Castile and the Crown of Aragon as well as attempts by the Genoese to make the Balearics a satellite state. The Kingdom of Majorca, which had bonds of vassalage with the crowns of France (through Montpellier) and Aragon, could not remain neutral during the conflicts. In addition, increased taxes to fund the kingdom&#x27;s treasury during its neutrality caused substantial unrest.

The Kingdom of Majorca continued for nearly another four hundred years in personal union with the Crown of Aragon, retaining its own viceroy and political identity. However, during the War of the Spanish Succession the Crown of Aragon mostly backed the claims of the Archduke Charles and with his defeat the victorious Philip V of Spain abolished the kingdom via the Nueva Planta decrees in 1715.

<text>The Bechuanaland Protectorate () was a protectorate established on 31 March 1885 in Southern Africa by the United Kingdom. It became the Republic of Botswana on 30 September 1966.

==History==
Scottish missionary John Mackenzie (1835–1899), sponsored by the London Missionary Society (LMS), lived at Shoshong from 1862 to 1876. He warned that African peoples were threatened by Boers encroaching on their territory from the south. He campaigned for the establishment of what became the Bechuanaland Protectorate, to be ruled directly from Britain. &quot;Austral Africa: Losing It or Ruling It&quot; (1887) is Mackenzie&#x27;s account of events leading to the establishment of the protectorate. Influenced by Mackenzie, in January 1885 the British government decided to send a military expedition to South Africa to assert British sovereignty over the contested territory. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Charles Warren (1840–1927) led a force of 4,000 Imperial troops north from Cape Town. After making treaties with several African chiefs, Colonel Warren announced the establishment of the protectorate in March 1885. In September that year the Tswana country south of the Molopo River was proclaimed the Crown colony of British Bechuanaland. Mackenzie accompanied Warren, and &quot;Austral Africa&quot; contains a detailed account of the expedition. 
Bechuanaland meant the &quot;country of the Tswana&quot; (from an archaic form of &quot;Batswana&quot; plus &quot;-land&quot;) and for administrative purposes was divided into two political entities. The northern part was administered as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and the southern part was administered as the crown colony of British Bechuanaland. British Bechuanaland was incorporated into the Cape Colony in 1895 and now forms part of South Africa.

The northern part, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, had an area of , and a population of 120,776. It comprised an area occupied by the three main Tswana peoples: the Bamangwato, the Bakwena and the Bangwaketse, together with a number of minor tribes like the Bamalete and the Bakhatla. Also living in the Protectorate were the descendants of the original inhabitants of the area, such as Bushmen and Makalaka, who had been dispossessed by the Tswana peoples in the course of their migration south.

The British government originally expected to turn over the administration of the protectorate to Rhodesia or South Africa, but Tswana opposition left the protectorate under British rule until its independence in 1966.

The Bechuanaland Protectorate was technically a protectorate rather than a colony. Originally the local Tswana rulers were left in power, and British administration was limited to the police force to protect Bechuanaland&#x27;s borders against other European colonial ventures. But on 9 May 1891 the British Government gave the administration of the protectorate to the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, who started to appoint officials in Bechuanaland, and the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of Bechuanaland ended.

The protectorate was administered from Mafeking, creating an unusual situation, the capital of the territory being located outside of the territory. The area of Mafeking (from 1980 with the incorporation into Bophuthatswana Mafikeng, since 2010 Mahikeng), was called &#x27;The Imperial Reserve&#x27;. In 1885, when the protectorate was declared, Bechuanaland was bounded to the north by the latitude of 22° south. The northern boundary of the protectorate was formally extended northward by the British to include Ngamiland, which was then dominated by the Tawana state, on 30 June 1890. This claim was formally recognised by Germany the following day by Article III of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, which confirmed the western boundary of the British protectorate of Bechuanaland and the German protectorate of South-West Africa and also created the Caprivi strip inherited by modern Namibia:
In Southwest Africa, Germany&#x27;s sphere of influence is demarcated thus:

# To the south by the line that commences at the mouth of the Orange River and continues up its northern bank to its intersection point with the 20° east longitude.
# To the east by the line that commences at the aforementioned point and follows the 20th degree of east longitude to its intersection point with the 22° south latitude. The line then traces this degree of latitude eastward to its intersection with the 21° east longitude, follows this degree of longitude northward to its intersection with the 18° south latitude, runs along this degree of latitude eastward to its intersection with the Chobe River. Here it descends the thalweg of the main channel until it meets the Zambezi, where it ends. It is understood that under this arrangement Germany shall be granted free access from its protectorate to the Zambezi by means of a strip of land not less than twenty English miles wide at any point. Great Britain&#x27;s sphere of influence is bounded to the west and northwest by the previously described line and includes Lake Ngami.
British officials did not arrive in the Ngamiland region until 1894.

The Tati Concessions Land Act of 21 January 1911 transferred the new eastern territory to the protectorate:
From the place where the Shashe River rises to its junction with the Tati and Ramokgwebana Rivers, thence along the Ramokgwebana River to where it rises and thence along the watershed of those rivers,

This territory was originally claimed by Matabeleland. In 1887 Samuel Edwards, working for Cecil Rhodes, obtained a mining concession, and in 1895 the British South Africa Company attempted to acquire the area, but the Tswana chiefs Bathoen I, Khama III and Sebele I visited London to protest and were successful in fending off the BSAC. This territory forms the modern North-East District of Botswana.

Furthermore, Southern Bechuanaland was heavily effected by the 1890s African rinderpest epizootic which temporarily damaged the economy.

==Politics==
The proclamation of a protectorate flanked by a new Crown colony to the south (British Bechuanaland) were primarily intended as safeguards against further expansion by Germany, Portugal, or Boers.

Contrary to what was reported at the time by Warren and others, not all chiefs affected by the protectorate were in favour of it. The most powerful ruler was King Khama III, who had strong support from the British government, and was especially popular among evangelicals in Britain. He collaborated closely with the British military, and kept his vast, but underpopulated lands independent from intruders from South Africa.

Khama&#x27;s eldest son, Sekgoma II, became chief of the Bamangwato upon Khama&#x27;s death in 1923. Sekgoma II&#x27;s eldest son was named Seretse. Throughout his life Khama was widowed and remarried several times. One wife, Semane, birthed a son named Tshekedi.

Sekgoma II&#x27;s reign lasted only a year or so, leaving his son Seretse, who at the time was an infant, as the rightful heir to the chieftainship (Tshekedi was not in line to be chief since he did not descend from Khama&#x27;s oldest son Sekgoma II). So in keeping with tradition, Tshekedi acted as regent of the tribe until Seretse was old enough to assume the chieftainship. The transfer of responsibility from Tshekedi to Seretse was planned to occur after Seretse had returned from his law studies overseas in Britain.

Tshekedi&#x27;s regency as acting chief of the Bamangwato is best remembered for his expansion of the &quot;mephato&quot; (regiments) to build primary schools, grain silos, and water reticulation systems, for his frequent confrontations with the British colonial authorities over the administration of justice in Ngwato country, and for his efforts to deal with a major split in the tribe after Seretse married a white woman, Ruth Williams, while studying law in Britain.

Tshekedi opposed the marriage on the grounds that under Tswana custom a chief could not marry simply as he pleased. He was a servant of the people; the chieftaincy itself was at stake. Seretse would not budge in his desire to marry Ruth, and he did, while exiled in Britain in 1948. Tribal opinion about the marriage basically split evenly along demographic lines – older people went with Tshekedi, the younger with Seretse. In the end, British authorities exiled both men (Tshekedi from the Bamangwato territory, Seretse from the Protectorate altogether). Rioting broke out and a number of people were killed.

Seretse and Ruth were allowed to return to the Protectorate and Seretse and Tshekedi were able to patch things up a bit between themselves. By now though, Seretse saw his destiny not as chief of the Bamangwato tribe, but rather as leader of the Botswana Democratic Party and as President of the soon-to-be independent nation of Botswana in 1966. He would remain Botswana&#x27;s president until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1980. The story of Seretse and Ruth forms the basis of the 2016 film &quot;A United Kingdom&quot;.

===Elections===
*1930 Bechuanaland European Advisory Council election
*1933 Bechuanaland European Advisory Council election
*1961 Bechuanaland general election
*1965 Bechuanaland general election

==Office holders==
===High commissioners and resident commissioners===
The Bechuanaland Protectorate was one of the &quot;High Commission Territories&quot;, the others being Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland (now Eswatini). The High Commissioner had some of the functions of a governor, but the major tribes were self-governing, and the protectorate was not a British possession, so was not available for white settlement. The office was first held by the Governor of the Cape Colony, then by the Governor-General of South Africa, then by the High Commissioner for Southern Africa until independence. In each of the three territories, the administration of Britain&#x27;s responsibilities was headed by a Resident Commissioner with some of the functions of a Governor but less authority.

===Chief Justice===
The Chief Justice was the Chief Justice of the High Commission Territories (Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland). From 1951 the Chief Justices were:

===Prime minister===

== Postage stamps ==

Bechuanaland postage stamps were issued from 1888 to 1966. Overprinted stamps were issued until 1932, when the first stamps inscribed &quot;Bechuanaland Protectorate&quot; were issued. On 14 February 1961 the South African rand was introduced, necessitating the surcharging of the existing definitive stamps until new ones were issued.

<text>HMS &quot;Ocelot&quot; (S17) is an diesel-electric submarine which was operated by the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a direct follow-on of the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull.

As designed for British service, the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty Standard Range 16 VMS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a three-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers and 62 sailors.

&quot;Ocelot&quot; was laid down by Chatham Dockyard on 17 November 1960, and launched on 5 May 1962. The boat was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 31 January 1964. &quot;Ocelot&quot; was the last submarine built for the Royal Navy at Chatham Dockyard, although three more &quot;Oberon&quot;s; &quot;Ojibwa&quot;, &quot;Onondaga&quot; and &quot;Okanagan&quot;—were built for the Royal Canadian Navy.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Ocelot&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Submarine Squadron, based at HMNB Clyde, in Faslane, serving there for three years.

During the 1960s, &quot;Ocelot&quot; took part in clandestine missions. &quot;Ocelot&quot; attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the Submarine Flotilla.

==Decommissioning and fate==
HMS &quot;Ocelot&quot; was paid off in August 1991 as the conventional submarine fleet of the RN began to decline, making way for the nuclear fleet. She was sold in 1992 and preserved as a fully tourable museum in Chatham Historic Dockyard.

In November 2013 the interior of HMS &quot;Ocelot&quot; was added to Google Street View by Google Business Photos Agency, CInsideMedia Ltd.

<text>Carl Laemmle (; born Karl Lämmle ; January 17, 1867 – September 24, 1939) was a German-American film producer and the co-founder and, until 1934, owner of Universal Pictures. He produced or worked on over 400 films.

Regarded as one of the most important of the early film pioneers, Laemmle was born in what is now Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and worked in Chicago for 20 years before he began buying nickelodeons, eventually expanding into a film distribution service, the Laemmle Film Service, then into production as Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), later renamed Universal Film Manufacturing Company, and later still renamed Universal Pictures Company.

==Early life and education==
Karl Lämmle was born in 1867 to Julius Baruch Lämmle and Rebekka Lämmle, a Jewish couple in the Radstrasse, a street in the Jewish quarter of Laupheim, in the Kingdom of Württemberg. His father was a cattle merchant, also involved in land transactions. The family struggled financially and lived in poverty: Of his eleven siblings only 3 reached adulthood. He was one of the youngest children, and close to his mother, who enrolled him in a Jewish school. When he was 13, she arranged a three-year apprenticeship for him in Ichenhausen, a nearby village, where he learned accounting and sales, and worked to support his family.

==Career==
After his mother died in 1883, Laemmle decided to emigrate to the US for a better life, also following his thirteen-year-older brother Joseph. For his 17th birthday, his father had given him the tickets for an Atlantic crossing on the steamboat SS &quot;Neckar&quot; plus fifty dollars. He left Bremerhaven on January 28, 1884, and arrived in New York on February 14, 1884. He settled in Chicago. Here he lived for about twenty years as a bookkeeper and office manager. In 1889, he became a naturalized American citizen. Laemmle worked a variety of jobs, but by 1894 he was the bookkeeper of the Continental Clothing Company in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he introduced a bolder advertising style.

In 1906, at the age of 39, Laemmle quit his job. He initially wanted to open a network of cheap retail stores, but changed his mind after entering a nickelodeon. He started one of the first motion picture theaters in Chicago, The White Front on Milwaukee Avenue, and quickly branched out into film exchange services. He challenged Thomas Edison&#x27;s monopoly on moving pictures, the Motion Picture Patents Company, under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. As part of his offensive against Edison&#x27;s company, Laemmle began advertising individual &quot;stars,&quot; such as Mary Pickford and Florence Lawrence, thus increasing their individual earning power, and thus their willingness to side with the &quot;Independents.&quot;

After moving to New York, Carl Laemmle became involved in producing movies, forming Independent Moving Pictures (IMP); the city was the site of many new movie-related businesses. On April 30, 1912, in New York, Laemmle brought together Pat Powers of Powers Motion Picture Company, Mark Dintenfass of Champion Film Company, William Swanson of Rex Motion Picture Company, David Horsley of Nestor Film Company, as well as Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel of the New York Motion Picture Company, to merge their companies with IMP as the &quot;Universal Film Manufacturing Company&quot;, with Laemmle assuming the role of president. They founded the Company with studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where at the beginning of the 20th century many early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based. 

On March 15, 1915, Laemmle opened the world&#x27;s largest motion picture production facility, Universal Studios Hollywood, on a 230-acre (0.9-km2) converted farm in the San Fernando Valley, just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood. 

Universal maintained two East Coast offices: The first was located at 1600 Broadway, New York City. This building, initially known as the Studebaker Building, was razed around 2004 or 2005. The second location to house Universal&#x27;s executive offices was at 730 Fifth Avenue, New York City. Many years later, 445 Park Avenue was the location of Universal&#x27;s executive offices. In 1916, Laemmle sponsored the $3,000 three-foot-tall solid silver Universal Trophy for the winner of the annual Universal race at the Uniontown Speedway board track in southwestern Pennsylvania. Universal filmed each race from 1916 to 1922.

In 1932, Laemmle opened the Laemmle Building on Hollywood and Vine. Originally planned as a 900-seat theater and office tower, the final construction was a one-story restaurant, the original plans thwarted by the Great Depression.

In 1936, Laemmle and his son were removed from the company he founded by a hostile takeover. He briefly resumed distribution with a partner, Michael Mindlin, specializing in foreign films as CL Imports, in the mid-1930s, but for the most part remained in secluded retirement until his death.

==Personal life==

In 1898, Laemmle married Recha Stern, the niece of Sam Stern, his employer at the Continental Clothing Company. Together, they had a daughter named Rosabelle (born 1903) and a son named Julius (born 1908). Rosabelle later married Stanley Bergerman, while Julius became known as Carl Laemmle Jr. On January 13, 1919, at the age of 43, Recha died from pneumonia caused by the Spanish flu. After moving to California, Laemmle purchased the former home of film pioneer Thomas Ince on Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills, which was razed in the early 1940s; he also maintained a large apartment for himself and his two children at 465 West End Avenue in New York City.

Asked how to pronounce his surname, Laemmle told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; in 1936, &quot;The name means &#x27;little lamb&#x27; and is pronounced as if it were spelled &#x27;lem-lee&#x27;.&quot;

Laemmle&#x27;s relatives in the film industry included his cousins Max Laemmle, Kurt Laemmle, and William Wyler; his nephews Ernst Laemmle and Edward Laemmle; his niece Carla Laemmle; and his brothers-in-law Isadore Bernstein, Joseph Stern, and Abe Stern. His great-nephew Michael Laemmle is a noted resident of Darwin, California, and was featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Darwin: No Services Ahead&quot;. His great-grandniece, Antonia Carlotta, talks about him at length in &quot;Universally Me&quot;, her web series about the history of Universal Studios.

Poet Ogden Nash observed the following about Laemmle&#x27;s habit of giving his son and nephews top executive positions in his studios:
==Death==
Laemmle died from cardiovascular disease on September 24, 1939, in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 72. Laemmle was entombed in the Chapel Mausoleum at Home of Peace Cemetery.

==Awards and honors==
* Oscar, 1930 for &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;.

==Legacy==
Laemmle, although having made hundreds of films in his active years as a producer (1909–1934), is remembered for &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923), &quot;The Phantom of The Opera&quot; (1925), both with Lon Chaney Sr. in the title role, and &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1928) and most of the early sound horror films, such as &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), with his son, Carl Jr.

Laemmle remained connected to his home town of Laupheim throughout his life, providing financial support to it. In the 1930s he sponsored hundreds of Jews from Laupheim and Württemberg to emigrate from Nazi Germany to the United States, paying both emigration and immigration fees, thus saving them from the Holocaust. To ensure and facilitate their immigration, Laemmle contacted American authorities, members of the House of Representatives and Secretary of State Cordell Hull. He also intervened to try to secure entry for the refugees on board the , who were ultimately sent back from Havana to Europe in 1939, where many were murdered in the Holocaust.

<text>The Annonaceae are a family of flowering plants consisting of trees, shrubs, or rarely lianas commonly known as the custard apple family or soursop family. With 108 accepted genera and about 2400 known species, it is the largest family in the Magnoliales. Several genera produce edible fruit, most notably &quot;Annona&quot;, &quot;Anonidium&quot;, &quot;Asimina&quot;, &quot;Rollinia&quot;, and &quot;Uvaria&quot;. Its type genus is &quot;Annona&quot;. The family is concentrated in the tropics, with few species found in temperate regions. About 900 species are Neotropical, 450 are Afrotropical, and the remaining are Indomalayan.

==Description==

The species are mostly tropical, some are mid-latitude, deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs, with some lianas, with aromatic bark, leaves, and flowers.

; Stems, stalks and leaves: Bark is fibrous and aromatic. Pith septate (fine tangential bands divided by partitions) to diaphragmed (divided by thin partitions with openings in them). Branching distichous (arranged in two rows/on one plane) or spiral. Leaves are alternate, two-ranked, simple, pinnately veined, and have leaf stalks. Stipules absent.

; Flowers: Flower stalks are axillary to (on the opposite side of shoot from) leaf scars on old wood and sometimes from leaves on new shoots. The flowers are usually trimerous; borne singly or in compound inflorescences; bisexual and rarely unisexual. The receptacle might become enlarged, elevated or flat. The outer whorls are inserted below the ovaries, and have valvate (overlapping) or imbricate (nonoverlapping) segments. Usually two to four persistent sepals that are distinct or connate (fused) at the base. Six petals in two unequal whorls of three with larger outer whorls and fleshier inner whorls that might share the same nectar glands, or six to fifteen petals, with impressed veins on their inner face. Ten to twenty (or many more) stamens inserted below the ovary, spirally arranged and forming a ball or flat-topped mass with short and stout and linear to oblong anthers which face outward and open longitudinally. Each flower can have from one to many pistils, distinct to connate, with stigmas distinct. Marginal placentation, each pistil bearing one locule, with one to many ovules. Style short and thick, with terminal stigma.

; Fruits and seeds: Fruits are single berries or coalesce from several pistils (into aggregate fruit, syncarps). Seeds are one to many per pistil; have a fleshy and usually brightly colored cover, have ruminate endosperm (nutritive tissue surrounding the embryo) and are oily.

==Systematics==
Monophyly and inter-familial systematics have been well supported for Annonaceae by a combination of morphological and molecular evidence. The APG II system places Annonaceae as most closely related to the small Magnoliid family Eupomatiaceae.



In a phylogeny-based reclassification of the family four subfamilies are recognised: Anaxagoreoideae (including just &quot;Anaxagorea&quot;), Ambavioideae, Annonoideae, and Malmeoideae. A number of the larger genera, including &quot;Guatteria&quot;, with its 177 species, &quot;Annona&quot;, and &quot;Xylopia&quot; belong to Annonoideae. Together, Annonoideae and Malmeoideae comprise the majority of the species and each are further subdivided into a number of tribes. The subfamilial and tribal classification is followed in World Annonaceae which presents an overview of all Annonaceae genera and taxonomic, distribution and photographic information for a large number of species. Keys for the identification of Annonaceae genera (separately for Neotropical, African/Madagascan, and Asian/Australian taxa) are presented in: For a concise bibliographic overview of the taxonomic literature (1900 to 2012) see:

Both plastid DNA markers and morphological characters provide evidence that &quot;Anaxagorea&quot; is the sister clade to the rest of the family. This may confirm the hypothesis that morphological traits shared between &quot;Anaxagorea&quot; and other Magnoliales species (such as 2-ranked phyllotaxis, monosulcate pollen, and laminate stamens) represent ancestral characters, while derived characters observed in other genera have evolved independently multiple times. The oldest fossil evidence of Annonaceae is described as the genus &quot;Futabanthus&quot;, from the Late Cretaceous (Coniacian) of Japan, which represents a minimum age of c. 89 million years ago for the most recent common ancestor (crown group) of the family. The ages of Annonaceae clades inferred using fossil evidence and molecular clock-based dating techniques suggests that the pantropical distribution of the family originated subsequent to the break-up of the Gondwanan supercontinent, as the result of a combination of geodispersal tracking the expansion of the boreotropical flora during the Eocene and more recent long-distance dispersal events.

=== Taxonomic revisions within the subfamily Malmeoideae ===

==== The reclassification and establishment of &quot;Huberantha&quot; ====
The genus &quot;Huberantha&quot; (synonym &quot;Hubera&quot;) was resolved to be sister to &quot;Miliusa&quot;, with certain species previously under &quot;Polyalthia&quot; being additionally reclassified. This reclassification was highly supported by maximum parsimony, Bayesian analysis, and morphological characters. &quot;Hubera&quot; is characterized by reticulate tertiary venation, axillary inflorescences, 1 ovule per ovary, seeds with flat to slightly raised raphes, and other characters. &quot;Huberantha&quot;&#x27;s phylogenetic distance and morphological difference from &quot;Monoon&quot; and &quot;Polyalthia&quot;, distinguish &quot;Huberantha&quot; on the generic level. Morphologically, &quot;Huberantha&quot; has a finely and densely granular infratectum whereas &quot;Monoon&quot; and &quot;Polyalthia&quot; have columellate or densely granular infratecta.

==== Controversy over &quot;Stelechocarpus/Winitia&quot; ====
It was proposed that the genus &quot;Stelechocarpus&quot;, which includes &quot;S. burahol&quot; and &quot;S. cauliflorus&quot; be reclassified under a new genus &quot;Winitia&quot;, which is characterized by mixed flowers, multicolumellar stigmas, and columellate/coarsely granular infratectum. This genus was created after phylogenetic analysis that highly supported an unclassified species from Thailand being sister to &quot;S. cauliflorus&quot; as a monophyletic group. However this is no longer accepted.

==== Reclassification of &quot;Annickia&quot; as tribe Annickieae ====
The genus &quot;Annickia&quot; was previously included within the tribe Piptostigmateae. However, it is highly supported to being sister to the rest of the Malmeoideae tribes, and weakly supported to being sister to the rest of the Piptostigmateae genera. For these reasons, &quot;Annickia&quot; is now classified within its own tribe in the Malmeoideae, the Annickieae.

==Uses==
===Food===
The large, edible, pulpy fruits of some members, typically called &quot;anona&quot; by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking people of the family&#x27;s Neotropical range, include species of &quot;Annona&quot;: custard apple (&quot;A. reticulata&quot;), cherimoya (&quot;A. cherimola&quot;), soursop/guanábana/graviola (&quot;A. muricata&quot;), sweetsop (&quot;A. squamosa&quot;), ilama (&quot;A. macroprophyllata&quot;), soncoya (&quot;A. purpurea&quot;), &quot;atemoya&quot; (a cross between &quot;A. cherimola&quot; and &quot;A. squamosa&quot;); and biriba (&quot;A. mucosa&quot;). The names of many of those fruits are sometimes used interchangeably.

Consumption of the neotropical annonaceous plant &quot;Annona muricata&quot; (soursop, &quot;graviola, guanabana&quot;) has been strongly associated as a causal agent in &quot;atypical Parkinsonism&quot;. The causative agent, annonacin, is present in the seeds and leaves of many of the Annonaceae, though not in any significant quantity in the fruit flesh. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines.

The American pawpaw (&quot;Asimina triloba&quot;) has an Eastern United States distribution and has been investigated as a commercial agricultural crop.

Flower petals from sacred earflower (&quot;Cymbopetalum penduliflorum&quot;) and from related species &quot;C. costaricense&quot; were traditionally used to flavor chocolate before the arrival of cinnamon and the other Old World spices. The dried petals are still used to flavor atoles, pinoles, and coffee.

===Folk medicine===
The bark, leaves, and roots of some species are used in folk medicines.

==Toxicology==
The acetogenin compounds, which occur in the fruit, seeds, and leaves of many Annonaceae, including soursop (&quot;Annona muricata&quot;), are neurotoxins and seem to be the cause of a neurodegenerative disease. The disorder is a so-called tauopathy associated with a pathologic accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Experimental results indicate that acetogenins are responsible for this accumulation.

==Other uses==
Lancewood (&quot;Oxandra lanceolata&quot;) is a tough, elastic, and heavy wood obtained from the West Indies and The Guianas. It was often used for carriage shafts. It is brought into commerce in the form of taper poles of about 6 m in length and from 15 to 20 cm in breadth at the butt. The black lancewood or carisiri of the Guianas is of remarkably slender form.

The yellow lancewood tree &quot;Calycophyllum candididissimum&quot;, common names lemonwood or degame, is from a different family (Rubiaceae). It is used as an alternative to lancewood and is found in tolerable abundance throughout The Guianas, and used by the Amerinds for arrow-points, as well as for spars, beams, etc. Some bowyers use this wood for making longbows.

===Other===
* Some species of the family, such as &quot;Cananga odorata&quot; (ylang-ylang) also have aromatic oil and are used for perfumes or spices.
* The strong bark is used for carrying burdens in the Amazon Rainforest and for wooden implements, such as tool handles and pegs. The wood is valued as firewood.
* Yellow and brown natural dyes
* Some species are also grown as ornamental plants, especially the Indian species &quot;Polyalthia longifolia pendula&quot;.
* The fruit and leaves of &quot;Uvariopsis tripetala&quot; (pepperfruit) are used as a spice for meats in some parts of Nigeria, due to its &quot;hot&quot; peppery flavor.

==Chemical constituents==
A large number of chemical compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and acetogenins, have been extracted from the seeds and many other parts of these plants. Flavonoids and alkaloids contained in the leaves and bark of several species of the family have shown insecticidal properties.

<text>Terry Alan Anderson (October 27, 1947 – April 21, 2024) was an American journalist and combat veteran. He reported for the Associated Press. In 1985, he was taken hostage by Shia Hezbollah militants of the Islamic Jihad Organization in Lebanon and held until 1991. In 2004, he ran unsuccessfully for the Ohio State Senate.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Lorain, Ohio, on October 27, 1947. In Lorain, his father Glen Anderson was the village police officer and, later, when his family moved to Batavia, New York, his mother Lily (Lunn) Anderson was a waitress and his father was a truck driver. He was raised in Batavia, New York, and graduated from Batavia High School in 1965. A professional journalist, he was in the United States Marine Corps for six years, serving as a combat journalist for five years among Japan, Okinawa, and Vietnam. He served two tours of duty in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. As a staff sergeant in the Marine Corps, he spent his final year at Ames, Iowa, as a recruiter for the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. After his discharge he enrolled at Iowa State University, graduating in 1974 with dual degrees: one in journalism and mass communication, the other in political science. During his studies at Iowa State, he was employed as a part time photographer and reporter at the KRNT radio and television station in Des Moines. He then joined the Associated Press, serving in Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before being assigned to Lebanon as chief Middle Eastern correspondent for next two and a half years beginning in 1983.

==Hostage in Lebanon==

On March 16, 1985, Anderson had just finished a tennis game when he was abducted from the street in Beirut, placed in the trunk of a car, and taken to a secret location where he was imprisoned. For the next six years and nine months, he was held captive, being moved periodically to new sites. His captors were a group of Hezbollah Shiite Muslims who were supported by Iran in supposed retaliation for Israel&#x27;s use of U.S. weapons and aid in its 1982–83 strikes against Muslim and Druze targets in Lebanon. He was the longest-held of the Western hostages captured by Hezbollah in an effort to drive U.S. military forces from Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War.

During his captivity, numerous persons fiercely advocated for his release including his older sister Peggy Say, who rallied support from Mother Teresa, Pope John Paul II, Yasir Arafat, and Ronald Reagan, professional journalists Dan Rather and Kevin Cooney, who was a close friend from Anderson&#x27;s days in Iowa, his fellow colleagues at the Associated Press and numerous other journalists who had covered war zones.

Anderson was released on December 4, 1991, and said he had forgiven his captors. Later, when asked if he would return to the Middle East as a correspondent, he stated, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go there for a million dollars. It is very dangerous.&quot;

==Post-captivity life==
After his release, Anderson taught courses at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and at the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University. He wrote a best selling memoir of his experience as a hostage, titled &quot;Den of Lions&quot;.

He filed suit against the Iranian government for his captivity, and, on March 24, 2000, was awarded a $324 million settlement from frozen Iranian assets by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson based upon a 1996 anti-terrorism law which allows United States citizens, who are victims of terrorist acts abroad, the right in United States courts to sue foreign countries which are classified as sponsors of terrorism by the United States State Department. Estimates put the amount he actually received at $26 million. The judgement from U.S. District Judge Jackson also awarded $10 million to his second wife Madeleine Bassil and $6.7 million to their daughter Sulome Anderson with $40 million for his parents Glen and Lily (Lunn) Anderson through additional lawsuits.

Anderson for some time lived in Nicholasville, Kentucky, teaching journalism and diversity at the University of Kentucky. In 2009, Anderson joined the faculty of the School of Journalism at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky. In November 2009, he filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7. In 2011, he became a visiting professional at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. In 2013, he acted as Honorary Chair of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that supports press freedom around the globe. In 2014, he moved to Hidden Village in Gainesville, Florida, to teach a course in international journalism at the University of Florida.

==Philanthropy==
With some of his settlement, Anderson, Marcia Landau and actress Kieu Chinh founded the &quot;Vietnam Children&#x27;s Fund&quot;, which has built more than 50 schools in Vietnam.

Anderson also created the Father Lawrence Jenco Foundation with a $100,000 endowment to honor and support people who do charitable and community service projects in Appalachia. Lawrence Jenco was a former Catholic Relief Services director in Beirut who also was kidnapped. The two men met in jail. Jenco, who died in 1996, wrote his memoirs, &quot;Bound to Forgive&quot;, for which Anderson wrote the preface.

==2004 State Senate campaign==
In December 2003 Anderson announced his candidacy on the Democratic ticket to represent the 20th District in the Ohio Senate. His opponent was Republican candidate Joy Padgett, who had been appointed to the seat earlier in the term. Padgett ran controversial ads suggesting that Anderson would be soft on terrorism: the ads showed Anderson shaking hands with one of his former kidnappers. He received 46% of the vote in a district that leans Republican; the seat has been held by Republicans since 1977.

==Personal life==
Anderson was married and divorced three times. He met his first wife, Mihoko &quot;Mickey&quot; Anderson, while he was a Marine stationed with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service in Japan. They had one daughter Gabrielle Anderson, but later divorced. After 1982, he became engaged to Madeleine Bassil, a Lebanese native from a Maronite Christian family; they had one daughter, Sulome Anderson, born in 1985, three months after he was taken hostage. After his release, Anderson and Bassil were married in 1993, but later divorced.

A fan of blues music, Anderson owned the Blue Gator from early 2002 until mid-2008, a blues bar in Athens, Ohio, which hosted regional and national acts.

In an interview in the spring 1995 newsletter of the School of Journalism Alumni Association, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, by Will Norton Jr., Anderson is quoted:

Is there going to be peace in the world? I&#x27;m a Christian. I believe eventually there will be, at the second coming. I think we are moving into an era of greater, or if not peace, at least of greater prosperity. Think about it: In the last 10 to 15 years there are hundreds of millions of people in the world who are living in a greater degree of individual responsibility and freedom and perhaps dignity than there were 15 years ago. That&#x27;s true in eastern Europe, in Latin America, even in Asia. That great process of history, of thousands of years of an increase in a dignity of the individual, seems to have been halted for a good period of time by the growth of totalitarian societies, and those are breaking up now. Certainly the totalitarian instinct has not gone away. There are a great many wars going on and struggles by peoples, but that ice jam, that blockage that was representative of the domination of a third of the world by communism, is gone. I think that&#x27;s reason for great optimism.

Anderson died at his home in Greenwood Lake, New York, on April 21, 2024, at the age of 76. He had recently undergone heart surgery.

Anderson&#x27;s papers are held at Iowa State University.

<doc id="432509" wikidata="Q1638840" url="?curid=432509" title="USS Bowfin">
<text>USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; (SS/AGSS-287), is a of the United States Navy named for the bowfin fish. Since 1981, she has been open to public tours at the USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; Submarine Museum &amp; Park in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, next to the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial Visitor Center.

&quot;Bowfin&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 23 July 1942, and launched on 7 December 1942 by Mrs. Jane Gawne, wife of Captain James Gawne, and commissioned on 1 May 1943, Commander Joseph H. Willingham in command.

==First patrol==
Following fitting out, the submarine proceeded via Newport, Rhode Island, to New London, Connecticut, her base for shakedown training. Early in July 1943, she got underway for the Pacific war zone, and after transiting the Panama Canal and crossing the Pacific, reached Australia. After-voyage repair at Brisbane preceded her getting underway on 19 August to move north and west along the Australian coast to Darwin. She topped off her fuel tanks at that port and sailed on the morning of 25 August for her first war patrol.

&quot;Bowfin&quot; reached the Mindanao Sea on 2 September, but patrolled for more than three weeks without finding any worthwhile targets. On 24 September, she met to conduct coordinated operations. The next day, the two submarines began tracking a six-ship convoy and continued the chase for some five hours before &quot;Bowfin&quot; finally attained a suitable attack position. She then launched her six bow torpedoes – four at a cargo ship and two at a trailing transport. Three exploded against the side of the first ship and both of those fired at the second struck home. The submarine immediately turned her fantail toward the convoy and emptied her stern tubes, sending four torpedoes in the direction of a tanker. Gunfire at her periscope forced &quot;Bowfin&quot; to go deep, so prevented her crew from observing the progress of her last salvo, but they heard its torpedoes explode. When the submarine rose to periscope depth about an hour later, the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kirishima Maru&quot; was slowly sinking, the tanker was on fire, and the transport seemed to be settling by the stern. However, the two latter ships apparently were able to limp back to port, for the sinking of neither was confirmed by postwar study of Japanese records. Later in the day, members of &quot;Bowfin&quot;&#x27;s crew heard distant explosions and inferred that &quot;Billfish&quot; was going after the remnants of the convoy, a conclusion that proved to be correct, for their sister ship managed to damage two Japanese ships totaling about 12,000 tons. Although the submarines continued to pursue the remaining enemy vessels as they fled during the night, the battered group of Japanese ships finally managed to slip away in the darkness.

The following morning, after &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s radar had picked up an enemy plane also equipped with radar, the submarine was forced to submerge to avoid detection. Two days later, she came across a inter-island steamer and shadowed her until reaching a firing position about three hours later. She then launched three torpedoes. One stopped before reaching the target, and the other two missed.

On 30 September, as she left the Mindanao Sea, &quot;Bowfin&quot; chanced upon a diesel-propelled barge carrying over 100 Japanese soldiers, and opened fire on it with her four-inch gun. When the target responded with machine gun fire, the submarine&#x27;s 20-mm guns entered the fray. The battle came to an abrupt end when a four-inch round struck the enemy&#x27;s magazine and blew apart the already sinking barge.

On 2 October, as the submarine continued through the Makassar Strait toward Australia, her crew sighted a schooner off Balikpapan. Willingham fired two shots across the stranger&#x27;s bow, but failed to bring her to and sank her with gunfire.

&quot;Bowfin&quot; arrived at Fremantle on 10 October, ending a successful patrol. Rear Admiral Ralph Waldo Christie, who commanded American submarines in the area, was lavish in his praise of the submarine&#x27;s performance; he rewarded her commanding officer with the opportunity of heading a submarine division. To free him for the new role, Lieutenant Commander Walter T. Griffith relieved Willingham as commanding officer of &quot;Bowfin&quot; on 26 October.

==Second patrol==

Upon completion of refitting, &quot;Bowfin&quot; got underway on 1 November and headed for the South China Sea. From time to time during this patrol, she again cooperated with &quot;Billfish&quot;. On 8 November, &quot;Bowfin&quot; picked up the trail of a group of five schooners. When she pulled within range of them, she opened fire with her four-inch gun and sank three before bombs from a Japanese plane forced the submarine to dive, allowing the two surviving vessels to slip away. After staying down until dark, &quot;Bowfin&quot; surfaced and resumed patrolling. Before long, she discovered and opened fire upon a large sailing ship, which went down after suffering hits by two four-inch shells. Two days later, she found her next victims, two small steamers heading for Tawi-Tawi Bay, and set both ablaze with gunfire.

Her luck was even better on the morning of 26 November, while she was approaching the coast of Indochina during a blinding rainstorm. Without prior knowledge that any other vessels were near, she unexpectedly found herself surrounded by Japanese shipping. After barely avoiding a collision with a tanker by backing all engines, she torpedoed and sank the tanker &quot;Ogurasan Maru&quot; and then sank the cargo ship &quot;Tainan Maru&quot;. A few hours later, her torpedoes sank &quot;Van Vollenhoven&quot;, a coaster that the Japanese had taken from her French owners when they overran Indochina almost two years before. On 28 November, after having sunk a small passenger-cargo ship with one torpedo, &quot;Bowfin&quot; joined &quot;Billfish&quot; in attacking a convoy and quickly sank the cargo ship &quot;Sydney Maru&quot; and tanker &quot;Tonon Maru&quot;.

Meanwhile, one of the Japanese ships fired on &quot;Bowfin&quot; and scored hits, which opened leaks in her starboard induction line; while serious, they did not prevent the submarine from getting off her last two torpedoes. Repair efforts at daylight slowed, but did not completely stop the flooding, and &quot;Bowfin&quot; began her voyage back to Australia. En route to her base on 2 December, she came across a &quot;two-masted yacht...which...,&quot; in Griffith&#x27;s words, &quot;...looked like it might have been some planter’s yacht taken over by the Japs.&quot; The submarine&#x27;s deck gun promptly destroyed this stranger; thereafter, &quot;Bowfin&quot; enjoyed an uneventful passage that brought her to Fremantle a week later. There, Rear Admiral Christie praised her performance as the &quot;classic of all submarine patrols&quot;.

==Third patrol==

The submarine got underway on 8 January 1944 for her third war patrol. She proceeded through the Java, Banda, and Flores Seas to Makassar Strait, where – on 16 January – she encountered a small schooner, surfaced, and sank the sailing vessel with her deck gun. The following day, she came across a cargo ship and two escorts, but her attacks on these targets were frustrated by malfunctioning torpedoes. One from her first spread of four bow torpedoes hit and stopped the cargo ship, but the other three missed, and two shots from her bow tubes detonated before reaching the target. After reloading her tubes, she returned to the convoy the following day and finished off the crippled cargo ship with four torpedoes, which sank the &quot;Shoyu Maru&quot;. She also hit one of the escorts with two torpedoes, but did not sink her.

Out of torpedoes, &quot;Bowfin&quot; returned to Darwin for more, and while in port, picked up Rear Admiral Christie, who remained on board the submarine for the rest of the patrol to check on torpedo performance, first hand, and to learn the secret of &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s remarkable success. The day after she returned to sea, the submarine put three torpedoes into a small cargo ship. Lt. Comdr. Griffith claimed the target sank and his distinguished passenger confirmed the kill, but the sinking was not borne out by postwar examination of Japanese records – possibly because &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s alleged victim was too small to be listed. About daybreak on 28 January, &quot;Bowfin&quot; began trailing a large tanker, and she continued the chase until reaching striking range that evening. She then fired all six bow torpedoes, but since the target simultaneously changed course, none struck home. After a rapid reload, she sent six more toward the tanker, and this time, two exploded against the side of the Japanese ship, sending towers of fire and smoke skyward. Nevertheless, the tanker remained afloat. As &quot;Bowfin&quot; closed to administer the &quot;coup de grace&quot;, the enemy ship began fighting back with her main battery and machine-gun fire. Undaunted, the submarine kept up the attack, and during the ensuing 20 minutes, fired six more torpedoes - two misses, followed by a pair of hits, then a miss, and finally another hit. At this point, the tanker&#x27;s fire was becoming more accurate and forced the submarine to dive. When she came up, the Japanese vessel was retiring from the scene, and by dawn had disappeared over the horizon.

The next day, &quot;Bowfin&quot; laid a minefield in Makassar Strait before beginning the voyage back to Australia. On 30 January, she came across two small schooners, which she destroyed with her four-inch gun. The submarine moored at Fremantle on 5 February and began preparations for her next mission.

==Fourth patrol==
Underway on 28 February 1944, the submarine headed for the Celebes Sea. On 10 March, her crew sighted a convoy of four ships screened by two escorts. &quot;Bowfin&quot; fired six bow tubes, but four of the torpedoes exploded prematurely. Japanese planes forced Griffith to dive, thus preventing anyone on board from observing the fate of the two other torpedoes. During the ensuing action, in which the escorts searched for the submarine, and she, in turn, strove to hide at some 350 ft below the surface, a chain dragged by one of the Japanese hunters scraped across &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s hull. Meanwhile, depth charge explosions – more than 20 – shook the submarine severely, but did no debilitating damage. When Griffith dared to rise to the surface, he saw a cargo ship down by the stern being taken under tow. Despite the efforts of the enemy escorts and of five circling Japanese aircraft, &quot;Bowfin&quot; attacked the convoy, but could not follow the progress of her torpedoes because one of them had boomeranged and threatened her by running in a circular pattern. She dived to escape the danger and did not come up again until the next day. She attacked the cargo ship again, but the Japanese escorts drove her down once more. Later that day, she rose to periscope depth, found the damaged ship alone, and finished the &quot;Tsukikawa Maru&quot; off with four torpedoes.

The submarine then began looking for the rest of the convoy, caught up with it well after dark, and fired her remaining torpedoes, but none scored. She then headed back to Darwin for more, and stood out to sea again on 15 March with a fresh supply. Three days later, she emptied her bow tubes while attacking a small convoy, but all six either ran under their targets or missed wide of their marks. The inevitable depth charge barrage followed, but proved to be equally ineffective. When &quot;Bowfin&quot; attacked again later that day, she launched four torpedoes – all of which were wasted.

She did better on the night of 24 March, when at the end of a long chase, she attacked a five-ship convoy in the Celebes Sea, sinking two cargo ships: &quot;Sinkyo Maru&quot; and &quot;Bengal Maru&quot;. She also damaged a third ship, but could not finish her off for want of torpedoes. As a result, she returned to Darwin, where she arrived on 1 April.

==Fifth and sixth patrols==

There, Commander John H. Corbus relieved Lt. Cdr. Griffith in command of the submarine, which got underway again on 24 April and headed for the Palaus. Although this sixth patrol proved to be her longest in both time and distance, she only managed to put two torpedoes into a cargo ship on 14 May, and it refused to sink. She performed lifeguard duty before heading, via Midway, for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 21 June.

On 16 July, &quot;Bowfin&quot; left Hawaii and headed for the Ryukyu Islands. She encountered no worthwhile targets until 9 August, when her crew sighted four ships heading for the harbor at Minami Daito. She trailed them into port, and after they had moored, fired her bow torpedoes, blowing up two and damaging a third. A stray torpedo hit a dock, sending a bus careening into the water, later an incident the Cary Grant comedy film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; incorporated into its story line in 1959 (Grant yelling &quot;We sunk a truck!&quot; in the film after an unintentional misfire caused by a nurse on board). However, no sinkings were confirmed by Japanese records – again possibly because of the small size of the alleged victims.

An authenticated kill came off the Tokara Islands on 22 August, when she attacked a convoy, hit several ships, and claimed several kills, including two destroyers, but apparently sank only the transport . According to &quot;Tsushima-maru&quot; Commemoration Association data, the ship was carrying 1,661 civilian evacuees, including 834 schoolchildren, of whom 775 were killed. Shortly after the sinking, a &quot;gag order&quot; was enforced, and families and survivors rarely spoke about the incident. The number of victims who have been identified by name, based on notifications from bereaved families (as of 22 August 2012), include 780 schoolchildren.

On 28 August, &quot;Bowfin&quot; set a trawler afire with her four-inch gun. However, since she had futilely fired her last four torpedoes at this target before surfacing, the submarine headed via Midway and Pearl Harbor for the US West Coast. She reached San Francisco, California, on 21 September and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul.

==Seventh through ninth patrols==

At the end of the yard work, Commander Alexander K. Tyree relieved Commander Corbus on 16 December 1944; later that day, the submarine got underway westward back across the Pacific. Following training in Hawaiian waters, she headed for a station near the Japanese home islands south of Honshū, where she performed lifeguard services for American planes – both naval and Army – raiding strategic enemy targets in Japan. On 17 February, &quot;Bowfin&quot; attacked two Japanese subchasers and sank the &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 56&quot; with torpedoes, and then survived a 26-depth-charge attack by her victim&#x27;s consort, which had herself barely escaped destruction when some of &quot;Bowfin&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes exploded prematurely. The submarine later sank a Japanese sea truck with one torpedo. On 19 March about 15 miles south of Shikoku at 09:30, the submarine was on watch when a lone Navy torpedo bomber with white stars on its wings and its tail shot up headed in low toward the submarine. The plane had been hit moments earlier by enemy flak during its bombing run over the Kure Naval Yard. The plane landed in the water dead ahead, about 500 yards off the bow. It floated for two minutes and then nosed down and sank. Both men in the plane jumped out and hung onto an inflated raft. Eleven minutes later, the crew of &quot;Bowfin&quot; had them aboard. She rescued the pilot, Lieutenant R. U. Plant, and gunner, J. Papazoglakis (Pakis) of the downed Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber of Torpedo Squadron 83 (VT-83) from the aircraft carrier . The two men were cold and wet from just a few minutes in that water, but otherwise safe and sound. The captain ordered the life raft sunk and the dye marker destroyed with small arms fire and then resumed patrol on the lifeguard station. The submarine soon set a course for the Marianas and ended the patrol upon her arrival at Guam on 25 March.
Underway on 23 April for her eighth war patrol, the submarine plied the waters north of Honshū and Hokkaidō. Her first kill came on 1 May, when two of her torpedoes sank the transport &quot;Chowa Maru&quot;. A week later, she overtook, torpedoed, and destroyed the cargo ship &quot;Daito Maru No. 3&quot;, but that proved to be the last score of the patrol. After a fortnight of futile searching for targets, she arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam, for refit.

While training for her ninth and final patrol of the war, &quot;Bowfin&quot; rescued a Marine Corps pilot whose fighter had crashed. She got underway on 29 May and set course for Japan. One of nine submarines protected by newly developed mine-detecting sonar and sent into the Sea of Japan, she threaded her way through the minefields of Tsushima Strait, which guarded this previously sacrosanct maritime heart of the Japanese Empire, but found little enemy shipping. Nevertheless, she wasted neither of her two possible contacts: the first, the cargo ship took four torpedoes before sinking on 11 June; and the second, the cargo ship &quot;Akiura Maru&quot; met a similar fate on 13 June.

The submarine left the Sea of Japan by La Pérouse Strait (Soya Misaki) and headed for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on Independence Day and began preparations to return to action. Early in August, &quot;Bowfin&quot; sailed for the Marianas, her staging point for her 10th war patrol. However, while en route, she received word of Japan&#x27;s capitulation. As a result, she reversed course and returned to Hawaii and, then, headed for the Panama Canal on her way to the east coast of the United States. &quot;Bowfin&quot; arrived at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, on 21 September 1945. She served in the Atlantic Fleet until decommissioned at New London on 12 February 1947 and placed in reserve.

==Post-war==

Reactivated because of the Navy&#x27;s need to expand the fleet to support United Nations-led forces during the Korean War, the submarine was recommissioned on 27 July 1951, and following shakedown training, sailed for the Pacific. After arriving at San Diego, California, on 6 October, she worked from that port for the next two years, devoting her time to training operations and local exercises. The nominal ending of hostilities in Korea in the summer of 1953 reduced the Navy&#x27;s need for active submarines and prompted &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s second inactivation. She arrived at San Francisco on 8 October 1953, and was placed out of commission, in reserve, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 22 April 1954. The warship remained there until moving to Seattle, Washington, on 1 May 1960 to replace as the Naval Reserve training submarine there, and to begin a little over a decade&#x27;s service. Her name was finally stricken from the Navy list on 1 December 1971, and she was taken back to Pearl Harbor, where she now serves as a memorial. Audio tours are available to the general public at Pearl Harbor. Some areas of the boat are off limits.

&quot;Bowfin&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 1987, she was drydocked and refitted to be used as a floating location to portray three different submarines in the epic miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. She was drydocked again in 2004, and a third time in 2022.

==The sinking of&quot; Tsushima Maru&quot;==
&quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; was an unmarked Japanese cargo ship sunk by &quot;Bowfin&quot; between 22:00 and 22:30 local time on 22 August 1944 as the ship was carrying hundreds of schoolchildren from Okinawa to Kagoshima. Attacked while in convoy, &quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; sank close to the island of Akusekijima. About 1,484 civilians, including 767 schoolchildren, were killed; 59 children survived the sinking.

On her sixth patrol, &quot;Bowfin&quot; destroyed a pier at Minami Daito that contained a crane and a bus. Thirteen small vessels were sunk by &quot;Bowfin&quot;″s deck guns.

==USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; Submarine Museum &amp; Park==
The submarine is owned and operated by the Pacific Fleet Submarine Memorial Association, and is now part of the USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; Submarine Museum &amp; Park in Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Visitors can tour the submarine with an audio narration of life in the vessel during World War II.

The park&#x27;s museum features exhibits and artifacts about submarines and the history of the United States Submarine Service, including detailed models, weapon systems, photographs, paintings, battleflags, recruiting posters, and a memorial honoring the 52 American submarines and the more than 3,500 submariners lost during World War II.

The museum&#x27;s other exhibits include a Kaiten torpedo and a 40-mm quad gun, along with Poseidon C-3 and Regulus I missiles. The park is located within walking distance of the visitor center for the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial and it is across the Harbor from the Battleship &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial.

<doc id="432510" wikidata="Q1789356" url="?curid=432510" title="USS Omaha (SSN-692)">
<text>USS &quot;Omaha&quot; (SSN-692), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Omaha, Nebraska. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 31 January 1971 and her keel was laid down on 27 January 1973. She was launched on 21 February 1976 sponsored by Mrs. Victoria Kuncl Hruska, wife of Senator Roman L. Hruska, and commissioned on 11 March 1978.

&quot;Omaha&quot; was placed in commission in reserve on 7 February 1995, decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 October 1995 and laid up at Bremerton in Washington. She was scheduled to enter the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 30 September 2010. Recycling was completed 30 November 2012.

== Service history ==

The third Omaha (SSN-692) was laid down on 27 January 1973 at Groton, Conn., by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp.; launched on 21 February 1976; sponsored by Mrs. Victoria E. Kuncl Hruska, wife of Senator Roman L. Hruska of Nebraska; and commissioned on 11 March 1978.

Upon her commissioning, Omaha was assigned to Groton as her homeport; however, in late April 1978, she was reassigned to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, effective as of 1 May. The boat sailed from Naval Submarine Base New London on 11 August, arriving on 15 September at Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor, where she was a member of Submarine Squadron (SubRon) Seven. Among her accomplishments for the year, the submarine completed sea trials, initial shakedown, Naval Sea Systems Command (NavSea) acoustic trials, Mk. 48 torpedo certification, and a submarine versus submarine type warfare exercise. On 15 November, Omaha entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an extended post shakedown availability (PSA) and selected restricted availability (SRA), which concluded in June 1979.

Following post-SRA sea trials, in July 1979 Omaha completed three SubRoc quality assurance system test firings and 12 Mk. 48 torpedo firings for weapons systems accuracy test certification. On 22 July, Omaha stood out from Pearl Harbor for deployment to the Eastern Pacific (EastPac). Ports visited included Seattle, Wash., during the city’s Seafair Festival and Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada. During the year, the submarine also completed NavSea acoustic trials, two major anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises, two special operations, and several local operations.

In early 1980, Omaha was busy preparing to make her first overseas deployment, conducting training, examinations, certifications, and upkeep in the first half of the year. She set off for the western Pacific (WestPac) in May, arriving on station on 6 June. She completed special operations for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac) through the first week of July and then put in to Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, for a week of upkeep. The ship called at Hong Kong in mid-July but had to cut her visit short and put to sea to avoid Typhoon Joe. She paused at Guam on 28 July for three weeks of upkeep. On 16 August, Omaha conducted a surveillance operation in the Philippine Sea and then proceeded to the Indian Ocean, where she operated for the next two months. The boat arrived at the remote outpost of Diego Garcia for a week of upkeep on 28 October and then enjoyed a week-long port visit (10–16 November) at Perth, Australia, before returning to Pearl Harbor in December in time for the holiday season. The boat won the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her service in the Indian Ocean from 23 August–21 November during this deployment. Omaha also this year received a Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy.

Omaha departed for another relatively short WestPac deployment early in June 1981, inchopping to the Seventh Fleet on the 8th. The ship conducted special operations for ComSubPac, then put in to Subic Bay for upkeep (28 July–1 August). She then made the return transit to Pearl Harbor. Following her deployment, in September Omaha welcomed 100 guests for a dependents’ cruise. She completed a weapons offload and on 25 September the submarine entered dry dock at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. During this SRA period, workers installed a retractable towed array sonar system.

Following sea trials and the completion of SRA in February 1982, Omaha once again prepared to deploy with a series of inspections, examinations, and certifications. The submarine sailed from Pearl Harbor in September for a WestPac deployment, inchopping to the Seventh Fleet with the Enterprise (CVAN-65) Battle Group. During the first week of October, the boat conducted operations in the northern Pacific and Sea of Japan under Commander Task Group (CTG) 70.6. Following upkeep at Subic Bay (13–21 October), Omaha visited Singapore (25–29 October). She then transited the Malacca Strait in company with the escort ship Hepburn (DE-1055) en route to the Indian Ocean for operations with CTG 70.6, including ASWEx 83-2U from 15–17 November. The boat visited Mombasa, Kenya (23–26 November) and Diego Garcia (21–23 December) and rang in the new year at Perth, Australia (30 December–5 January 1983).

Omaha then returned to the western Pacific, stopping briefly at Subic Bay on the way to ASUWEx 83-1 in the Philippine Sea on 17–18 January 1983. After a maintenance period at Guam from 22 January–8 February, the submarine called at Yokosuka, Japan (15–18 February) and then resumed special operations for ComSubPac until outchopping on 11 March and setting course for Pearl Harbor.

After her post-deployment stand down, Omaha resumed underway operations in May 1983, completing a special project for the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) off San Clemente Island, Calif. In June, the boat completed several major inspections and then entered the floating dry dock Competent (AFDM-6) to begin a two-month selected restricted availability. She conducted sea trials and completed SRA in October.

In early January 1984, Omaha exercised with the frigate Badger (FF-1071). She completed a tactical readiness evaluation in March and shortly thereafter put to sea for another WestPac deployment. Arriving on station on 1 April, she completed special operations for ComSubPac until 15 May. From 16–21 May, the ship put in to Yokosuka for upkeep and following a week of operations arrived at Subic Bay for additional maintenance from 30 May–10 June. During the next week, Omaha completed an independent ship exercise in the South China Sea, returning to Subic Bay on 21 June. The submarine made a port visit at Hong Kong supported by the destroyer Leftwich (DD-984) (1–4 August) and then returned to Subic Bay (7–11 August). The boat provided services for CTG 70.6 while en route to Singapore, where Omaha hosted the Honorable Devan Nair, the President of the Republic, for dinner on board one evening during her five day visit (18–22 August). During another upkeep period at Subic Bay (28 August–8 September), the ship had to sortie from 1–3 September to avoid Typhoon Ike. She returned to Pearl Harbor later that month.

Following her deployment, Omaha stood out once again in mid-November 1984 to take part in Fleet Exercise 1-85 in the Philippine Sea from 17 November–1 December. Fellow SubRon Seven boats Swordfish (SSN-579), Sargo (SSN-583), San Francisco (SSN-711), and Bremerton (SSN-698) also participated in this major exercise.

Omaha then made preparations to enter Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 7 January 1985 for a scheduled major overhaul, which continued through all of 1985 and 1986. Significant work completed included upgrading her sonar and fire control systems and reworking all other ship’s systems.

Omaha emerged from overhaul on 13 April 1987 and began a series of post-overhaul inspections and certifications to achieve operational readiness for extended deployment. From late July to early September, the submarine completed a six-week EastPac deployment which included acoustic trials and ASW operations. During this cruise, the boat visited Seattle, Wash.; Alameda, Calif.; and San Diego. In November, Omaha successfully certified to employ the Tomahawk missile weapons system and in December, she completed her pre-overseas movement certification.

In January 1988, Omaha commenced an eight week deployment to the Northern Pacific (NorPac) area. Following an upkeep period, the ship embarked upon a six month WestPac deployment in April, inchopping on the 21st. Operating in the Philippine Sea, the ship participated in KiloEx from 12–14 May, followed by ASWEx 88-2JA from 18–20 May. She then completed a Harpoon exercise in the South China Sea (27–28 May). Omaha visited Hong Kong from 21–27 August, then returned to sea for various independent and joint evolutions. This deployment also included stops at Okinawa and Yokosuka, Japan; Subic Bay; Guam; and Chinhae, Republic of Korea. Omaha returned home in October, operated locally in November, and successfully completed the tactical readiness examination in December.

In early 1989, Omaha operated locally and completed ship’s maintenance. In March she departed Pearl Harbor for an eight week NorPac deployment. After returning home in April, the ship continued local operations and completed a technical proficiency inspection. After making a dependents’ cruise with a port call at Lahaina on the island of Maui in June, Omaha completed a selected restricted availability in July and August. She took part in PacEX 89 in September and October. After visiting Cold Bay, Alaska, Omaha returned to Hawaii to conduct local operations and complete her tactical readiness evaluation and pre-overseas movement upkeep in the last quarter of the year.

January 1990 saw Omaha put to sea for another western Pacific deployment. Over the course of her cruise, the submarine called at Yokosuka, Guam, Chinhae, Subic Bay, and Hong Kong. Returning to Pearl Harbor in July, the boat operated locally through the rest of the summer and then departed again for a seven-week NorPac deployment in October, calling at Seattle before returning home in November to resume local operations into the New Year.

Omaha held an intermediate maintenance availability in January 1991. In this month, the ship also achieved a &quot;Solid Gold&quot; wardroom with the qualification of LT Jean-Paul (&quot;JP&quot;) Tennant, becoming the only submarine in SubPac with all officers qualified in submarines. In February, Omaha served as the at-sea training ship for prospective commanding officers. She also made two dependents’ cruises with a port call at Lahaina. Following upkeep, the submarine operated locally through the spring while also completing torpedo certification proficiency firings and the tactical readiness evaluation.

In May 1991, Omaha departed for a seven week deployment to the northern Pacific, conducting operations for ComSubPac. On the 31st, the ship participated in a humanitarian evacuation of one of her crew off Kodiak Island due to the premature birth of his child, the crewman being transported ashore by a Coast Guard helicopter. Happily, his child recovered fully from the complications of premature birth. The submarine made a port visit at Adak, Alaska, in June and returned to Pearl Harbor in July. Shortly thereafter, Omaha put to sea once again, headed this time for the eastern Pacific. From 2–6 August, the ship stopped at Esquimalt, B.C., then put in to Bangor, Wash. (10–11 August), where she embarked male guests for a &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; to Alameda, Calif. While at Alameda (14–19 August), Omaha conducted two distinguished visitor cruises on the 14th and 15th. Guests included the mayor of Alameda and the Honorable P. J. Morgan, mayor of Omaha, Neb., and other honored guests of the ship’s namesake city. After another brief stop at San Diego (24–25 August), the boat returned home to Pearl Harbor. Omaha received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her work from 1 January 1990 – 1 August 1991.

Following her EastPac deployment, Omaha operated locally until 4 November 1991, when she entered Competent for selected restricted availability. The ship completed sea trials and concluded her SRA at the end of February 1992 and commenced operations in local waters. In March, the submarine exercised with Pintado (SSN-672) and Birmingham (SSN-695). She held another dependents’ cruise in April, including a stop at Lahaina. As Omaha prepared for her next deployment during the spring, she completed her tactical readiness evaluation and deperming. The boat participated in the major multi-national fleet exercise RimPac 92 in June and achieved her pre-overseas movement certification in July.

Omaha departed on a six month WestPac deployment in August 1992. During her transit of the Pacific, the submarine took part in battle group support exercises. Later in the month, she conducted a search and rescue exercise and touched at Sasebo, Japan. In November, the boat called at Yokosuka and then headed to Australia to take part in Exercise Lungfish 92 with the Australian submarines HMAS Otway (S.59) and HMAS Ovens (S.70). The ship visited Melbourne (2–5 December) and Brisbane (14–17 December) and then sailed for Guam for a maintenance availability alongside submarine tender Holland (AS-32). Omaha departed Guam 10 January 1993 and returned to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 26 January.

Following post-deployment stand down, Omaha held an intermediate maintenance activity in March 1993 and conducted underway training locally. An inspection and survey board conducted an underway material inspection 23–24 April. At the end of the month, the ship enjoyed a dependents cruise and port call in Kailua-Kona (30 April–3 May) on the island of Hawaii. She returned to Pearl Harbor and operated locally for the rest of the spring and then spent most of July in upkeep. The submarine completed major assessments in the summer and also conducted prospective commanding officer (PCO) operations in August.

On 13 September 1993, Omaha got underway for an EastPac deployment, headed first to San Diego (18–26 September). Members of the veterans’ association for the previous Omaha (CL-4), in town for their annual reunion, met with the crew of the submarine on the 21st, and the ship’s historian reported that &quot;New ties [were] made between all shipmates of the Omahas.&quot; Additional ports visited during the deployment included Alameda (28–30 September) and Nanoose and Esquimalt, B.C. (6–12 October). She returned to Hawaii on 4 November and spent the rest of the year in stand down and upkeep.

The beginning of 1994 found Omaha preparing for her next WestPac deployment with underway training and assessments, an intermediate maintenance activity in February and completion of pre-overseas movement certification in March. She stood out from Pearl Harbor on 4 April and set course for the western Pacific, calling later that month in Sasebo, Japan. In May, the ship made a short stop at Chinhae, where two Republic of Korea naval personnel embarked for a brief submarine indoctrination cruise. In June, Omaha participated in RimPac 94, a large joint battle exercise with warships from the U.S., Canadian, Australian, Japanese, and South Korean navies. During operations, the submarine conducted a humanitarian evacuation of a senior chief petty officer who was transferred by helicopter to the aircraft carrier Independence (CV-62). June also saw Omaha in Guam for an availability alongside Holland, and the ship also conducted special forces training with a U.S. Marine reconnaissance company off Okinawa. The boat paid another visit to Guam for maintenance alongside Holland in August. She then called at Brisbane (20–25 August) and American Samoa (29 August–1 September). Arriving back at Pearl Harbor on 6 September, for the rest of the month Omaha’s crew enjoyed a well-deserved stand-down period with their families after having maintained 81% operation tempo while deployed.

Omaha resumed operations in October 1994, sailing in local waters in support of various ships in Squadron Seven. In November, the submarine held an intermediate maintenance availability. While on deployment earlier in the year, Omaha’s crew received word that they would be changing homeports to Kittery, Maine, effective administratively on 1 December, to undergo inactivation at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. To conclude her time in Pearl Harbor, Omaha conducted a dependents’ cruise to Kailua-Kona (12–15 December). The following day at Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor, the boat held an inactivation ceremony with three former commanding officers (Hamilton, Sherwood, and Pohtos) in attendance, marking the beginning of the process of stripping the ship prior to decommissioning and final disposition.

Placed in reserve status on 7 February 1995, Omaha was decommissioned at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 5 October 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. The boat was disposed of in the Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Wash. Recycling was completed as of 30 November 2012. Omaha’s sail and rudder have been preserved for placement in a memorial park in the submarine’s namesake city.

<text>Joseph Leo Mankiewicz (; February 11, 1909 – February 5, 1993) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A four-time Academy Award winner, he is best known for his witty and literate dialogue and his preference for voice-over narration and narrative flashbacks. Also known as an actor&#x27;s director, Mankiewicz directed several prominent actors, including Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor, to several of their memorable onscreen performances. 

Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Mankiewicz studied at Columbia University and graduated in 1928. He moved overseas to Europe, where he worked as a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and translated German intertitles into English for UFA. On the advice of his screenwriter brother Herman, Mankiewicz moved back to the United States, and was hired by Paramount Pictures as a dialogue writer. He then became a screenwriter, writing for numerous films starring Jack Oakie. He next moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) where he served as a producer for several films, including &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940) and &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942). Mankiewicz left MGM after a dispute with Louis B. Mayer.

In 1944, Mankiewicz began working for Twentieth Century-Fox, where he produced &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1944). He made his directorial debut with &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946) after Ernst Lubitsch had dropped out due to illness. Mankiewicz remained at Twentieth Century-Fox, directing a broad range of genre films. Consecutively, in 1950 and 1951, he won two Academy Awards each for writing and directing &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949) and &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950). In 1953, Mankiewicz formed his own production company Figaro, where he independently produced, as well as wrote and directed, &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1958). 

In 1961, Mankiewicz took over direction from Rouben Mamoulian for &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963). The production was beset with numerous difficulties, including a heavily publicized extramarital affair between the film&#x27;s stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Relatively late into the production, Darryl F. Zanuck reassumed control of Twentieth Century-Fox as studio president, and briefly fired Mankiewicz for the film&#x27;s excessive production overruns. Released in 1963, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; became the highest-grossing film of 1963 and earned mixed reviews from film critics. Mankiewicz&#x27;s reputation suffered, and he did not return to direct another film until &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967).

Mankiewicz then directed &quot;There Was a Crooked Man...&quot; (1970) and the documentary &quot;&quot; (1972), sharing credit with Sidney Lumet on the latter film. His final film &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), starring Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier, earned Mankiewicz his fourth and final Oscar nomination as Best Director. In 1993, Mankiewicz died at Bedford, New York, at the age of 83. 

==Early life and education==
Mankiewicz was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to Franz Mankiewicz (died 1941) and Johanna Blumenau, Jewish emigrants from Germany and Courland, respectively. His siblings were Herman J. Mankiewicz (1897–1953) and Erna Stenbuck (née Mankiewicz, 1901–1979). At age four, Joseph moved with his family to New York City, and graduated in 1924 from Stuyvesant High School. He followed his brother Herman to Columbia University, where he initially wanted to be a psychiatrist. Mankiewicz once stated, &quot;I took a pre-med course at Columbia. Then came the part where you disembowel frogs and earthworms, which horrified and nauseated me. But we really got me was physics.&quot; Mankiewicz failed the course, and switched his major to English and wrote for the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;. He graduated in 1928 and moved to Germany. There, he intended to enroll in the University of Berlin and finish at Oxford for a potential career in pedagogy. 

However, Mankiewicz abandoned these plans, and was hired as an assistant correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Sigrid Schultz, the Berlin bureau chief for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, gave Mankiewicz his first assignment, which was to interview explorer Umberto Nobile. Mankiewicz earned another job, translating film intertitles from German to English for UFA, and worked a third job as a stringer for the &quot;Variety&quot; trade magazine. He relocated to Paris, which Mankiewicz described as the &quot;three most miserable months of my life.&quot; After receiving a despondent letter from his brother, Herman encouraged Joseph to move to Hollywood.

==Career==
===1929–1933: Paramount===
In 1929, Mankiewicz got a contract to work as a writer at Paramount, through his brother Herman. Herman was one of the writers on &quot;The Dummy&quot; (1929), on which Mankiewicz wrote titles. He also did titles for &quot;Close Harmony&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Man I Love&quot; (1929) with Jack Oakie, &quot;The Studio Murder Mystery&quot; (1929), &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (1929), &quot;The River of Romance&quot; (1929), &quot;The Saturday Night Kid&quot; (1929) with Clara Bow, &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929) with Gary Cooper.

Mankiewicz started to be credited on screenplays for films like &quot;Fast Company&quot; (1929) starring Jack Oakie and &quot;Slightly Scarlet&quot; (1930) and he worked on the script for &quot;The Light of Western Stars&quot; (1930) with Richard Arlen and &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930). Mankiewicz wrote &quot;The Social Lion&quot; (1930) with Oakie, &quot;Only Saps Work&quot; (1930), &quot;The Gang Buster&quot; (1931) with Arlen, &quot;Finn and Hattie&quot; (1931) with Oakie, and &quot;June Moon&quot; (1931) with Oakie.

He also did the scripts for &quot;Skippy&quot; (1931) with Jackie Cooper, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; (1931) with Oakie, &quot;Newly Rich&quot; (1931), and &quot;Sooky&quot; (1931), a sequel to &quot;Skippy&quot;. This was followed by &quot;This Reckless Age&quot; (1932), &quot;Sky Bride&quot; (1932) with Arlen and Oakie, &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1932) with Oakie and W.C. Fields, &quot;Night After Night&quot; (1932) (uncredited), and &quot;If I Had a Million &quot; (1932). He was borrowed by RKO for &quot;Diplomaniacs&quot; (1933) and &quot;Emergency Call&quot; (1933). He returned to Paramount for &quot;Too Much Harmony&quot; (1933) with Oakie and Bing Crosby, &quot;Meet the Baron&quot; (1933) (uncredited), and the all-star &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933).

===1934–1944: MGM===
Herman began working for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in March 1933, and David O. Selznick hired Joe as a screenwriter with a weekly salary of $750. At the age of 25, Joseph co-wrote &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; (1934) with Oliver H. P. Garrett, which starred Myrna Loy and William Powell. The film was a critical and commercial success, and two months into its release, federal agents shot John Dillinger as he left a Chicago theater having viewed the film. At the 1935 Academy Awards, Arthur Caesar won the Academy Award for Best Story. Meanwhile, Joseph contributed additional dialogue for King Vidor&#x27;s 1934 film &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;. 

Mankiewicz&#x27;s next project was adapting &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; (1934) based on the 1933 play by Edward Barry Roberts and Frank Morgan Cavett. Bernard H. Hyman was the producer, and Joe was instructed to write for Loretta Young, George Brent and Frank Cavett. When Mankiewicz delivered the script, Hyman replied: &quot;We&#x27;re going to use Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery.&quot; He told Mankiewicz to arrive at Crawford&#x27;s residence and read the script to her. Mankiewicz at first declined the offer, but later drove to Crawford&#x27;s Brentwood home. During the reading, Crawford was delighted at the line: &quot;I could build a fire by rubbing two boy scouts together.&quot; &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; became a success, and Mankiewicz was assigned another Joan Crawford vehicle &quot;I Live My Life&quot; (1935), after Louis B. Mayer told Mankiewicz: &quot;You&#x27;re the only one on the lot who knows what to do with her.&quot; 
In the autumn of 1935, having written three successful films, Mankiewicz personally requested Mayer to direct his own feature film. Mayer declined his proposition and instead replied: &quot;You have to learn to crawl before you can walk.&quot; Mankiewicz was promoted to producer with &quot;Three Godfathers&quot; (1936). Adapted from the 1913 novel by Peter B. Kyne, the film is a biblically-inspired Western about three outlaws—Chester Morris, Lewis Stone and Walter Brennan—rescuing a baby in the Mojave Desert. 

Mankiewicz&#x27;s next project was &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), that was inspired by a real-life mob lynching in which two suspects, held in a San Jose prison, were hanged for the murder of a department store heir. While in New York, screenwriter Norman Krasna read the story in &quot;The Nation&quot;, and during the summer of 1934, he pitched the idea to Mankiewicz and Samuel Marx, who were interested in it, which prompted an early story treatment. After some time, Krasna had no recollection of the story, so Mankiewicz wrote a ten-page treatment titled &quot;Mob Rule&quot; and paid Krasner for the screen rights. Mankiewicz was assigned with Fritz Lang on a film &quot;about a crooked D.A.&quot; but the project was shelved. 

MGM general manager Eddie Mannix then handed Lang the &quot;Mob Rule&quot; treatment, with the subsequent drafts written by Bartlett Cormack. During filming, Lang had an adversarial relationship with the cast and crew, in which Mankiewicz reflected on years later, calling Lang a &quot;a strange man&quot; and a &quot;terrible tyrant on the set.&quot; Released in June 1936, &quot;Fury&quot; was acclaimed by several film publications and was a box office success, catapulting Mankiewicz with his first major hit as a producer. 

Mankewicz reteamed with Crawford on the 1936 film &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot;—her first costume drama film—as an innkeeper&#x27;s daughter, with Robert Taylor, Franchot Tone, Melvyn Douglas and James Stewart as potential tutors. Their collaboration continued with &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1936), a romantic comedy with two newspaper men, Clark Gable and Franchot Tone vying for Crawford. Retroactively seen as a pale imitation of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934, which also starred Gable), it was a box office success. Crawford next starred in &quot;The Bride Wore Red&quot; (1937), directed by Dorothy Arzner. 

Beginning with &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1937), Mankiewicz collaborated with director Frank Borzage in a story about a Delancey Street working-class girl torn between her chiseler husband (Alan Curtis) and a shipping magnate (Spencer Tracy). Their follow-up film, &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (1938), with Margaret Sullavan and Robert Taylor, began F. Scott Fitzgerald writing the initial script. However, Sullavan complained to Mankiewicz that her passages were unspeakable, which led to Mankiewicz and other screenwriters redrafting Fitzgerald&#x27;s dialogue. Mankiewicz later joked, &quot;If I go down at all in literary history, in a footnote, it will be as the swine who rewrote F. Scott Fitzgerald.&quot; Borzage&#x27;s next film &quot;The Shining Hour&quot; (1938), starring Crawford, Sullavan and Melvyn Douglas, was well received by critics but was a box-office flop. 

Mankiewicz produced &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1938). At least four film versions had already existed before Lionel Barrymore, who had played Ebenezer Scrooge on the radio, prompted MGM to have his filmed version. However, Barrymore broke his hip after tripping over a cable while filming &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937). Mankiewicz offered to delay filming for a year, but Barrymore insisted the production continue. Mankiewicz selected Reginald Owen as Scrooge, who had been hired to portray Jacob Marley. Production was completed in November 1938 and the film was screened as a holiday attraction at the Radio City Music Hall. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote the film wielded &quot;superb acting, inspired direction and top production values into an intensively interesting exposition of the Dickens story.&quot; Since its release, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; has become a perennial television favorite.

By 1938, Katharine Hepburn had been labeled &quot;box office poison&quot; by box office exhibitors after several unsuccessful films. Hepburn departed Hollywood and starred as Tracy Lord in Philip Barry&#x27;s 1939 play &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. It became one of the year&#x27;s successful Broadway plays, and Howard Hughes secured the film rights enabling Hepburn to forge a screen comeback. Several Hollywood studios declined to produce the film on the basis of Hepburn&#x27;s box office record and male actors who demurred being potentially outshined by her. Louis B. Mayer took Hughes&#x27;s offer on the assurance that Hepburn should appear with &quot;two important male stars.&quot; 
Cary Grant and James Stewart were cast in the leading male roles, while George Cukor was hired to direct. At Hepburn&#x27;s insistence, Donald Ogden Stewart wrote a faithful adaptation of Barry&#x27;s play, though he added two brief scenes based on Mankiewicz&#x27;s suggestions. Mankiewicz claimed credit for the film&#x27;s opening scene—a silent comic prologue featuring Grant and Hepburn in a tableau of their temperamental and fracturing marriage. Released in December 1940, &quot;A Philadelphia Story&quot; was a critical and commercial success, making it Mankiewicz&#x27;s biggest hit as a producer. At the 1941 Academy Awards, the film earned six Oscar nominations, including one for Outstanding Production for Mankiewicz. James Stewart won the Academy Award for Best Actor, as well as Odgen Stewart winning for Best Adapted Screenplay. 

Mankiewicz reteamed with Hepburn on the romantic comedy &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942). Deriving inspiration from his father and newspaper columnist Dorothy Parker, Ring Lardner Jr. had written a story outline before collaborating with Garson and Michael Kanin. Both men drafted a 99-paged script, tentatively titled &quot;The Thing About Women&quot;, which they showed to Hepburn. Eager to make it her next film, Hepburn presented the script directly to Mayer, who then consulted Mankiewicz for his opinion. He was enthusiastic for the script, believing it had been written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. 
Retitled &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, the premise involves Tess Harding, a high-browed foreign affairs reporter, pitted against Sam Craig, a sports columnist. Spencer Tracy was Hepburn&#x27;s first choice, though he was initially unavailable until &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946) was cancelled. Mankiewicz introduced the two stars, who at the time had never met before. Hepburn greeted Tracy, commenting, &quot;Mr. Tracy, I think you&#x27;re a little short for me.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t worry,&quot; Mankiewicz chimed in, &quot;He&#x27;ll cut you down to size.&quot; George Cukor was also unavailable as he was directing &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941) so at Hepburn&#x27;s behest, George Stevens was loaned out to MGM from Columbia Pictures. 

During test screenings, preview audiences distained at the original ending, which had Tess accepting her newfound role as a housewife. Stevens, Mankiewicz and Mayer agreed to write a new ending, with Tess attempting to make breakfast, but fails miserably. Hepburn deplored the new scene, but test audiences responded favorably. Released in February 1942, &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; was praised by film critics for the chemistry between the stars. At the 1943 Academy Awards, Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress, while Michael Kanin and Lardner Jr. won for Best Original Screenplay.

By 1942, Mankiewicz was romantically involved in Judy Garland. As a vehicle for Garland, he began adapting S. N. Behrman&#x27;s 1942 play &quot;The Pirate&quot;. The adaptation was never completed, but eventually became a 1948 musical unrelated to Mankiewicz&#x27;s involvement. To reduce Garland&#x27;s dependency on prescription medicine, Mankiewicz advised her to seek psychiatric therapy sessions with Ernst Simmel. Garland&#x27;s mother Ethel Gumm reported the incident to Mayer, who later called Mankiewicz into his office. There, Mayer chastened him for his involvement, stating, &quot;You mustn&#x27;t mess with our property.&quot; The two fell into an argument, and Mankiewicz decided to quit MGM negotiating for an early termination with one year left on his contract. Mankiewicz&#x27;s final productions at MGM were &quot;Reunion in France&quot; (1942) starring Joan Crawford and John Wayne, and &quot;Cairo&quot; (1942) with Jeanette MacDonald—the latter film Mankiewicz had his producing credit removed at his request.

===1944–1952: 20th Century Fox===

By August 1943, Mankiewicz had signed with Twentieth Century-Fox, stipulating his contractual right to write and direct. As a follow-up to &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), Mankiewicz selected A. J. Cronin&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; as his first production. Rewriting a script by Nunnally Johnson, the tale centered on Father Francis Chisholm, a humble Scottish Catholic priest, in his thirty-five years as a missionary in a small Chinese village. Gregory Peck was cast in the lead role while Ingrid Bergman was the studio&#x27;s first choice as the Reverend Mother Maria-Veronica. After Bergman withdrew, Mankiewicz pleaded with Darryl F. Zanuck to instead cast his then-wife Rose Stradner. The film opened in December 1944 to mixed reviews, though it garnered four Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck.

Meanwhile, Twentieth Century-Fox acquired the screen rights to Anya Seton&#x27;s gothic romance novel &quot;Dragonwyck&quot;, with Ernst Lubitsch as the director. However, Lubitsch collapsed from a heart attack while filming &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; (1945). While recuperating, he decided instead to produce and have Mankiewicz direct &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946). By May 1944, Gregory Peck and Gene Tierney were cast in the leading roles, but Peck dropped out to star in &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946) and was replaced by Vincent Price. 
&quot;Dragonwyck&quot; tells of Nicholas van Ryn, the proprietor of the Dragonwyck estate, who poisons his invalid wife and marries his cousin Miranda, in hopes of bearing an heir. When their infant son dies, Nicholas copes with opium and schemes to murder Miranda, who falls for a local doctor. Displeased with Mankiewicz&#x27;s creative decisions, Lubitsch removed his name from the production credits. &quot;We differed about some of the direction,&quot; Mankiewicz explained, &quot;mostly about where I put the camera.&quot; A review in &quot;Variety&quot; applauded &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; as a &quot;psychological yarn, its mid-19th century American feudal background being always brooding with never a break in its flow of morbidity. Yet, it is always interesting if somewhat too pointed at times in its fictional contrivance.&quot; The film earned $3 million in box office rentals in the United States and Canada. 

&quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; (1946) originated from Marvin Borowsky&#x27;s short story &quot;The Lonely Journey&quot;. While Zanuck was in Europe, Anderson Lawler came across the story, which impressed Zanuck. Back in the United States, Lawler presented an adaptation script by Howard Dimsdale to Mankiewicz, who was eager to direct his second film. A &quot;film noir&quot;, John Hodiak plays an amnesiac war veteran who searches for a detective named Larry Cravat, whom he discovers was involved in a murder over $2 million in Nazi funds funneled into Los Angeles. 

Over a course of eighteen months, Mankiewicz directed three adaptations adapted by Philip Dunne—&quot;The Late George Apley&quot; (1947), &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1948), and &quot;Escape&quot; (1948)—each film &quot;done in rapid succession, not of my writing, in which I concentrated upon learning the technique and craft—indeed, upon dissociating myself as far as possible from the writer&#x27;s approach.&quot; Adapted from John P. Marquand&#x27;s novel of the same name, &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; was first produced as a play by Marquand and George S. Kaufman. Fox purchased the film rights for $275,000, with Ronald Colman and Peggy Cummins as the title character and Eleanor Apley, George&#x27;s daughter. 

Adapted from R. A. Dick&#x27;s 1945 novel, &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; stars Rex Harrison as the ghost of a sea captain unsuccessfully seeking to frighten Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney), a young widow who has rented her house, at the turn of the century. During filming, Tierney&#x27;s first two days were reshot at Dunne and Zanuck&#x27;s request, as Dunne had envisioned her as a &quot;straightforward, practical woman&quot; compared to Tierney&#x27;s initial quirkier characterization. More reshoots were done when Richard Ney was replaced with George Sanders. Upon its release, film reviewers praised Harrison and Tierney&#x27;s performances. &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Black and White). Mankiewicz reteamed with Harrison in &quot;Escape&quot; (1948), a story about a convict who escapes a Dartmoor prison. Filmed in Britain under tax regulations, much of the film was shot on location. 

Producer Sol C. Siegel had acquired the screen rights to the 1945 novel &quot;A Letter to Five Wives&quot;, which first appeared as a short story published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. Siegel had intended for Ernest Lubitsch to direct, and tapped Vera Caspary to write a script adaptation. Mankiewicz remembered, &quot;I read [Caspary&#x27;s script] and knew I had looked upon the Promised Land. I wrote the screenplay about four wives; Zanuck, in an almost bloodless operation, excised one, so we ended with &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;.&quot; Set in an affluent, postwar American suburb, three wives—Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell, and Ann Sothern—reflect on their marriages as each considers which of their husband has eloped with Addie Ross, voiced by Celeste Holm. The film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, and was lauded by critics and audiences for the performances of the cast. At the 23rd Academy Awards, in 1950, Mankiewicz was bestowed two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. 

In May 1949, Mankiewicz was the first recipient of the Screen Directors Guild (SDG)&#x27;s Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement. A year later, he was elected as the president for the Screen Directors Guild. A proponent for the Hollywood blacklist, Cecil B. DeMille proposed guild members should take an anticommunist loyalty oath. In August 1950, the board approved the measure, while Mankiewicz was vacationing overseas after filming &quot;All About Eve&quot;. When Mankiewicz returned, he was shocked DeMille had gone behind his back. &quot;It seems to me that kind of thing only happens in Moscow,&quot; to which DeMille replied, &quot;Well, maybe we need a little of that here.&quot; On October 12, DeMille convened a general board meeting, requesting 25 signatures to recall Mankiewicz as guild president. Mankiewicz&#x27;s supporters included John Huston, William Wyler, and Billy Wilder. Over the night, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Mankiewicz survived the recall election but retained the loyalty oath. 

Meanwhile, Siegel had hired screenwriter Philip Yordan to adapt Jerome Weidman&#x27;s novel, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Go There Anymore&quot; into a feature film titled &quot;House of Strangers&quot; (1949). However, Yordan was fired after writing two-thirds of a first draft. Between assignments, Mankiewicz did an entire rewrite of the script, in which the Screen Writers Guild arbitrated a shared credit between Yordan and Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz angrily disagreed so Yordan was given the sole credit. Featuring Edward G. Robinson, Richard Conte and Susan Hayward, the story centers on Gino Monetti, an Italian-American ex-convict son of a banking family who seeks revenge against his brothers for turning him into the police. The film was entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival where Robinson won for Best Actor. 

Following a trend of socially conscious films, including &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948), Zanuck purchased a story by Lesser Samuels about a racially charged encounter between a Black doctor and a white racist criminal. Yordan had written a script, which Mankiewicz promptly rewrote in six weeks. Titled &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1950), Mankiewicz cast Sidney Poitier in his screen debut while Richard Widmark played one of the racist brothers accusing Poitier of medical malpractice. Also, at the 23rd Academy Awards, Mankiewicz and Samuels were also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story and Screenplay, but lost to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950).
&quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950) originated from the 1946 &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; short story &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot; by Mary Orr. Fox purchased the rights to Orr&#x27;s story for $5,000 and Mankiewicz began writing the first draft while preparing for &quot;No Way Out&quot;. Notably, he secluded himself for six weeks to laboriously write the draft at the San Ysidro Ranch near Santa Barbara. On March 7, 1950, Zanuck finished reading Mankiewicz&#x27;s script and immediately sent a memo: &quot;Without any question of a doubt you have done a remarkable job. The holes that were present in certain sections of the original treatment have disappeared.&quot; However, he delivered a lengthier memo, requesting a reduction of 50 pages. 

Claudette Colbert was initially cast as Margo Channing, but suffered a back injury and withdrew less than ten days before filming. To replace her, Mankiewicz considered Gertrude Lawrence. Her attorney Fanny Holtzmann demanded changes to the script, which Mankiewicz declined to make. Fresh from her mutual split from Warner Bros., Bette Davis read the script, describing it as the best she had ever read, and accepted the role. Jeanne Crain was originally considered for the part of Eve Harrington, but Zanuck felt she lacked the &quot;bitch virtuosity&quot; needed for the role. He approved Mankiewicz&#x27;s suggestion for Anne Baxter. 

Critical reaction towards &quot;All About Eve&quot; was unilaterally positive, with praise directed towards the performances from the cast and Mankiewicz&#x27;s direction and screenplay. &quot;All About Eve&quot; was nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, and won for Best Picture. Mankiewicz won his second consecutive set of writing and directing Academy Awards. Davis and Baxter were nominated for the Best Actress Oscar but lost to Judy Holliday in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950).

Mankiewicz adapted and directed &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1951), also produced by Zanuck, which starred Cary Grant and Jeanne Crain. Adapted from Curt Goetz&#x27;s 1932 play &quot;Dr. Prätorius&quot;, Grant plays a physician who is investigated for his unorthodox medical practices led by Professor Ewell (Hume Cronyn). Meanwhile, he falls for Deborah Higgins, an unwed pregnant student contemplating suicide. Though it received favorable reviews, it failed to be profitable. 

Mankiewicz&#x27;s last film under contract with Fox was &quot;5 Fingers&quot; (1952), starring James Mason and Danielle Darrieux. Zanuck had enlisted Henry Hathaway to direct and Michael Wilson to write a script from Ludwig Carl Moyzisch&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Operation Cicero&quot;. Mankiewicz read Wilson&#x27;s script and cabled to Zanuck, stating he wanted to rewrite the dialogue feeling it needed &quot;humor, sex and excitement.&quot; Zanuck consented providing that Mankiewicz would not seek a writing credit and accept Otto Lang as the film&#x27;s producer. At Zanuck&#x27;s insistence, the film was retitled &quot;5 Fingers&quot; to avoid association with a race riot that had occurred in Cicero, Illinois. On the last day of filming, in September 1951, Mankiewicz declined to renew his contract with Twentieth Century-Fox, in which he decided to be an independent filmmaker. Released in March 1952, &quot;5 Fingers&quot; garnered fairly positive reviews.

===1953–1960: Return to MGM; Figaro, Inc.===
In December 1951, Mankiewicz signed a three-picture contract with MGM&#x27;s Dore Schary, with a stipulation he be allowed to produce theatrical stage productions. By 1952, Mankiewicz had three projects he was contemplating—an adaptation of Carl Jonas&#x27;s novel &quot;Jefferson Selleck&quot; about a midwestern businessman experiencing a midlife crisis with Spencer Tracy; &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;, and a new stage production of &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. During this time, MGM producer John Houseman approached Mankiewicz about directing a film adaptation of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. He reflected, &quot;Joe was one of the first people I thought of. He is so literate and such a good dialogue writer, I knew he&#x27;d be interested.&quot; 

Casting for the central roles involved several American and British actors, including James Mason as Brutus, John Gielgud as Cassius, and Louis Calhern as Caesar. Marlon Brando&#x27;s casting as Marc Antony was met with skepticism, so much that &quot;Time&quot; magazine jokingly wondered if Brando would be &quot;muttering and grumbling his lines in a Polish accent, sound reading the funeral oration?&quot; Against the studio&#x27;s objections, Houseman chose to photograph in black and white so it would mirror newsreels of Benito Mussolini. Principal photography continued until late October 1952, with the production sets repurposed from &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951). 

Released during the summer of 1953, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; opened positive reviews from film critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film was &quot;a production that pulls the full potential of point and passion from this classic of the stage, and Brando&#x27;s reciting of Mark Antony&#x27;s speech was described as a &quot;brilliant, electrifying splurge of bitter and passionate invective&quot;. While directing rehearsals for &quot;La bohème&quot;, disagreements over &quot;Jefferson Selleck&quot; led to a lapse in Mankiewicz&#x27;s MGM contract.

In 1951, Mankiewicz relocated his family to New York and within two years, he established his independent production company Figaro, Inc. Its namesake was taken from the barber in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. In Mankiewicz&#x27;s words, Figaro did &quot;a little bit of everything.&quot; In June 1956, the NBC television network acquired a 50 percent ownership stake with the right of first refusal to any proposed film project. United Artists was inked as the distributor, and Mankiewicz proceeded with his two-picture deal with &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954), which he had been originally written to be a novel. 

For his first original screenplay, Mankiewicz is believed to have been inspired by several Hollywood actresses, including Rita Hayworth, Linda Darnell, and Anne Chevalier. Envisioned as a &quot;Cinderella&quot;-like story set in Hollywood, the tale centers on the starlet Maria Vargas as her career is told in flashbacks, with one told by Harry Dawes, a veteran film director, played by Humphrey Bogart. Ava Gardner was Mankiewicz&#x27;s first choice for the title role, and she was loaned from MGM for a payment of $200,000 plus 10 percent of the box office returns. 

Principal filming began in early January 1954 at the Cinecittà studio in Rome. Bogart was frustrated with Gardner whispering her lines during one take and degenerated her acting prowess. Bogart himself had severe racking coughs while delivering his lines. When filming had concluded, Mankiewicz regretted not building any rapport with Gardner. Upon its release, Gene Arneel of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film as a &quot;dish of ingeniously-fashioned, original entertainment for grown-up viewers. it has a strong show business flavor and a line or two that might be beyond the ken of strangers in movie-making. But its basic story elements are strong and make for substantial fare on anyone&#x27;s menu.&quot; 

At the 27th Academy Awards, Mankiewicz was nominated for his screenplay while Edmond O&#x27;Brien won for Best Supporting Actor. Meanwhile, the script was faced with two plagiarism lawsuits, one was quickly dismissed and the other was litigated in 1960, alleging similarities to an unpublished manuscript inspired by Chevalier&#x27;s life. It was also dismissed. 

In 1954, Samuel Goldwyn hired Mankiewicz to write and direct the film version of the Broadway musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. Goldwyn pursued Gene Kelly for the part of Sky Masterson, but MGM&#x27;s Nicholas Schenck vigorously declined to loan out Kelly. Goldwyn suggested Marlon Brando instead, and Mankiewicz convinced Brando to take the part to expand his acting oeuvre. Frank Sinatra pursued the role as Nathan Detroit, while Jean Simmons was cast as Sister Sarah Brown after an extensive search. &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; was one of 1955&#x27;s biggest box office hits, earning $9 million in estimated distributor rentals in the United States and Canada. However, film critics found the film too verbose and were mixed on the musical performances. 

By the time &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; was released, Mankiewicz&#x27;s Figaro expanded with its contract with United Artists to produce nine films, with five films to be written and directed by him within four years. For his second directorial effort with Figaro, Mankiewicz considered a biographical film of Francisco Goya and an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and Danny Kaye. He however decided to write and direct &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1958), an adaptation of Graham Greene&#x27;s 1955 novel. Set against the backdrop of Indochina (now known as Vietnam), Alden Pyle, an idealistic American CIA agent, vies for the affection of Phuong, a local Vietnamese woman, against Thomas Fowler, a British journalist.

The choice role of Thomas Fowler had been offered to Laurence Olivier, who later declined after reading a draft. William Holden and James Mason were unavailable thus Mankiewicz turned to Michael Redgrave. Montgomery Clift was considered for Alden Pyle, but he was severely injured while filming &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957). Mankiewicz then cast Audie Murphy and selected Italian actress Giorgia Moll for Phuong. Mankiewicz, influenced by the climate of anti-Communism and the Hollywood blacklist, altered the message of Greene&#x27;s book, changing major parts of the story. He told film critic Arthur Knight after filming had wrapped, he wanted to &quot;make the American both more credible and truer to the earnest, hardworking, apolitical types that he found in Indo-China.&quot; A cautionary tale about America&#x27;s blind support for anti-Communists was turned into, according to Greene, a &quot;propaganda film for America&quot;.

While preparing &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, in 1956, Mankiewicz recruited film producer Walter Wanger to work for Figaro. Wanger proposed numerous film projects but most of these were turned down. After six months of no progress, Wanger proceeded with a film project starring Susan Hayward. By October 1957, Figaro had signed Hayward to star in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), a real-life account of Barbara Graham&#x27;s lethal execution. When a script draft was completed, Mankiewicz recommended several truncations to the script, which were made by his nephew Don Mankiewicz. Robert Wise was hired to direct the film. 

Mankiewicz reunited with Sam Spiegel on &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959), an adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s stage play. Katharine Hepburn portrayed Violet Venable, a wealthy widow, who has her niece Catherine Holly institutionalized after she had witnessed her son Sebastian&#x27;s death. Bribing the hospital with a one-million donation for renovation, Violet pushes John Cukrowicz, a neurosurgeon, to have Catherine lobotomized in order to preserve Sebastian&#x27;s memory. Elizabeth Taylor was cast Catherine, and it was Taylor who convinced Spiegel to cast her friend Montgomery Clift as Cukrowicz. The film earned mixed reviews from film critics but was a box office success, earning $9 million in worldwide box office rentals. At the 32nd Academy Awards, Hepburn and Taylor received competitive Oscar nominations for Best Actress.

===1961–1963: &quot;Cleopatra&quot;===
By May 1960, Mankiewicz was selected to write and direct a film adaptation of Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Justine&quot;, the first volume of &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;. Ava Gardner and David Niven were hired in the lead roles. The premise centered on Darley, an Anglo-Irish schoolmaster and aspiring novelist, who is determined to unravel the truth behind Justine, a beautiful young woman, with whom he had a brief affair with him. Darley later learns Justine is married to her husband Nassim, who is involved in a Coptic plot against the Muslims to arm the Zionists in Palestine. 

By the winter of 1960, Mankiewicz was vacationing at the Children&#x27;s Bay Cay—Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy&#x27;s private island—in the Bahamas. He had completed a 151-page treatment outline and written a partially complete first screenplay draft. On January 18, 1961, he flew north to New York for dinner with his agent Charles Feldman and Spyros Skouras, who requested him to complete Walter Wanger&#x27;s concurrent troubled production &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), a film project Mankiewicz&#x27;s Figaro Inc. had earlier declined to finance. The film&#x27;s star Elizabeth Taylor had personally requested Mankiewicz to take over the project after Rouben Mamoulian had resigned as director. Mankiewicz declined the request, but Skouras was persistent in hiring him. Feldman persuaded Mankiewicz he could resume &quot;Justine&quot; after he finished &quot;Cleopatra&quot; under the advice: &quot;Hold your nose for fifteen weeks and get it over with.&quot; 

Skouras decided to acquire Figaro, Inc., in which Mankiewicz was paid $1.5 million, while NBC (which controlled a 50 percent stake) earned the other half for a total of $3 million. On January 25, 1961, Mankiewicz was hired as writer and director, and within a month, he toured the production sets constructed at Pinewood Studios in London. Being familiar with Roman antiquities having directed &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), Mankiewicz decided to rewrite the entire script, with a &quot;modern, psychiatrically rooted&quot; approach as described by Wanger in his production dairy. Lawrence Durrell and Sidney Buchman were hired to collaborate on the script for &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. By late April 1961, Mankiewicz was dissatisfied with Durrell&#x27;s story outlines, while Buchman was instructed to finish the outline. Wanger hired screenwriter Ranald MacDougall to finish the shooting script based on Buchman&#x27;s outline. 

Meanwhile, Twentieth Century-Fox dismantled the Pinewood sets, worth an estimated cost of $600,000. Skouras decided to reshoot the film in California, but Mankiewicz persuaded him to shoot in Rome. By June 30, Skouras reversed his decision and allow the production to film at Cinecittà, where principal filming for &quot;Cleopatra&quot; began on September 1961 under Mankiewicz&#x27;s direction. Because Skouras insisted for the production to resume, Mankiewicz&#x27;s revised shooting script was not complete at the start of filming. Therefore, Mankiewicz directed at daytime and wrote the script longhand at night, to the point he contracted a dermatological disorder on his hands forcing him to wear thin protective gloves. To maintain his health regimen for several months, Mankiewicz required daily vitamin B12 shots. One shot accidentally hit his sciatic nerve, rendering him barely able to walk.
On January 22, 1962, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton filmed their first scene together. Their romantic chemistry was not lost on Mankiewicz who later told Wanger: &quot;I have been sitting on a volcano all alone for too long, and I want to give you some facts you ought to know. Liz and Burton are not just &quot;playing&quot; Antony and Cleopatra.&quot; In February 1962, rumors of the extramarital affair were spreading, and by the spring, it became worldwide news. In June 1962, Skouras was forced out as studio president and replaced with Darryl Zanuck. In early October 1962, Mankiewicz screened his rough cut at Zanuck&#x27;s residence in Paris. Infuriated by Cleopatra&#x27;s dominance over Marc Antony, Zanuck remarked, &quot;If any woman behaved toward me the way Cleopatra treated Antony, I would cut her balls off.&quot; Mankiewicz and Zanuck had planned to discuss the cut the next day, but Zanuck cancelled the meeting. 

Less than two weeks later, Mankiewicz sent a letter to Zanuck requesting an &quot;honest and unequivocal statement of where I stand in relation to &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.&quot; Zanuck wrote back stating his services were terminated, and in a memo addressed the press, he believed Mankiewicz has &quot;earned a well-deserved rest.&quot; In response to his public firing, Mankiewicz told &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;The actors are almost more upset than I am. They gave three goddam good performances and, badly cut, they&#x27;ll be ruined.&quot; In December 1962, Zanuck rehired Mankiewicz to film reshoots in Almería, Spain and complete the final editing. Mankiewicz finished the reshoots on March 5, 1963.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; opened at the Rivoli Theatre to mixed reviews, with Bosley Crowther who exclaimed the film was &quot;one of the great epic films of our day&quot;. On the contrary, Judith Crist of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; headlined her review calling the film a &quot;monumental mouse.&quot; The film&#x27;s premiere runtime of 243 minutes was reduced to over 3 hours for its first-run engagements.

Regardless, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; became the highest-grossing film of 1963, generating $26 million in distributor rentals. However, the film held a negative cost of $44 million and did not break-even until Fox sold the television broadcast rights to ABC in 1966. At the 37th Academy Awards, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was nominated for nine Oscars and it won four. The film&#x27;s notorious production and mixed reception damaged Mankiewicz&#x27;s professional reputation and self-esteem.

===1964–1993: Later career===
In 1964, Mankiewicz read Frederick Knott&#x27;s play &quot;Mr. Fox of Venice&quot; and the novel &quot;The Evil of the Day&quot; by Thomas Sterling, both of which were adapted from Ben Jonson&#x27;s 1606 play &quot;Volpone&quot;. Interested in the subject material, Mankiewicz optioned the works for his next screenplay, tentatively titled &quot;Mr. Fox of Venice&quot;. Meanwhile, he was approached by Anna Rosenberg, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense, to participate in a Xerox-sponsored series of television films promoting the United Nations (UN). The first installment was &quot;Carol for Another Christmas&quot; (1964) with a teleplay by Rod Serling. A dystopian adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, the telefilm had an ensemble cast featuring Sterling Hayden, Peter Sellers, Godfrey Cambridge, Peter Fonda, Richard Harris, Christopher Plummer, Eva Marie Saint and James Shigeta. Filming began in early September 1964. It was broadcast on ABC on December 28, 1964. 

Retitled &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967), the story centers on Cecil Fox, an eccentric English millionaire, who hires William McFly, a struggling actor, in a scheme modeled after Volpone&#x27;s play. McFly invites three of Fox&#x27;s former mistresses to his Venetian palazzo as Fox pretends to be on his death bed. Filming began on September 20, 1965 at the Cinecittà and ran for five months. Similar to &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the production was troubled. After the first week of filming, Mankiewicz fired his cinematographer Gianni di Venanzo and replaced him with Pasqualino De Santis. Rachel Roberts, then married to Rex Harrison (who was cast as Fox), attempted suicide after she was turned down in favor of Maggie Smith. Susan Hayward was granted permission to attend her dying husband back in the United States. Mankiewicz began editing in London in March 1966, and settled on a runtime of 150 minutes when it premiered in London in the following year. It was later trimmed to 131 minutes when it premiered in New York. Critics complimented Rex Harrison and Maggie Smith&#x27;s performances but criticized the runtime. 

In 1968, Mankiewicz signed a multi-picture deal with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, with his first project titled &quot;The Bawdy Bard and Bill&quot;, a biopic about William Shakespeare by Anthony Burgess. However, he was intrigued by an original script tentatively titled &quot;War&quot; by David Newman and Robert Benton, the screenwriting team of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). The film was retitled &quot;There Was a Crooked Man...&quot; (1970), and it was the first Western genre film Mankiewicz had directed. He reflected: &quot;It&#x27;s been a chance to try some muscles I haven&#x27;t used before. Although I wrote a lot of Westerns in the old days ...I&#x27;m either the elder statesman or the oldest whore on the beat.&quot; The film starred Kirk Douglas as a charming but ruthless convict who is sent to a remote Arizona prison where the conscientious prison warden (Henry Fonda) attempts to reform him. Filming began in March 1969, but six weeks into production, Mankiewicz slipped a disk at his home and directed the rest of the film from a wheelchair. 

Meanwhile, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts underwent corporate restructuring, and the film&#x27;s release was delayed by over a year. It premiered in London months before its release in the United States on Christmas Day, with a minimal promotional campaign. Contemporary critical reaction was mixed, though the film has been viewed more favorably in retrospect. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film was &quot;a movie of the sort of taste, intelligence and somewhat bitter humor I associate with Mr. Mankiewicz who, in real life, is one of America&#x27;s most sophisticated, least folksy raconteurs, especially of stories about the old Hollywood.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; however lambasted the film as a &quot;commercialized black comedy nihilism seems to have been written by an evil 2-year-old, and it has been directed in the Grand Rapids style of filmmaking.&quot; 

During post-production on &quot;Crooked Man&quot;, in October 1969, Mankiewicz and Sidney Lumet shot 18 minutes of interstitial segments of celebrities reading select passages for the 1970 documentary &quot;&quot;. Produced by Ely Landau, the documentary featured Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Ben Gazzara, Charlton Heston, James Earl Jones, Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Anthony Quinn, Clarence Williams III, and Joanne Woodward. The film was screened in select theaters for only one night, March 24, 1970. 

Later that year, Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s 1970 play &quot;Sleuth&quot; had a successful Broadway run, and received the Tony Award for Best Play. Laurence Olivier portrays Andrew Wycke, a mystery writer, who invites Cockney hairdresser Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) to his country estate knowing that Milo is having an affair with his wife. From there, a clever mystery game ensues with potentially deadly results. At the time, Mankiewicz was developing a remake of &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931). Filming was scheduled from April to June 1971, but production ran over schedule. Mankiewicz, plagued with back pain, tore his thigh when he fell onto a camera equipment. Olivier, with his own health problems, had a real-life injury that was incorporated into the finished film. 

To qualify as an eligible Oscar contender, &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972) was rushed into completion and premiered in New York in December 1972. The film received largely positive reviews and was a moderate financial success earning over $5.7 million in box office rentals. Two weeks after its premiere, Edgar Scherick, the film&#x27;s executive producer, wanted an intermission and cuts made to the film leading into its nationwide release for January 1973. A Palomar Pictures studio executive notified Mankiewicz about the proposed changes even after an intermission had been inserted, which damaged the negative film. Furious over the alterations, &quot;Sleuth&quot; was restored to Mankiewicz&#x27;s preference. At the 45th Academy Awards, Mankiewicz received his fourth Best Directing nomination. Olivier and Caine received competitive Oscar nominations for Best Actor. 

In 1975, Robert Redford approached Mankiewicz about directing &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976). However, Mankiewicz did not like William Goldman&#x27;s early draft of the script and decided instead to direct an adaptation of the 1973 novel &quot;Jane&quot; by Dee Wells. The story centered on the eponymous heroine living in London who unexpectedly becomes pregnant and speculates the identity of the father. Mankiewicz signed with Columbia Pictures to write and direct the film, but he was removed during development after completing two-thirds of the script. Meanwhile, in 1978, Kenneth L. Geist published a biography of Mankiewicz titled &quot;Pictures Will Talk&quot;, having spent eight years researching his filmography. 
In 1983, Mankiewicz was a member of the jury at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. By 1992, still search of a new project, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Mankiewicz was &quot;writing in notebooks, transcribing facts, opinions and &quot;tribal customs and taboos&quot; for a probable autobiography.

==Personal life==
===Family history===
Joseph was the younger brother of Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, the co-writer (with Orson Welles) of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; among numerous other films. In 2024, Joseph and Herman were both announced as inductees into the Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame.

In 1934, Mankiewicz married actress Elizabeth Young, and they had a son, Eric Reynal. They divorced in 1937. He married actress Rose Stradner on July 28, 1939, and they had two sons: Christopher and Tom Mankiewicz, who became a famed screenwriter in his own right. In September 1958, Stradner was found dead at her summer home in Bedford Hills, aged 45. Her death was ruled a suicide through an overdose of sedatives. 

In 1954, Mankiewicz met his third wife Rosemary Matthews while filming &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; in Rome. For several years, they kept in contact, and Matthews served as a production assistant for &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. On December 14, 1962, the two were married in a New York courthouse. They had a daughter, Alexandra.

Joseph was the uncle of Frank Mankiewicz, a political campaign manager who officially announced the assassination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. His niece Johanna &quot;Josie&quot; Mankiewicz Davis, worked as a journalist and a novelist. In July 1974, she was struck and killed by a taxicab in New York City at the age of 36.

His great-nephews include writer-filmmaker Nick Davis (Johanna&#x27;s son), NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot; reporter Josh Mankiewicz and television personality Ben Mankiewicz (Frank&#x27;s sons).

===Death===
Mankiewicz died of a heart attack on February 5, 1993, six days before his 84th birthday. He was interred in Saint Matthew&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard cemetery in Bedford, New York.

<text>USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (SSN-688), lead ship of her class of submarines, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Los Angeles, California. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 8 January 1971 and her keel was laid down on 8 January 1972. She was launched on 6 April 1974 sponsored by Anne Armstrong, and commissioned on 13 November 1976. She hosted President Jimmy Carter and the First Lady on 27 May 1977 for an at-sea demonstration of her capabilities. In 2007 she was the oldest submarine in active service with the United States Navy. The Navy decommissioned &quot;Los Angeles&quot; on 23 January 2010, in the Port of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, her namesake city.

== Deployments ==

&quot;Los Angeles&quot; made her first operational deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in 1977 and was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation. In 1978, she transferred to the Pacific Fleet and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 7, homeported in Pearl Harbor. She conducted 17 Pacific deployments over the next 32 years and earned eight Meritorious Unit Citations and a Navy Unit Citation. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; participated in four multinational &quot;Rim of the Pacific&quot; (RIMPAC) exercises, and visited numerous foreign ports in Italy, Republic of the Philippines, Diego Garcia, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Canada and Singapore.

In 1999, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was modified to carry a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). Her capabilities included undersea warfare, surface warfare, strike warfare, mining operations, special forces delivery, reconnaissance, carrier battle group support and escort, and intelligence collection.

== Decommissioning ==
&quot;Los Angeles&quot; was inactivated on 1 February 2010 and decommissioned 4 February 2011. The wardroom of the oldest submarine in the fleet carries Richard O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s personal cribbage board, and upon her decommissioning the board was transferred to the next oldest boat at that time, . Ex-&quot;Los Angeles&quot; entered the Navy&#x27;s Ship-Submarine Recycling Program, 1 February 2010, and recycling was completed 30 November 2012.

<doc id="432513" wikidata="Q285950" url="?curid=432513" title="Popular sovereignty">
<text>Popular sovereignty is the principle that the leaders of a state and its government are created and sustained by the consent of its people, who are the source of all political legitimacy. Popular sovereignty, being a principle, does not imply any particular political implementation. Benjamin Franklin expressed the concept when he wrote that &quot;In free governments, the rulers are the servants and the people their superiors and sovereigns&quot;.

==Origins==

In &quot;Defensor pacis&quot;, Marsilius of Padua advocated a form of republicanism that views the people as the only legitimate source of political authority. Sovereignty lies with the people, and the people should elect, correct, and, if necessary, depose its political leaders.

Popular sovereignty in its modern sense is an idea that dates to the social contract school represented by Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), John Locke (1632–1704), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778). Rousseau authored a book titled &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, a prominent political work that highlighted the idea of the &quot;general will&quot;. The central tenet of popular sovereignty is that the legitimacy of a government&#x27;s authority and of its laws is based on the consent of the governed. Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau all held that individuals enter into a social contract, voluntarily giving up some of their natural freedom, so as to secure protection from the dangers inherent in the freedom of others. Whether men are seen as naturally more prone to violence and rapine (Hobbes) or to cooperation and kindness (Rousseau), the idea that a legitimate social order emerges only when liberties and duties are equal among citizens binds the social contract thinkers to the concept of popular sovereignty.

An earlier development of the theory of popular sovereignty is found among the School of Salamanca (see e.g. Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546) or Francisco Suarez (1548–1617)). Like the theorists of the divine right of kings and Locke, the Salamancans saw sovereignty as emanating originally from God. However, unlike the divine right theorists and in agreement with Locke, they saw it as passing from God to all people equally, not only to monarchs.

Republics and popular monarchies are theoretically based on popular sovereignty. However, a legalistic notion of popular sovereignty does not necessarily imply an effective, functioning democracy. A party or even an individual dictator may claim to represent the will of the people and rule in its name, which would be congruent with Hobbes&#x27;s view on the subject. Most modern definitions present democracy as a necessary condition of popular sovereignty.

Judge Ivor Jennings called the notion that governments are the creation of the consent of its people &quot;ridiculous&quot;, as &quot;the people cannot decide until somebody decides who are the people&quot;.

==United States==

The application of the doctrine of popular sovereignty receives particular emphasis in American history, notes historian Christian G. Fritz&#x27;s &quot;American Sovereigns: The People and America&#x27;s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War&quot;, a study of the early history of American constitutionalism. In describing how Americans attempted to apply this doctrine prior to the territorial struggle over slavery that led to the Civil War, political scientist Donald S. Lutz noted the variety of American applications:

The American Revolution marked a departure in the concept of popular sovereignty as it had been discussed and employed in the European historical context. American revolutionaries aimed to substitute the sovereignty in the person of King George III, with a collective sovereign—composed of the people. Thenceforth, American revolutionaries generally agreed with and were committed to the principle that governments were legitimate only if they rested on popular sovereignty – that is, the sovereignty of the people. This was often linked with the notion of the consent of the governed—the idea of the people as a sovereign—and had clear 17th- and 18th-century intellectual roots in English history.

===1850s===

In the 1850s, in the run-up to the Civil War, Northern Democrats led by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois promoted popular sovereignty as a middle position on the slavery issue. It said that actual residents of territories should be able to decide by voting whether or not slavery would be allowed in the territory. The federal government did not have to make the decision, and by appealing to democracy, Cass and Douglas hoped they could finesse the question of support for or opposition to slavery. Douglas applied popular sovereignty to Kansas in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which passed Congress in 1854.

The Act had two unexpected results. By dropping the Missouri Compromise of 1820 under which said slavery would never be allowed in Kansas, it was a major boost for the expansion of slavery. Overnight, outrage united anti-slavery forces across the North into an &quot;anti-Nebraska&quot; movement that soon was institutionalized as the Republican Party, with its firm commitment to stop the expansion of slavery.

Also, pro- and anti-slavery elements moved into Kansas with the intention of allowing or banning slavery, which led to a raging state-level civil war, known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;. Abraham Lincoln targeted popular sovereignty in the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, which left Douglas in a position that alienated Southern pro-slavery Democrats, who considered him weak in his support of slavery. The Southern Democrats broke with the party and ran their own candidate against Lincoln and Douglas in 1860.

<doc id="432514" wikidata="Q956533" url="?curid=432514" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">
<text>Herman Jacob Mankiewicz ( ; November 7, 1897 – March 5, 1953) was an American screenwriter who, with Orson Welles, wrote the screenplay for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941). Both Mankiewicz and Welles went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film. Mankiewicz was previously a Berlin correspondent for &quot;Women’s Wear Daily&quot;, assistant theater editor at &quot;The New York Times,&quot; and the first regular drama critic at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Alexander Woollcott said that Mankiewicz was the &quot;funniest man in New York&quot;.

Mankiewicz was often asked to fix other writers&#x27; screenplays, with much of his work uncredited. His writing style became valued in the films of the 1930s—a style that included a slick, satirical, and witty humor, in which dialogue almost totally carried the film, and which eventually become associated with the &quot;typical American film&quot; of that period. In addition to &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; he wrote or worked on films including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Man of the World&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; and &quot;The Pride of St. Louis&quot;.

Film critic Pauline Kael credits Mankiewicz with having written, alone or with others, &quot;about forty of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties...He was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best.&quot; Nearly seventy years after his death, Mankiewicz was portrayed by actor Gary Oldman in the 2020 Oscar-winning film &quot;Mank&quot;.

==Early life==
Mankiewicz was born in New York City in 1897. His parents were German-Jewish immigrants: his father, Franz Mankiewicz, was born in Berlin and emigrated to the U.S. from Hamburg in 1892. In New York he met his wife, Johanna Blumenau, a seamstress from the German-speaking Kurland region of Latvia. The family lived first in New York, then moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where Herman&#x27;s father accepted a teaching position. In 1909, Herman&#x27;s brother, Joseph L. Mankiewicz—who later became a successful writer, producer, and director—was born, and both boys and a sister, Erna, spent their childhood there. Census records indicate the family lived on Academy Street.

Mankiewicz was described as a &quot;bookish, introspective child who, despite his intelligence, was never able to win approval from his demanding father&quot; who was known to belittle his achievements. The family moved to New York City in 1913, where Herman&#x27;s father accepted a teaching position, at Stuyvesant High School,&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine.columbia/mankiewicz-family&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Herman graduated from Columbia College in 1917 where he was the “Off-Hour” editor of the &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot; student newspaper.

==Early career==
After a period as managing editor of the &quot;American Jewish Chronicle&quot; and a reporter at the New York Tribune, he joined the United States Army Air Service to fly planes, but because of airsickness, enlisted instead as a private first class with the Marines, A.E.F. In 1919 and 1920, he was director of the American Red Cross News Service in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers/372836671&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Marriage==
After returning to the U.S., he married Sara Aaronson of Baltimore. He took her overseas on his next job as a newspaper writer in Berlin from 1920 to 1922; then returned to the U.S. to do political reporting for George Seldes on the &quot;Chicago Tribune.&quot; Herman and Sara had three children: screenwriter Don Mankiewicz (1922–2015), political adviser Frank Mankiewicz (1924–2014), and novelist Johanna Mankiewicz Davis&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/killed-johanna-davis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time/6797114&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (1937–1974).

==Reporter, publicist, playwright==
While a reporter in Berlin, Mankiewicz also sent pieces on drama and books to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At one point he was hired in Berlin by dancer Isadora Duncan to be her publicist in preparation for her return tour in the United States. At home again in the U.S., he took a job as a reporter for the &quot;New York World&quot;. Known as a &quot;gifted, prodigious writer,&quot; he contributed to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and numerous other magazines. While still in his twenties, he collaborated with Heywood Broun, Dorothy Parker, Robert E. Sherwood and others on a revue; and collaborated with George S. Kaufman on a play, &quot;The Good Fellows,&quot; and with Marc Connelly on the film &quot;The Wild Man of Borneo&quot; (1941). From 1923 to 1926, he was at &quot;The New York Times&quot; as assistant theater editor to George S. Kaufman, and soon after became the first regular theater critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, writing a column during 1925 and early 1926. He was a member of the Algonquin Round Table. His writing attracted the notice of film producer Walter Wanger, who offered him a contract to work at Paramount, and Mankiewicz soon moved to Hollywood.

==Hollywood==
===Early success===
Paramount paid Mankiewicz $400 a week plus bonuses, and by the end of 1927, he was head of Paramount&#x27;s scenario department. Film critic Pauline Kael wrote about him and the creation of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, her 1971 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article: &quot;In January, 1928, there was a newspaper item reporting that he (Mankiewicz) was in New York &#x27;lining up a new set of newspaper feature writers and playwrights to bring to Hollywood... Most of the newer writers on Paramount&#x27;s staff who contributed the most successful stories of the past year&#x27; were selected by &#x27;Mank.&#x27;&quot; Film historian Scott Eyman notes that Mankiewicz was put in charge of writer recruitment by Paramount. As &quot;a hard-drinking gambler,&quot; however, he hired men in his own image, such as Ben Hecht, Bartlett Cormack, Edwin Justus Mayer—writers comfortable with the iconoclasm of big-city newsrooms who would introduce their sardonic worldliness to movie audiences.

Kael notes that &quot;beginning in 1926, Mankiewicz worked on an astounding number of films.&quot; In 1927 and 1928, he did the titles (printed dialogue and explanations) for at least twenty-five films starring Clara Bow, Bebe Daniels, Nancy Carroll, Wallace Beery and other public favorites. By then, sound had arrived, and in 1929 he wrote the script and dialogue for &quot;The Dummy,&quot; and scripts for many other directors, including William Wellman and Josef von Sternberg.

Other screenwriters made large contributions to Hollywood&#x27;s early sound films, but &quot;probably none larger than Mankiewicz,&quot; according to Kael. At the beginning of the Talkies era, he was one of the highest-paid writers in the world, because, Kael writes, &quot;He wrote the kind of movies that were disapproved of as &#x27;fast&#x27; and immoral. His heroes weren&#x27;t soft-eyed and bucolic; he brought good-humored toughness to the movies, and energy and astringency. And the public responded, because it was eager for modern American subjects.&quot; Ben Hecht described him as &quot;a Promethean wit bound in a Promethean body, one of the most entertaining men in existence ... [and] called the &#x27;Central Park West Voltaire&#x27; &quot;.

According to Kael, Mankiewicz did not work on every kind of picture. He did not do Westerns, for example; and once, when a studio attempted to punish him for his customary misbehavior by assigning him to a Rin Tin Tin picture, he rebelled by turning in a script that began with the craven dog frightened by a mouse and reached its climax with a house on fire and the dog taking a baby into the flames.

===Style===
Shortly after his arrival on the West Coast, Mankiewicz sent a telegram to journalist-friend Ben Hecht in New York: &quot;Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don&#x27;t let this get around.&quot; He attracted other New York writers to Hollywood who contributed to a burst of creative, tough, sardonic styles of writing for the fast-growing movie industry.

Between 1929 and 1935, he worked on at least twenty films, many of which he received no credit for. Between 1930 and 1932 he was either producer or associate producer on four comedies and helped write their screenplays without credit: &quot;Laughter&quot;, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, and &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;, which many critics considered one of the funniest comedies of the early 1930s. In 1933, he moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer where, along with Frances Marion, he adapted &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, which was based on the George S. Kaufman/Edna Ferber play, and became one of the most popular comedies at that time and remains a &quot;classic&quot; comedy.

In 1933, he went on leave from MGM to write a film warning Americans about the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. No studio was willing to produce his screenplay, &quot;The Mad Dog of Europe&quot;, and in 1935, MGM was notified by Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Education and Propaganda under Hitler, that films written by Mankiewicz could not be shown in Nazi Germany unless his name was removed from the screen credits. During World War II, Mankiewicz officially sponsored and took financial responsibility for many refugees fleeing Nazi Germany for the United States.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
In February 1938, Mankiewicz was assigned as the first of ten screenwriters to work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Three days after he started writing, he handed in a 17-page treatment of what was later known as &quot;the Kansas sequence&quot;. While L. Frank Baum devoted less than a thousand words in his book to Kansas, Mankiewicz almost balanced the attention between Kansas and Oz, feeling it necessary that audiences relate to Dorothy Gale in a real world before she was transported to a magic one. By the end of the week he had finished 56 pages, and included instructions to film the scenes in Kansas in black and white. His goal, according to film historian Aljean Harmetz, was to &quot;capture in pictures what Baum had captured in words—the grey lifelessness of Kansas contrasted with the visual richness of Oz.&quot; He was not credited for his work on the film.

===&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;===

Mankiewicz is best known for his collaboration with Orson Welles on the screenplay of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, for which they shared an Academy Award. The authorship later became a source of controversy. Pauline Kael attributed &quot;Kane&quot;″s screenplay to Mankiewicz in a 1971 essay that was and continues to be strongly disputed. Much debate has centered on this issue, largely because of the importance of the film itself, which most agree is a fictionalized biography of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. According to film biographer David Thomson, however, &quot;No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay...&quot;

Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes, including the way the movie was promoted. When RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1, 1941, followed by showings at theaters in other large cities, the publicity programs included photographs of Welles as &quot;the one-man band, directing, acting, and writing.&quot; In a letter to his father afterwards, Mankiewicz wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn&#x27;t one single line in the picture that wasn&#x27;t in writingwriting from and by mebefore ever a camera turned.&quot; Mankiewicz biographer Sydney Ladensohn Stern discounts his assertion as his defensiveness with his father, especially because he and other family members had recently bailed him out financially.

According to film historian Otto Friedrich, it made Mankiewicz &quot;unhappy to hear Welles quoted in Louella Parsons&#x27;s column, before the question of screen credits was officially settled, as saying, &#x27;So I wrote &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.&#x27; Mankiewicz went to the Screen Writers Guild and declared that he was the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along, but Mankiewicz sometimes claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit. Welles eventually agreed to share credit with Mankiewicz and furthermore, to list his name first. Sometime later, Welles commented on this allegation:
God, if I hadn&#x27;t loved him I would have hated him after all those ridiculous stories, persuading people I was offering him money to have his name taken off ... that he would be carrying on like this, denouncing me as a coauthor, screaming around.

====Hearst&#x27;s inner circle====
Mankiewicz became good friends with Hollywood screenwriter Charles Lederer, who was Marion Davies&#x27;s nephew. Lederer grew up as a Hollywood habitué, spending much time at San Simeon, where Davies reigned as William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s mistress. As one of Mankiewicz&#x27;s admirers in the early 1930s, Hearst often invited him to spend the weekend at San Simeon.

&quot;Herman told Joe to come to the office of their mutual friend Charlie Lederer.&quot; &quot;Mankiewicz found himself on story-swapping terms with the power behind it all, Hearst himself. When he had been in Hollywood only a short time, he met Marion Davies and Hearst through his friendship with Charles Lederer, a writer, then in his early twenties, whom Ben Hecht had met and greatly admired in New York when Lederer was still in his teens. Lederer, a child prodigy who had entered college at thirteen, got to know Mankiewicz.&quot; Herman eventually &quot;saw Hearst as &#x27;a finagling, calculating, Machiavellian figure.&#x27; But also, with Charlie Lederer, ... wrote and had printed parodies of Hearst newspapers.&quot;

In 1939, Mankiewicz suffered a broken leg in a driving accident and had to be hospitalized. During his hospital stay, one of his visitors was Orson Welles, who met him earlier and had become a great admirer of his wit. During the months after his release from the hospital, he and Welles began working on story ideas which led to the creation of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

Despite Welles&#x27; denial that the film was about Hearst, few people were convinced—including Hearst. After the release of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Hearst pursued a longtime vendetta against Mankiewicz and Welles for writing the story.
&quot;Certain elements in the film were taken from Mankiewicz&#x27;s own experience: the sled Rosebud was based—according to some sources—on a very important bicycle that was stolen from him. ... [and] some of Kane&#x27;s speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst&#x27;s.&quot; Most personally, the word &quot;rosebud&quot; was reportedly Hearst&#x27;s private nickname for Davies&#x27; clitoris. Hearst&#x27;s thoughts about the film are unknown; what is certain is that his extensive chain of newspapers and radio stations blocked all mentions of the film, and refused to accept advertising for it, while some Hearst employees worked behind the scenes to block or restrict its distribution.

====Academy Award celebration====
&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award in every possible category, including Best Original Screenplay. Meryman writes, &quot;Herman insisted he had no chance to win, though &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; had given the film first place in ten of its twelve divisions. The fear of Hearst, he felt, was still alive. And Hollywood&#x27;s resentment and distrust of Welles, the nonconformist upstart, were even greater since he had lived up to his wonderboy ballyhoo.&quot; Neither Welles nor Mankiewicz attended the dinner, which was broadcast on radio. Welles was in South America filming &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;, and Herman refused to attend. &quot;He did not want to be humiliated,&quot; said his wife, Sara.

Richard Meryman describes the evening:

On the night of the awards, Herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair. Sara lay on the bed. As the screenplay category approached, he pretended to be hardly listening. Suddenly from the radio, half screamed, came &quot;Herman J. Mankiewicz.&quot; Welles&#x27;s name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out, &quot;Mank! Mank! Where is he?&quot; And audible above all others was Irene Selznick: &quot;Where is he?&quot;

George J. Schaefer accepted Herman&#x27;s Oscar. &quot;Except for this coauthor award, the Motion Picture Academy excommunicated Orson Welles,&quot; wrote Meryman, &quot;[and] as Pauline Kael put it, &#x27;The members of the Academy ... probably felt good because their hearts had gone out to crazy, reckless Mank, their own resident loser-genius.&quot;

====The film as a whole====
Richard Meryman concludes that &quot;taken as a whole ... &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was overwhelmingly Welles&#x27;s film, a triumph of intense personal magic. Herman was one of the talents, the crucial one, that were mined by Welles. But one marvels at the debt those two self-destroyers owe to each other. Without Welles there would have been no supreme moment for Herman. Without Mankiewicz there would have been no perfect idea at the perfect time for Welles ... to confirm his genius ... The &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; script was true creative symbiosis, a partnership greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;

==Alcoholism and death==
Mankiewicz was an alcoholic. Ten years before his death, he wrote: &quot;I seem to become more and more of a rat in a trap of my own construction, a trap that I regularly repair whenever there seems to be danger of some opening that will enable me to escape. I haven&#x27;t decided yet about making it bomb proof. It would seem to involve a lot of unnecessary labor and expense.&quot; A future Hollywood biographer went so far as to suggest that Mankiewicz’s behavior &quot;made him seem erratic even by the standards of Hollywood drunks.&quot;

Mankiewicz died March 5, 1953, at age of 55, of uremic poisoning, the result of liver failure,&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz/2013-11-07-this-day&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. Orson Welles said of him, &quot;He saw everything with clarity. No matter how odd or how right or how marvelous his point of view was, it was always diamond white. Nothing muzzy.&quot;

==Legacy==
In looking back on his early films, Pauline Kael wrote that Mankiewicz had, in fact, written (alone or with others) &quot;about forty of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties. I hadn&#x27;t realized how extensive his career was. ... and now that I have looked into Herman Mankiewicz&#x27;s career it&#x27;s apparent that he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best. These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... [and] the most highly acclaimed directors of that period, suggests that the writers ... in little more than a decade, gave American talkies their character.&quot;

Director and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson claimed that the &quot;two most brilliant men he has ever known were George S. Kaufman and Herman Mankiewicz, and that Mankiewicz was the more brilliant of the two. ... [and] spearheaded the movement of that whole Broadway style of wisecracking, fast-talking, cynical-sentimental entertainment onto the national scene.&quot;

In 2024, Mankiewicz was announced as a posthumous inductee into the &quot;Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame&quot;.

==Depictions==
Mankiewicz is played by John Malkovich in &quot;RKO 281&quot;, a 1999 American film about the battle over &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

&quot;Mank&quot;, a black-and-white Mankiewicz biopic directed by David Fincher and starring Gary Oldman in the title role, was released on Netflix in December 2020. Oldman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

<text>USS &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; (SSN-689) was a nuclear-powered attack submarine which served with the United States Navy. With her keel laid down on 18 November 1972, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was launched on 26 April 1975. She became the second &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine to be commissioned, on 25 June 1977. In 1995, she was the first of her class to be decommissioned, after a collision with a Russian .

&quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was the first and currently only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

==Design==

&quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was a nuclear attack submarine and, as such, was optimized for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and strike operations. To this end, she carried a complement of 26 weapons, including the Mark 48 ADCAP torpedoes – the main weapon of U.S. Navy submarines, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and subsonic Tomahawk cruise missiles. The latter has a range of either 280 or 1,600 miles (450 or 2,500 km), depending on whether it is anti-ship or strike variant, and is nuclear-compatible, although this capability is normally not deployed on &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines. Since the boat did not incorporate the vertical launching system found on later &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines, the Harpoons and Tomahawks were torpedo tube-launched. &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; can also lay Mobile Mark 67 and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines.

The boat&#x27;s propulsion system comprised a S6G pressurized-water reactor based on the D2G reactor of the and es of cruiser. Heat produced from the S6G reactor converted water into steam, powering two turbines, and thus the propeller shaft (see &quot;Nuclear marine propulsion&quot;). Although the U.S. Navy discloses the boat&#x27;s submerged speed to be &quot;25+ knots (28+ miles per hour; 46.3+ km/h),&quot; non-military sources have claimed that &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines&#x27; top speed to be in excess of . The nuclear reactor fuel load had a lifespan of ten years.

A crucial component in &quot;Baton Rouge&quot;″s ability to perform her mission were the comprehensive defensive, navigational and sonar systems. Among her several sonar sets were the TB-23/29 thin line passive towed array sonar, the Ametek BQS 15 close range high frequency active sonar and the Raytheon SADS-TG active detection sonar. These systems collaborated to give &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; good situational awareness. The boat&#x27;s electronic support measures included a direction finding system, interceptor and a radar warner.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia, on 8 January 1971, and her keel was laid down on 18 November 1972. Launched on 26 April 1975 in the presence of sponsor Mrs. Felix Edward Hebert, wife of the United States representative from the first district and the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was commissioned on 25 June 1977.

Based at Norfolk and assigned to Submarine Squadron 8, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot;″s immediate history following the commissioning was characterized by shakedown training in New London, Connecticut, among other tests. During 5–29 July, she performed drills off the New England coast, returning to Norfolk for a month-long post-shakedown upkeep. From September 1977 to August 1978, she participated in numerous other tests, such as acoustic trials in Exuma Sound, The Bahamas, and weapons tests off Port Everglades, Florida. During this time, she returned periodically to Norfolk, and docked alongside , for upkeep, the longest of which spanned from February to August.

==Operational history==
In preparations for her first overseas assignment, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was deployed to New London in September for training before returning to Norfolk for last-minute checks prior to the deployment. She left port on 19 October 1978, and raised her first port of call in La Maddalena, Sardinia, on 1 November. &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; also visited La Spezia and took part in a variety of ASW exercises through the winter of 1978 and 1979.

The submarine returned to Norfolk from her first overseas assignment in March 1979. After post-deployment stand-down, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; resumed normal operations later that year. These included participation in two major ASW exercises and visits to such widely separated places as Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. In July, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 but continued to use Norfolk as her base of operations. During September–October, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; participated in a major NATO exercise – Operation Ocean Safari – which took her across the Atlantic once more and included a call at Rotterdam, the Netherlands. She returned to Norfolk from that mission during the latter part of October and spent the remainder of 1979 in a restricted availability.

In 1980, she was deployed to the Indian Ocean and circumnavigated the earth, passing through the International Date Line and the Panama Canal. For the deployment, she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation when she arrived in Norfolk. As was the case in the Indian Pacific in 1980, in 1981 &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; again came under the command of Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), after which she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. For the third time, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; came under the command of CINCPACFLT when she made her second deployment to the Mediterranean Sea.

In the mid-1980s, the boat underwent an eighteen-month overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The overhaul, which ended in spring 1986, saw the addition to &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; the AN/BQQ-5C sonar system, the CCS Mk-1 digital fire-control system, and the ESGN navigation system. She made her third deployment to the Mediterranean in November 1986, and her fourth in January 1990. Between these two assignment, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; conducted a deployment to the North Atlantic, and was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation.
===Collision with the &quot;Kostroma&quot;===

At 20:16 local time on 11 February 1992, while on patrol off Kildin Island near Severomorsk, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; collided with the Russian attack submarine K-276 &quot;Kostroma&quot;. The United States Navy stated that the collision occurred more than 12 miles (22 km) from the shore, in international waters. Initially the U.S. Navy denied any damage suffered by &quot;Baton Rouge&quot;, but it was later disclosed that the boat suffered two cuts, as well as dents and scrapes. &quot;Kostroma&quot; was fully repaired by 29 June 1992 and continues in service to this day, while &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was removed from service soon afterward. The Navy was looking to make cuts in all classes of vessels at the time. &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was just unlucky enough to be decommissioned for this reason. This is recorded in Russian navy lore as a victory and the &quot;Kostroma&quot; crew painted the number &quot;1&quot; bordered by a star on the sail, as did Soviet submarines during World War II to indicate the number of their victories.

==Decommissioning==
Less than two years later, on 1 November 1993, &quot;Baton Rouge&quot; was placed in commission in reserve. On 13 January 1995, she became the first &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine to be decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, after less than 18 years in commission. As part of post-Cold War restructuring, the U.S. Navy decided to decommission 14 of the first 31 ships in the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class instead of refueling them, most at between 17 and 19 years of service. Some of &quot;Baton Rouge&quot;″s sister ships served for 35 years or more after refueling. Ex-&quot;Baton Rouge&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program, and dismantling of the boat was complete by 30 September 1997.

<text>Jian Ghomeshi (born June 9, 1967) is a Canadian broadcaster, writer, musician, producer and former CBC personality. From 1990 to 2000, he was a vocalist and drummer in the Thornhill-based folk-pop band Moxy Früvous. In the 2000s, he became a television and radio broadcaster. He hosted, among others, the CBC Newsworld program &quot;Play&quot; (2002–2005), the CBC Radio One program &quot;The National Playlist&quot; (2005–2006), and the CBC Radio One program &quot;Q&quot;, which he co-created and hosted from 2007 to 2014.

Ghomeshi was fired by the CBC in 2014, as allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment came out, for which he was eventually arrested. In late 2015, Ghomeshi pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his trial began in early 2016. That March he was acquitted of five of the charges, and in May, the Crown withdrew the last remaining charge after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond and apologized to his accuser.

In April 2017, Ghomeshi launched a new online venture, &quot;The Ideation Project&quot;. In 2018, Ghomeshi&#x27;s essay &quot;Reflections from a Hashtag&quot; was published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, which led to widespread criticism of the magazine.

==Early life==
Jian Ghomeshi was born in London, England, to Iranian parents Farhang (Frank), a civil engineer, and Azar (Sara) Ghomeshi. His family came to Canada in 1974 when Jian was aged seven and his sister, Jila Ghomeshi, was aged ten, first living in Toronto before eventually settling in its suburb of Thornhill, Ontario. Ghomeshi described Thornhill as a &quot;safe and quiet suburb where conformity was coveted... The dwellings all looked relatively similar on our street, and most of the houses had big lawns and nice trees&quot;. He visited pre-revolutionary Tehran twice as a child, once at age two, the other aged five.

A Muslim, Ghomeshi was born into a secular household that was initially optimistic about the 1979 Iranian Revolution but also celebrated on Christmas and Easter, and has described being raised in a largely Jewish community. With few Iranian expatriates in Canada during his youth, Ghomeshi &quot;was extremely self-conscious of his appearance and his East London accent&quot; and &quot;felt different.&quot; He was bullied for his ethnicity by classmates, who called him &quot;Blackie&quot;, &quot;Arab&quot;, &quot;Paki&quot;, and &quot;terrorist&quot;.

Ghomeshi attended Thornlea Secondary School, where he was student council president. He has written that, during his teenage years, he ensured that his clothes smelled of cigarette smoke to give him &quot;social credibility&quot; even though he was a non-smoker, dressed &quot;new wave&quot; and listened to music from David Bowie, Talking Heads, and Rush. Ghomeshi had an interest in music as a student and in Grade 9 started a short-lived band with a few of his school friends called Urban Transit. His older sister, Jila, became a professor of linguistics, and their parents had initial reservations about his less-traditional career path—the distinction between &quot;busking&quot; and &quot;begging&quot; being lost on his father—but Ghomeshi has said they ultimately supported his choices.

In 1985, Ghomeshi was a committed feminist and budding progressive activist when he matriculated at York University in the theatre program (in his memoir &quot;1982&quot;, he describes himself as a &quot;theatre geek&quot;). In 1990, he earned a record number of votes in his election to head of student government, which he renamed the York Federation of Students. As president, Ghomeshi instituted bilingualism and advocated for abortion rights, free tuition, and ending “institutional racism.” He also cut off funding to student groups he alleged were engaged in “sexism, racism, homophobia and other exclusionary measures.&quot; While criticizing fraternities and sororities for &quot;sexism&quot;, he supported the school&#x27;s female-only Women&#x27;s Centre and was one of the few men allowed inside it. When then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney visited campus, Ghomeshi hurled macaroni at him. Progressives have since traced the roots of the “activist student coup” that subsequently took hold of York back to Ghomeshi&#x27;s radical leadership.

In 1995, after taking time off to play music, Ghomeshi graduated from York with a BA in political science and a double minor in history and women&#x27;s studies.

==Career==
===Music===

In 1983, Ghomeshi and friends Murray Foster, Tracy Jones, Reno Manfredi, and John Ruttle formed a band called Tall New Buildings. The band released two 12&quot; EPs and played various gigs in and outside of Toronto before breaking up around 1988. Ghomeshi, Foster and another bandmate, Mike Ford, then formed a band called The Chia Pets.

In 1989, the trio were joined by Dave Matheson to form the politically satirical folk-pop band Moxy Früvous and together recorded eight albums before going on indefinite hiatus in 2001. Moxy Früvous was originally inspired by street-performing or busking bands, and Ghomeshi and bandmates started out by playing on streets in Toronto. Ghomeshi sang and played drums. He was credited as &quot;Jean&quot; rather than Jian on the band&#x27;s first album, but reverted to the original spelling of his name for subsequent albums. A year after forming, Moxy Früvous was opening for headline performers like Bob Dylan. The band sold over 50,000 copies of their debut independent EP in 1992 (gold in Canada). Their debut album &quot;Bargainville&quot; went platinum in Canada in 1994 after selling over 100,000 copies. The band was also nominated for a Juno Award as Band of the Year in 1994. Over the course of eight albums, they sold over 500,000 copies of their albums in Canada and the United States and made an appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Ghomeshi released his first solo EP, &quot;The First 6 Songs&quot;, in July 2001.

A 1996 video tape, revealed in 2014, suggested that Ghomeshi disdained his audiences, stating on camera that people paying to see the band&#x27;s shows were &quot;losers&quot; and &quot;fucking idiots&quot;. David Yuhnke, who was present at the recording, suspected that Ghomeshi was joking, recalling that the room&#x27;s atmosphere was &quot;sarcasm-laded&quot;, but added that he found it &quot;hard to gauge entirely if he [Ghomeshi] was being serious or not&quot;.

In 1999, Ghomeshi began a correspondence with a 16-year-old girl, Sally Block, who was a fan of Moxy Früvous. This continued for three years and included in-person meetings where Ghomeshi is alleged to have been &quot;handsy&quot; with her. In 2002, they had a falling out and Block broke into Ghomeshi&#x27;s email account. Ghomeshi sought to have her banned from &quot;FruCon&quot; – a Moxy Früvous convention – and wanted criminal charges to be pressed against her. She was allowed to attend FruCon, and Ghomeshi dropped the issue after her father confronted him for &quot;carrying on this type of relationship with an underage girl&quot;.

Ghomeshi&#x27;s production company, Jian Ghomeshi Productions Inc., managed musician Martina Sorbara (now of the band Dragonette) and produced music for Dar Williams. He managed electropop artist Lights from 2007 until 2014, during which time she won the Juno Award for Best New Artist and was nominated for several more. Lights initially supported Ghomeshi after he was accused of sexual abuse in 2014, but later dropped him as her manager, saying: &quot;I rushed to defend my manager of 12 years. I am now aware that my comments appear insensitive to those impacted and for that I am deeply sorry&quot;.

===Radio and television===

In 2002, Ghomeshi became host of CBC Newsworld&#x27;s &quot;Play&quot;, a show about the arts in Canada and abroad. &quot;Play&quot; ran for three seasons and won a Gemini Award. He also wrote columns for &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Ghomeshi hosted the radio series &quot;50 Tracks&quot; and &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot; on CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 (now CBC Music). From late 2005 until early 2006, he hosted a program on Radio One called &quot;The National Playlist&quot;.

From April 16, 2007, to October 26, 2014, Ghomeshi was the host of &quot;Q&quot;, a program airing twice daily on CBC Radio One, and on over 170 stations in the U.S. through Public Radio International. As the host of &quot;Q&quot;, he interviewed a range of musicians, artists, actors, and other notable figures, a list that included Woody Allen, Paul McCartney, Salman Rushdie, Barbara Walters, William Shatner, Jay-Z, Jimmy Wales, and Leonard Cohen. In 2012, Ghomeshi received the Gold Award for best talk show host at the New York Festivals&#x27; International Radio Awards. By 2013, with &quot;Q&quot; had a weekly audience of more than 2.5 million listeners weekly in Canada and 550,000 listeners in the U.S. During his time as host of &quot;Q&quot;, Ghomeshi many times booked guests who shared his agent and lawyer without disclosing this connection.

Ghomeshi hosted the 2009 Dora Mavor Moore Awards ceremony. He was set to host the November 2014 Scotiabank Giller Prize awards gala but was replaced in October by comedian Rick Mercer. That same month, he was replaced as the host of the CBC competition &quot;Canada Reads&quot; by Wab Kinew, the previous year&#x27;s winner.

In December 2014 the CBC announced that it would not be rebroadcasting Ghomeshi&#x27;s interviews and it would be removing them from the CBC&#x27;s online archive. Reactions to this decision were swift and varied and, after further deliberations by CBC management, the decision was reversed.

====Billy Bob Thornton interview====
On April 8, 2009, actor and musician Billy Bob Thornton appeared with his band, The Boxmasters, on &quot;Q&quot;. In introducing Thornton, Ghomeshi mentioned Thornton&#x27;s acting career and added, &quot;he&#x27;s always intended to make music, he just got sidetracked.&quot; In responding to Ghomeshi&#x27;s subsequent interview questions, Thornton acted confused and gave vague, evasive answers. When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, Thornton answered with a rambling commentary about his favourite childhood magazine, &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;. Later in the interview, Thornton said that the reason for his uncooperative answers was that Ghomeshi had been &quot;instructed not to discuss&quot; his film career but had done so.

Thornton said that Canadians did not get up and move or throw things at concerts, and referred to them as &quot;mashed potatoes without the gravy&quot;. Ghomeshi replied, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ve got some gravy up here as well.&quot; Ghomeshi described the interview as one of the most difficult he has conducted. He compared the international media exposure that followed the interview to being &quot;in the middle of a tsunami&quot;. After the show, Canadians responded to Ghomeshi&#x27;s &quot;professionalism and the manner in which he handled the situation ... [and] the show received more than 100,000 e-mails with almost unanimous praise for the host&quot;.

====Dismissal from the CBC====
In the spring of 2014, Ghomeshi advised his employers at the CBC that the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; was looking into allegations by an ex-girlfriend that he had engaged in non-consensual rough sex and that he denied this accusation. The crisis management firm Navigator Ltd. was hired to work for both Ghomeshi and the CBC.

In early summer of 2014, reporter Jesse Brown contacted the CBC and warned that Ghomeshi&#x27;s behaviour may have crossed into his work environment. The corporation investigated and concluded that there were no workplace complaints against Ghomeshi. According to an investigation by CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, &quot;almost all known staffers on ... &quot;Q&quot; said they were not contacted by CBC management as part of any investigation&quot;. Ghomeshi denied the accusations again and the &quot;Star&quot; declined to go forward with the story at that time.

In October 2014, Brown tweeted that he was working on a story that would be &quot;worse than embarrassing for certain parties&quot;. He later said that he was referring to an unrelated story, but Ghomeshi requested a meeting with CBC management on October 23. During that meeting, the CBC viewed what it later described as &quot;graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman&quot;. According to &quot;Vice&quot;, Ghomeshi showed his bosses lewd text messages on a CBC-owned phone and graphic personal sex videos.

On October 24, Ghomeshi announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the CBC to deal with personal matters. Two days later, the CBC terminated his employment, with a spokesperson saying &quot;information came to our attention recently that in CBC&#x27;s judgment precludes us from continuing our relationship with Jian&quot;. Ghomeshi subsequently released a &quot;lengthy Facebook post&quot; saying his dismissal was motivated by fear of an alleged smear campaign by an ex-girlfriend that according to Ghomeshi could release private details about his sex life. Ghomeshi also said he refused an offer by the CBC to &quot;walk away quietly&quot;. Chris Boyce, the head of CBC Radio, denied that such an offer was made.

Ghomeshi filed a $55 million lawsuit against the CBC, alleging that the corporation misused &quot;personal and confidential information provided to it in confidence&quot;. He also filed &quot;a union grievance alleging wrongful dismissal and defamation&quot;, and stated through his lawyer that he &quot;does not engage in non-consensual role play or sex and any suggestion of the contrary is defamatory&quot;. Ghomeshi withdrew his lawsuit on November 25, 2014. The terms of settlement stipulated that Ghomeshi pay the CBC $18,000 in legal costs.

===Literature===

Ghomeshi&#x27;s literary debut, &quot;1982&quot;, is a creative non-fiction title, about that year of his youth. It was released on September 18, 2012. It is a memoir of Ghomeshi&#x27;s life at the age of 14 (during 1982) growing up as a Persian-Canadian in Thornhill, his attempt to fit in as one of the few non-white kids in his neighbourhood, and his goal of mimicking his idol David Bowie.

&quot;1982&quot; received a mixed reception from critics. Canadian poet, novelist and TV writer Zoe Whittall called it a &quot;funny, nostalgic and compelling read, especially for music nerds of a certain age.&quot; Stephen Carlick criticized the book, saying that Ghomeshi&#x27;s attempt to appeal to the varied audience that listened to &quot;Q&quot; made it &quot;uneven and often tedious&quot; to read, making the reader question who the book was for after the prologue, which Carlick referred to as &quot;1982 for Dummies&quot;. Carlick also noted that &quot;Ghomeshi is a nice guy ... inoffensive and genial&quot;, but the book, by &quot;trying to appeal to everyone&quot;, is spread &quot;too thin&quot;.

In October 2014 his publisher, Penguin Random House Canada, announced that it would not publish his second book &quot;in light of recent events&quot; following allegations of sexual abuse.

In September 2018, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; published &quot;Reflections from a Hashtag&quot;, a 3,000-word essay by Ghomeshi. The essay drew a &quot;storm of criticism&quot; from major figures in the literary world, an apology from the magazine, and the late-September firing of editor Ian Buruma. On October 25, the magazine&#x27;s editors acknowledged that the essay generated &quot;considerable criticism from readers&quot; and admitted to &quot;failures in the presentation and editing of his story&quot;. The editors wrote that readers should have been informed about the &quot;serious nature and number of allegations against Mr. Ghomeshi&quot; and they added a summary of these allegations to the online version of the essay.

In response to Ghomeshi&#x27;s essay, Jesse Brown wrote on Canadaland: &quot;The piece is filled with inaccuracies, omissions, evasions, and mischaracterizations about what he [Ghomeshi] did, what he is alleged to have done, and what happened to him as a result—much of which are matters of public record.&quot; Brown added that while &quot;&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; presented Ghomeshi&#x27;s essay under the grave cover headline &#x27;THE FALL OF MEN, the &quot;fall of Jian Ghomeshi is not indicative of the fall of men, mankind, masculinity, or anything so dire. It was the fall of one man who, by his own admission, was hurting people and abusing his power&quot;.

===Podcasting===

In April 2017, Ghomeshi launched &quot;The Ideation Project&quot;, a music and podcast series featuring all-original words, music, recordings and production by Ghomeshi commenting on cultural and newsworthy topics. Ghomeshi launched &quot;The Ideation Project&quot; with a monologue called &quot;Exiles&quot; on the topic of what it means to not have a homeland. The podcast was discontinued after one season.

Since 2020, Ghomeshi has been the executive producer and host of &quot;Roqe&quot;, an English-language podcast aimed at the Iranian diaspora.

==Criminal charges and trial==
On November 26, 2014, following his termination by the CBC, Ghomeshi turned himself in to the Toronto Police Service and was charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking, after an investigation that began on October 31, 2014. The charges concerned three separate women. He appeared in court on the same day and was released on $100,000 bail on the conditions that he surrender his passport, stay within Ontario and live with his mother.

Ghomeshi appeared in court again on January 8, 2015, and was charged with three additional counts of sexual assault related to three more women. In a court appearance on February 26, 2015, a judicial pretrial was set for March 27, 2015, and was later put over to April 28, 2015. His lawyer, Marie Henein, stated that he would plead not guilty to all charges. On October 1, 2015, Ghomeshi pleaded not guilty to one count of choking and four counts of sexual assault.

Ghomeshi&#x27;s trial began on February 1, 2016, and lasted eight days. Henein was able to access thousands of messages between Ghomeshi&#x27;s accusers and presented them during the trial. Judge William Horkins stated that the complainants had provided what he described as &quot;deceptive and manipulative&quot; evidence, claiming the &quot;inconsistency&quot; and &quot;outright deception&quot; of the witnesses&#x27; testimony had irreparably weakened the prosecution&#x27;s case. On March 24, 2016, the judge acquitted Ghomeshi of all charges on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

A second trial for one additional charge was scheduled for June 2016. On May 11, 2016, however, the Crown withdrew the last remaining charge over the alleged sexual assault against Kathryn Borel, a producer of &quot;Q&quot;, after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond. The publication ban as to the name of the victim, Borel, was lifted that same day. According to Borel, Henein approached Borel&#x27;s representation to ask for an alternative to a trial, and after several exchanges Ghomeshi agreed to apologize to Borel and did so formally. &quot;A peace bond is an order from a court that typically involves keeping good behaviour and a prohibition on contacting the complainant,&quot; lawyers told the CBC. &quot;The signing of a peace bond is not an admission of having committed a crime.&quot;

===Further allegations===
In 2022, actress Sarah Polley accused Ghomeshi of sexually assaulting her on a date in 1995, when she was 16 and he was 28. Polley made the accusation in her autobiographical essay collection &quot;Run Towards the Danger&quot;, in which she wrote that she had wanted to come forward about her experiences in 2014 but was dissuaded by family and friends from speaking out.

<doc id="432519" wikidata="Q6913970" url="?curid=432519" title="Morrisania, Bronx">
<text>Morrisania ( ) is a residential neighborhood in the southwestern Bronx, New York City, New York. Its boundaries are the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the north, Crotona-Prospect Avenue to the east, East 163rd Street to the south, and Webster Avenue to the west. Third Avenue is the primary thoroughfare through Morrisania.

The name derives from the Manor of Morrisania, the estate of the powerful and aristocratic Morris family, who at one time owned most of the Bronx as well as much of New Jersey. The family includes Lewis Morris, 4th Lord of the Manor and signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence, and Gouverneur Morris, the penman of the United States Constitution. Both are buried in the crypt at St. Ann&#x27;s Church of Morrisania. Today the name is most commonly associated with the neighborhood of Morrisania, which is only a small corner of the original Morrisania.

Morrisania is part of Bronx Community Board 3, and its ZIP Codes include 10456 and 10459. The area is patrolled by the NYPD&#x27;s 42nd Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx.

==History==

From 1644 to the early 20th century, the land of the neighborhood was the estate of the Morris family in Westchester County. In 1790, Lewis Morris, owner of the estate and signer of the Declaration of Independence, proposed the land as the site of the federal capital.

The area was sparsely populated until 1840, when Gouverneur Morris Jr., son of the famous congressional delegate and nephew of Lewis, allowed a railroad to be built across the property. In 1848, he sold the land next to the line for the development of a new settlement called the Village of Morrisania. In 1855, additional settlements along the rail line became the Town of Morrisania (with its own police force), with its political center in the original 1840 village (which was eventually incorporated in 1864). At first, the village was an early forerunner of today&#x27;s bedroom communities, populated by people who worked in Manhattan, but it quickly developed its own local industries and craftsmen as it developed into a full-fledged town. In 1874, the area was annexed to New York City (then consisting only of Manhattan) as part of the Twenty-Third Ward. In 1887, the Third Avenue Elevated was extended to the area to provide easy and quick access to and from Manhattan. By the time the New York City Subway was extended to the area in 1904, a large influx of European immigrants had given the neighborhood an urban character, with a high concentration of tenement buildings replacing houses as the dominant form of dwelling.


In the 1950s along with changing demographics, Robert Moses destroyed various tenements in favor of a colony of public housing. After the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the poverty that East Tremont suffered spread into Morrisania. As a result, and also due to the aggressive 1968 Program for Action, the Third Avenue El closed in 1973. During this time period, a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area.

Many social problems associated with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, have plagued the area for some time. Despite crime declines versus their peaks during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community. Morrisania has significantly higher drop-out rates and incidents of violence in its schools. Other problems in local schools include low test scores and high truancy rates. Drug addiction is also a serious problem in the community. Due to the lucrative drug trade in the area, many addicts reside in the community. Peer pressure among children who come from broken homes contributes to the high rate of usage. Many households in the area are headed by single mothers, which contributes to the high poverty rate. Single parent homes often have a harder time providing at the same level as two-parent homes. Many of the families living in Morrisania have been in poverty for generations. The incarceration rate in the area is also very high. Morrisania is home to a significant number of inmates currently held in New York state prison and jail facilities.

After a wave of arson ravaged the low-income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, most of the residential structures in Morrisania were left seriously damaged or destroyed. The city began to rehabilitate many formally abandoned tenement-style apartment buildings and designate them low-income housing beginning in the late 1970s. Also many subsidized attached multi-unit townhouses and newly constructed apartment buildings have been or are being built on vacant lots across the neighborhood.

==Demographics==

<text>USS &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; (DD-952/DDG-2), named for Charles Francis Adams III (Secretary of the Navy from 1929 to 1933), was the lead ship of her class of guided missile destroyers of the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1960, during her 30-year operational history she participated in the recovery operation for the Mercury 8 space mission, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as operations in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Decommissioned in 1990, attempts to save her as a museum ship failed and she was scrapped in 2021.

==History==
The ship was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine, on 16 June 1958, launched on 8 September 1959 by Mrs. R. Homans, sister of Mr. Adams, commissioned on 10 September 1960, and stationed in its homeport of Charleston, South Carolina.

Intended as a follow-on to the s, the ship was originally designated as DD-952. Outwardly similar to the &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; class, &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; was the first U.S. Navy ship designed from the keel up to launch anti-aircraft missiles. To reflect the increased capabilities of the ship and to distinguish her from previous destroyer designs, &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; was re-designated DDG-2 prior to the ship&#x27;s launching.
Following commissioning, &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; took part in recovery operations for Walter M. Schirra&#x27;s Mercury 8 mission. While engaged in this operation the Cuban Missile Crisis developed and &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; moved to the Caribbean Sea as part of the quarantine forces around the island of Cuba. In July 1969, &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; left her homeport of Charleston and relocated to Mayport, Florida.

On 19 November 1980 &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; under the command of Commander Joseph F. McCarton, sailed with and her battle group to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, during which the ship made a port call to the town of Bunbury, Western Australia from 3–7 February 1981. &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; returned home to Mayport on 9 June 1981.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
&quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1990. Attempts were made to acquire the ship as a museum while it was being stored on Donation Hold status at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania.

The Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum attempted to acquire the ship as a museum and memorial to be located in Bay City, Michigan; however, the cost of preparing the ship for movement through the Saint Lawrence Seaway proved too expensive and the project was abandoned.

In 2008 she was considered for preservation by the Adams Class Veteran&#x27;s Association and the Jacksonville Historic Naval Ship Association (JHNSA) in Jacksonville, Florida. An application was delivered to the U.S. Navy for same on 31 March 2008.

In October 2010, the Jacksonville City Council supported efforts to bring the ship to Jacksonville as a museum ship, given the vessel&#x27;s historical past association with nearby Naval Station Mayport. The preservation effort was estimated to require approximately $300,000 to tow the ship to Jacksonville from the Navy&#x27;s Inactive Ship Facility in Philadelphia, $3 million for repairs and restoration of the vessel, and $5 million to construct a pier to moor it. By late 2013, the preservation groups had raised about $1.4 million.

On 27 August 2014, the Jacksonville City Council approved a lease of city-owned riverfront property to the JHNSA and authorized the Downtown Investment Authority to manage the project. The groups expected to have the ship moored downtown on the St. Johns River by the end of 2015. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan&#x27;s proposal to develop the riverfront included a location for the ship.
In December 2018, plans to bring &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; to Jacksonville were abandoned in light of the continued reluctance of the Navy, for reasons that were never clearly articulated, to release the ship to the JHNSA; the JHNSA believes that the Navy preferred demolition of the ship versus transfer of the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; to the JHNSA and its conversion to a museum ship.

In September 2020, the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; left Philadelphia Navy Yard under tow, bound for Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping. Scrapping was completed by July 2, 2021

<text>USS &quot;John King&quot; (DD-953/DDG-3) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile armed destroyer in the United States Navy named for Medal of Honor recipient John King.

&quot;John King&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath in Maine on 25 August 1958, launched on 30 January 1960 by Mrs. Paul J. Kilday, wife of Representative Kilday of Texas and commissioned on 4 February 1961; Comdr. Albert M. Sackett in command. &quot;John King&quot; was ordered as DD-953, reclassified as DDG-3 on 16 August 1956 and reclassified as DDG-3 on 26 June 1957. &quot;John King&quot; participated in blockade duties during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.

== Service history ==

Following shakedown training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;John King&quot; carried out weapons tests on the East Coast before arriving Norfolk 7 September 1961 for regular duty. One of a new class of guided missile destroyers, she featured latest hull design with all-aluminum superstructure and mounted the very latest in modern armament and electronic equipment. Departing 27 November 1961, the ship cruised to England and Northern Europe until 1 January 1962, when she sailed from Dublin for the Mediterranean. There, &quot;John King&quot; joined the 6th Fleet in its constant role of peacekeeping in this troubled region. After her return to Norfolk, Virginia in April, the ship conducted missile firing exercises and training in the Caribbean. She arrived Washington 10 July 1962 for a 4-day stay, entertaining a group of Senators and Congressmen as well as Secretary of the Navy Fred Korth.

Following additional exercises, &quot;John King&quot; entered Norfolk Navy Yard 11 October 1962. Soon afterward, the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba precipitated a crisis; and, as Navy ships placed a quarantine around the island, the ship quickly finished her repairs and joined the blockade 6 November. After the crisis eased, the ship remained in the Caribbean operating with the Navy&#x27;s newest and biggest carrier, the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise (CVN-65). She returned to Norfolk 8 December 1962.

&quot;John King&quot; departed for her second Mediterranean cruise 6 February 1963. After visiting various ports on 6th Fleet maneuvers, she steamed to Kiel, Germany, 23 June 1963, then returned to Norfolk 17 July 1963. The next twelve months were spent on training and readiness exercises off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean, including a week at the Anti-submarine Warfare School, Key West, Florida, in April 1964.

The destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean Sea once more 3 August 1964 and joined the 6th Fleet 16 August near the strife-torn island of Cyprus. She remained in the Mediterranean until the end of 1964.

&quot;John King&quot; returned to Norfolk 29 January and operated along the East Coast until sailing for the &quot;Med&quot; 14 October. Following 4 months of operations with the 6th Fleet, she returned to Norfolk 7 March 1966. In the summer she visited the Mediterranean and recrossed the Atlantic on NATO Exercise &quot;Straight Laced.&quot; Back at homeport in the fall she operated out of Norfolk until sailing for another 6th Fleet deployment 10 January 1967. Her movements were concentrated in the Western Mediterranean until she sailed for home 11 May. Arriving Norfolk on the 19th, &quot;John King&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 27 June 1967 for an overhaul to prepare for future service.

Throughout the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, &quot;John King&quot; participated various NATO exercises and supported Atlantic Fleet operations during the Cold War. In 1982, &quot;John King&quot; was off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, providing gunfire support to the U.S. Marines.

&quot;John King&quot; was decommissioned on 30 March 1990, was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 January 1993 and sold for scrap on 10 February 1999.

<doc id="432525" wikidata="Q7885417" url="?curid=432525" title="Union Bay (Seattle)">
<text>Union Bay is a body of water located in Seattle, Washington. Part of Lake Washington, it is bounded by the Laurelhurst neighborhood to the north and the Montlake and Madison Park neighborhoods to the south. The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, which carries State Route 520, crosses over a portion of the bay.

Marsh Island and Foster Island are located in Union Bay, and are connected to the mainland (and each other) by the Arboretum Waterfront Trail and the Foster Island Trail. Union Bay ends at the eastern opening of the Montlake Cut, which connects Union Bay with Portage Bay (an arm of Lake Union) to the west—this marks the beginning of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which runs through Seattle and connects Lake Washington to Puget Sound.

Broken Island is adjacent to Husky Stadium and was formed in 1916 when Lake Washington was lowered several feet by the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The island, and the wetlands in which it sits on the lake&#x27;s shore, were &quot;the result of conversion of shallow water lake habitats following lake level lowering.&quot; The island&#x27;s soil is mostly peat laid down from earlier times.

== History ==
When the level of Lake Washington was dropped nearly in 1916 as a result of the opening of the Ship Canal, a good portion of Union Bay and Union Bay Marsh and wetland became dry land, furthered by landfill activities. The marsh and much of the bay was filled from 1911 to 1967. The Montlake Landfill (in use from 1926 to 1967) was the fictional home of television clown J. P. Patches, resident 1958 through 1981. The University Village shopping center (1956) and most of the east main campus of the University of Washington (UW) but for Husky Stadium sit on this land today. What remains of Union Bay Marsh is the restored remnant within the Union Bay Natural Area of the UW.

As well as providing the outlet for Lake Washington, Union Bay receives the water of Arboretum Creek, and Ravenna Creek via pipeline from Ravenna Park through south Ravenna, daylighted past the restored Union Bay Natural Area.

The shores of what is now Union Bay have been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago. Ancestors of the Native American Duwamish tribe today, until the 1850s the &quot;Dkhw’Duw’Absh&quot;, &quot;the People of the Inside&quot;, of the (Skagit-Nisqually) Lushootseed Coast Salish nations had villages around Union Bay.

The village of &quot;hehs-KWEE-kweel&quot; (&quot;skate&quot;) was of the &quot;hloo-weelh-AHBSH&quot; (from &quot;s&#x27;hloo-WEELH&quot;, &quot;a tiny hole drilled to measure the thickness of a canoe&quot;), for the narrow passage through then-large and resource-rich Union Bay marsh. Traces of the marsh survive as the Union Bay Natural Area and the Foster Island area of north Washington Park Arboretum. The trees and the island of &quot;Stitici&quot; (Stee-tee-tchee) were their ceremonial burial ground. &quot;Stitici&quot;, Little Island, is now called Foster Island. The village was at the northeast tip of what is now Madison Park. One of the longhouses (forerunners of cohousing for tens of people) may have been used as a potlatch house. The Duwamish Tribe is today leveraging the sacred site in the path of substantial enlargement of State Route 520 through south Union Bay between Redmond and Interstate 5, in their quest for recognition.

The prominent village of &quot;SWAH-tsoo-gweel&quot; (&quot;portage&quot;) was on an abundant and much larger Union Bay, and what is now Ravenna was their backyard before the arrival of European settlers, Laurelhurst in summer. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built around 1886 along what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail, following what was the shoreline past where the UW power plant and University Village are today. A longhouse was near the present UW power plant (across Montlake Boulevard from the IMA building), others were around the north shores which were about mile farther north than today, and shores east of what is now the Union Bay Natural Area, with a longhouse or two between what is now the Center for Urban Horticulture and Children&#x27;s Hospital. Villages were diffuse.

Cheshiahud or Lake John and his family were among the memorable residents around Union Bay in the early decades of Seattle.

<doc id="432527" wikidata="Q11351131" url="?curid=432527" title="USS Lawrence (DDG-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Lawrence&quot; (DD-954/DDG-4) was a Charles F. Adams class guided-missile destroyer in the United States Navy. It was the fifth ship named after Captain James Lawrence USN (1781–1813). The &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; served on blockade duty during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and, in 1972, was part of Operation Linebacker in the west Pacific.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;USS Lawrence&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey on 27 October 1958. The ship was launched on 27 February 1960, by Mrs. Fernie C. Hubbard, the great-great-granddaughter of Captain James Lawrence. The ship was commissioned on 6 January 1962. After a shakedown cruise on the Great Lakes, &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; proceeded to Naval Station Norfolk for duty in the Atlantic Fleet.

=== Cuban Missile Crisis ===

Following the rapid development of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the warship deployed with Task Group 136.1, a surface quarantine group of cruisers composed of USS Canberra (CAG-2), USS Newport News (CA-148), three guided-missile destroyers including &quot;USS&quot; &quot;Lawrence,&quot; and twelve escorts. The group took up a blocking position north of Cuba on 24 October 1962, two days into the crisis. On Friday, 26 October 1962, &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; and &quot;MacDonough&quot; (DLG-8) began shadowing &quot;MT Grozny&quot;, a tanker proceeding towards Cuba. The next day, the Soviet Union agreed to defuse the crisis and military forces on both sides began standing down.

==== Mediterranean ====
After returning to Norfolk on 6 December 1962, &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; began the first of many Mediterranean cruises on 6 February 1963, steaming across the Atlantic to join the Sixth Fleet for operations in European waters, where she remained until 1 July 1963. Following a second Mediterranean deployment between April and August 1964, the warship received an extensive overhaul in Norfolk over the ensuing winter. Before the end of the decade, she conducted four more cruises; a Sixth Fleet deployment (24 August 1965 to 17 December 1965), a NATO exercise in the North Atlantic (3 August 1966 to 5 September 1966), another Mediterranean tour (27 September 1966 to 1 February 1967) and a third Sixth Fleet cruise (10 January 1968 to 4 May 1968). During her fourth Mediterranean deployment, &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; helped rescue crewmen from the sinking merchant vessel &quot;New Meadow&quot;, in distress off the coast of Crete.

=== Vietnam War ===

Following two additional Mediterranean deployments, one in 1969 and another in 1971, the much-traveled destroyer made one Vietnam War tour in the Western Pacific from 1972 to 1973, providing naval gunfire support, rescuing downed aviators and serving as plane guard during aircraft carrier operations. Among her guests on Yankee Station were the Chief of Naval Operations and Secretary of the Navy.

As the U.S.S. Lawrence came through the locks in the Panama canal, her sister ship was sabotaged by a crewman that dropped a large wrench into the main reduction gear shaft, causing her to be towed to San Diego for repairs while the &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; sailed on to Vietnam and engaged in Operation Linebacker. At the time, she was affectionately known as the &quot;Leapin Larry&quot; by her crew. For her service, she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation.

==== Sixth Fleet ====
Two more Sixth Fleet cruises followed in 1977-78 and 1979, and during the latter she briefly visited the Black Sea. &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; circumnavigated Africa en route to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, deployment that took place in 1974. &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; passed through the Mediterranean en route to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, deployments that took place in 1980 and 1983 to 1984.
==== Caribbean ====
&quot;USS Lawrence&quot; also saw frequent service closer to home, in the western Atlantic and Caribbean, and occasionally visited other waters. In 1986, she circumnavigated around South America as part of Operation Unitas XVII, exercising with Latin American navies and visiting ports in Puerto Rico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. During that deployment, she served as the flagship for Destroyer Squadron 26.

=== Decommissioning ===
The &quot;USS Lawrence&quot; was decommissioned on 30 March 1990 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 May 1990. The ship was sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. The Navy repossessed the ship in October 1996 after the ship breaking company failed, and it was finally resold for scrap on 10 February 1999.

<doc id="432529" wikidata="Q3051227" url="?curid=432529" title="Elizabeth George Speare">
<text>Elizabeth George Speare (November 21, 1908 – November 15, 1994) was an American writer of children&#x27;s historical fiction, including two Newbery Medal winners, recognizing the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;. In 1989 she received the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award for her contributions to American children&#x27;s literature and one of the Educational Paperback Association&#x27;s top 100 authors.

==Life==

Speare was born in Melrose, Massachusetts to Harry Allan and Demetria (Simmons) George. Her childhood, as she later recalled, was &quot;exceptionally happy&quot; and Melrose was &quot;an ideal place in which to have grown up, close to fields and woods where we hiked and picnicked, and near to Boston where we frequently had family treats of theaters and concerts.&quot; 

She had an extended family with one brother and many aunts, uncles, and cousins, and most importantly, very loving and supportive parents. Speare lived much of her life in New England, the setting for many of her books.

Speare began writing stories while still in high school. After completing her Bachelor of Arts degree at Smith College in 1930, she earned her Master&#x27;s degree in English from Boston University and taught English at several private Massachusetts high schools from 1932 to 1936.

In 1936, she met her future husband, Alden Speare, and together they moved to Connecticut where they married and raised two children. Although Speare always intended to write, the challenges and responsibilities of being a mother and wife drained her of any free time. Speare began to focus seriously on literature when her children were in junior high school.

==Literary career==

Speare&#x27;s first published work was a magazine article about skiing with her children. She also wrote many other magazine articles based on her experiences as a mother, and even experimented with one-act plays. Eventually her work saw circulation in &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Parents&quot;, and &quot;American Heritage&quot;.

Speare&#x27;s first book, &quot;Calico Captive&quot;, was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1957. It features a colonial New Hampshire family kidnapped by Native Americans in 1754. The next year she completed her second historical novel, &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot;, which won numerous awards, including the Newbery Medal in 1959. Ideas and inspiration for both books came to Speare while she was researching the history of New England and Connecticut, respectively. She earned her second Newbery Medal in 1962 for her third book, &quot;The Bronze Bow&quot;. &quot;The Sign of the Beaver&quot; (1984) was a Newbery Honor winner, and won the Scott O&#x27;Dell Award for Historical Fiction and the Christopher Award.

Biographer Marilyn Fain Apseloff wrote, “…she is not merely a writer of escapist literature, bringing only the past to her readers; in exploring universal problems and offering timeless values, she offers them hope for the present and the future as well.&quot; 

In 1989, the Association for Library Service to Children awarded Speare the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award, which recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made &quot;a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children&quot;. At the time, it was awarded every three years.

==Death==
Speare died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm on November 15, 1994, aged 85, in Tucson, Arizona.

<text>The Text This Week is a Web site devoted to the study of the Christian Bible and the conduct of Christian worship.

The site is organised in terms of the passages of scripture recommended for reading each Sunday (and on other days) in the lectionaries of the major Christian denominations, and in particular in the Revised Common Lectionary, which is widely used in many denominations and countries. However all the resources are available at all times, and the site is indexed by the bible passages as well as by the calendar.

The site contains comprehensive references to historic bible commentaries and worship resources that are in the public domain and available on the world wide web, and also to works of modern scholarship and to subscription web sites. It is international in scope, though most (not all) of the resources it indexes are in English. It is constantly updated. The site is theologically, denominationally and liturgically eclectic. As a result, it is used and respected by preachers world-wide.

The Text This Week was founded and is maintained by Jenee Woodard, a member of the United Methodist Church in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
