<text>A pointe shoe (, ), also referred to as a &quot;ballet shoe&quot;, is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work. Pointe shoes were conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance &quot;en pointe&quot; (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink.

==History==
Women began to dance ballet in 1681, twenty years after King Louis XIV of France ordered the founding of the Académie Royale de Danse. At that time, the standard women&#x27;s ballet shoe had heels. In the 1730s, dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Opéra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age. After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes. These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the toes to enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet.

The first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1796. His &quot;flying machine&quot; lifted dancers upward, allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground. This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and, as a result, choreographers began to look for ways to incorporate more pointe work into their pieces.

As dance progressed into the 19th century, the emphasis on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe without the aid of wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced &quot;La Sylphide&quot; en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.

The next substantially different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy in the late 19th century. Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, flat platform at the front end of the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models. These shoes also included a box—made of layers of fabric—for containing the toes, and a stiffer, stronger sole. They were constructed without nails and the soles were only stiffened at the toes, making them nearly silent. By 1880s, shoemaker Salvatore Capezio also improved the construction of pointe shoes after a series of work for repairing pointe shoes.

The birth of the modern pointe shoe is often attributed to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who was one of the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.

Men have not historically performed in pointe shoes except for comedic effect. Examples of this include Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, and characters such as Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the evil stepsisters in &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

==Controversy==
Pointe shoes employ structural reinforcements in both shank and toe box in an attempt to distribute the dancer&#x27;s weight load throughout the feet, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all their body weight on fully vertical feet.

But this belief is disputed. Nothing in pointe shoe design prevents a foot’s &quot;slippage&quot;, in which, when en pointe, the dancer’s weight forces their foot down into the shoe until their big toe meets the end of the toe box. Measurements have shown that most of the dancer&#x27;s weight en pointe is borne by the big toe(s) regardless of the length of the second toe. Hence, such reinforcements cannot and do not distribute the weight load throughout the foot as claimed.

==Construction==

Every dancer has unique feet, with variations that include toe length and shape, arch flexibility, and mechanical strength. Consequently, most pointe shoe manufacturers produce more than one model of shoe, with each model offering a different fit, as well as custom fitted shoes. Regardless of the manufacturer or model, however, all pointe shoes share two important structural features that enable dancers to dance on the tips of their toes:

* A &quot;box&quot; within the front end of the shoe that encases and supports the dancer&#x27;s toes.
* A &quot;shank&quot;, which is a piece of rigid material that serves to stiffen the sole so as to provide support for the arch of the en pointe foot.

The exterior of a pointe shoe is covered with fabric, thus concealing the box and other internal structural elements and lending an aesthetically pleasing look to the shoe. Most pointe shoes are covered with satin, but some are available with canvas exteriors. Pointe shoes are most often available in light pink colors and less commonly in black and white. In recent years, pointe shoes have also become more diverse in color. For example, many pointe shoe makers, like Bloch, offer pointe shoes in various skin tones ranging from light pink to deeper browns to suit darker complexions. When other colors are desired (e.g., to match a costume), pointe shoes may be dyed, or ordered in custom colors.

The &quot;vamp&quot; refers to the shoe&#x27;s upper piece, measured from the platform to the drawstring; normally, longer toes call for a longer vamp. The &quot;throat&quot; is the edge of the vamp above the arch of the foot; it is usually either v-shaped or round, which tend to suit feet with higher or lower arches, respectively. The &quot;drawstring&quot; is located within the binding on the throat; this may be made from either elastic or lace.

===Box===

The box is a rigid enclosure within the front end of the shoe that encases and supports the dancer&#x27;s toes. The front end of the box is flattened so as to form a platform upon which the dancer can balance, and fabric covers the exterior of the box for aesthetics.

In conventional pointe shoes, the box is typically made from tightly packed layers of paper, paste and fabric that have been glued together and then shaped into an enclosure. When the glue dries, it becomes hard and provides the required stiffness. In some newer pointe shoes, the box may be made from plastic and rubber, with rigidity provided by the plastic.

Box shapes vary widely among shoe models and manufacturers. A number of shape attributes, including box length, height, taper angle and platform area, determine the suitability of a shoe for any particular foot.

===Sole===
For most pointe shoes, the sole is constructed from a piece of leather that is attached to the shoe with adhesive and reinforced by stitching along its edges. The sole overlaps and secures the unfinished edges of the shoe&#x27;s exterior fabric. Pointe shoes may be manufactured with either scraped soles, which provide superior traction, or buffed soles, which have a smoother surface for reduced traction.

Aesthetic appearance is of paramount importance for modern pointe shoes. To achieve an elegant appearance, the shoe&#x27;s more decorative outer fabric is prominently featured, covering the maximum possible area of the shoe&#x27;s visible surfaces. To this end, the sole is made of thin material to give it a minimal profile, and a margin of satin is artfully pleated around it so that the sole covers only part of the bottom of the shoe.

===Shank===

Shanks are typically made from leather, plastic, cardstock, or layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of a shank is determined by its thickness and the type of material used. A shank&#x27;s thickness may be consistent throughout or it may vary along its length to produce different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut across a shank at demi-pointe to enhance roll through. Also, a shank&#x27;s thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard pointe shoes typically have a full shank, in which the shank runs the full length of the sole, or fractional (e.g., half or three-quarter) length shanks. Many pointe shoe manufacturers offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build shoes with customized shanks of varying stiffness and length.

Different pointe shoe makers offer different strengths of shank. For example, Grishko, a Russian pointe shoe company, offers various shank strengths such as super soft, soft, medium, hard, and super hard. The strength of the shank mostly depends on the arch and strength of the dancer’s foot. If the dancer has a strong and flexible arch, they would need a hard or super hard shank to support the foot while en pointe properly. If the dancer is starting pointe and has weaker feet, a super soft or soft shank would be more suitable, allowing the dancer to point their foot more easily. Additionally, dancers will sometimes wear different pointe shoe models for different performance pieces. In such cases, the choreography can dictate the type of shank required; a lyrical style may call for a softer shoe, while an aggressive style with many turns is more easily performed in a hard, stiff shoe.
===Ribbons and elastic band===

A pointe shoe employs two fabric ribbons and an elastic band to secure it to the foot. Most of the work of securing shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer&#x27;s ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together in a knot, which is then tucked under the ribbon on the inside of the ankle to hide it from view.

The elastic band—which traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbons—keeps the heel of the shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe. Optionally, two overlapped elastic bands may be used on each shoe to increase tension and holding power.

The locations where the band and ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement can result in a poorly fitting shoe. Some dancers choose to sew the ribbons and elastics onto the inside of the shoe, whereas others sew them outside onto the silk exterior. Typically, the loose ends of newly sewn ribbons are briefly exposed to open flames to melt them and thus prevent fraying.

===Pré-pointe shoe=== 

A &quot;pré-pointe&quot; shoe, which is also variously called a &quot;break-down&quot;, &quot;demi-pointe&quot; or a &quot;soft-block&quot; shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe and it has a toe box, although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the toe box) are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Pré-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.

Pré-pointe shoes are most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to acclimate dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The toe box allows the dancer to experience the feel of a pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.

==Manufacturing process==

Traditional pointe shoes are usually manufactured using a method known as &quot;turnshoe&quot;, in which each shoe is initially assembled inside-out on a last and then turned right-side-out before finishing. When manufacturing standard pointe shoes, a standardized, common last is used for both left and right shoes, resulting in identical left and right shoes in a pair. Some ballerinas have custom-made lasts that replicate the shapes of their own feet; these may be supplied to a pointe shoe manufacturer for the purpose of manufacturing custom shoes.

==Breaking in==

Dancers typically &quot;break in&quot; new pointe shoes to reduce or eliminate the discomfort they commonly cause. Typically this is done by performing relevés that flex the box and shank in a natural manner, thus causing the box shape and shank flex points to adapt to the dancer&#x27;s feet. Various other methods have been employed for breaking in pointe shoes, including deforming them with hands or against hard surfaces, striking them on hard surfaces, and moistening or heating the boxes to soften the glues, but these methods typically are ineffective as they do not cause the shoes to conform to the feet and also may damage the shoes or shorten their usable lifetimes. Pointe shoes usually are only broken in by professional dancers who use pointe shoes for multiple hours every day. Non-professional dancers and dancers beginning to learn pointe typically do not break in their pointe shoes by hand so that they last longer.

==Accessories==
A dancer may experience discomfort while wearing a pointe shoe even after the shoe has been broken in. Several devices are commonly used to mitigate the discomfort:

* &quot;Toe pads&quot; are pouches that encapsulate and cushion the toes from the unyielding box and prevent friction that can cause blistering. These are typically made from thin, fabric-covered gel sheets.
* Gel &quot;toe spacers&quot; of various shapes and sizes are inserted between toes; these serve to adjust toe spacing and alignment so as to alleviate pain at the bunion joint between the big toe and first toe.
* &quot;Lambswool&quot; is stretched and wrapped around toes to reduce chafing and the likelihood of blisters. After several uses, the lambswool becomes densely packed and custom fitted to the dancer&#x27;s foot.
* &quot;Tape&quot; is wrapped around toes to reduce chafing and blisters.
* &quot;Blister pads&quot; are small gel squares that prevent damage from rubbing and friction.

==Lifetime==

In the course of normal use, there are three predominant types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The most important of these is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances. When a pointe shoe has been worn to the point where it is no longer safe to wear, the shoe is typically referred to as &quot;dead&quot;.

The other primary type of wear involves the exterior fabric. In pointe work the front face and bottom edge of the toe box are subjected to friction against the performance surface. This friction will eventually wear through the shoe&#x27;s outer fabric covering, thereby exposing the toe box and creating loose, frayed fabric edges. Unlike a weakened shank, damaged outer fabric does not affect the performance of a shoe. Due to its unprofessional appearance, however, damaged fabric may render the shoe unfit to wear in situations other than informal practice or rehearsal. 
Under moderate usage, a pair of pointe shoes will typically last through ten to twenty hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use from a pair of pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. For example, in 2013 New York City Ballet ordered 8,500 pairs (for 180 dancers) and the Royal Ballet used approximately 12,000 pairs of pointe shoes.

The lifetime of a pointe shoe depends on many factors, including:

* Usage: More aggressive dance styles and more frequent, longer durations of use will hasten wear.
* Dance technique: Improper technique subjects shoes to unusual stresses that may lead to premature failure.
* Fit: Well fitting pointe shoes encourage proper technique, which in turn leads to longer shoe life.
* Weight: Greater dancer weight exerts proportionally greater stresses to the shoes, leading to faster wear.
* Construction: Varying qualities and types of construction will yield different life expectancies.
* Shank material: The stiffness and integrity of various shank materials will degrade at varying rates.
* Breaking-in: The breaking-in process simulates accelerated wear, and thus may shorten the life of a shoe.
* Performance surface: Rough surfaces cause rapid wear of the exterior fabric, in contrast to smooth surfaces such as Marley floors, which minimize the rate of fabric wear.
* Foot Strength: Stronger arch muscles exert greater force on the shank, causing it to bend more and thus accelerating its wear.

<text>The SVT-40 () is a Soviet semi-automatic battle rifle that saw widespread service during and after World War II. It was intended to be the new service rifle of the Soviet Red Army, but its production was disrupted by the German invasion in 1941, resulting in a change back to the Mosin–Nagant rifle for the duration of World War II although both rifles served concurrently.

== History ==
In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union requested the development of a semi-automatic rifle to replace the Mosin-Nagant, taking inspiration from the Mexican Mondragón rifle. The design was left up to two individuals, Sergei Simonov and Fedor Tokarev. Simonov, who had experience in developing the Fedorov Avtomat, created a prototype for the AVS-36 in 1931. The rifle was used during the Winter War but was removed from service in 1941 due to design flaws.

=== SVT-38 ===

In 1938, Tokarev&#x27;s rifle was accepted for production, under the designation &quot;SVT-38&quot; with hopes that it would become the new standard-issue rifle of the Red Army. Ambitious production plans anticipated two million rifles per year by 1942. Production began at Tula Arsenal in July 1939 (production at Izhmash began in late 1939).

The SVT-38 is a gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston above the barrel and a tilting bolt, a system that would later be used in the FN FAL. The SVT-38 was equipped with a bayonet and a 10-round detachable magazine. The receiver was open-top, which enabled reloading of the magazine using five-round Mosin–Nagant stripper clips. The sniper variant had an additional locking notch for a see-through scope mount and was equipped with a 3.5×21 PU telescopic sight.

The SVT-38 saw its combat debut in the 1939–1940 Winter War with Finland. The rifle had many design flaws, as its gas port was prone to fouling, the magazine would sometimes fall out during use, and it was inaccurate, only being effective up to 600m. Production of the SVT-38 was terminated in April 1940 after some 150,000 examples had been manufactured.

===SVT-40===
With the removal of the SVT-38 from service, an improved design, the SVT-40, entered production. It was a more refined, lighter design incorporating a folding magazine release and lightening cuts. The hand guard was now of one-piece construction and the cleaning rod was housed under the barrel. Other changes were made to simplify manufacturing. Production of the improved version began in July 1940 at Tula and later at factories in Izhevsk and Podolsk. Production of the Mosin–Nagant M1891/30 bolt-action rifle continued, and it remained the standard-issue rifle to Red Army troops, with the SVT-40 more often issued to non-commissioned officers and elite units like the naval infantry. Since these factories already had experience manufacturing the SVT-38, output increased quickly and an estimated 70,000 SVT-40s were produced in 1940.

By the time of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, the SVT-40 was already in widespread use by the Red Army. In a Soviet infantry division&#x27;s table of organization and equipment, one-third of rifles were supposed to be SVTs, though in practice they seldom achieved this ratio. The first months of the war were disastrous for the Soviet Union; they lost hundreds of thousands of SVT-40s. To make up for this, the production of the Mosin–Nagant rifles was reintroduced. In contrast, the SVT was more difficult to manufacture, and troops with only rudimentary training had difficulty maintaining it. Submachine guns like the PPSh-41 had proven their value as simple, cheap, and effective weapons to supplement infantry firepower. This led to a gradual decline in SVT production. In 1941, over one million SVTs were produced but in 1942 Izhevsk arsenal was ordered to cease SVT production and switch back to the Mosin–Nagant 91/30. Only 264,000 SVTs were manufactured in 1942 and production continued to diminish until the order to cease production was finally given in January 1945. Total production of the SVT-38/40 was around 1,600,000 rifles, of which 51,710 were the SVT-40 sniper variant.

SVTs frequently suffered from vertical shot dispersion; the army reported that the rifles were of &quot;flimsy construction and there were difficulties experienced in their repair and maintenance&quot;. The stock, made of Arctic Birch, was prone to cracking in the wrist from recoil. This was generally remedied by drilling and inserting one or two large industrial bolts horizontally into the stock just before the wrist meets the receiver. Many rifles were also poorly seated in their stocks, letting the receiver shift on firing. This led to a field modification that selectively shimmed the stock with birch chips, usually around the receiver and in between where the wood stock meets the lower metal handguard. For a sniper rifle, this was unacceptable and production of the specialized sniper variant of the SVT was terminated in 1942. Milling scope rails in the receivers of standard SVT rifles was also discontinued. Other production changes included a new, simpler muzzle brake design with two vents per-side instead of the six on the original.

=== AVT-40 automatic rifle ===
To supplement the Red Army&#x27;s shortage of machine guns, an SVT version capable of full-automatic fire (designated the &quot;AVT-40&quot;) was ordered into production on 20 May 1942; the first batches reached the troops in July. It was externally similar to the SVT, but its modified safety also acted as a fire selector allowing for both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire modes. When fired automatically the rifle had a rate of fire of approximately 750 RPM, faster than the DP machine gun which fired the same cartridge at 550 RPM. To better resist the stress of automatic fire, the AVT featured a slightly stouter stock made of hardwood usually distinguished with a large “A” engraved in it; surplus AVT stocks were later used on refurbished SVTs. The automatic fire was largely uncontrollable, and the rifles often suffered breakages under the increased strain. Documents discovered after the war indicated that during testing, under continuous automatic fire, an AVT-40&#x27;s barrel would be &quot;shot out&quot;, meaning the rifling in the barrel would be completely worn down, in as little as 200-250 rounds. The use of the AVT&#x27;s automatic fire mode was subsequently prohibited, and production of the rifle was relatively brief; none were made after the summer of 1943.

=== SKT-40 ===
A shorter carbine version &quot;SKT-40&quot; (СКТ-40) was designed in 1940 and was submitted to a competitive test with a design of Simonov in the same year; neither was accepted for service. Later, a prototype version chambered for the new, shorter, 7.62×39mm round was developed, but was not accepted for production. A silenced variation was also experimented with, though it too ended in failure.

=== AT-44 ===
An assault rifle based on a scaled-down SVT with 7.62x41mm chambering called the AT-44 was also put into development, it came with a bipod and pistol grip. It was competing with the AS-44 design. It failed to be accepted for similar reliability issues as the AVT.

==SVTs outside of the Soviet Union==
The first country outside the Soviet Union to employ the SVT was Finland, which captured some 2,700 SVT-38s during the Winter War, and over 15,000 SVTs during the Continuation War. The SVT saw extensive use in Finnish hands. The Finns even attempted to make their own clone of the SVT-38 designated &quot;Tapako&quot;, though only a prototype was ever conceived. The Finns would continue to experiment with producing their own SVT based rifles until the late 1950s with the introduction of the RK-62.Germany captured several hundred thousand SVTs from the Eastern Front. As the Germans were short of self-loading rifles themselves, SVT-38 and 40s, designated respectively as Selbstladegewehr 258(r) and Selbstladegewehr 259(r) by the Wehrmacht, saw widespread use by Germany. The study of the SVT&#x27;s gas-operated action also aided in the development of the German Gewehr 43 rifle.

During the 1940s, Switzerland began looking into equipping its military with semi-auto rifles. Although never officially adopted, W+F Bern produced a clone of the SVT with a 6-round 7.5×55mm Swiss magazine called the AK44.

Italy also produced at least one prototype loosely copying an SVT, which is extant in Beretta&#x27;s collection, but its designation or exact details are unknown.

==Post-war==
After the war, SVTs were mostly withdrawn from service and refurbished in arsenals, then stored. In Soviet service, firearms like the SKS and the AK-47 as well as the later SVD made the SVT obsolete, and the rifle was generally out of service by 1955. Only a few SVTs were exported to Soviet allies and clients. The Korean People&#x27;s Army reportedly received some before the Korean War. The Finnish Army retired the SVT in 1958, and about 7,500 rifles were sold to the United States civilian market through firearm importer Interarms. This marked the end of SVTs in regular service.

In the Soviet Union, some SVTs (without bayonets) were sold as civilian hunting rifles, although other SVTs were kept in storage until the 1990s, when many rifles were sold abroad, along with other surplus military firearms.

<doc id="444049" wikidata="Q380574" url="?curid=444049" title="Knowledge Navigator">
<text>Coined in 1987, the term Knowledge Navigator described a future computing system and how people might use it to navigate worlds of knowledge. In a sense, the user is actually the “Knowledge Navigator,” though the term often refers to the system’s primary interface, a tablet computer. That part (i.e., the tablet) often stands for the whole system. The term is also the title of an Apple “vision video.” The concept was described by former Apple Computer CEO John Sculley and John A. Byrne in their book, . “A future-generation Macintosh, which we should have early in the twenty-first century, might well be a wonderful fantasy machine called the Knowledge Navigator, a discoverer of worlds, a tool as galvanizing as the printing press. Individuals could use it to drive through libraries, museums, databases, or institutional archives. This tool wouldn&#x27;t just take you to the doorstep of these great resources as sophisticated computers do now; it would invite you deep inside its secrets, interpreting and explaining—converting vast quantities of information into personalized and understandable knowledge.” 

== Technologies ==
Apple’s Knowledge Navigator video illustrated the use of a series of technologies including:

* Tablet computer 
* Foldable touch screen 
* Touch interface 
* Memory cards 
* University research networks 
* Hypertext, across distributed databases
* Simulation software, for authoring and experimenting 
* Video conferencing 
* Collaborative work 
* Intelligent agents, with voice recognition and synthesis

==Scenarios==
Apple produced several concept videos showcasing the idea:

* Knowledge Navigator (1987)
* HyperCard: 1992 (1987)
* Project 2000 (1988)
* Grey Flannel Navigator (1988)
* High School 2000 (1988)
* Healthcare 2008 (1988)

Many of them featured a tablet style computer with numerous advanced capabilities, including an excellent text-to-speech system with no hint of &quot;computerese&quot;, a gesture based interface resembling the multi-touch interface later used on the iPhone and an equally powerful speech understanding system, allowing the user to converse with the system via an animated &quot;butler&quot; as the software agent.

In the Knowledge Navigator video, a university professor returns home and turns on his computer, in the form of a tablet the size of a large-format book. The agent is a bow-tie wearing butler who appears on the screen and informs him that he has several calls waiting. He ignores most of these, from his mother, and instead uses the system to compile data for a talk on deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest. While he is doing this, the computer informs him that a colleague is calling, and they then exchange data through their machines and co-create a simulation, while holding a video based conversation.

In the Project 2000 video, a young student uses a smaller handheld version of the system to prompt him while he gives a class presentation on volcanoes, eventually sending a movie of an exploding volcano to the video &quot;blackboard&quot;. In a final installment a user scans in a newspaper by placing it on the screen of the full-sized version, and then has it help him learn to read by listening to him read the scanned results, and prompting when he pauses.

===Credits===
The first three videos were funded and sponsored by Bud Colligan, Director of Apple&#x27;s higher education marketing group, written and creatively developed by Hugh Dubberly and Doris Mitsch of Apple Creative Services, with technical and conceptual input from Mike Liebhold of Apple&#x27;s Advanced Technologies Group, who said &quot;[I was] channeling some of the ideas of Alan Kay and the MIT Architecture Machine group&quot;.

The videos were produced by The Kenwood Group in San Francisco and directed by Randy Field. The director of photography was Bill Zarchy. Jane Hernandez was Kenwood’s producer; Christina Crowley managed Kenwood. The post-production mix was done by Gary Clayton at Russian Hill Recording for The Kenwood Group. The product industrial design was created by Gavin Ivester and Adam Grosser of Apple design.

The concepts behind Knowledge Navigator owe a debt to many pioneers, especially Alan Kay and his vision of the Dynabook. Liebhold had worked with Kay at Atari, and Kay met weekly with Sculley, who wrote, “When I trace the origins of the most exciting and outrageous ideas behind the personal computer revolution, most paths lead directly to Alan.” Sculley also credits the work of Ted Nelson and Bill Atkinson. Kay was a student of Ivan Sutherland, whose work has been fundamental to modern computing. Kay was also influenced by the work of JCR Licklider, Bob Taylor, and Douglas Engelbart. 

Dubberly and Mitsch interviewed Paul Saffo, Bob Johansen, and Aaron Marcus as input and subsequently met with Kay. Another important influence was MIT’s Arch Mach group and its work on the “Jeep Repair Manual,” an interactive, hypertext, multi-media system, which Dubberly had visited as a student in 1981. Stewart Brand’s book “The Media Lab”, Vernor Vinge&#x27;s story “True Names,” and William Gibson’s “Neuromancer” were also part of their research. And Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think” was foundational. 

The Knowledge Navigator video premiered in 1987 at Educom, the leading higher education conference, in a keynote by John Sculley, with demos of multimedia, hypertext and interactive learning directed by Bud Colligan. The video’s project schedule was six weeks from start to keynote. The budget was $60,000. 

The music featured in this video is Georg Anton Benda&#x27;s Harpsichord Concerto in C.

==Reception==
In 1988, John Markoff wrote in The New York Times:“During the last year John Sculley, Apple&#x27;s chairman, has widely shown a public relations film called ‘Knowledge Navigator’ that features an advanced PC. In Apple&#x27;s vision, future users will interact with computers capable of displaying TV-like animation and speaking to them.”The software agent in the video has been discussed in the domain of human–computer interaction. It was criticized as being an unrealistic portrayal of the capacities of any software agent in the foreseeable future, or even in a distant future.

Some visions put forth by proponents of the Semantic Web have been likened to that of the Knowledge Navigator by Marshall and Shipman, who argue that some of these visions &quot;ignore the difficulty of scaling knowledge-based systems to reason across domains, like Apple&#x27;s Knowledge Navigator,&quot; and conclude that, as of 2003, &quot;scenarios of the complexity of [a previously quoted] Knowledge Navigator-like approach to interacting with people and things in the world seem unlikely.&quot;

==Siri==

New York Times tech columnist John Markoff has linked Knowledge Navigator and Siri.

The notion of Siri was firmly planted at Apple 25 years ago though “Knowledge Navigator” with the voice of the assistant was only a concept prototype. In one of the videos, a man is seen asking the assistant to search for an article published 5 years before his time, the assistant finds it and tells the article being dated to 2006, and due to this we can conclude that the video is set to take place in September 2011. In October 2011, Apple relaunched Siri, a voice activated personal assistant software vaguely similar to that aspect of the Knowledge Navigator just a month after their initial prediction.

<doc id="444051" wikidata="Q1147337" url="?curid=444051" title="Sit-in">
<text>A sit-in or sit-down is a form of direct action that involves one or more people occupying an area for a protest, often to promote political, social, or economic change. The protestors gather conspicuously in a space or building, refusing to move unless their demands are met. The often clearly visible demonstrations are intended to spread awareness among the public, or disrupt the goings-on of the protested organization. Lunch counter sit-ins were a nonviolent form of protest used to oppose segregation during the civil rights movement, and often provoked heckling and violence from those opposed to their message.

== Examples ==

=== United States ===

==== Civil rights movement ====

The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) conducted sit-ins as early as the 1940s. Ernest Calloway refers to Bernice Fisher as &quot;Godmother of the restaurant &#x27;sit-in&#x27; technique.&quot; In August 1939, African-American attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker organized the Alexandria Library sit-in at the then racially segregated library. Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) labor delegates had a brief, spontaneous lunch counter sit-in during their 1947 Columbus, Ohio convention.

In one of the earliest use of sit-ins against racism, followers of Father Divine and the International Peace Mission Movement joined with the Cafeteria Workers Union, Local 302, in September 1939 to protest racially unfair hiring practices at New York&#x27;s Shack Sandwich Shops, Inc. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; for September 23, 1939, on Thursday between 75 and 100 followers showed up at the restaurant at Forty-first Street and Lexington Avenue, where most of the strike activity has been concentrated, and groups went into the place, purchased five-cent cups of coffee, and conducted what might be described as a kind of customers&#x27; nickel sit down strike. Other patrons were unable to find seats.

In May 1942, James Farmer Jr., an organizer for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, led a group of 27 people to protest the racially discriminatory no-service policy of the Jack Spratt Diner on 47th Street in Chicago. Each seating area at the diner was taken by groups that included at least one black person. The peaceful patrons, several from the campus of the nearby University of Chicago, then tried to order; all were refused. The police were called, but when they arrived they told the management that no laws were being broken, so no arrests were made. The diner closed for the night but thereafter, according to periodic checks made by CORE activists, it no longer enforced its discriminatory policy. 
With the encouragement of Melvin B. Tolson and Farmer, students from Wiley and Bishop Colleges organized the first sit-in in Texas in the rotunda of the Harrison County Courthouse in Marshall. This sit-in directly challenged the oldest White Citizens Party in Texas and would culminate in the reversal of Jim Crow laws in the state and the desegregation of postgraduate studies in Texas by the &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; (1950) verdict. Sit-ins are often recognized for illuminating the goals of the movement in a way that young people were also able to participate in. Sit-ins were an integral part of the nonviolent strategy of civil disobedience and mass protests that eventually led to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which ended legally sanctioned racial segregation in the United States and also passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that struck down many racially motivated barriers used to deny voting rights to non-whites.

====1955 Baltimore, Maryland====

One of the earliest lunch counter sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement was started by a group of Morgan State College (now University) students and the Baltimore chapter of CORE. Their goal was to desegregate Read&#x27;s drug stores. The peaceful sit-in lasted less than one half an hour and the students were not served. They left voluntarily and no one was arrested. After losing business from the sit-in and several local protests, two days later the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; newspaper ran a story featuring Arthur Nattans Sr., then President of Read&#x27;s, who was quoted saying, &quot;We will serve all customers throughout our entire stores, including the fountains, and this becomes effective immediately&quot;. As a result, 37 Baltimore-area lunch counters became desegregated. Despite also being led by students and successfully targeting segregation at a store lunch counter, the Read&#x27;s Drug Store sit-in did not garner the same level of attention as the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins.

====1957 Durham, North Carolina====

At another early sit-in, the &quot;Royal Seven,&quot; a group of three women and four men from Durham, North Carolina, sat in at the Royal Ice Cream Parlor on June 23, 1957, to protest practices of segregation. The activists were arrested and charged with trespassing. Their efforts are now recognized via historical markers in Durham. They went to court three times; each case ended in their being found guilty.

====1958 Wichita and Oklahoma City====

This sit-in for the purpose of integrating segregated establishments began on July 19, 1958, in Wichita, Kansas, at Dockum Drugs, a store in the old Rexall chain. In early August, the drugstore became integrated, then remainder of Dockum stores in all of Kansas. A few weeks later on August 19, 1958, in Oklahoma City, a nationally recognized sit-in at the Katz Drug Store lunch counter occurred. The Oklahoma City Sit-in Movement was led by NAACP Youth Council leader Clara Luper, a local high school teacher, and young local students, including Luper&#x27;s eight-year-old daughter, who suggested the sit-in be held. The group quickly desegregated the Katz Drug Store lunch counters. It took several more years, but she and the students, using the tactic, integrated all of Oklahoma City&#x27;s eating establishments. Today, in downtown Wichita, Kansas, a statue depicting a waitress at a counter serving people honors this pioneering sit-in. Despite the notable attention that has historically been given to the 1960 Greensboro sit-in, the 1958 Katz Drug Store sit-in in fact employed the same strategy that would be used in Greensboro one-and-a-half years later.

====1960 Greensboro and Nashville====

Following the Oklahoma City sit-ins, the tactic of non-violent student sit-ins spread. The Greensboro sit-ins at a Woolworth&#x27;s in Greensboro, North Carolina, on February 1, 1960, launched a wave of anti-segregation sit-ins across the South and opened a national awareness of the depth of segregation in the nation. Within weeks, sit-in campaigns had begun in nearly a dozen cities, primarily targeting Woolworth&#x27;s and S. H. Kress and other stores of other national chains.

The largest and best-organized of these campaigns were the Nashville sit-ins, whose groundwork was already underway before the Greensboro events. They involved hundreds of participants, and led to the successful desegregation of Nashville lunch counters. Most of the participants in the Nashville sit-ins were college students, and many, such as Diane Nash, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, and C. T. Vivian, went on to lead, strategize, and direct almost every aspect of the 1960s civil rights movement. The students of the historically black colleges and universities in the city played a critical role in implementing the Nashville sit-ins.

1963 Flagstaff Arizona

The NAACP recruited 10 high school and middle school students from Flagstaff Junior High School and Flagstaff High School to protest the refusal of the El Charro Cafe to serve a bus load of Negro tourists from New Jersey. Shirley Sims, a 14-year-old member of the NAACP Youth Corp at Flagstaff Junior High School, accepted the invitation to participate in a nonviolent sit-in demonstration. Each of the youth members were given $5 with the instructions to go inside and sit down. If they were able to order a meal they would pay for it, if not they would sit there. Reportedly, none of the members were served. Joseph Watkins, an official of the Arizona Branch of the NAACP, reported to the Flagstaff City Council that none of the youths had been served and that there had been no violence. Watkins also stated that unless the restaurant had a change in policy, more sit ins would be staged, &quot;but whatever methods we employ or encourage will be peaceful.&quot; Sims stated in an &quot;Arizona Daily Sun&quot; article in 2017 that, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t scary because a lot of the people who frequented that restaurant were our teachers, and they encouraged us.&quot;

====1961 Rock Hill, South Carolina====
The Friendship Nine was a group of African American men who went to jail after staging a sit-in at a segregated McCrory&#x27;s lunch counter in Rock Hill, South Carolina in 1961. The group gained nationwide attention because they followed the Nashville student&#x27;s strategy of not bailing themselves out of jail and called it &quot;Jail, No Bail&quot;, which lessened the huge financial burden civil rights groups were facing as the sit-in movement spread across the South. They became known as the Friendship Nine because eight of the nine men were students at Rock Hill&#x27;s Friendship Junior College. They are sometimes referred to as the Rock Hill Nine.

====1962 University of Chicago, Illinois====

In January 1962, Bernie Sanders, then a student at the University of Chicago, helped lead a sit-in in protesting university president George Wells Beadle&#x27;s segregated campus housing policy. 
&quot;We feel it is an intolerable situation, when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,&quot; Sanders told a crowd of about 200 students. After several days of protests, Beadle met with students to form a commission to investigate discrimination.

===Disability rights movement===

====1935 New York City====
The League of the Physically Handicapped in New York City was formed in May 1935 to protest discrimination by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The Home Relief Bureau of New York City stamped applications by physically handicapped applicants with &quot;PH&quot;, which stood for &quot;physically handicapped&quot;. Marked as &quot;unemployable&quot;, they were denied access to WPA-created jobs. To protest, members of the League held a sit-in at that Home Relief Bureau for nine days beginning on May 29, 1935, and a weekend sit-in at the WPA headquarters, also in New York City, in June 1935. These actions eventually led to the creation of 1,500 jobs for physically handicapped workers in New York City in 1936.

====1972 New York City====
An early version of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was vetoed by President Richard Nixon in October 1972. Later in 1972, Disabled in Action demonstrated in New York City with a sit-in protesting this veto. Led by Judith Heumann, eighty activists staged this sit-in on Madison Avenue, stopping traffic.

====1977 San Francisco====
Initially Joseph Califano, U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, refused to sign meaningful regulations for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was the first U.S. federal civil rights protection for people with disabilities. After an ultimatum and deadline, demonstrations took place in ten U.S. cities on April 5, 1977, including the beginning of the 504 Sit-in at the San Francisco Office of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. This sit-in, led by Judith Heumann and organized by Kitty Cone, lasted until May 4, 1977, a total of 25 days, with more than 150 people refusing to leave. It is the longest sit-in at a federal building to date. Joseph Califano signed the regulations on April 28, 1977.

===Easement payment===
On June 1, 1955, in Door County, Wisconsin, Mrs. Victor Baker sat on a chair over three charges of dynamite, and later moved to her car parked near the dynamite. She blocked the construction of a state highway for 17 hours to protest the failure of the county government to pay the entirety of the amount owed her and her husband for the additional right-of-way taken from her home and orchard along the construction route. The county had planned to pay a week later, after the state sent the funds. On the morning of June 2, the county highway commissioner came by with a check for an additional $1,500 and she ended the protest.

===Feminist movement===

====1969 Marlene Dixon====
In 1969 there was a sit-in at the University of Chicago to protest the firing of feminist sociology professor Marlene Dixon. On February 12, 1969, a faculty committee chaired by Hanna H. Gray, Associate Professor of History, concluded that no violation of normal appointment procedures had occurred, but recommended that Dixon be offered a one-year terminal reappointment since the resolution of her status had been delayed by the controversy surrounding the decision; Dixon refused. On February 15, the protestors still sitting-in voted to stop. In March 1969, at the decision of university disciplinary committees, forty-two students involved in the Administration Building sit-in were expelled, eighty-one were suspended, and three were placed on probation.

A &quot;Statement on the University of Chicago sit-in&quot; was included in the feminist anthology &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot; (edited by Robin Morgan, published in 1970); this statement refers to the Marlene Dixon sit-in.

====1969 Oak Room sit-in====
By the early 1950s, women were allowed inside the Oak Room and Bar during the evenings, but still barred until 3 p.m. on weekdays, while the stock exchanges operated. In February 1969, Betty Friedan and other members of the National Organization for Women held a sit-in and then picketed to protest this; the gender restriction was removed a few months later.

====1970 &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;====
In March 1970, feminists held an 11-hour sit-in at the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; office, which resulted in them getting the opportunity to produce a section of the magazine that August.

===Gun control lobby===

====2016 United States House of Representatives====

The sit-in began on June 22, 2016, when members of the House Democratic Caucus declared their intention to remain on the floor of the United States House of Representatives until its Republican Speaker, Paul Ryan, allowed votes on gun safety legislation in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting.

A group of the Democrats ultimately occupied the floor through the night, only leaving on the afternoon of June 23. None of the measures demanded by the occupying members were given a vote.

===LGBTQ+ rights movement===

====1965 Philadelphia====

On April 25, 1965, the first of two sit-ins occurred at the popular Dewey&#x27;s Restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the earliest demonstrations advocating for the LGBT community in United States history. Three unidentified teenagers and approximately 150 supporters walked into the Dewey&#x27;s location at 219 South 17th Street, refusing to leave in the name of civil rights. This initial sit-in was in response to Dewey&#x27;s recently implemented discriminatory policy claiming it would not serve “homosexuals,” “masculine women,” “feminine men,” or “persons wearing nonconformist clothing.” Philadelphia police arrested the three teenagers, which led to further grass-roots action. Clark Polak, president of the local Janus Society, extended support to the protesters. Members of the Janus Society and other supporters circulated approximately 1500 flyers throughout the local area over the next five days.

On May 2, 1965, protesters staged a second sit-in at Dewey&#x27;s, although this time there were no arrests. Soon after the second sit-in, Dewey&#x27;s Restaurant reversed their discriminatory policy. The Dewey&#x27;s sit-ins helped continue the path towards equal rights for many LGBT people in the United States.

====1966 New York====

On April 21, 1966, gay activists of the Mattachine Society of New York (MSNY) conducted a &quot;Sip-In&quot; at Julius&#x27; Bar at 10th Street. This established the right of gay people to be served in licensed premises in New York. This action helped clear the way for gay premises with state liquor licenses.

=== Protests against the Israel-Hamas War ===
In April of 2024, student activists at Columbia University, with Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace began to conduct a sit-in on the university&#x27;s campus, demanding the university divest from Israel in response to the Israel-Hamas War. Columbia&#x27;s demonstration influenced protests and sit-ins at other universities both in and out of the United States. In response to the demonstrations, the White House spokesman stated, &quot;The president believes that forcibly taking over a building on campus is absolutely the wrong approach. That is not an example of peaceful protests.&quot;

=== Hungary ===

==== Eco-protest movement ====

In 2016, eco-protesters occupied the area of the Kertem in Budapest in protest against the building plan in Városliget.

=== Pakistan ===

==== 2014 anti-government protest ====

The Azadi March (Freedom March) led by Imran Khan of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and Inqilab March (Revolution March) led by Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri of Pakistan Awami Tehrik (PAT) are political, aiming at a probe of election rigging by Nawaz Sharif, as well as restoration of &quot;true democracy and social, political and economical reforms.&quot; The Azadi March started on August 14, 2014, and ended on December 17, 2014. It is considered to be the longest-lasting public sit-in in Pakistan&#x27;s history. Concepcion Picciotto&#x27;s sit-in was the more long-lasting sit-in, but on an individual level.

=== South Africa ===
During apartheid a number of sit-in protests against the country&#x27;s policy of racial segregation were staged in South African embassies in the United States. In post-apartheid South Africa two notable sit-ins were the occupation of South African universities to protest high tuition during the FeesMustFall protests and the Greenmarket Square refugee sit-in to protest for the resettlement of refugees to third countries due to xenophobia.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Welsh Language Society&#x27;s first public protest took place in February 1963 in Aberystwyth town centre where members pasted posters on the post office in an attempt to be arrested and go to trial. When it became apparent that they would not be arrested for the posters, they then moved to Pont Trefechan in Aberystwyth, where around seventy members and supporters held a sit-in blocking road traffic for half an hour.

In 1968 a sit-in was held at the news and television studio and the newsroom department of the BBC at Broadway, Cardiff, by members of the Welsh Language Society. The sit-in was calling for the BBC to use more Welsh.

=== Dharna ===
A dharna (Hindi: धरना; Urdu: دهرنا) is a non-violent sit-in protest, which may include a fast undertaken at the door of an offender, especially a debtor, in India as a means of obtaining compliance with a demand for justice, state response of criminal cases, or payment of a debt. The word originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;dharnam&quot;.

Dharna generally refers to fixing one&#x27;s mind on an object. It refers to whole-heartedly pledging toward an outcome or to inculcating a directed attitude. Dharna is consciously and diligently holding a point of view with the intent of achieving a goal.

Historically in India, it was a popular form of protest during the Indian independence movement and part of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s satyagraha form of civil disobedience and protest. There were also recorded instances of indigenous officials charged with recruitment quotas for the British Indian Army staging dharna as a recruitment tool in Punjab during World War I.

More recently, there are designated places for conducting Dharna, and a permission is required for it. Often, those practicing dharna break the permission leading to clashes with law enforcement. For example, the Shaheen Bagh protest was a sit-in peaceful protest, led by women, that began in response to the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in both houses of the Parliament of India on December 11, 2019, and the ensuing police intervention against students at Jamia Millia Islamia who were opposing the Amendment. Protesters agitated not only against the citizenship issues of the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), but also against police brutality, unemployment, poverty and for women&#x27;s safety. Mainly consisting of Muslim women, the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, since December 14, 2019, blocked a road in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for 101 days until March 24, 2020.

In Pakistan, the term was first used in 1958 by Abdul Qayyum Khan against the Prime Minister Feroze Khan&#x27;s administration to remove his President Iskander Mirza but its effective usage was made by Naeem Siddiqui proposed to use dharna politics for obtaining objectives and latter on Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Jamaat-e-Islami organised dharna in Pakistan in 1993, Fazl Ur Rehman, Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Safdar awan and other political and religious leaders are now attempting to use this strategy for their purposes.

<text>Fort Amsterdam was a fortification on the southern tip of Manhattan Island at the confluence of the Hudson and East rivers. The fort and the island were the center of trade and the administrative headquarters for the Dutch and then British/Colonial rule of the colony of New Netherland and thereafter the Province of New York. The fort was the nucleus of the settlement on the island and greater area, which was named New Amsterdam by the first Dutch settlers and eventually renamed New York by the English, and was central to much of New York&#x27;s early history.

Before the fort was constructed, it was the scene where the purchase of Manhattan Island occurred. In its subsequent history, the fort was known under various names such as &quot;Fort James&quot;, &quot;Fort Willem Hendrick&quot; and its anglicized &quot;Fort William Henry&quot;, &quot;Fort Anne&quot;, and &quot;Fort George&quot;. The fort changed hands eight times in various battles, the first episode involving Dutch governor Peter Stuyvesant, who surrendered the fort to Richard Nicolls of England in 1664. In the 18th century, the fort was at the center of the Stamp Act riots in New York when it was used to store shipments of stamped paper brought over from England, while serving as a safe haven for a number of stamp tax collectors. During the American Revolution, it was involved in the Battle of Brooklyn, when volleys were exchanged between the fort and British emplacements on Governor&#x27;s Island. After 165 years of service, involving a number of conflicts, the fort was finally torn down in 1790 after the American Revolution. After the fort&#x27;s demolition, the Government House was constructed on the site as a possible house for the United States President. The site is now occupied by the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which houses a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian; Bowling Green is nearby.

The construction of the fort marked the official founding date of New York City as recognized by its seal. In October 1683, what would become the first session of the New York legislature convened at the fort. Artillery guns outside the fort overlooking the harbor formed a battery that would later be the namesake of nearby Battery Park.

==History==
Starting with the founding and establishment of Fort Amsterdam in 1626, the fort, with its strategic location, overlooking the harbor and the mouth of the Hudson River, and as a lucrative trade center, played a significant role in the history that followed, all the way through the American Revolution, frequently changing hands between the Dutch, British and the Americans, with corresponding changes in the fort&#x27;s name.

===Establishment (1621–1660)===
Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, and the greater Dutch colony of New Netherland, was chartered by the Dutch West India Company in 1621. Before Fort Amsterdam was constructed, the Dutch settlers erected a large stone building on the future location of the fort that served as a meeting house. It was surrounded by some 30 makeshift dwellings made from timber and bark, as finished building materials were scarce. The structures were surrounded by red cedar palisades which served as a temporary fort. Manhattan Island at this time was covered by woods and brush, with several marshes about the shore line, and at night the sound of bears and other wildlife could be heard.

During the 17th century, no settlement was secure without a fortification for defense and refuge. Historian Maud Wilder Goodwin maintains the fort existed not so much out of concern for the Indians, but over other ambitious and enterprising Europeans. Historian John Andrew Doyle, however, maintains that the fort, with its earthen walls, was intended more for a defense against Indians and was almost useless as a defense against a professional army or navy at that time. In 1625, after much deliberation, it was decided that the best location for the fort would be at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, with the idea that it would be able to defend against any ship attempting to ascend the Hudson River. The fort was designed by Kryn Fredericksen, deputy and chief engineer of the New Netherland colony. Seventeenth-century Dutch forts all followed a similar design. Probably originally intended as a standard star-shaped fort, Fort Amsterdam had four sides with a bastion at each corner to better protect the walls. The original plan was to face the wall with stone, but this was never accomplished. The fort was built of hard-packed earth or rubble because earthworks would absorb the shock of cannon fire without collapsing, as stone walls might. Fredericksen had instructions to employ the help of nearby Indians in the fort&#x27;s construction. and were never taken into slavery.

Under the direction of the Dutch West India Company, the first appearance of negro slaves in New Amsterdam occurred in 1626, and were used helping in the construction of the fort, clearing land, farming and other such work. Attitudes about slavery varied among the colonists. Some of the slaves were converted to Christianity, and later some of them were given their freedom and grants of land.

The fort became the nucleus of the New Amsterdam settlement and its mission was protecting New Netherland colony operations in the Hudson River against attack from the English and the French. Although its main function was military, it also served as the center of trading activity. It contained a barracks, a church, a house for the West India Company director, and a warehouse for the storage of company goods.
The company appointed Cornelius Jacobsen Mey in 1624 as the first (provisional) director of the New Netherland colony, and who was stationed at New Amsterdam at the fort, serving until 1625.

Mey was soon replaced by Willem Verhulst, who arrived in January 1625. Verhulst served as the second director in 1625–1626. His term as director was marked with harsh and inconsistent punishment which infuriated the settlers. Realizing that food staples were in short supply in the newly developed settlement, the Dutch West India Company had shipped over some cattle, various live stock, seeds and farming equipment. The animals were initially kept on Governor&#x27;s Island but the grazing proved inadequate so they were moved to a more fertile location on upper Manhattan Island.

At the time, Manhattan was sparsely settled, as most of the Dutch West India Company operations were upriver along the Hudson in order to conduct trading operation for beaver pelts. According to John Romeyn Brodhead, while the fort was under construction, three Wechquaesgeek people traveled south from the area of present-day Westchester County to barter beaver skins. When they reached the &quot;Kolck&quot;, a pond near what is now Chinatown, they were set upon by three farmhands, and one of the two adults was killed. When the young boy who was with them grew older, he took his revenge for the murder of his uncle, which act served as a pretext for Kieft&#x27;s War.
At the direction of the Dutch West India Company, Verhulst was replaced as governor by the appointment of Peter Minuit, who arrived in 1625 and was appointed governor the following year. Minuit&#x27;s first official task was to arrange a meeting with the local Indian chiefs and negotiate the purchase of Manhattan Island before any settlement and the erection of the fort was to occur. The meeting took place on 26 May 1626, on the rocky southernmost shore of the island, where a trade deal was made, which was gladly accepted by the Indians. Minuit promptly organized the first government of the colony, and was granted authority over its executive, legislative, and judicial functions. He also appointed a sheriff and a five-member advisory council, chosen from the most reputable men at the colony. On 27 July 1626, the Dutch ship, &quot;Arms of Amsterdam&quot;, arrived at Manhattan, commanded by captain Adriaen Joris, who in 1623 accompanied Captain May, and was left in charge of the colony at Fort Orange. By September 26, the &quot;Arms of Amsterdam&quot;, with a cargo containing thousands of fur pelts, samples of grain, and a load of hardwood, departed for Holland with news of the purchase of Manhattan and the successful establishment of the new colony. By 1628, the population of Manhattan Island, including men, women and children, was 270.

In 1632, Minuit was replaced by Sebastiaen Jansen Krol who briefly served as director for a period of thirteen months. His replacement, Wouter van Twiller, a clerk in the Dutch West India Company, who arrived at the fort, still under construction, aboard the Dutch ship, &quot;De Zoutberg&quot; along with a company of one hundred and four soldiers from Holland, the first military force to arrive at the colony, with Van Twiller officially as its first military head Also aboard was the Reverend Everardus Bogardus.&lt; Relations with neighboring English colonies were uncertain, as they were competing with the Dutch over trade with the Indians, prompting Twiller to strengthen the fort with stone at several locations. The fort was completed in 1635. He had built within the fort a guard-house and a small house for the soldiers. Outside the fort he built New Netherland&#x27;s first church, complete with a house and stable, a bakery, a goat-stable, and a large storage shed to accommodate the ship builders.

Twiller, however, was generally disliked by the Dutch settlers. His financial management and accounting were poorly conducted and he neglected to report regularly to Amsterdam and had acquired a reputation for drunkenness. For this he was sharply and openly criticized by Borgardus from the pulpit and by the company&#x27;s treasurer, Lubbertus Van Dincklagen, for which Twiller dismissed him and sent him back to Holland. Van Dincklagen immediately drew up a formal complaint and submitted it to the States General. After confirmed reports of Twiller&#x27;s performance reached Holland it was decided that he be replaced as Director General of New Netherland. William Kieft was subsequently appointed as the new Director in September 1637, arriving at New Amsterdam in March of the following year, effectively replacing Twiller.
Conditions in and about the fort by 1638 had deteriorated and were not promising, with incompetent governmental management contributing to a decline in trade, and making the prospect of farming bleak. Director Kieft upon inspection of the fort and surrounding area, found the fort in a ruinous condition, with its dilapidated walls which allowed the fort to be entered without difficulty from various points. All the carriages that mounted the cannons had fallen into decay, while the farms in the area had become neglected.
About 1640 conflicts with the Indians, who were robbing and murdering settlers for their fur and other goods, had increased into war. The garrison at Fort Amsterdam in 1643 consisted of only fifty to sixty soldiers, who were lacking in discipline and were often disorderly. The situation prompted Kieft to establish a code of military law for members of the garrison while on duty, which included stiff fines for blasphemy, slandering, intoxication or failure to appear for duty. The code was read aloud by a corporal every time the soldiers appeared for duty. After four years of fighting with the Indians a peace was finally reestablished in 1645. Under Kieft, however, public revenues overall were not forthcoming, smuggling was frequent and severely compromising legitimate trade, discontent and disorder was prevalent throughout the community, while protests and appeals for reform had no effect in getting Kieft and his subordinates to address the situation effectively. Subsequently, when Peter Stuyvesant arrived at Fort Amsterdam in 1647 he was joyfully received. He was accompanied by Reverend Johannes Backerus, who was to replace Bogardus.

Johannes Megapolensis, a minister of the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, arrived at Fort Amsterdam from Rensselaerswyck Manor in 1664 after serving there for six years. His arrival at Fort Amsterdam was subsequent to his assisting French missionary, Isaac Jogues, in his escape from the Mohawks. Jogues became the first Catholic priest to set foot on Manhattan Island. While at the fort, Jogues observed and wrote an account of the condition of the fort, its repairs, and the activity on Manhattan, noting the various religions and languages spoken. As the population of Manhattan was increasing the West India Company sent out another minister, Domine Samuel Drisius, to assist Megapolensis who had served the Dutch congregation in England and could preach in Dutch, English and French. At the insistence of Stuyvesant, and with children in need of baptism and religious instruction, Megapolensis was persuaded to remain in Manhattan.

As the population of the colony grew, there was a corresponding increase in the number of soldiers, and by 1650 the number of soldiers in New Netherland was roughly 250. By 1660, the population is estimated to have been around five-hundred, and by 1664 had grown to fifteen-hundred. That same year, Jacques Cortelyou was commissioned to conduct a survey and make a second map of New Amsterdam, which now had approximately three-hundred and fifty dwellings.
===English rule (1664–1673)===
On 29 August 1664, four English warships under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls, carrying 450 well-trained soldiers and bearing 120 heavy guns, arrived in New Amsterdam&#x27;s harbor. Fort Amsterdam had a garrison of 250 men with only 24 pieces of artillery. Supplies were limited and food was in short supply, precluding any chance of enduring a prolonged siege. After surrounding the fort with ships and landed soldiers Nicolls demanded the Dutch surrender of the colony and Fort Amsterdam, which at the time was almost useless as a defense against a professional army and navy. Although Peter Stuyvesant, the Director of New Netherland, with his guns in place and ready to fire, was prepared to fight, prominent city residents, including Stuyvesant&#x27;s son Balthazar, Hendrick Kip and Reverend Megapolensis, all of whom signed a formal Remonstrance, persuaded Stuyvesant to stand down in the face of overwhelming odds. On September 8, Stuyvesant raised the white flag of surrender and subsequently, after much protest and deliberation, he signed the colony over without any blood-shed during the Second Anglo–Dutch War. At the behest of the James II, Duke of York, Nicoll&#x27;s was appointed governor whose objective was to oversee the occupation of the Dutch colony and establish government.

As the first governor of the province of New York, Nicoll&#x27;s was greeted cordially by the Dutch and civic authorities whom he allowed to keep their offices and other stations. Under the previous rule of the West India Company, and their appointed governors, the rulership was autocratic; it denied basic rights of the people that were enjoyed in Holland, the motherland, while it favored the aristocratic class with grants of land and other special favors. As a result, the new English government was well received by most of the citizens, who were well rooted in Dutch and England culture and ideology, countries with strong democratic principles, derived from the &quot;Great Privilege&quot; and the &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, both documents of Catholic origin. The official capitulation of New Amsterdam to the English occurred on September 6, I664.

Nichols&#x27; first official act was to rename the city from New Amsterdam to New York, in recognition of James&#x27;s title as Duke of York, while the fort was renamed Fort James, in honor of James II of England. Designed primarily as a defense against Indians the fort was considered almost useless for guarding the entry to the Hudson River or repelling a military siege, and subsequently a battery was erected at the southernmost shore of the island and fitted out with artillery. In 1668 Nicolls resigned the governorship and returned to England, where he resumed his service to the Duke of York. He was replaced as governor by Francis Lovelace on 28 August 1668.

===Dutch rule (1673–1674)===

Beginning in the spring of 1672, the Third Anglo-Dutch War broke out. The following year, two Dutch fleets, commanded by Admiral Cornelis Evertsen aboard the flagship &quot;Swaenenburgh&quot;, and Commodore Jacob Binckes, had combined their fleets and were plundering English shipping in the Caribbean and Chesapeake Bay, before they arrived at Fort James on 7 August 1673, which was Evertsen&#x27;s ultimate objective before he departed Holland which at the time was almost defenseless in the face of such a force. The fleet, consisting of twenty-three ships, carrying 1,600 men, was alarming to acting captain Sheriff John Manning, who was left in command while Lovelace was away visiting Governor Winthrop at Hartford. The fort at this time only had a garrison of no more than 80 men with only 30-36 guns mounted along its walls. Manning tried in vain to summon reinforcements from nearby towns and made attempts to forestall the eminent recapture of Fort James.

Before the arrival of the Dutch fleet, the Dutch burghers and 400 Dutch colonists had grown impatient and resentful with English rulership as their appeals for rights and liberties were constantly ignored, and conveyed this sentiment to the Dutch upon their arrival. Manning sent an envoy of three men from the fort to Admiral Evertsen&#x27;s ship with a message asking why the Dutch had arrived &quot;in such a hostile manner&quot;. Evertsen replied that they had come to take back what he felt was rightfully theirs. The envoy then insisted that they see Evertsen&#x27;s commission, where he replied that it was stuck in the barrel of his cannon, and that the English would see it soon enough if they did not surrender the fort. Subsequently, the next day the Dutch fleet exchanged broadsides with the fort for about four hours, while Anthony Colve, commander of Marines, landed 600 men on the west side of Manhattan Island and on 30 July 1673, forced the English garrison into surrendering the fort. On August 2, with New Amsterdam once again under Dutch rule, the Council of War appointed Colve as military governor-general of the province and Fort Orange, who in turn appointed Cornelius Steenwyk as Councillor of State, with executive privileges.

In 1674, the fort and New Orange were turned back over to the English in the Treaty of Westminster (1674) which included a provision that the colony of New Netherland be returned to England, which ended the war (the Dutch got Suriname). The fort was officially renamed Fort Willem Hendrick in honor of William III of England, who was Stadtholder and Prince of Orange, and changed the name from New Orange back to New York.

===English rule (1674–1689)===
After the treaty was secured, the English once again named the area &quot;New York&quot; and returned the Fort James name. Edmund Andros was appointed governor and served from 9 February 1674, to 18 April 1683. On 10 November 1674, Andros received the surrender of the town, while their religious and other rights and property were not lost or compromised.

In September 1682, James, Lord Proprietor of the Province of New York, appointed Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, an Irishman and staunch Catholic, who had arrived at New York on 25 August 1863, as Vice-admiral in the Navy and provincial governor (1683–1688) to replace Edmund Andros. Dongan organized the first representative assembly of New York Province at Fort James, on 14 October 1683.

Dongan had served in the French army for many years, which made him familiar with French customs and diplomacy. His service in the Low Countries had given him a first-hand knowledge of the Dutch language. Upon his arrival, Dongan was not very impressed with New York, which at the time was a small town, and likewise had the same regard for the fort, which after he inspected it, said its walls could be battered down by artillery in an hour. On the face of the gate to the fort was a faded emblem of the Coat of Arms of the Duke of York. Here, Dongan turned and bowed to the cheering crowd and entered the fort. He was greeted by Captain Anthony Brockholls, the acting governor of the Province of New York, and commander of the fort, who was accompanied by a company of regular infantry. Brockholls exclaimed to Dongan that he had great difficulty maintaining order, and that he was relieved over his arrival. At the time of his appointment, the province was bankrupt and in a state of rebellion. Dongan was able to restore order and stability. He was also the first to establish batteries of cannon to the south of the fort.

===Colonist rule (1689–1691)===
In 1689, following the Glorious Revolution (English Revolution of 1688), in which William and Mary acceded to the throne, German-born colonist Jacob Leisler seized Fort James in what was called Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion, replacing deposed Francis Nicholson who had fled New York City. Leisler arrived at New Amsterdam from England in 1660, a penniless soldier of the East India Company. He started out in the trade business and soon married a rich merchant&#x27;s widow, and by 1689 he achieved prosperity and respectability. As acting governor of New York, he represented the common people against a group of wealthy leaders represented by Pieter Stuyvesant and others and enacted a government of direct popular representation as well as bringing reform to the many governmental provisions that previously existed. The people appealed to Stuyvesant to capitulate and accept the generous offers Leisler was providing, as they had already endured corruption, abuse, and other hardships under the previous rulership. At the direction of governor Henry Sloughter, Leisler and ten others were eventually arrested and imprisoned at the fort. After a long and involved trial, Leissler, along with Jacob Milborne, were found guilty of treason and executed on 16 May 1691.

===British rule (1691–1775)===

Leisler&#x27;s rule ended in 1691, when British sovereign William&#x27;s new governor (appointed in 1690) finally reached New York. The fort had earlier been named for Willem when he was head of the Dutch government. He became the sovereign of the English government by the overthrow of James in the Glorious Revolution. The fort was renamed Fort William Henry in honor of the new Protestant king.

Governor Hunter was replaced by William Burnet who arrived at Manhattan on 16 September 1720. Rather than calling for elections for a new assembly, as was customary, Burnet summoned the standing provincial assembly, with whom he found favor, to meet at Fort George, where it voted for revenues to sustain the government for the following five years. The assembly also prohibited any trading of Indian goods with the French, which greatly compromised the business interests of New York&#x27;s merchants.

In 1756, John Campbell, Earl of Loudoun, was appointed commander of all English forces in North America Prompted by the loss of Fort Oswego during the French and Indian War, he sent one thousand regulars to strategically located New York City for winter quarters. The old barracks in Fort George were prepared for them, while the fort underwent repairs and major improvements to its structure. To aid in the defense of the harbor, a good number of heavy cannon were also added to the battery and other strategic locations near the fort.

===Prelude to the revolution===
Fort George became the target of American riots following Parliament&#x27;s passage of the Stamp Act on 4 March 1765. The first shipment of stamps for New York and Connecticut arrived at New York on 23 October 1765. The ships were confronted by some 2000 angry colonists. Subsequently, the stamps had to be quietly unloaded in the middle of the night and brought into Fort George, which at the time had a garrison of only 200 regulars. On October 31, the day before the Stamp Act was to be enforced, thousands of colonists took to the streets. As a precaution, British authorities beforehand had the guns at the battery spiked along with any not inside the fort, making them inoperable. The protests, agitation and violence over the Stamp Act reached a climax from November 1–3, as a result of the arrival of the stamps brought to and held at Fort George.

Cadwallader Colden, the acting governor of the Province of New York from 1763 to 1765, was residing at the fort at the time, but admitted that he had no real authority outside its gates. On 1 November 1765, the garrison was put on alert and manned the walls of the fort, and was soon greeted by the approaching colonists. A courier emerged from the crowd and approached the gate, bearing a message for Cadwallader, which he handed to the sentry. Addressed to Cadwallader specifically, its message was the culmination of over a year&#x27;s frustration and anger over the proposed imposition of the Stamp Act, which ultimately gave Cadwallader, now 77 years of age, an ultimatum, threatening in pointed language that he not participate in the enforcement of the Stamp Act. Reports of violent riots occurring in Newport, Boston, and elsewhere continued to reach Cadwallader&#x27;s desk. Jared Ingersoll, stamp agent from Connecticut, and William Franklin, Governor of New Jersey, under extreme pressure not to enforce the Stamp Act had their supplies of stamped paper transported to Fort George for safe keeping.

During the early morning hours of November 2, engineers and workers worked earnestly to strengthen the fort. Artillery office Major Thomas James was in command of the fort, who later testified before Parliament that he could have killed more than 900 of the rioters, but added that had he done so, the colonists could in little time have amassed 50,000 fighting men from New York alone, and that there would have been no chance in holding the fort. General Gage later said that had the colonists been fired on, the revolution would have begun that year. Colden, concerned that Fort George had an inadequate garrison, requested reinforcements, which General Gage provided, while James brought new cannons to the fort. The fort also provided a safe haven for several stamp masters, including Zachariah Hood from Maryland, who, at the invitation of Colden, had fled to the fort to escape the wrath of the Sons of Liberty and other angry colonists.

In the face of growing numbers of angry colonists, General Gage and the Governor&#x27;s Council, wanting to spare New York&#x27;s Loyalist families from what seemed like imminent ruin, insisted that Colden strike a compromise and surrender the stamped paper. After initially delaying, Colden, now acting as an official stamp distributor, knowing he could not stand alone on matters, ultimately convinced the Common Council to pay for all surrendered and destroyed stamps. The subsequent surrender of the stamps brought calm to the city, while New York&#x27;s colonial newspapers called for peace. After calm returned to the city Colden&#x27;s political adversaries blamed him for the mishap, and ultimately had his governorship replaced by Sir Henry Moore. In the effort to maintain peace and restore order to the city, Moore had met with the influential Isaac Sears, a leader of the Sons of Liberty, and others, and shortly thereafter opened the gates of the fort and invited everyone in.

===Colonist rule (1775–1776)===

In the American Revolution, the colonists under George Washington seized the fort in 1775, before the colonies formally seceded from the British Empire. During the Battle of Long Island, guns from the fort engaged British frigates starting on 12 July 1776. On July 12, the British ships HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; and HMS&quot; Rose&quot;, with a few smaller vessels in attendance, sailed from Staten Island and began moving into the mouth of the Hudson River, prompting alarm guns to sound in New York. The cannons from batteries at Red Hook and Governors Island commenced firing at the small British fleet. Artillery fire also commenced from Fort George, under the command of New York artillery captain Alexander Hamilton, who at the time was nineteen, but had little effect. Fearing that the British capture of the fort was eminent, Hamilton and his artillery teams hauled off more than ten cannons, shortly before a barge from HMS &quot;Asia&quot; approached and fired on the fort and its vicinity.

In September 1776, under the command of Henry Clinton the British made a Landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay, and soon recaptured Fort George, along with lower Manhattan, forcing General Washington and his army to retreat north and eventually into New Jersey, at Valley Forge where they would remain for most of the following winter. The British soon occupied the entire city and ruled New York from the fort throughout the war.

===British rule (1776–1783)===

The British occupied the city and ruled New York from Fort George throughout the remainder of the war. Having been subjected to a large fire in 1776, the city experienced another great fire in 1778, with the subsequent destruction of many dwellings, and along with the British presence, the city became very crowded with overall poor living conditions for many of its inhabitants. After the British occupation of Manhattan Island was completed, the fort was not involved in any further military engagements for the remainder of the war.

===American rule (1783–1790)===
After peace was established with Britain in 1783, Washington received word that the British would soon evacuate New York. As Washington and his army marched south on Manhattan Island, Washington noted the devastation, lack of trees, shrubs, and the many buildings that were left in ruins. Washington&#x27;s advance came to a halt at the barrier enclosing the inner city and Fort George. A volley of cannon signaled that the British had departed New York. While waiting for the American army to secure the island, Washington received word that the British had sabotaged the flag pole inside Fort George, by removing its ropes, knocking off its the cleats and by greasing the pole, all as measures taken to hinder the Americans from raising their flag at the fort. After a brief reception at Cape&#x27;s Tavern, Washington, Governor Clinton and the cavalcade entered the fort. After an extended effort the flagpole was repaired and its missing parts replaced, after which John Van Arsdale ascended the pole and attached the American flag, on Evacuation Day, 25 November 1783, after the British finally pulled out.

In 1788, the government ordered the razing of Fort George (as it was then known). Its materials were used as landfill to add to the shore and expand the Battery. The fort was torn down in 1790, and the Government House, intended as the presidential residence, was built on the site.

The need for new fortifications soon became apparent, especially as tensions started rising again with France and Great Britain. In 1798, guns were placed in temporary fortifications on the Battery. Eventually a new fort, Castle Clinton, was built on Lower Manhattan to the southwest, shortly before the outbreak of the War of 1812 with Britain.

The site of Fort James was redeveloped for the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. Prior to landfilling and the creation of Battery Park, it was located at the shoreline of the Hudson River but is now a few blocks away.

<text>Idaho Transfer is a 1973 science fiction film directed by Peter Fonda. It stars Kelley Bohanon, Kevin Hearst, Dale Hopkins, and Keith Carradine.

It is the only film Fonda directed in which he did not appear.

==Plot summary==
Teenager Karen Braden (Kelley Bohanon) is a troubled mental hospital outpatient who is taken by her father George and sister Isa to a government facility near the Craters of the Moon lava fields in Idaho. The project there was commissioned to develop matter transference, but made a different discovery: time travel. They also discovered that a mysterious ecological catastrophe will soon wipe out civilization.

The time travel process has negative health effects, though. Adults &quot;not much older than 20&quot; are unable to survive for long, as their kidneys hemorrhage shortly after the experience. So the scientists decide to only send young people 56 years into the future so they can build a new civilization.

After the government takes over the project, the transfer machines are turned off, trapping a large number of project members in the future. Now trapped, they begin exploring the future world.
A survivor from the project is picked up by a family dressed in futuristic clothing. She is placed alive in the trunk of their car. The small girl in the back seat asks what will happen when they run out of them (people from the past),
&quot;Will we have to use each other, then?&quot;

==Cast==
* Kelley Bohanon as Karen Braden
* Kevin Hearst as Ronald
* Caroline Hildebrand as Isa Braden
* Keith Carradine as Arthur
* Ted D&#x27;Arms as George Braden
* Judy Motulsky as Judy (credited as Judy Motolsky)
* Dale Hopkins as Leslie
* Fred Seagraves as Dr. Lewis
* Joe Newman as Cleve
* Susan Kelly as Nurse Nora
* Meridith Hull as Jennifer
* Roy B. Ayers as Elgin (credited as Roy Ayers)
* Kim Casper as Anne
* Debbie Scott as Joanna
* Devin Burke as Michael
* Earl Crabb as Evans

==Production==
The film was produced by Peter Fonda&#x27;s Pando Company, in association with
Marrianne Santas; it was copyrighted to Kathleen Film Production Company in 1973.

The $500,000 film was self-financed by Fonda and starred mostly non-professional actors. Principal shooting took place in Arco, Idaho, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, and Bruneau Sand Dunes State Park. Castmember Earl Crabb also cites Bellevue, Washington as a location. The film was shot after Fonda had finished directing &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971) and August 1971.

The end credits conclude with the Latin phrase &quot;Esto Perpetua&quot;. Translated, it means &quot;Let it be perpetual&quot; or &quot;It is forever&quot;; appropriate for a time travel film, it is also the motto of the state of Idaho. Fonda either neglected, or did not wish to renew his rights on this film, and according to several sources, the movie passed into the Public Domain.

Fonda also produced a documentary about the making of the film.

==Reception==
Fonda said &quot;The film was in release for only three weeks when the distributor (Cinemation) went bankrupt. The banks had the film for years. Luckily, I was able to retain the rights.&quot;

Reception of &quot;Idaho Transfer&quot; has been mixed. &quot;Time&quot; described it as a &quot;very deliberate and closely controlled film graced with a slow, severe beauty that makes its quiet edge of panic all the more chilling&quot;, whereas Jay Robert Nash in &quot;The Motion Picture Guide&quot; declares it a &quot;useless piece of drivel about an obnoxious group of teens&quot;.

<doc id="444064" wikidata="Q161070" url="?curid=444064" title="Araucaria heterophylla">
<text>Araucaria heterophylla (synonym A. excelsa) is a species of conifer. As its vernacular name Norfolk Island pine (or Norfolk pine) implies, the tree is endemic to Norfolk Island, an external territory of Australia located in the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is not a true pine, which belong to the genus &quot;Pinus&quot; in the family Pinaceae, but instead is a member of the genus &quot;Araucaria&quot; in the family Araucariaceae, which also contains the hoop pine. Members of &quot;Araucaria&quot; occur across the South Pacific, especially concentrated in New Caledonia (about due north of Norfolk Island), where 13 closely related species of similar appearance are found. It is sometimes called a star pine, Polynesian pine, triangle tree or living Christmas tree, due to its symmetrical shape as a sapling.

==History==
The first European known to have sighted Norfolk Island was Captain James Cook. In 1774, on his second voyage to the South Pacific in HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, Cook noted the presence of large forests of tall, straight trees that appeared to be suitable for use as masts and yards for sailing ships. However, when the island was occupied in 1788 by convicts transported from Britain, it was found that Norfolk Island pine trees were not resilient enough for such use and the idea was abandoned.

In the late 1950s, a trial shipment of Norfolk pine logs was sent to plywood manufacturers in Sydney, New South Wales, with the hope of developing a timber export industry on Norfolk Island. Although the plywood companies reported excellent results, the industry was deemed not sustainable by the Norfolk Island Advisory Council, which decided to reserve timber production for local use. The timber is good for woodturning and, together with the similar Cook pine, is extensively used by Hawaiian artisans.

==Description==
The tree is slow growing and can reach a height of , with straight vertical trunks and symmetrical branches, even in the face of incessant onshore winds that can contort most other species. From the straight trunk, it emits five almost horizontal or slightly oblique branches, forming floors; the plane of each floor is a perfect pentagon. If kept indoors, the tree remains smaller. The grey-brown bark falls off in fine scales. The branchlets are four to seven in regular whorls.

The young leaves are soft and awl-shaped, long, about thick at the base on young trees, and incurved, long and variably broad on older trees. The thickest, scale-like leaves on coning branches are in the upper crown. The cones are squat globose, long and diameter, and take about 18 months to mature. They disintegrate at maturity to release the nut-like edible seeds. The seeds have a length of and a diameter of about with wide wings. There are four cotyledons present. It is a dioecious tree (male and female flowers in different plants), although it can also be monoecious.

The scientific name &quot;heterophylla&quot; (&#x27;different leaves&#x27;) derives from the variation in the leaves between young and adult plants.

==Cultivation==

The distinctive appearance of this tree, with its widely spaced branches and symmetrical, triangular outline, has made it a popular cultivated species, either as a single tree or in avenues. When the tree reaches maturity, the shape may become less symmetrical. Despite the endemic implication of the species name &quot;Norfolk Island pine&quot;, the species is widely planted as an ornamental tree for its exotic, pleasing appearance and fairly broad climatic adaptability, and now occurs throughout the world in regions with suitable Mediterranean and humid subtropical climate. It grows well in deep sand, as long as it receives reliable water when young. This, and its tolerance of salt and wind, make it ideal for coastal situations. Indoors, the plant needs a bright location with at least 40% but preferably above 60% humidity for good growth. Indoor trees must not be exposed to the scorching sun or dry air from a radiator; the temperature should ideally not exceed . In winter, the plant needs a bright room that should be around .

Many of the &quot;Norfolk Island pines&quot; that grow in Hawaii, including their descendants used as potted ornamentals on the U.S. mainland, are actually the closely related Cook pines native to New Caledonia, the two species having been confused when introduced.

===Uses===
Young trees are often grown as houseplants in areas where the winters are too cold for them to grow outside (they will not, for example, survive outdoors in most of North America or Europe), and are sometimes used as Christmas trees. It will not survive in areas subject to prolonged cold. However, there are a few specimens growing outdoors in the subtropical gardens of Tresco Abbey Gardens on the Isles of Scilly, in the United Kingdom. What is probably the most northerly specimen growing outdoors is a young tree on Valentia Island on the southwest coast of Ireland. The tendency for potted saplings to develop a barren appearance can be helped by growing them in clumps. In northern climates they can be left outdoors during summer or placed under growing lights to promote fuller growth.

When planted outside, the trees should be provided with adequate space, as they can grow to a large size. The trees are widely planted in coastal Southern California, where they can grow to well over . The trees are commonly confused with &quot;Araucaria columnaris.&quot;

&quot;Araucaria heterophylla&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Conservation and weediness===
The species survival is not threatened at all by the houseplant trade, as it is grown commercially for potted plants. However, the native, natural stands of &quot;A. heterophylla&quot; were always restricted and have been much reduced since Capt. Cook&#x27;s time. Farming, poor land management and the introduction of invasive species have reduced its population on the original three islands considerably. The main remaining stands are now within Norfolk Island National Park and are therefore under some protection. The IUCN classifies the species as vulnerable. Seedlings of this species are starting to turn up under native coastal forest in the North Island of New Zealand, adding this species to the already numerous species of &quot;Wilding Pines&quot; that are a huge issue in that country.

<text>Basque music refers to the music made in the Basque Country, reflecting traits related to its society/tradition, and devised by people from that territory. While traditionally more closely associated to rural based and Basque language music, the growing diversification of its production during the last decades has tipped the scale in favour of a broad definition.

==Traditional music==

Basque traditional music is a product of the region&#x27;s historic development and strategic geographical position on the Atlantic arch at a crossroads between mountains (Cantabrian mountain range, Pyrenees) and plains (Ebro basin), ocean and inland, European continent and Iberian Peninsula. Its culture and music has thus been exposed to a wide number of influences throughout history, ranging from British and northern European to Mediterranean to Arabic. For example, traditional overseas commerce with England, or international pilgrimage on the Way of St James added greatly to leave an imprint in both instruments and tunes.

===Instruments===
Folk instruments widespread in Europe ceased to be used in some places at some point of history and only remained in specific areas, where they took hold and adopted features and a character associated with the region, e.g. the three-hole pipe or tabor pipe in widespread use in Europe ultimately resulted in two specific instruments in the Basque Country: the txistu and the xirula. Accordingly, different instruments may have evolved out of one, such as Navarrese dulzaina and Souletin &quot;txanbela&quot;, with slight differences between them.

Most instruments adopted in rural and folk circles do not go back more than six centuries, with some having been introduced as late as the 19th century, such as the trikitixa, or the txistu, shaped in its present-day form during that period, despite the fact that it resulted from a long evolution. Most Basque instruments originated outside the Basque Country and became popular in the territory at some stage, but the txalaparta is not one of them.

Some traditional Basque instruments are the following:
*Alboka, a difficult double clarinet played in a circular breathing technique similar to that used for the Sardinian launeddas.
*Txalaparta, a wooden xylophone-like percussion instrument for two players.
*Kirikoketa, a wooden percussion device akin to the txalaparta associated with the cider making process.
*Toberak, a percussion instrument made of horizontal metal bars.
*Txistu, a local pipe.
*Drum, called &quot;danbolin&quot;, and usually accompanying the txistu.
*Atabal, a double sided, portable flat drum played together with aerophones.
*Xirula, a three-hole flute, shorter and more high-pitched than txistu.
*Ttun-ttun, a vertical stringed drum played usually together with the xirula.
*Trikitixa or &quot;eskusoinua&quot;, a lively diatonic button accordion.
*Tambourine, usually played together with the trikitixa.
*Dulzaina, a Navarre-based pipe belonging to the shawm family.
*Blowing horn, an instrument made of ox horn.

===Singing tradition===

====A collective soul====

The Basque people are especially given to singing. Basque language has stuck to the oral tradition stronger than Romance languages, and its literature was first recorded in writing in the 16th century. There are ballads dating from the 15th century that have been passed from parents to children by word of mouth, e.g. &quot;Ozaze Jaurgainian&quot; from Soule, which relates events six centuries ago and has come down to us in different versions (the best known was popularized by Benito Lertxundi), or &quot;Alostorrea&quot;, from Biscay. These ballads were crafted and spread by minstrels or bertsolaris, were kept in popular memory, and were transmitted in the so-called &quot;kopla zaharrak&quot;, sets of poems with a characteristic rhythmic pattern that could be sung: this is similar to traditional practices elsewhere in Europe. So, for example, the first work of literature in Basque &quot;Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ&quot; (1545) by Bernard Etxepare shows long verses that, while deceptively fashioned in metres resembling those used in Romance poetry, follow an internal rhythmic pattern similar to a &quot;kopla&quot;, so they can be popularly sung. Even today, it is not unusual to see groups of people marching around a town at some local festival singing and asking the neighbours for a food, drink or money donation, while the most famous celebrations following this pattern across the whole Basque Country may be those taking place on Christmas Eve (Olentzero) and the Saint Agatha&#x27;s Eve, with singers dressing up in traditional costumes.

It follows that traditional singing is closely related to bertsolaris, improvising bards, who even nowadays hold an important status in Basque culture. They voice the people&#x27;s concerns by means of a formal tradition coming from the people (tunes, linguistic devices), and act as their spokespersons. A considerable corpus of traditional songs was gathered by Resurrección María de Azkue and Aita Donostia, two religious scholars interested in Basque folk culture, at the turn of the 20th century; and also later on, in &quot;Cancionero popular vasco&quot; (1918) and &quot;Euskal Eres-Sorta. Cancionero Vasco&quot; (1922), to mention but a few works.

In the present day, the band Hiru Truku (comprising the celebrated musicians Joseba Tapia, Ruper Ordorika and Bixente Martinez) has chosen several ancient songs from all over the Basque Country, updated the music brilliantly and released them in a number of albums. Another current long-standing and renowned group who elaborate on traditional songs is Oskorri: The band set about singing traditional songs in public performances previously handing out to the audience a repertoire bill including the lyrics and encouraging them to sing along. The band has launched a couple of albums of this kind so far and performed on various tours to public acclaim, becoming especially popular with middle-aged parents.

A key figure bridging the old singing tradition of Soule and the folk song revival of the 20th century is Pierre Bordazaharre (1907–1979), Etxahun Iruri. A xirula player and singer, he collected old songs and fashioned new ones, which eventually caught on and spread, take for instance, &quot;Agur Xiberoa&quot;. He also contributed to new pastoral plays in the tradition of Soule, reshaping the pastoral and adding new topics.

There is also a tradition of choral music all over the Basque Country. Church choirs were set up in some towns to meet the religious musical needs. Yet at the turn of the 20th century some ensembles became established outside the ecclesiastical context, e.g. the Sociedad Coral de Bilbao (founded in 1886), Orfeón Donostiarra (founded in 1897) or the Coral Santa Cecilia from Donostia (founded in 1928). Later on, other ensembles were formed, such as Oldarra Abesbatza from Biarritz (founded in 1947), made up of men and sometimes putting on performances as an &quot;ochote&quot; (see below), or the reputed Coral Andra Mari from Errenteria, established in 1966, featuring Basque folk music and Aita Donostia&#x27;s several scores. Nowadays many minor choral ensembles, largely offering the Basque folk repertoire, dot the Basque territory. In Bayonne and Donostia a cheerful informal initiative has grown popular with amateurs in the late noughties, who meet once a month and go bar hopping around the streets of the respective Old Quarters while singing traditional songs.

Another Basque choral phenomenon is represented by the so-called &quot;ochotes&quot;, which became popular in the 1930s in the Bilbao region: Eight men with deep voices, with a marked taste for local and folk subjects, singing in Spanish and Basque. This may stem from summer ecclesiastic seminaries and they thrived on the warm atmosphere of the bars after the work shift was over. Eventually a branch of this genre evolved out into &quot;bilbainadas&quot; (up to the 1960s, nowadays much in decay).

====Classical soloists====
Awash in the same singing tradition, but shifting towards the refined European trends prevailing in the higher levels of society, certain Basques became renowned as individual singers. Some soloists worth highlighting include:
*Pierre-Jean Garat (1764–1823): An early soloist thriving on the heat of Labourd&#x27;s Enlightenment.
*Julián Gayarre (1844–1890): A Navarrese tenor from Roncal with an outstanding tenor voice.

==Composers==
The Basque Country has been home to various notable composers, writing mainly in the 20th century. Much in step with the artistic trends of the first half of the century (painting...), some of them developed a liking for Basque customs, manners and subjects.
* Juan de Anchieta (1462–1523): Composer of the Renaissance hailing from the area of Azpeitia.
* Santiago de Herdoiza (Durango, )
* Juan Crisostomo Arriaga (Bilbao, 1806 – Paris, 1826)
* Jose Maria Usandizaga (Donostia/San Sebastian, 1887–1915): He is considered along with J. Guridi the father of Basque opera. He drew up orchestral and chamber pieces, like the celebrated &quot;Cuarteto de cuerda en Sol, Op. 31&quot;, shifting to elaborate zarzuela as well as opera works at the end of his life (&quot;Mendi-Mendiyan&quot;, 1910: &quot;Las Golondrinas&quot;, 1914). He had his increasingly successful career cut short by an early death.
* Jesús Guridi (Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1881 – Madrid, 1961): Himself a friend of Usandizaga, whom he met in Paris while attending the Schola Cantorum, he was appointed manager of Bilbao&#x27;s &quot;Sociedad Coral&quot; choir in 1912. Influenced by Wagner and musicians of the Late Romanticism, he found inspiration and phrases for his compositions in Basque folklore. His rich musical education enabled him to deal with different types of music, e.g. zarzuela, opera, compositions for choir as well as religious pieces for organ. Some acclaimed works include &quot;El caserío&quot; (1926), &quot;Diez melodías vascas&quot; (1940), &quot;La meiga&quot; (1929), &quot;Seis canciones castellanas&quot; (1939) and &quot;Sinfonía pirenaica&quot; (1945).
* Nemesio Otaño (Azkoitia, 1880 – San Sebastian, 1956 ): Composer, organist and musicologist. One of the most important figures in 20th century Spanish music history. Director of the Royal Conservatory of Madrid between 1939 and 1956. Among his most known works is &#x27;Saint Ignatius March&#x27; (&#x27;Marcha de San Ignacio&#x27;), the patron saint of Biscay and Gipuzkoa. In 1894, he studied in the &quot;Colegio Preceptoría&quot; of Baliarrain, in which he composed two of his first litanies and a &quot;zortziko&quot; for piano; he was then only fourteen years old, but already played the organ in the school parish. In 1896 he joined the Society of Jesus and began his ecclesiastical studies along with the music classes. In 1911, he founded the Schola Cantorum at Comillas: His performances in plainsong and polyphony were highly influential. His works range from popular sacred songs (e.g. Estrella hermosa, Anima Christi, Baldako) to large-scale choral pieces.
* Pablo Sorozábal (Donostia/San Sebastian, 1897 – Madrid, 1988)
* Maurice Ravel (Ziburu, 1875 – Paris, 1937): Basque French composer and arranger
* Carmelo Bernaola (Otxandio, 1929 – Madrid, 2002)
* Francisco Escudero (Donostia/San Sebastian, 1912–2002), composer of Zigor and Gernika), operas with Basque librettos
* Sebastian Iradier (Lanciego, 1809 – Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1865)
* Javier Bello-Portu (Tolosa, 1920 – San Sebastian, 2004)

==Basque musical revival==

===Postwar desolation and first sprouts===
In the wake of the Civil War (1936–1937 in the Basque territory), headway made in the Basque culture in the pre-war period ground to a halt: Fear grew amidst harsh repression, famine became an overriding concern, and former cultural figures died or ran for their lives to exile. As an individual singing figure of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Luis Mariano and his powerful tenor voice should be highlighted. Born in Irun and moving in his 20s to Bordeaux, he jumped onto the Spanish and international scene with light-hearted songs in Spanish and French (and, occasionally, in Basque).

After the hardest postwar years, the younger generation set about putting together duos and small musical groups in Gipuzkoa and Biscay, who gradually began singing original tunes in Basque. Notable bands from the 1960s include Urretxindorrak, Enarak, Soroak and Estitxu (female singer born to fleeing parents near Bayonne). These new bands sought to take advantage of the regime&#x27;s increasing liberalization, despite the fact that major obstacles that still hindered cultural activity associated with anything Basque. Cultural and political awareness, social rebelliousness and an urge for action emerged in the following generations, resulting in a new left-leaning Basque nationalist movement.


===Music as identity assertion===
Some people from the southern Basque Country fled the territory to the French Northern Basque Country and seeking shelter. They left their imprint in the traditional Basque society of the Northern Basque Country, contributing to the rise of cultural and political awareness. In this category falls Mixel Labeguerie, who worked and lived in Kanbo, its mayor for more than a decade (1965–1980), Councillor General of the department and a founder of Basque nationalist movement Embata (he walked out later). He had a musical education, soaked up the new European musical trends, e.g. Brassens, folk music from England and France, and released an album in 1961 with songs that struck a chord, such as &quot;Gu gira Euskadiko&quot;, &quot;Primaderako liliak&quot;, etc. He was to have influence on the new artistic Basque artist collective &quot;Ez dok amairu&quot; put together in 1965, largely made up of folk singer-songwriters concerned with Basque culture: Benito Lertxundi, Mikel Laboa (popular song &quot;Txoriak txori&quot;), Xabier Lete, Lourdes Iriondo, etc.

Lourdes Iriondo took up singing accompanied on a guitar for the first time in Basque music, a fact that came in for much criticism on the grounds that the instrument was alien to the native culture. &quot;Ez Dok Amairu&quot; broke up in 1972 and its members took up separate paths that eventually confirmed some of them as acclaimed and key folk Basque singers up to the 2000s. Along the lines of singer-songwriter style, Guk, Larralde eta Etxamendi or the beloved duo Pantxoa eta Peio provide the musical background for the 1970s period of struggle, repression and turmoil across the Northern Basque Country. Especially in the provinces of Álava and Navarre, Enrike Zelaia (Altsasu) and Gorka Knörr struck a chord with a more folkloric and nuanced approach.

===A shift towards urban music===
Meanwhile, new and more urban style musical ensembles and bands sprang up in the 1970s, performing first to other&#x27;s songs of the time at summer local festivals. They gradually developed their own repertoire fashioned in line with the Basque revival and activism (special focus on the lyrics) and ongoing Western musical trends, e.g. folk (Gwendal for one), progressive rock (Pink Floyd...). As regards choral bands, Mocedades from Bilbao should be highlighted, founded in 1967 initially by Amaya Uranga and two sisters of her. They soon gained public notability by ranking second at the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest.

In the same city, the prolific band Oskorri (see above) got together featuring folk music, launching first album in 1976, where they paid homage to poet Gabriel Aresti, while in the Northern Basque Country Michel Ducau and Anje Duhalde teamed up and put together the first Basque rock band, the celebrated and politically committed Errobi, releasing album &quot;Errobi&quot; (1975) to critic and public acclaim, &quot;Bizi bizian&quot; ensued, probably its best, with the record company CBS considering signing up a contract with them. The group disbanded (not definitely) at the top of their popularity (1979); the split came to be regarded as a &quot;suicide&quot;.

Beginning in the mid-60s, Imanol Larzabal led a solo career as a singer/songwriter, featuring a deep voice as well as a socially committed and poetic subjects, with the collaboration of domestic and foreign poets and singers. He went through a short period in prison and came back from exile in 1977. Friend of his and son of emigrant Souletin parents, Niko Etxart came back to the Basque Country from Paris with brand-new ideas about music in 1972, so turning into a forerunner of Basque rock music (&quot;Euskal Rock&amp;Roll&quot; in 1973, released in 1979) alongside Errobi, while especially in the traditional Northern Basque Country some lashed out at his looks, manners and music. He alternately performed onstage in &quot;verbenas&quot; (dancing music in local festivals) with the band Minxoriak up to 1994.

In the area of Mutriku, Itoiz, a milestone in Basque folk-pop music, was formed in 1978, with Juan Carlos Perez as its lead vocalist and front-man, releasing that very year the critically acclaimed album &quot;Itoiz&quot;, which contained such poignant tracks as &quot;Hilzori&quot;, &quot;Lau teilatu&quot; etc. Akin ensemble Haizea delivered a couple of good albums during this period.

===The rise of Basque punk music===

Up to that point, Basque music bands from the Southern Basque Country resorted to labels from Spain to record and release their works. Yet at the end of the 1970s and notably in the early 1980s, new regional publishers arose (Xoxoa, Soñua...), providing a springboard for small bands that previously found it difficult to see their works come to light.

At the same time, a whole network of youth squats, the &quot;gaztetxes&quot;, sprang up all over the Basque Country, so furnishing small bands with premises to rehearse and a venue to stage concerts. For the first time, a younger disaffected and unruly generation stemming from urban sprawls and towns could find an outlet to voice its protest along the lines of a punk outlook (&quot;do it yourself&quot;), but could not avoid being badly shaken by drugs. 1984 saw the surge of Basque punk rock, or &quot;Basque Radical Rock&quot; (&quot;Rock Radical Vasco&quot; in Spanish).
Some popular bands jumping onto the rock scene were Zarama and Eskorbuto from Santurtzi, hard rock band Barricada and whimsical Tijuana in Blue from Pamplona, La Polla Records from Agurain, Kortatu and Baldin Bada from Irun, Hertzainak, Cicatriz and Potato from Vitoria-Gasteiz, Jotakie, RIP, Naste Borraste, MCD, BAP, Zer Bizio, Delirium Tremens, etc. Most of the times Spanish language was used, sometimes Basque, while other times bands were bilingual.

This new musical trend clashed with the previous singer-songwriter tradition (generation gap), with both linking to different degrees to the leftist and Basque nationalist movement. Meanwhile, Itoiz kept its low-profile musical path switching to pop in the accomplished album &quot;Musikaz blai&quot; (three more LP albums followed), featuring internationally acclaimed songs like &quot;To Alice&quot;, &quot;As Noites da Radio Lisboa&quot; or the catchy &quot;Marea gora&quot;.

Other bands of the late 1980s stack to a different path, gentle and even naïve, using Spanish-language lyrics and combining Spanish and international pop trends, take for instance, Duncan Dhu (with leading figure Mikel Erentxun), 21 Japonesas or Sanchis y Jocano, bands from the area of Donostia. Duncan Dhu especially attained big levels of popularity on the Spanish and international pop scene, giving rise to a tradition in ensuing years that was to be called &quot;Donosti Sound&quot; (Le Mans, La Oreja de Van Gogh...).

==Current popular music==

===New trends===
In 1990, Basque-language public radio station Euskadi Gaztea was born, intending to target the youth in a young, dynamic and informal manner, besides adding information, dealing with subjects Basque young people may be interested in and encouraging Basque groups. Basque music definitely opened its mind to trends all over the world.

The flagship Basque rock band Kortatu broke up in 1988 (live album &quot;Azken guda dantza&quot;), and soon after brothers Muguruza put together project Negu Gorriak. They showed a different outlook compared to previous band Kortatu: The new band sang entirely in Basque, their approach showed an open mind, while sticking to the Muguruzas&#x27; signature protest song, as showed in their acclaimed video clip &quot;Radio Rahim&quot;, that conjures up American hip-hop manners. Punk fell much in decay, while reggae as well as hardcore took over, e.g. Anestesia, Etsaiak, Sociedad Alkoholika, Su Ta Gar (heavy), etc. M-ak launched its best album &quot;Barkatu ama&quot; to critical acclaim, featuring styles ranging from hardcore to gentle tracks.

===Folk and triki pop music===
Early in the 1990s, younger generations took up folk again, finding a public that was eager to listen to milder tunes in Basque, e.g. Sorotan Bele, Mikel Markez, etc. Trikitixa schools finally bore fruit in the 1990s: The novelties brought about by the duo Tapia eta Leturia and Kepa Junkera confirmed them as compelling folk references in the Basque Country and even abroad. Novel trikitixa duos tried new ways that caught on, sometimes setting up bands including bass guitar and drums besides the set pair of diatonic button accordion and tambourine (&quot;triki pop&quot;), e.g. Maixa eta Ixiar, Alaitz eta Maider, Gozategi. They usually offered a cheerful repertoire, with Gozategi&#x27;s song &quot;Nirekin&quot; (&quot;Emoixtaxux muxutxuek...&quot;) hitting the summer charts in 2000 beyond language boundaries.

===Specialization and diversification===
Rock band Hertzainak disbanded in 1993, while its members followed their own projects. Hertzainak frontman and controversial singer Gari started up a solo and very personal career with some accomplished songs that has established him as a compelling reference in Basque music, while Josu Zabala collaborated with other singers and a bertsolari group project, i.e. the original brass band Karidadeko Benta (first album 2003). Power pop band Urtz, formed in 1988, dealt with personal stories that slightly differed from the still prevailing protest topics and harsh language of the late 1980s, besides featuring an unprecedented chorus line that delivered some charming, upbeat and catchy songs. The band broke up in the early 2000s, but staged a comeback in 2013.
In step with the hardcore punk tradition, the band Berri Txarrak from Lekunberri got together in 1994, releasing various albums and touring on Europe, where they come in for good reviews and gradually get a reputation that earned them performances and collaborations with important figures of indie rock all over the world. In August 2017, the band announced the recording of its ninth album at The Blasting Room studio in Colorado.

The band PiLT (Mungia), who showed a taste for metal and hard sounds (Clawfinger, Soundgarden), jumped into spotlight in 1995 after winning the bootleg contest &quot;Gaztea Sariak&quot; granted by radio station Euskadi Gaztea, while the definite hit came in 1996 with single &quot;Hil da jainkoa&quot;, earning them widespread recognition. Likewise heavy metal band Latzen came to public prominence after winning with the popular ballad &quot;Laztana&quot; the 1997 edition of the &quot;Gaztea Sariak&quot;.

The bands Skalariak (1994) and Betagarri (1992) took over the ska tradition, offering boogie inciting and swinging live concerts. In step with other multicultural experiences, such as Fermin Muguruza from Negu Gorriak or festive Joxe Ripiau to highlight but a few, in 2003 members of Etsaiak put together Pin pan pun band, a band with good connections in Latin America, releasing in 2005 the DVD &quot;Kuba-Mexiko Rock Tour 04&quot;, which bore witness to their experience and live powerful concerts. Etsaiak got together again in 2008 (launched album &quot;Apurtu arte&quot;). In the French Basque Country, the festive band Sustraia attained great popularity after 15 years on the road, while the sudden death of charismatic frontman Patrick Mixelena in January 2009, a.k.a. Mixu, made the group&#x27;s future uncertain.

Doctor Deseo was set up in Bilbao in 1986, releasing thereafter various albums during a period that spans more than 20 years. They deal with everyday and personal subjects in a rather poetic manner. Fito y los Fitipaldis (Bilbao) was formed in 1998 by Platero y Tú&#x27;s frontman Fito Cabrales, comprising a variety of styles ranging soul, blues, swing, flamenco, tex-mex or Hawaiian guitars. The project kicked off with &quot;A puerta cerrada&quot; (40,000 albums sold so far) and grew steadily in popularity, one of the latest hit song being &quot;Rojitas las orejas&quot;. 

In Donostia, youths from university gathered together in the mid-90s to rehearse. Yet they were in need of a singer for the band, so they fixed up a casting meeting with Amaia Montero that resulted in the creation of La Oreja de Van Gogh, who after launching album &quot;Dile al sol&quot; took off boosted by Amaia&#x27;s mighty voice and catchy soft tunes trimmed with beautiful arrangements. New hit songs and albums followed.
The band hailing from Zarautz Delorean does electronic&amp;rock with enthralling and trance raising live performances since 2000. It went international setting out on tours abroad including the United States. The band cancelled its 2013 international tour while in Mexico after a strange kidnapping attempt. A consistent career and musical know-how have confirmed several bands as compelling references as of 2014: Gatibu (Gernika), We Are Standard (Getxo), Atom Rhumba (Bilbao), Ken 7 (&#x27;minus seven&#x27;, Gernika), Berri Txarrak (Lekunberri), Capsula (Bilbao), to mention but a few.

===Singer-songwriters and gentle music===

The singer-songwriter approach that waned in the late 1980s shows presently a sound condition in the Basque scene, with some very outstanding figures, like poignant Anari, renowned for her intense, heartbreaking voice and songs, who is now taking off (live recording &quot;Anari Kafe Antzokian Zuzenean&quot; released in 2008). Other singer-songwriters include Petti, from Bera (Navarre), with four albums published up to 2008, or the bertsolari Mikel Urdangarin, featuring somewhat melancholic songs often accompanied on string and brass instruments.

Following the folk and singer-songwriter tradition, Jabier Muguruza (born 1960) took up a solo career in 1994 after quitting other projects (Les Mecaniciens...). The veteran musician composes and performs personal, mild songs with strong broody and literary lyrics. Meanwhile, some renowned figures of Basque folk music have kept on performing and creating, e.g. Benito Lertxundi, or Oskorri (fresh album &quot;Banda band&quot; in 2007, about to celebrate the ensemble&#x27;s 35 anniversary). The celebrated singer-songwriter Mikel Laboa, considered a father figure of modern Basque music, died in December 2008.

The ensemble Bidaia, i.e. the couple Mixel Ducau and Caroline Phillips, offers gentle and elaborate folk music, while percussionist Benat Achiary (born 1947) provides an experimental approach, often featuring improvised passages in his performances (several albums released in the 1990s). Amaia Zubiria (born 1947 in Zubieta -Gipuzkoa-), who has occasionally collaborated with him, holds a long and prolific career in the Basque song panorama: She came to the spotlight with progressive-folk group Haizea, having published some solo albums since and featuring a very pure mezzo-soprano voice. Her latest work is the album &quot;Nabil&quot; (2008).

<text>USS &quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; (SSBN-636), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Major General Nathanael Greene (1746–1786), who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Nathanael Greene&quot;″s keel was laid down on 21 May 1962 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. The construction of the ship was supervised by Commander Lawrence Dennis Ballou. She was launched on 12 May 1964, sponsored by Mrs. Neander W. Wade, a descendant of Nathanael Greene, and commissioned on 19 December 1964 with Commander Robert E. Crispin in command of the Blue Crew and Commander William M. Cossaboom in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; departed Portsmouth for shakedown on 30 December 1964, with her Gold Crew embarked; it was relieved on 1 February 1965 by the Blue Crew. Her shakedown period was followed by repairs and alterations at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, after which the submarine, with her Blue Crew embarked, departed the shipyard for ballistic missile loading and her initial Polaris missile deterrent patrol.

In 1970-1971 &quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; was refueled and received its conversion to launch Poseidon missiles at Newport News Shipbuilding. Following Yard period and Shakedown, the Greene proceeded to Cape Canaveral for a test missile launch. In March 1972 the Greene departed for her first deterrent patrol following conversion ending up in Holy Loch, Scotland.

:&quot;History needed for 1965-1986.&quot;

==Events and deactivation==
On January 29, 1970, while making a surface run into port in thick fog, &quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; ran aground in about 16 feet of water. She was refloated after about 7 hours.

On August 11, 1984, &quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; lost her propeller in the Irish Sea. While proceeding back to Holy Loch at about 3 knots using her secondary propulsion motor, a transit of about 5 or 6 days, she was redirected to Her Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base, Clyde at Faslane as the U.S. dry dock in Holy Loch was fully committed and unavailable, while Admiralty Floating Dock No. 60 at Faslane was available. While in the Faslane dry dock, a fire occurred in one of the dock&#x27;s enclosed machinery spaces on 18 August 1984. The fire was quickly extinguished and did not affect the &quot;Greene.&quot; While in dry dock, it was established that the main shaft had broken with the loss of about a third of its length along with the propeller. Repairs were completed in about 12 days with the &quot;Nathanael Green&quot; undocked on 3 September 1984.

On 13 March 1986 &quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; ran aground in the Irish Sea, suffering severe damage to her rudder and ballast tanks. Her grounding was a serious accident involving a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. She was deactivated while still in commission in May 1987. Her early deactivation was decided both as a result of the damage sustained in the accident as well as in accordance with the limitations set by the SALT II treaty.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; was decommissioned on 15 December 1986 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 January 1987. Her removal from service allowed the United States to comply easily with the ballistic missile limits of the SALT II strategic arms limitation treaty.

&quot;Nathanael Greene&quot; entered the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, on 1 September 1998. Her scrapping was completed on 20 October 2000.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Nathanael Greene&quot;″s sail has been restored and is now on display in Port Canaveral, Florida as a memorial to the original 41 for Freedom fleet ballistic missile submarines.

<text>The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (originally the New York Custom House) is a government building, museum, and former custom house at 1 Bowling Green, near the southern end of Manhattan in New York City, New York, United States. Designed by Cass Gilbert in the Beaux-Arts style, it was erected from 1902 to 1907 by the government of the United States as a headquarters for the Port of New York&#x27;s duty collection operations. The building contains the George Gustav Heye Center museum, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and the New York regional offices of the National Archives. The facade and part of the interior are New York City designated landmarks, and the building is listed on both the New York State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a National Historic Landmark. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, listed on the NRHP.

The Custom House is a seven-story steel-framed structure with a stone facade and elaborate interiors. The exterior is decorated with nautical motifs and sculptures by twelve artists. The second through fourth stories contain colonnades with Corinthian columns. The main entrance consists of a grand staircase flanked by &quot;Four Continents&quot;, a set of four statues by Daniel Chester French. The second-story entrance vestibule leads to a transverse lobby, a rotunda, and offices. The rotunda includes a skylight and ceiling murals by Reginald Marsh. The George Gustav Heye Center, a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian, operates on the ground and second stories, while the upper stories contain U.S. government offices.

The building was proposed in 1889 as a replacement for the previous New York Custom House at 55 Wall Street. Because of various disagreements, the Bowling Green Custom House was not approved until 1899; Gilbert was selected as architect following a competition. The building opened in 1907, and the murals in the rotunda were added in 1938 during a Works Progress Administration project. The United States Customs Service moved out of the building in 1974, and it remained vacant for over a decade until renovations in the late 1980s. The Custom House was renamed in 1990 to commemorate Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and its first Secretary of the Treasury. The Heye Center opened in 1994.

== Site ==
The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House occupies a trapezoidal plot bounded by Bowling Green to the north, Whitehall Street to the east, Bridge Street to the south, and State Street to the west. The Whitehall Street and State Street elevations are wide; the main elevation on Bowling Green is wide; and the rear elevation on Bridge Street is wide. , a concrete retaining wall measuring deep was being built around the building. Nearby buildings include the International Mercantile Marine Company Building and the Bowling Green Offices Building to the northwest, 26 Broadway to the northeast, 2 Broadway to the east, and One Battery Park Plaza to the south.

There are entrances to two New York City Subway stations immediately outside the Custom House. An entrance to the Whitehall Street station is adjacent to the eastern side of the building, while an entrance to the Bowling Green station is to the north. The building occupies the site of Fort Amsterdam, constructed by the Dutch West India Company to defend their operations in the Hudson Valley. The Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, the precursor to modern-day New York City, was developed around the fort. Bowling Green, immediately to the north, is the oldest park in New York City. The Government House occupied the site in the late 18th century before its demolition in 1815. The houses of several wealthy New Yorkers were subsequently developed at that location.

== Architecture ==

The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House is seven stories high with a stone facade and an interior steel frame. It was designed by Cass Gilbert in the Beaux-Arts style. The design is similar to those of previous custom houses in New York City, namely Ithiel Town&#x27;s Federal Hall at 26 Wall Street and Isaiah Rogers&#x27;s Merchants&#x27; Exchange building at 55 Wall Street.

The building&#x27;s design incorporates Beaux-Arts and City Beautiful planning principles, combining architecture, engineering, and fine arts. Gilbert had written in 1900 about his plans for a wide-ranging, site-specific decorative program, which would &quot;illustrate the commerce of ancient and modern times, both by land and sea&quot;. Sculptures, paintings, and decorations by well-known artists of the time, such as Daniel Chester French, Karl Bitter, Louis Saint-Gaudens, and Albert Jaegers, embellish various portions of the interior and exterior.

, U.S. Customs and Border Protection owns the Custom House. The building houses the Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives and Records Administration, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and offices for the United States Department of Transportation.

=== Facade ===
Unlike most custom houses, which face the waterfront, the Alexander Hamilton Custom House faces inland toward Bowling Green. Its main entrance is on the northern facade, the only side that does not overlook the Lower Manhattan waterfront. The exterior is decorated throughout with nautical motifs such as dolphins and waves, interspersed with classical icons such as acanthus leaves and urns.

The first-floor facade is composed of rusticated blocks and is tall. There are six entrances to the building. The main entrance is on the northern elevation, where a wide stairway leads to the second floor. Under the main entrance arch is a carving of the municipal arms of the city of New York. The keystone at the top of the arch depicts the head of Columbia, the female personification of the United States, and was designed by Vicenzo Albani. Andrew O&#x27;Connor created a cartouche for the space above the main entrance. The lintel above the main entrance, quarried in Maine, weighed and measured .

The second through fourth stories contain engaged columns in the Corinthian style; some of these columns are paired while the others are single. There are 44 columns in total: twelve each on the north, east, and west elevations and eight on the south elevation. The second story is the &quot;piano nobile&quot;; the windows on this story are flanked by brackets and capped by enclosed pediments, with carved heads above them (see ). The third- and fourth-story windows, conversely, are less ornately decorated; this was normal for Beaux-Arts buildings, which generally had greater detailing on the more visible lower levels. The lintels above the third-story windows are decorated with wave motifs, while those above the fourth floor depict shells. The center portion of the Bridge Street facade reaches only to the third story.

The fifth-story facade consists of a full-story entablature with a frieze and short rectangular windows. The sixth story is directly above it, while the seventh story consists of a red-slate mansard roof with dormer windows and copper cresting. The mansard roof is extremely steep, allowing the seventh-story attic to be designed as a full floor of usable space.

==== Sculptures ====
Twelve sculptors were hired to create the figural groups on the exterior. The major work flanking the front steps, the &quot;Four Continents&quot;, was contracted to Daniel Chester French, who designed the sculptures with associate Adolph A. Weinman. French received the commission for all four sculptures after Augustus Saint-Gaudens declined an invitation to design two of the statues. The work was made of marble and sculpted by the Piccirilli Brothers; each sculptural group cost $13,500 (). The sculptures were produced at the Piccirilli Brothers&#x27; studio in the Bronx. From east to west, the statues depict larger-than-life-size personifications of Asia, America, Europe, and Africa. The primary figure of each group is a woman and is flanked by smaller human figures. In addition, Asia&#x27;s figure is paired with a tiger, and Africa&#x27;s figure is paired with a lion.

The capitals of each of the 44 columns are decorated with carved heads depicting Hermes, the Greek god of commerce. The windows on the main facade are topped by eight keystones, which contain carved heads with depictions of eight human races. One source described the keystones as representing &quot;Caucasian, Hindu, Latin, Celt and Mongol, Italian, African, Eskimo, and even the Coureur de Bois&quot;.

Above the main cornice are a group of standing sculptures that personify seafaring nations. There are twelve such statues, which depict commercial hubs through both ancient and modern history. Each sculpture is tall and weighs . These sculptures are arranged in chronological sequence from east to west, or from left to right as seen from directly in front of the building. The easternmost sculptures are of ancient Greece and Rome, while the westernmost sculptures are of the more recent French and British empires. Eight sculptors were commissioned for this work. One of these sculptures, &quot;Germania&quot; by Albert Jaegers, was modified in 1918 to display Belgian insignia rather than German insignia. Bitter created a cartouche of the United States&#x27; coat of arms for the roof.

=== Interior ===
A barrel-vaulted entrance vestibule, supported by marble columns and decorated with multicolored mosaics, is just inside the entrance. Behind bronze gates is a passageway to the Great Hall. At the center of the building is a double-height rotunda, rising to the third story. On and above the third story, the building is arranged as a hollow quadrilateral, surrounding the rotunda. This creates a light court above the rotunda, which measures wide on its north end, wide on its south end, and deep.

Stairways, made of marble with iron handrails, connect the interior spaces. There are elevators in each corner; the southwestern and southeastern banks contain two elevators each, while the northwestern and northeastern banks have three elevators apiece. The northwestern and northeastern elevators were originally open cages but were replaced with enclosed cabs in 1935. Because the original appropriation was limited in scope, decorative elements in the initial construction were limited to several important rooms, including the rotundas, hallways, lobby, and collector&#x27;s office. The walls of these spaces are clad with marble in multiple hues, and there are nautical motifs in numerous locations.

==== Second floor ====
The second-floor ceiling is generally tall. This floor consists of the former office spaces in the front and rear, the transverse lobby, and the rotunda. Gilbert planned the Custom House&#x27;s interior so &quot;all entrances, corridors, stairways and passages [were] arranged on the most direct and simple axial lines&quot;. The second-floor space, including the former offices, is almost entirely occupied by the Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian.

===== Transverse lobby =====
The transverse lobby spans the northern end of the second floor from west to east. Generally, the more important offices were positioned north of the lobby, while divisions dealing in more routine work were relegated to the south. Following the conversion of the second floor into the Heye Center, the former back offices have been occupied by various exhibition galleries; the cashier&#x27;s office houses the museum store; and a café occupies the Northwest office adjacent to the main entrance.

Membrane arches divide the lobby into five bays. The floors are decorated in marble mosaic patterns. An entablature runs around the top of the lobby, with galleries on the third story. There are two doorways on the walls, each topped by carved architraves with nautical symbols. The doors from the lobby to the former offices are made of varnished oak and stippled glass. At the center of the lobby is a three-bay-wide foyer with a pair of round arches to the north and south, which are supplemented by green Doric-style marble columns with white capitals. The bays of the foyer are separated by marble piers. Three bronze lanterns are suspended from the vaulted ceiling, hanging above a red-marble disc on the floor. Elmer E. Garnsey designed murals for the ceiling.

Semicircular staircases, with bronze railings and marble stair treads, flank the lobby. The stairs do not have any metal support structures and are composed entirely of flat, hard-burned clay tiles. Under each stair are timbrel vaults, which connect each landing. The stairs rise to the seventh floor, which contains a skylight that is meant to evoke the design of a ship&#x27;s cabin. Only the western stair between the first and second floors is open to the public. The elevator doors in the lobby are topped by bronze transom grilles that depict a caravel or sailing ship. There are two additional stairs at the rear, or southern, end of the building.

===== Offices and rotunda =====
The collector&#x27;s office is at the northwestern corner of the second floor. The office contains elaborate hardwood floors and oak wainscoting designed by Tiffany Studios; the wainscoting measures high. Garnsey painted ten oil paintings, which are installed above the wainscoting. Each painting has a gold frame and depicts a Dutch or English port in the New World. The office also included a stone fireplace mantel with a plaque referencing Fort Amsterdam and the Government House. The coffered plaster ceiling has molded decorations, including a motif of the collector&#x27;s monogram. Fourteen lighting fixtures, covered in gold leaf, hang from the ceiling. The room is normally closed to the public but can be rented for events.

The manager&#x27;s office is next to the collector&#x27;s office and is decorated with plain plaster walls, topped by a cornice in the Ionic order. The northeastern corner housed the cashier&#x27;s office, which featured a white-marble countertop with a bronze screen. The southern half of the cashier&#x27;s room has white-marble walls and was originally where members of the public conducted their transactions. The northern half, where the cashiers themselves worked, has plaster walls. The ornate plasterwork ceiling is decorated to resemble Renaissance &quot;boxed beams&quot;, while the marble floor has a geometric border. The former cashier&#x27;s office has been incorporated into the Heye Center&#x27;s museum store.

The elliptical rotunda, within the building&#x27;s interior courtyard, measures and rises to the third story. The walls and floors are composed of geometric marble tiles in several hues. The ceiling is self-supporting, without any interior metal structure; it uses the Guastavino tile arch system created by Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino. It consists of numerous layers of fireproof tiles, each of which measures across and thick. The tiles and layers are bonded using Portland cement. The center of the ceiling is occupied by a oval skylight. The underside of the ceiling bears eight trapezoidal panels, as well as eight long, narrow panels between them. The panels contain fresco-secco murals, which were painted in 1937 by Reginald Marsh and eight assistants as part of the Treasury Relief Art Project. The larger murals portray shipping activity in the Port of New York and New Jersey, while the smaller murals depict notable explorers of the New World and the Port of New York. Several shipping companies bought lunch for Marsh while he was painting the murals; as such, the murals depict these companies&#x27; ships. The rotunda can be rented for special events. When the Heye Center opened within the building in 1994, it built several permanent galleries around the rotunda.

==== Other stories ====
The ground story is tall. It originally had six entrances: two on the front and two each on State and Whitehall Streets. The Bowling Green post office, operated by the United States Postal Service, was formerly near the building&#x27;s south end. The post office was located around a west–east corridor accessed by both State and Whitehall Streets. There are also two ramps for delivery vehicles. The floor surface, wainscoting, and pilasters are made of marble, and the ceilings are high. In the early 1990s, a 350-seat auditorium was built on the ground story. About of storage space on the ground floor, under the rotunda, was converted into the George Gustav Heye Center&#x27;s Diker Pavilion for Native Arts and Cultures in 2006. This pavilion consists of a slightly sloped circular space seating 400 people, surrounding a maple dance floor.

The Custom House&#x27;s trapezoidal site was excavated to an average depth of . Two stories were placed beneath the ground level. The first basement was just above sea level and had a ceiling, while the second basement had a waterproof asphalt-and-tar floor. When the post office was in operation, mail arrived through the delivery docks and was sorted in the basement.

The upper stories contain office space. The outer portion of the fifth story was initially used for document storage; the windows are small apertures within the entablature, making that story unsuitable for office use. The ceilings of the upper stories are between tall. Some of the offices on the upper stories were ornately decorated. In particular, the Naval Commander of the Port&#x27;s office at the northwest corner of the third floor was decorated in dark oak. The Treasury Secretary&#x27;s office at the northeast corner of the seventh floor was finished in quartered oak and contained Circassian-walnut furniture.

==History==

The United States Customs Service had been formed in 1789 with the passage of the Tariff Act, which authorized the collection of duties on imported goods. The Port of New York was the primary port of entry for goods reaching the United States in the 19th century and, as such, the New York Custom House was the country&#x27;s most profitable custom house. Import taxes were a major revenue stream for the federal government before a national income tax was implemented in 1913 with the passage of the 16th Amendment. The New York Custom House had supplied two-thirds of the federal government&#x27;s revenue at one point. Because the salary of the collector was tied to the custom house&#x27;s revenue, the New York Custom House&#x27;s collector earned more than the U.S. president, and the position was extremely powerful. The New York Custom House had occupied several sites in Lower Manhattan before the Alexander Hamilton Custom House was built. The first such house was established in 1790 at South William Street. The custom house moved to the Government House on the site of Fort Amsterdam in 1799. The customs service relocated numerous times in the 19th century before opening an office at 55 Wall Street in 1862. The Wall Street location had been optimal during the mid-19th century because it was close to the Subtreasury at 26 Wall Street, thereby making it easy to transport gold.

=== Planning and construction ===
The Custom House on Wall Street had become overcrowded by 1887. William J. Fryer Jr., superintendent of repairs of New York City&#x27;s federal-government buildings, wrote to the United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Supervising Architect in February 1888 about the &quot;old, damp, ill-lighted, badly ventilated&quot; quarters at 55 Wall Street. &quot;Architecture and Building&quot; magazine called the letter &quot;worthy of thoughtful investigation&quot;. The 55 Wall Street building&#x27;s proximity to the Subtreasury was no longer advantageous, as it was easier to use a check or certificate to make payments on revenue. On September 14, 1888, the United States Congress passed an act that would allow site selection for a new custom house and appraiser&#x27;s warehouse. Soon after, Fryer presented his report to the New York State Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber said in 1889: &quot;We have not seriously considered the removal of the present Custom House proper, since it is well located, and, if found inadequate, can easily be easily be enlarged to meet all the wants of the Government for an indefinite time to come.&quot;

==== Site selection ====
Fryer recommended Bowling Green as his first preference for a new custom house, followed by a site immediately south, along State Street north of Battery Park. The U.S. House and Senate both passed a bill in March 1889, appropriating $750,000 () for a new custom house in the vicinity of Bowling Green. One supporter of the Bowling Green site implied that it had been left that way &quot;in order that New York might have a public building worthy of the city and the nation&quot;. That September, Treasury secretary William Windom selected Bowling Green as the new site of the custom house and appraiser&#x27;s warehouse. Almost immediately, Windom was accused of exceeding his authority in selecting the new site. In addition, many local businessmen opposed moving the custom house, and a judge ruled in 1891 that the federal government could not take the Bowling Green site by eminent domain as it had proposed to do.

Both houses of the U.S. Congress passed a bill to acquire land for a new custom house in New York City, and to sell the old building, in March 1891. The federal government appointed three commissioners to appraise the cost of acquiring land at Bowling Green; in July 1892, the appraisers estimated that the site would cost $1.96 million (about $ million in ). Still, in January 1893, there was not enough money to purchase the lots at Bowling Green. The lessees and landowners were supposed to receive $2.1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), but there was only $1.5 million on hand (equivalent to $ million in ). The 1891 bill had allowed up to $2 million for land acquisition and had required that the previous building be sold for at least $4 million. Members of Congress voted against a bill in March 1893 to appropriate an additional $800,000 for the site. Because of a lack of funding, the planned custom house at Bowling Green was abandoned at the end of that month.

The project did not proceed further until January 1897, when bills for the acquisition of the Bowling Green site were introduced in both houses of Congress. Federal legislators proposed further appropriations, but the Treasury retained the disbursements that would have gone to the landowners. The federal government chose an alternate site for the appraiser&#x27;s warehouse in the West Village of Manhattan, near where much of the city&#x27;s international shipping activity took place.

==== Site acquisition and architectural competition ====

Architectural writer Donald Reynolds stated that the new custom house was to be as modern as possible, with &quot;an architectural style that embodied the tradition of the customs service, the federal government, and the United States with the latest building technology&quot;. The Tarsney Act, passed in 1893, permitted the Supervising Architect to host a competition to hire private architects to design federal-government buildings. The act did not take effect until Treasury secretary Lyman J. Gage took office in 1897. Furthermore, it was difficult for the federal government to sell the old building for the required price of $4 million (about $ million in ). The new New York Custom House was only the fourth building to be built under the Tarsney Act.

Republican Party officials wished to have complete control over spending for the new custom house building. Originally, the Chamber of Commerce and many business interests advocated for erecting a new custom house on the Wall Street site, even though it was less than half the size of the proposed Bowling Green site. In 1897, Senator Thomas C. Platt and Representative Lemuel E. Quigg, both Republicans, proposed bills in the United States Senate and House of Representatives for building a new custom house at Wall Street, with Platt&#x27;s bill calling for a five-person commission to oversee the process. The bills died at the end of the 54th United States Congress in March 1897. During the 55th Congress in February 1898, legislation for the acquisition of the Bowling Green site was again proposed in the U.S. House and Senate, providing $5 million (about $ million in ) for land acquisition and construction.

The U.S. House and Senate passed the Bowling Green bills in early 1899. At the time, most of the structures on the site were three-story houses used by steamship offices; by April, agreements had been made with most of the sixteen landowners. The federal government disbursed $2.2 million (about $ million in ) to landowners at the Bowling Green site that July. The next month, the old Custom House was sold for $3.21 million (about $ million in ). Twenty firms were invited in May 1899 to submit designs to the competition under the terms of the Tarsney Act; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the federal government took &quot;great care&quot; in selecting the architects who were to be invited. Federal supervising architect James Knox Taylor stipulated that any plan include a ground-level basement and up to six stories, as well as a southward-facing light court above the third story. A committee of three men, including Taylor, was appointed to look over the submissions.

By September 1899, there were two finalists: architecture firm Carrere &amp; Hastings and architect Cass Gilbert. Carrere &amp; Hastings&#x27;s design had called for a Beaux-Arts structure with decorative trim, while Gilbert&#x27;s design included more French Renaissance Revival elements with copious statuary. After a plan for the two finalists to collaborate failed, Taylor picked Gilbert, who had been his partner at the Gilbert &amp; Taylor architecture firm in St. Paul, Minnesota. The selection of Gilbert was controversial, drawing opposition from Platt and several groups. Some of the opposition centered around the fact that Gilbert was a &quot;westerner&quot; who had just moved from Minnesota to New York City, and several opponents raised doubts about the jury&#x27;s competence. Gage certified Gilbert&#x27;s selection in November 1899. Opposition to his selection decreased significantly afterward after the American Institute of Architects&#x27; New York chapter criticized the controversy as &quot;unseemly&quot;.

==== Construction ====

Demolition of existing buildings on the site began in February 1900, and demolition contractor Seagrist &amp; Co. had cleared the site by that July. The next month, workers drilled test bores for the new Custom House&#x27;s foundations. Contracts for the building&#x27;s foundations and structural steel were delayed because the federal government had received several bids, whose estimated completion dates differed significantly. Isaac A. Hopper was contracted to excavate the site that December. The collector of the Port of New York, George R. Bidwell, claimed the contract should have been awarded to the next highest bidder, Charles T. Wills, who like Bidwell was a Republican. The site was excavated to a depth of , and some of dirt was removed. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; called the site &quot;the biggest hole that was ever made in this city over which to erect a building&quot;.

The federal government also requested bids for the building&#x27;s facade. The government was not allowed to request material from a specific quarry, so multiple contractors submitted bids for numerous types of marble, limestone, and granite. In December 1901, the federal government accepted contractor John Peirce&#x27;s bid to erect the Custom House building&#x27;s first floor. Pending further appropriations, the rest of the building would also be built by Peirce. At the time, there was only $3 million budgeted toward the Custom House&#x27;s completion (equal to $ million in ). The federal government was required to obtain a congressional appropriation before the project could be completed, so federal officials told Peirce to build only the first story. Peirce was authorized to complete the remaining stories in November 1902, after another $1.5 million (equal to $ million in ) was allocated. Under the terms of the contract, Pierce was to procure Fox Island granite and would be paid $2.2 million (equal to $ million in ).

The cornerstone of the building was laid on October 7, 1902, in a ceremony attended by Treasury secretary Leslie M. Shaw. After a ticker tape parade down Broadway, the cornerstone, filled with contemporary souvenirs and artifacts, was placed at the northeast corner of the site. The new Custom House&#x27;s construction lagged due to government bureaucracy, while work on comparable private buildings nearby proceeded more quickly. The slow construction was attributed to various reasons, such as concurrent jobs being undertaken by the building&#x27;s contractors, money shortages, and lack of supplies. Nonetheless, the building&#x27;s imminent completion sparked the development of other nearby sites. The Custom House was reportedly 70 percent complete by February 1905, according to Peirce. That September, J. C. Robinson was contracted to furnish the interior of the building, while New-York Steam Fitting was hired to install the mechanical equipment. The facade was finished by the following January.

=== Use by U.S. Customs Service ===

The building&#x27;s first tenant was a United States Post Office Department station, which opened on the Bridge Street side of the building&#x27;s ground floor in July 1906. The same year, an additional $465,000 was allocated for the building&#x27;s completion (equivalent to $ million in ). By September 1907, the Custom House was ready to open. The general contractors turned the building over to the federal government on October 1, 1907, after they had completed all major construction. At the time, many of the interior furnishings had not been added, and Congress was reluctant to provide additional funds. The U.S. Customs Service moved its offices to Bowling Green on November 4, 1907. With a proposed final cost of $4.5 million (approximately $ million in ), it would be more expensive than any other public building in New York City except for the Tweed Courthouse.

==== 1900s to 1930s ====

Following the Customs Service&#x27;s relocation to the Custom House, other government agencies with offices in New York City, such as the Weather Bureau, also moved to the Bowling Green Custom House. By 1908, the Custom House was fully occupied by these other agencies, as the Treasury&#x27;s chief architect had assigned space to other departments without consulting with the collector. The next year, the House of Representatives approved the installation of a pneumatic-tube system so the post office and custom house could send packages to the appraiser&#x27;s warehouse. A bronze tablet, marking the historical site of a Native American gathering place, was dedicated at the Custom House&#x27;s main entrance in 1909. Another tablet was dedicated at the Custom House in 1912, marking the site of the first mass in New York City, which had taken place in 1683.

The Consular Bureau opened an office at the Custom House in 1910. A regional tax office, where companies and residents in Manhattan south of 23rd Street paid taxes, opened at the Bowling Green Custom House in 1914. Various other agencies such as the Life-Saving Service and Secret Service also had offices in the Custom House. Following the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, &quot;individuals and patriotic societies&quot; objected to the presence of Germany from the Custom House&#x27;s sculptures, since Germany was one of the Central Powers against which the United States was fighting. Federal officials determined that it was not feasible to remove the &quot;Germania&quot; statue, which weighed . Instead, in September 1918, Gilbert was directed to remove the German insignia on the entablature&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; statue and replace them with Belgian insignia. The U.S. Passport Agency moved to the Custom House building the next year. The U.S. government proposed relocating the Customs Service&#x27;s administrative offices in 1927 to the Appraiser&#x27;s Stores Building, but shipping companies spoke out against the move.

A plaque honoring Richard Nicolls, the first colonial governor of the Province of New York, was dedicated at the Custom House in 1931. Large amounts of dirt had accumulated on the facade over the years, and workers steam-cleaned the facade and refurbished the interior in 1934. During the Great Depression, in April 1937, collector Harry M. Durning commissioned Reginald Marsh to paint murals in the main rotunda as part of the Treasury Relief Art Project, with funds and assistance from the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Marsh accepted the commission for $1,560 (), less than five percent of what he would have normally charged. The ceiling of the rotunda had been undecorated white plaster when the building was erected. The installation of the murals was delayed for several months because of what Marsh described as red tape; the murals were completed by February 1938. The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce also relocated from the building in late 1937.

==== 1940s to early 1970s ====
U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt requested in May 1939 that Congress appropriate $190,000 to renovate the Custom House. Congress approved the appropriation but later reduced it by $90,000. Durning asked Congress in 1940 to restore the appropriation, saying that &quot;men [were] falling out of ancient chairs, and [...] our valuable records and current papers stacked on desks and improperly filed in decrepit cabinets and bookshelves&quot;. At the time, the building had 1,865 employees, of which 847 worked for the Customs Service; according to Durning, the New York Custom House handled half of the United States&#x27; customs business. The building also housed the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the U.S. Post Office, the Commerce Department, and eight other agencies of the U.S. government.

The Custom House&#x27;s regional tax office began serving additional taxpayers in Staten Island and Midtown Manhattan in 1951. The offices of the Taxpayer Assistance Program, which helped residents file their taxes, relocated from the Custom House to Lafayette Street in 1955; the tax office itself relocated to Houston Street the next year. Although the Port of New York remained the United States&#x27; busiest port after World War II, it had begun to decline in importance by the 1950s because of several factors. These included increasing cargo-handling and trucking costs; the decline of local railroads; the rapid growth of the southern and southwestern United States and the development of ports in these regions; and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada, which allowed ships to deliver cargo directly to the Upper Midwest.

As early as 1964, the U.S. Customs Service was considering moving to the World Trade Center, which was under construction. The building&#x27;s other tenants at the time included the United States Coast Guard, whose Third District Search and Rescue Command was headquartered on the sixth floor. As a money-saving measure, in 1965, the Custom House began using a computerized system to record ships&#x27; arrivals. The Public Buildings Service, an agency of the federal government, conducted a study of the Custom House in 1967, finding that the building needed at least $8 million in renovations. By the early 1970s, the facade was extremely dirty, and the front steps had been shuttered for several years because of security concerns.
The Customs Service leased space at Six World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1970. That year, the New York City Planning Commission considered transferring the site&#x27;s unused air rights across the street to 1 Broadway, where the Walter Kidde Company planned to build a 50-story skyscraper. In exchange, the Walter Kidde Company would have been required to help preserve the Custom House. When the Customs Service moved out during 1973, the building had 1,375 employees, and the land under the building was estimated to be worth between $15 million and $20 million (about $– million in ). The General Services Administration (GSA) acquired the Bowling Green Custom House after the Customs Service relocated.

=== Abandonment and restoration proposals ===

==== 1970s plans ====
Several lawyers and businessmen had formed the nonprofit Custom House Institute in late 1973. With assistance from several organizations and the city government&#x27;s Office of Lower Manhattan Development, the institute raised $40,000 to conduct a feasibility study of the various plans for the Custom House. In March 1974, the institute recommended a proposal by architect I. M. Pei, who suggested converting the upper floors into office space, keeping the second-floor rotunda open, and converting the first floor to commercial use. The next year, the federal government declared the building &quot;surplus&quot; property, making it available to the city government. Pei&#x27;s proposal was not carried out, as the GSA found the proposal to be impractical. Instead, the GSA cleaned the facade during the mid-1970s.

From 1974 on, the Custom House was largely vacant. The building&#x27;s primary occupant was the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which occupied two stories; the Custom House Institute occupied the first floor. The other floors remained unused and were seldom open to the public except for special events. These included the bicentennial of the United States in 1976, a summer arts program in 1977, and another arts exhibition in 1979. Different parts of the building fell into various states of disrepair. Marsh&#x27;s ceiling murals and the commissioner&#x27;s room remained relatively intact, but there was peeling paint in other offices, and weeds were growing from the statues outside.

The GSA announced a plan in 1977 to convert the building into federal offices for $20 million, but there was no progress for a year. The agency indicated in January 1979 that it would spend $25 million on renovating the Bowling Green Custom House (about $ million in ). U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan gave U.S. House representatives a tour of the building to convince them to fund its renovation. In September 1979, in part because of his advocacy, Congress approved $26.5 million for the renovation, including the restoration of Marsh&#x27;s murals. The GSA decided to host a competition for the Custom House&#x27;s restoration and reuse. The entrance and rotunda were to be refurbished; the upper stories would contain upgraded offices for the federal government, while the lower stories would host a public institution.

==== 1980s plans ====
A joint venture of Marcel Breuer Associates, James Stewart Polshek Associates, Stewart Daniel Hoban and Associates, and Goldman-Sokolow-Copeland was selected in January 1980 to restore the building. The joint venture planned to restore the rotunda in a way that would allow the space to be used by a variety of tenants, rather than tailoring it for a specific use. Under this proposal, four atriums would have been built around the rotunda on the upper floors. In addition, the space beneath the rotunda would have been renovated, and a subway entrance would have been added. This proposal was never carried out because of bureaucratic delays. The federal government contemplated declaring the building surplus property in February 1983, allowing federal officials to sell it to a private owner, but Moynihan intervened and convinced federal officials to keep the building.

The GSA opened a request for proposals in November 1983, soliciting tenants for at the Custom House. Six plans were presented to Manhattan Community Board 1 in August 1984. The GSA gave the most consideration to two plans: one for a Holocaust museum and the other for a cultural and educational center with an ocean liner museum, restaurants, and theaters. The community board&#x27;s members were overwhelmingly in favor of the cultural and educational center, while Jewish groups preferred the Holocaust museum. The Holocaust museum proposal was selected in October 1984, prompting objections from preservationists who thought it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; for a Holocaust museum to be located in the Custom House. New York governor Mario Cuomo proposed an alternate site in nearby Battery Park City for the museum (later known as the Museum of Jewish Heritage), and the museum agreed in 1986 to relocate to Battery Park City.

An $18.3 million renovation (equivalent to $ million in ) began in August 1984. Ehrenkrantz and Eckstut Architects conducted the renovation. They cleaned, restored, and conserved exterior and ceremonial interior spaces. The restoration architects renovated old office space into federal courtrooms and ancillary offices; rental offices and meeting rooms; and a 350-seat auditorium. The building&#x27;s fire-safety, security, telecommunications, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems were also upgraded.

=== Museum of the American Indian operation ===

==== Agreement and renovation ====
By early 1987, Moynihan was proposing legislation that would turn over the building to the Museum of the American Indian (later the George Gustav Heye Center). The museum had outgrown its existing headquarters at Audubon Terrace in Upper Manhattan, and it was considering either relocating to Texas or merging with the American Museum of Natural History. The American Indian Community House, which wished to occupy a part of the Custom House, argued against giving the building to the Museum of the American Indian because the museum was run mostly by non-Indians. At the time, the Museum of the American Indian wished to relocate because its Upper Manhattan facility was insufficient, and the Custom House was being offered as an alternative for the museum&#x27;s possible relocation to Washington, D.C. U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye introduced the National Museum of the American Indian Act the next month, which would have brought the collection to Washington, D.C., instead.

A compromise was reached in 1988, in which the Smithsonian Institution would build the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian would also acquire the Heye collection and operate a satellite location of the museum at the Custom House. The museum would only occupy the lowest floors of the Custom House; the fifth through seventh floors would be reserved for the Bankruptcy Court. City officials and museum officials agreed to this compromise in January 1989, and the National Museum of the American Indian Act was passed that November. The architecture firm Ehrenkrantz Eckstut &amp; Whitelaw was hired in May 1990 to renovate the building. The same year, the building was officially renamed after Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, by act of Congress. The building&#x27;s renovation included constructing an auditorium on the ground level; converting the cashiers&#x27; office into a visitor center; and adding gallery space, two gift shops, a theater, offices, and classrooms. The renovation cost $24 million in total.

==== Opening of museum and 21st century ====
The George Gustav Heye Center&#x27;s space in the Custom House opened for previews in November 1992. The galleries to the west, south, and east of the rotunda formally opened on October 30, 1994. At that time, most of the space had been closed for 20 years. The Heye Center was housed in the three lower stories, while the Bankruptcy Court occupied two additional stories. One of the Bankruptcy Court&#x27;s rooms on the fifth floor, known as the Eastern Airlines Room, had been renovated to accommodate bankruptcy hearings for large companies such as Eastern Air Lines. The other two stories were vacant and had not been renovated, but the GSA planned to refurbish these stories.

The museum and building were mostly undamaged by the September 11 attacks in 2001, but airborne debris from the collapse of the World Trade Center had to be cleared from some of the interior spaces. The Heye Center&#x27;s exhibition and public access areas originally totaled about . The museum expanded into part of the ground floor in 2006. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) offices in New York moved to the Custom House in 2012. After a storm surge flooded the building during Hurricane Sandy that year, the GSA decided to build a retaining wall around the Custom House. In 2023, the federal government allocated $11 million to build the retaining wall using environmentally friendly materials such as low-emission concrete. SuperStructures Engineers + Architects was hired to design the renovation, which would cost $131.3 million and be completed in two phases.

==Impact==

=== Reception ===
Gilbert stated that, during the design process, a tall dome was suggested in order to make the building into a &quot;landmark&quot; but that &quot;this would wholly destroy the proportions of the building per se, and as a matter of plan, seriously impair its practical usefulness&quot;. Gilbert said a storage tower would be more appropriate if a &quot;landmark&quot; was necessitated, but he believed such a tower &quot;would add considerably to the cost&quot;.

From the start, the Alexander Hamilton Custom House was architecturally distinguished from other buildings in the area. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 1906 that &quot;it is the unity of idea embodied in the new Custom House and enforced by the wealth of sculpture with which it is embellished, more than its mere costliness, that gives to the edifice its unique value&quot;. A &quot;Times&quot; editorial the same year said that, despite the federal government&#x27;s initial reluctance to decorate the Custom House lavishly, &quot;few recall the money sunk into stone, bricks and mortar; they enjoy the final touches inside on which millions were not squandered&quot;. The &quot;Crockery &amp; Glass Journal&quot; stated in 1907 that the building&#x27;s quality was derived from its &quot;proportion, with rich simplicity—the Roman recipe&quot;. The same year, Charles DeKay wrote for &quot;Century&quot; magazine that &quot;at least something has been done to blunt the reproof that New York, a city by the sea, great through the ocean and our magnificent waterways, rarely remembers the sources of her wealth and greatness&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 1914 that the Custom House &quot;represents the national Government in its economic bases and financial life&quot;.

Acclaim for the building continued in the decades after its completion. Architectural writer Henry Hope Reed Jr. regarded the Custom House in 1964 as &quot;the finest public building in New York&quot;. When the U.S. Customs Service relocated in 1973, Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that 6 World Trade Center&#x27;s &quot;functional, featureless grid&quot; contrasted with the &quot;splendor&quot; of the Alexander Hamilton Custom House. Architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern and his co-authors, in the 1983 book &quot;New York 1900&quot;, said that the Custom House and the Ellis Island immigration station were the two structures that reinforced New York City&#x27;s role as &quot;the leading American metropolis, representative of America&#x27;s role in the world&quot;.

After the lower floors were converted into the Heye Center, Benjamin Forgey of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the galleries were &quot;conceived as neutral containers, a sequence of vaulted rooms ingeniously constructed within the old building frame in order not to damage (or indeed even to touch) the original walls&quot;. A writer for &quot;USA Today&quot; called the building &quot;itself a sight to see&quot;. Stern and his co-authors wrote in the 2006 book &quot;New York 2000&quot; that the building, which had been one of the Financial District&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished white elephants&quot;, became a &quot;destination spot&quot; once the Heye Center moved in. Several critics wrote about the juxtaposition of the Custom House&#x27;s classical architecture and the Heye Center&#x27;s focus on Native American culture, which, according to Stern and his co-authors, was largely characterized as &quot;a culturally and stylistically inconsistent mix&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; believed that the museum clashed with &quot;the Custom House itself, which with its newly cleaned ceiling murals depicting ferries and ships seems a bizarre venue for looking at Indian art&quot;.

=== Landmark designations ===
The Custom House was one of the earliest designations of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, becoming an official exterior landmark in October 1965, six months after the city&#x27;s landmarks law was signed. At the time of the exterior designation, the commission said that &quot;At some time in the future this building may be in jeopardy&quot;, since the federal government had doubted whether the Custom House should be made a city landmark. The Custom House&#x27;s interior was also designated as a city landmark in January 1979. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, the designation covering both its exterior and public interior spaces. The structure was also declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, marking it as a site that adds &quot;exceptional value to the nation&quot;. In addition, the Custom House was added to the New York State Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 2007, it was designated as a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, an NRHP district.

=== Media ===
The U.S. Custom House has been used as a filming location for dozens of movies and TV shows. Its exterior and lobby were used as a filming location in the 1989 American supernatural comedy film &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, where the building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Museum of Art. The building has also been used as a filming location for other movies such as &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2006), &quot;How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days&quot; (2003), and &quot;Black Swan&quot; In addition, it has been depicted in commercials for Citibank and BMW.

<text>Dave Weckl (born January 8, 1960, in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American jazz fusion drummer and the leader of the Dave Weckl Band. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Biography==
Weckl started playing his first set of drums at age 8 in his spare room along with records. He later played in the living room, sometimes with his father on piano. Weckl studied at the University of Bridgeport. Starting out on the New York fusion scene in the early 1980s, Weckl soon began working with artists such as Paul Simon, George Benson, Michel Camilo, Robert Plant, and Anthony Jackson.

He was with the Chick Corea Elektric Band from 1985 to 1991. During this time he performed on many albums and also appeared with Corea&#x27;s Akoustic Band. He said he &quot;augmented his work with Corea by continuing his session work and appearing often with the GRP All-Star Big Band&quot;. Weckl has released a series of instructional videotapes. His first recording as leader was in 1990 – &quot;Master Plan&quot;, for GRP. This was followed by &quot;Heads Up&quot; in 1992, and &quot;Hard-Wired&quot; in 1994. Later on, Weckl recorded and toured with guitarist Mike Stern.

<text>The president of the Republic of Yemen () is the head of state of Yemen. Under the Constitution of Yemen, the president is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and head of the executive branch of the Yemeni government.

As of 7 April 2022, the powers of the president are exercised by the Presidential Leadership Council, headed by a chairman. The chairman of the Presidential Leadership Council is vested with sweeping powers, including the ability to unilaterally command the military and appoint governors and other key officials.

The first and longest-serving president of unified Yemen was Ali Abdullah Saleh and the second was Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who took office on 27 February 2012. The legality of his claim to presidency is in question, as he was the only candidate in the 2012 election and the end of his mandate was originally set for 27 February 2014. His mandate was extended for another year. However, he remained in power after the expiration of his mandate, and on 22 January 2015, he handed over his resignation. He reaffirmed that he intended on resigning two weeks later. After his resignation, the government was assumed by the Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee. However, on 21 February 2015, Hadi presented himself as the president again, in Aden. On 7 April 2022, in a televised address, Hadi resigned, dismissed Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, and transferred the powers of the president and vice president to the Presidential Leadership Council, with Rashad al-Alimi, former interior minister under President Saleh, as its chairman. Right after assuming his office, al-Alimi met King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed, during an official visit to Saudi Arabia on 29 April 2022 for support of all peace efforts in Yemen and the region.

The Hadi faction&#x27;s claim to the presidency is contested by the Houthi Supreme Political Council&#x27;s chairman, Mahdi al-Mashat, who is only recognized by Iran.

<doc id="444091" wikidata="Q94491" url="?curid=444091" title="Weierstrass function">
<text>In mathematics, the Weierstrass function, named after its discoverer, Karl Weierstrass, is an example of a real-valued function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. It is also an example of a fractal curve.

The Weierstrass function has historically served the role of a pathological function, being the first published example (1872) specifically concocted to challenge the notion that every continuous function is differentiable except on a set of isolated points. Weierstrass&#x27;s demonstration that continuity did not imply almost-everywhere differentiability upended mathematics, overturning several proofs that relied on geometric intuition and vague definitions of smoothness. These types of functions were denounced by contemporaries: Henri Poincaré famously described them as &quot;monsters&quot; and called Weierstrass&#x27; work &quot;an outrage against common sense&quot;, while Charles Hermite wrote that they were a &quot;lamentable scourge&quot;. The functions were difficult to visualize until the arrival of computers in the next century, and the results did not gain wide acceptance until practical applications such as models of Brownian motion necessitated infinitely jagged functions (nowadays known as fractal curves).

==Construction==

In Weierstrass&#x27;s original paper, the function was defined as a Fourier series:

formula_1

where formula_2, formula_3 is a positive odd integer, and

formula_4

The minimum value of formula_3 for which there exists formula_2 such that these constraints are satisfied is formula_7. This construction, along with the proof that the function is not differentiable over any interval, was first delivered by Weierstrass in a paper presented to the Königliche Akademie der Wissenschaften on 18 July 1872.

Despite being differentiable nowhere, the function is continuous: Since the terms of the infinite series which defines it are bounded by formula_8 and this has finite sum for formula_9, convergence of the sum of the terms is uniform by the Weierstrass M-test with formula_10. Since each partial sum is continuous, by the uniform limit theorem, it follows that formula_11 is continuous. Additionally, since each partial sum is uniformly continuous, it follows that formula_11 is also uniformly continuous.

It might be expected that a continuous function must have a derivative, or that the set of points where it is not differentiable should be countably infinite or finite. According to Weierstrass in his paper, earlier mathematicians including Gauss had often assumed that this was true. This might be because it is difficult to draw or visualise a continuous function whose set of nondifferentiable points is something other than a countable set of points. Analogous results for better behaved classes of continuous functions do exist, for example the Lipschitz functions, whose set of non-differentiability points must be a Lebesgue null set (Rademacher&#x27;s theorem). When we try to draw a general continuous function, we usually draw the graph of a function which is Lipschitz or otherwise well-behaved. Moreover, the fact that the set of non-differentiability points for a monotone function is measure-zero implies that the rapid oscillations of Weierstrass&#x27; function are necessary to ensure that it is nowhere-differentiable.

The Weierstrass function was one of the first fractals studied, although this term was not used until much later. The function has detail at every level, so zooming in on a piece of the curve does not show it getting progressively closer and closer to a straight line. Rather between any two points no matter how close, the function will not be monotone.

The computation of the Hausdorff dimension formula_13 of the graph of the classical Weierstrass function was an open problem until 2018, while it was generally believed that formula_14. That &quot;D&quot; is strictly less than 2 follows from the conditions on formula_15 and formula_3 from above. Only after more than 30 years was this proved rigorously.

The term Weierstrass function is often used in real analysis to refer to any function with similar properties and construction to Weierstrass&#x27;s original example. For example, the cosine function can be replaced in the infinite series by a piecewise linear &quot;zigzag&quot; function. G. H. Hardy showed that the function of the above construction is nowhere differentiable with the assumptions formula_17.

==Riemann function==
The Weierstrass function is based on the earlier Riemann function, claimed to be differentiable nowhere. Occasionally, this function has also been called the Weierstrass function.
formula_18

While Bernhard Riemann strongly claimed that the function is differentiable nowhere, no evidence of this was published by Riemann, and Weierstrass noted that he did not find any evidence of it surviving either in Riemann&#x27;s papers or orally from his students.

In 1916, G. H. Hardy confirmed that the function does not have a finite derivative in any value of formula_19 where &quot;x&quot; is irrational or is rational with the form of either formula_20 or formula_21, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are integers. In 1969, Joseph Gerver found that the Riemann function has a defined differential on every value of &quot;x&quot; that can be expressed in the form of formula_22 with integer &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, that is, rational multipliers of formula_23 with an odd numerator and denominator. On these points, the function has a derivative of formula_24. In 1971, J. Gerver showed that the function has no finite differential at the values of &quot;x&quot; that can be expressed in the form of formula_25, completing the problem of the differentiability of the Riemann function.

As the Riemann function is differentiable only on a null set of points, it is differentiable almost nowhere.

==Hölder continuity==
It is convenient to write the Weierstrass function equivalently as

formula_26

for formula_27. Then formula_28 is Hölder continuous of exponent α, which is to say that there is a constant &quot;C&quot; such that

formula_29

for all formula_30 and formula_31. Moreover, formula_32 is Hölder continuous of all orders formula_33 but not Lipschitz continuous.

==Density of nowhere-differentiable functions==

It turns out that the Weierstrass function is far from being an isolated example: although it is &quot;pathological&quot;, it is also &quot;typical&quot; of continuous functions:
* In a topological sense: the set of nowhere-differentiable real-valued functions on [0, 1] is comeager in the vector space &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R) of all continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1] with the topology of uniform convergence.
* In a measure-theoretic sense: when the space &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R) is equipped with classical Wiener measure &quot;γ&quot;, the collection of functions that are differentiable at even a single point of [0, 1] has &quot;γ&quot;-measure zero. The same is true even if one takes finite-dimensional &quot;slices&quot; of &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R), in the sense that the nowhere-differentiable functions form a prevalent subset of &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R).

<text>Leucoplasts (&quot;formed, molded&quot;) are a category of plastid and as such are organelles found in plant cells. They are non-pigmented, in contrast to other plastids such as the chloroplast.

==Background==
Lacking photosynthetic pigments, leucoplasts are located in non-photosynthetic tissues of plants, such as roots, bulbs and seeds. They may be specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as heme. In general, leucoplasts are much smaller than chloroplasts and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of stromules interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls, and petals, and in callus and suspension culture cells of tobacco. In some cell types at certain stages of development, leucoplasts are clustered around the nucleus with stromules extending to the cell periphery, as observed for proplastids in the root meristem.

===Etioplasts===

Pre-granal etioplasts, which are chloroplasts that have not matured but can be chloroplasts deprived of light, lack the active pigment. They can thereby can be considered leucoplasts. After several minutes exposure to light, etioplasts transform into functioning chloroplasts and cease being leucoplasts. Amyloplasts are of large size and store starch.

Proteinoplasts store proteins and are found in seeds (pulses), while elaioplasts store fats and oils and are found in seeds. They are also called oleosomes.

<doc id="444095" wikidata="Q1325388" url="?curid=444095" title="Bloody Sunday (1887)">
<text>Bloody Sunday was an event which took place in London, England on 13 November 1887, when a crowd of marchers protesting about unemployment and the Irish Coercion Acts, as well as demanding the release of MP William O&#x27;Brien, clashed with the Metropolitan Police. The demonstration was organised by the Social Democratic Federation and the Irish National League. Violent clashes took place between the police and demonstrators, many &quot;armed with iron bars, knives, pokers and gas pipes&quot;. A contemporary report noted that 400 were arrested and 75 people were badly injured, including many police, two policemen being stabbed and one protester bayonetted.

==Background==

Prime Minister William Gladstone&#x27;s espousal of the cause of Irish home rule had split the Liberal Party and made it easy for the Conservatives to gain a majority in the House of Commons. The period from 1885 to 1906 was one of Tory dominance, with short intermissions. Coercion Acts were the answer of British governments perturbed by rural unrest in Ireland, and they involved various degrees of suspension of civil rights. Although one purpose of the 13 November demonstration was to protest about the handling of the Irish situation by the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury, it had a much wider context.

The Long Depression, starting in 1873 and lasting almost to the end of the century, created difficult social conditions in Britain—similar to the economic problems that drove rural agitation in Ireland. Falling food prices created rural unemployment, which resulted in both emigration and internal migration. Workers moved to the towns and cities in thousands, eroding employment, wages and working conditions. By November 1887, unemployed workers&#x27; demonstrations from the East End of London had been building up for more than two years. There had already been clashes with the police and with the members of upper class clubs. Trafalgar Square was seen symbolically as the point at which the working-class East End met the upper-class West End of London, a focus of class struggle and an obvious flashpoint.

This attracted the attention of the small but growing socialist movement – the Marxists of both the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and Socialist League, and the reformist socialists of the Fabian Society. Police and government attempts to suppress or divert the demonstrations also brought in the radical wing of the Liberal Party and free speech activists from the National Secular Society.

The working class in British cities contained many people of Irish birth or origin. London, like industrial areas of northern England and western Scotland, had a large Irish working class, concentrated in the East End, where it rubbed shoulders with increasing numbers of Jews from Eastern Europe.

==Demonstration of 13 November==

Some 30,000 people, &quot;mostly respectable spectators&quot;, encircled Trafalgar Square as at least 10,000 protesters marched in from several different directions, led by (among others) Elizabeth Reynolds, John Burns, William Morris, Annie Besant and Robert Cunninghame-Graham, who were primarily leaders of the Social Democratic Federation. Also marching were the Fabian playwright George Bernard Shaw, Eleanor Marx, and Charlotte Wilson.

There were approximately 14,000 police officers for 5.5 million Londoners.
Two thousand police and 400 troops were deployed to halt the demonstration. Burns and Cunninghame-Graham were arrested and imprisoned for six weeks. Annie Besant, who was a Marxist, Fabian and secularist, spoke at the rally and offered herself for arrest, but the police declined to do so. Of the 400 arrested, 50 were detained in custody.

At some point James Compton Merryweather, head of the firm Merryweather &amp; Sons, and a Conservative supporter, offered to use a 400-gallons-per-minute steam fire engine as a water cannon of the day to clear the rioters from Trafalgar Square. However the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Charles Warren, declined.

In the fighting, many rioters were injured by police truncheons and under the hooves of police horses. The British Army dispatched a force of 400 men, consisting of both infantry and cavalry. Although the infantry were marched into position with bayonets fixed, they were not ordered to open fire and the cavalry were not ordered to draw their swords. An Australian newspaper, of conservative political orientation, reported that the wounds received by the mob were less severe than those of the constables.

==Aftermath==
The following Sunday, 20 November, saw another demonstration and more casualties. According to a report in the partisan &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, among them was a young clerk named Alfred Linnell, who was run down by a police horse, dying in hospital a fortnight later from complications of a shattered thigh.

The funeral of Linnell on 18 December provided another focus for the unemployed and Irish movements. William Morris, leader of the Socialist League, gave the main speech and &quot;advocated a holy war to prevent London from being turned into a huge prison&quot;. A smaller but similar event marked the burial of another of those killed, W. B. Curner, which took place in January. The release of those imprisoned was celebrated on 20 February 1888, with a large public meeting. Henry Hyndman, leader of the SDF, violently denounced the Liberal Party and the Radical MPs who were present.

<text>Bloody Sunday (, ), also known as Red Sunday (), was the series of events on Sunday, in St Petersburg, Russia, when demonstrators, led by Father Georgy Gapon, were fired upon by soldiers of the Imperial Guard as they marched towards the Winter Palace to present a petition to Tsar Nicholas II.

Bloody Sunday caused grave consequences for the tsarist authorities governing Russia: the events in St. Petersburg provoked public outrage and a series of massive strikes that spread quickly to the industrial centres of the Russian Empire. The massacre on Bloody Sunday is considered to be the start of the active phase of the Revolution of 1905. In addition to beginning the 1905 Revolution, historians such as Lionel Kochan in his book &quot;Russia in Revolution 1890–1918&quot; view the events of Bloody Sunday to be one of the key events which led to the Russian Revolution of 1917.

==Background==
After the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 by Tsar Alexander II of Russia, there emerged a new peasant working class in Russia&#x27;s industrializing cities. Prior to emancipation, no working class could be established because serfs working in the cities to supplement their incomes retained their ties to the land and their masters. Although the working conditions in the cities were horrific, they were only employed for short periods of time and returned to their village when their work was complete, or when it was time to resume agricultural work.

The emancipation of the serfs resulted in the establishment of a permanent working class in urban areas, which created a strain on traditional Russian society. Peasants &quot;were confronted by unfamiliar social relationships, a frustrating regime of factory discipline, and the distressing conditions of urban life.&quot; This new group of peasant workers made up the majority of workers in urban areas. Generally unskilled, these peasants received low wages, were employed in unsafe working environments, and worked up to fifteen hours a day. Although some workers still had a paternalistic relationship with their employer, factory employers were more present and active than the noble landowners that previously had ownership of the serfs. Under serfdom, peasants had little, if any, contact with their landowner. In the new urban setting, however, factory employers often used their absolute authority in abusive and arbitrary manners. Their abuse of power, made evident by the long working hours, low wages, and lack of safety precautions, led to strikes in Russia.

===Early strikes===
&quot;The Russian term for strike, &quot;stachka&quot;, was derived from an old colloquial term, &quot;stakat’sia&quot;- to conspire for a criminal act.&quot; As such, Russian laws viewed strikes as criminal acts of conspiracy and potential catalysts for rebellion. The governmental response to strikes, however, supported the efforts of the workers and promoted strikes as an effective tool that could be used by the workers to help improve their working conditions. The Tsarist authorities usually intervened with harsh punishment, especially for the leaders and spokesmen of the strike, but often the complaints of the strikers were reviewed and seen as justified and the employers were required to correct the abuses about which the strikers protested.

These corrections did not address a grossly unbalanced system that clearly favoured employers. This caused the continuation of strikes and the first major industrial strike in Russia in 1870 in St. Petersburg. This new phenomenon was a catalyst of many more strikes in Russia, which increased until they reached a peak between 1884 and 1885 when 4,000 workers went on strike at Morozov&#x27;s cotton mill. This large strike prompted officials to consider regulations that would restrain the abuses of employers and ensure safety in the workplace. A new law was passed in 1886 that required employers to specify working conditions in their factories in writing. This included the treatment of workers, workers&#x27; hours and the safety precautions taken by the employer. This new law also created factory inspectors who were charged with preserving industrial peace. Despite these changes, strike activity again reached high proportions during the 1890s, resulting in the restriction of the workday to eleven and a half hours in 1897.

===Priest Gapon===
A leading role in these events was played by a Priest Georgy Gapon. Fr. Gapon was a charismatic speaker and effective organizer who took an interest in the working and lower classes of the Russian cities.

The &quot;Assembly of the Russian Factory and Mill Workers of the City of St. Petersburg&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;the Assembly&quot;, had been headed by Fr. Gapon since 1903. The Assembly was patronized by the Department of the Police and the St. Petersburg Okhrana (secret police); during 1904 the membership of the association had grown rapidly, although more radical groups saw it as being a &quot;police union&quot; – under government influence. The Assembly&#x27;s objectives were to defend workers&#x27; rights and to elevate their moral and religious status. In the words of Fr. Gapon, this organization served as:

== Prelude ==
===Putilov incident===
In December 1904, six workers at the Putilov Ironworks in St. Petersburg were fired because of their membership in the Assembly, although the plant manager asserted that they were fired for unrelated reasons. Virtually the entire workforce of the Putilov Ironworks went on strike when the plant manager refused to accede to their requests that the workers be rehired. Sympathy strikes in other parts of the city raised the number of strikers up to 150,000 workers in 382 factories. By , the city had no electricity and no newspapers whatsoever and all public areas were declared closed.

===Petition and preparation for the march===
The decision to prepare and present a petition was made in the course of discussions during the evening of , at the headquarters of Gapon&#x27;s movementthe &quot;Gapon Hall&quot; on the Shlisselburg Trakt in Saint Petersburg. The petition, as drafted in respectful terms by Gapon himself, made clear the problems and opinions of the workers and called for improved working conditions, fairer wages, and a reduction in the working day to eight hours. Other demands included an end to the Russo-Japanese War and the introduction of universal suffrage. The idea of a petition resonated with the traditionally minded working masses. From the 15th to the early 18th centuries individual or collective petitions were an established means of bringing grievances to the attention of the tsar&#x27;s administration. They could be submitted to the Petitions Prikaz (office) in Moscow, or directly to the tsar or his courtiers when the tsar was making an appearance outside the palace.

The march on the Winter Palace was not a revolutionary or rebellious act, though it was done against the permission of public authorities. Political groups, such as the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and the Social Revolutionaries disapproved of the procession due to its lack of political demands. Fr.
Gapon even encouraged his followers to tear up leaflets that supported revolutionary aims. The majority of Russian workers retained their traditional conservative values of Orthodoxy, faith in the autocracy, and indifference to political life. The workers of St. Petersburg wished to receive fair treatment and better working conditions; they decided, therefore, to petition the tsar in hopes he would act on it. In their eyes, the tsar was their representative who would help them if he was made aware of their situation. God appointed the tsar, therefore the tsar had an obligation to protect the people and do what was best for them. Their petition was written in subservient terms and ended with a reminder to the tsar of his obligation to the people of Russia and their resolve to do what it took to ensure their pleas were met. It concluded: &quot;And if Thou dost not so order and dost not respond to our pleas we will die here in this square before Thy palace&quot;. Gapon, who had an ambiguous relationship with the tsarist authorities, sent a copy of the petition to the Minister of the Interior together with a notification of his intention to lead a procession of members of his workers&#x27; movement to the Winter Palace on the following Sunday.

Troops had been deployed around the Winter Palace and at other key points. Despite the urging of various members of the imperial family to stay in St. Petersburg, the tsar left on Saturday for Tsarskoye Selo. A cabinet meeting, held without any particular sense of urgency that same evening, concluded that the police would publicize his absence and that the workers would accordingly probably abandon their plans for a march.

==Events of Sunday 22 January==
===Beginning of march===

In the pre-dawn winter darkness of the morning of Sunday, , striking workers and their families began to gather at six points in the industrial outskirts of St Petersburg. Holding religious icons and singing hymns and patriotic songs (particularly &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot;), a crowd of &quot;more than 3,000&quot; proceeded without police interference towards the Winter Palace, the tsar&#x27;s official residence. The crowd, whose mood was quiet, did not know that the tsar was not in residence. Insofar as there was firm planning, the intention was for the various columns of marchers to converge in front of the palace at about 2 pm. Estimates of the total numbers involved range wildly from police figures of 3,000 to organizers&#x27; claims of 50,000. Initially, it was intended that women, children and elderly workers should lead, to emphasize the united nature of the demonstration. Vera Karelina, who was one of Gapon&#x27;s inner circle, had encouraged women to take part although she expected that there would be casualties. On reflection, younger men moved to the front to make up the leading ranks.

===Government measures===

A report had been made to the tsar at Tsarskoe Selo on Saturday night on the measures being taken to contain the marchers. Substantial military forces were deployed in and around the environs of the Winter Palace. These comprised units of the Imperial Guard, who provided the permanent garrison of Saint Petersburg and Cossacks, plus infantry regiments brought in by rail in the early morning of 9 January from Reval and Pskov. The troops, who now numbered about 10,000, had been ordered to halt the columns of marchers before they reached the palace square but the reaction of government forces was inconsistent and confused. Individual policemen did salute the religious banners and portraits of the tsar carried by the crowd or joined the procession. Army officers variously told the marchers that they could proceed in smaller groups, called on them to disperse or ordered their troops to fire into the marchers without warning. When the crowds continued to press forward, Cossacks and regular cavalry made charges using their sabres or trampling the people.

===Shootings===
The first instance of shooting occurred between 10 and 11 am. There was no single encounter directly before the Winter Palace, as often portrayed, but rather a series of separate collisions at the bridges or other entry points to the central city. The column led by Gapon was fired upon near the Narva Gate. Around forty people were killed or wounded there, although Gapon himself was not injured.

As late as 2 pm large family groups were promenading on the Nevsky Prospekt as was customary on Sunday afternoons, mostly unaware of the extent of the violence elsewhere in the city. Amongst them were parties of workers still making their way to the Winter Palace as originally intended by Gapon. A detachment of the Preobrazhensky Guards, previously stationed in the Palace Square where about 2,300 soldiers were being held in reserve, now made its way onto the Nevsky and formed two ranks opposite the Alexander Gardens. Following a single shouted warning a bugle sounded and four volleys were fired into the panicked crowd, many of whom had not been participants in the organized marches.

===Casualties===

The total number killed in the day&#x27;s clashes is uncertain. The tsar&#x27;s officials recorded 96 dead and 333 injured; anti-government sources claimed more than 4,000 dead; moderate estimates still average around 1,000 killed or wounded, both from shots and being trampled during the panic. Another source noted that the official estimate was 132 people killed. Leon Trotsky did not put forward a precise figure but claimed that hundreds were killed and that many of the dead were secretly buried by the authorities.

Nicholas II described the day as &quot;painful and sad&quot;. As reports spread across the city, disorder and looting broke out. Gapon&#x27;s Assembly was closed down that day, and Gapon quickly left Russia with the assistance of writer and political activist Maxim Gorky.

===Reactions===
This event was seen by the British ambassador as inflaming revolutionary activities in Russia and contributing to the Revolution of 1905. Media commentary in Britain and the United States was overwhelmingly negative towards the actions of an already unpopular regime. The writer Leo Tolstoy was emotionally affected by the event, reflecting the revulsion of liberal, socialist and intellectual opinion within Russia itself.

==Consequences==

The immediate consequence of Bloody Sunday was a strike movement that spread throughout the country. Strikes began to erupt outside of St. Petersburg in places such as Moscow, Warsaw, Riga, Vilna, Kovno, Reval, Tiflis, Baku and Batum. In all, about 414,000 people participated in the work stoppage during January 1905. Tsar Nicholas II attempted to appease the people with a duma; however, the autocracy eventually resorted to brute force near the end of 1905 in order to curtail the burgeoning strike movement that continued to spread. Between October 1905 and April 1906, an estimated 15,000 peasants and workers were either hanged or shot; 20,000 were injured and 45,000 sent into exile.

Perhaps the most significant effect of Bloody Sunday was the drastic change in the attitude of the Russian peasants and workers. Previously the tsar had been seen as the champion of the people: in dire situations, the masses would appeal to the tsar, traditionally through a petition, and the tsar would respond to his people promising to set things right. The lower classes placed their faith in the tsar. Any problems that the lower classes faced were associated with the boyars of Russia; however, after Bloody Sunday the tsar was no longer distinguished from the bureaucrats and was held personally responsible for the tragedy that occurred.

Although the tsar was not at the Winter Palace and did not give the order for the troops to fire, he was widely blamed for the inefficiency and callousness with which the crisis had been handled. While it was unrealistic for the marchers to expect Nicholas to ride out into the Palace Square to meet them, his absence from the city, against at least some advice, reflects a lack of imagination and perception that he was to show on other occasions. The killing of people, many of whom had seen the tsar as their &quot;Little Father&quot;, resulted in a surge of bitterness towards Nicholas and his autocratic rule. A widely quoted reaction was &quot;we no longer have a Tsar&quot;.

==In culture==
Soviet actor, film director and screenwriter (1881–1933) told the story of Bloody Sunday in his 1925 silent feature film &quot;Devyatoe yanvarya&quot; (&quot;The Ninth of January&quot;). Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s 1957 11th Symphony, subtitled &quot;The Year 1905&quot;, is a programmatic work centered on Bloody Sunday. The second movement, entitled &quot;The Ninth of January&quot;, is a forceful depiction of the massacre. The sixth of Shostakovich&#x27;s 1951 &quot;Ten Poems on Texts by Revolutionary Poets&quot; (whose music the symphony quotes) is also called &quot;The Ninth of January&quot;. Shostakovich&#x27;s father and uncle were both present at the march that day, a year before the composer&#x27;s birth. Maxim Gorky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life of a Useless Man&quot; (1908) portrays the effects of Bloody Sunday on the Russian working class and operations of the spies employed by the tsar.

<doc id="444098" wikidata="Q4444797" url="?curid=444098" title="Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge">
<text>Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge ( ) is a fictional character in comedic stories by author P. G. Wodehouse. Ukridge appears in one novel and nineteen short stories.
Ukridge is a charismatic opportunist who will do anything to increase his capital—except, of course, work. The stories in which he appears generally involve his get-rich-quick schemes. Though Ukridge never achieved the popularity of the same author&#x27;s Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse retained a certain fondness for him, his last appearance in a Wodehouse story being as late as 1966. With completed new stories appearing over a span of 60 years, he is the longest-running of Wodehouse&#x27;s characters, topping Jeeves and Wooster (1915–1974, or 59 years) and the denizens of Blandings Castle (1915–1969, or 54 years).

== Inspiration ==

Robert Graves wrote that Wodehouse had based the character of Ukridge on Graves&#x27; brother Perceval, who was one of Wodehouse&#x27;s personal friends. Wodehouse himself, in a letter to Perceval, denies basing Ukridge on him; he says that Ukridge was based on a man named Craxton whom William Townend, Wodehouse&#x27;s friend of school days, had described to Wodehouse, and, on another man Wodehouse knew, named Westbrook. According to biographer Robert McCrum, Ukridge was inspired partly by Townend&#x27;s stories about his friend Carrington Craxton, and partly by Herbert Westbrook.

== Fictional biography==

=== Life ===

Ukridge&#x27;s early years (as recounted in &quot;Ukridge&#x27;s Dog College&quot;) were not proud times; expelled from school (later revealed to be Wrykyn) for sneaking out at night to attend a local fair (he had the forethought to wear a false beard, but omitted to remove his school cap), he travelled the world in various capacities, visiting a wide number of countries and getting himself in trouble in almost all of them. It is mentioned in &quot;Success Story&quot; that he had once been part of a squad conducting a raid on an illegal gambling establishment in America, and that he had been involved in other raids in other locales &quot;as a patron, as a waiter [and] as a washer of glasses.&quot;

At some point in his youth he was a schoolmaster at a private school, along with his friend Jeremy Garnet. His time in England seems to be mostly in a state of penury, although he has a wealthy aunt named Julia, who lives in the Wimbledon Common area and with whom he resides from time to time, generally upsetting by abusing her hospitality in some way.

In &quot;Love Among the Chickens&quot;, the events of which seem to occur some time after those of the shorts, Ukridge is married to Millie, a small young woman who is often described as looking like a little girl, but who is capable and cheerful despite her husband&#x27;s frequent financial troubles. The events leading to their engagement are recounted in the short story &quot;Ukridge Rounds a Nasty Corner&quot;.

=== Character ===

Standing around tall, with large ears and a loud voice, Ukridge makes a striking figure, generally found wearing worn grey flannel trousers and a golf coat with a bright yellow Mackintosh over it; his collar is rarely properly attached to his shirt, and his pince-nez glasses are held in place with wire from a ginger beer bottle. By way of contrast, he looks exceptionally smart in evening dress (generally borrowed without permission from his friend James &quot;Corky&quot; Corcoran, the narrator of most of the stories).

Ukridge has a fondness for whisky and cigars. He tends to address people as &quot;laddie&quot; or &quot;old horse&quot;, and his favourite exclamations are &quot;upon my Sam&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s a little hard&quot;, the latter summing up his view of the treatment life invariably seems to mete out to him, although he remains forever cheerful. He always has some visionary scheme which will win him fame and fortune, but is hampered by lack of capital; in borrowing from friends he exhorts them to have &quot;vision&quot; and to maintain the &quot;big, broad, flexible outlook&quot;.

Ukridge is forthright and opinionated, and likes to maintain a casual, informal atmosphere. Though rarely meaning to be rude, he often manages to offend those not used to his manner. People are overwhelmed by his personality and are persuaded to give him credit regularly, but become less civil when they find their bills unpaid. He can more than hold his own in a bar-room scrap.

He does occasionally win people over, the ex-butler Bowles who owns his friend James Corcoran&#x27;s apartment building being a quite mystifying case-in-point. Ukridge exhibits no snobbery, and is often pally with members of the lower orders, domestic staff, bookies, and chaps he meets in pubs. For a time Ukridge manages the boxer &quot;Battling&quot; Billson, whom he met at sea.

To those who count themselves his friends (foremost among them being Corcoran, who narrates the shorts, and Jeremy Garnet, narrator of &quot;Love Among the Chickens&quot;), Ukridge is a difficult and often exasperating companion, but one who is generally well-regarded. Corcoran has a lot of time for him, despite the ordeals he endures at his friend&#x27;s hand, and their old schoolfellow George Tupper, a man of some wealth and distinction in the Foreign Office, has some faith in his schemes and is often generous with funds.

He is generally at loggerheads with his fearsomely proper novelist aunt, Julia Ukridge, who lives in a big house off Wimbledon Common, but has occasional periods of reconciliation, which end when he exploits his position in her house to start another scheme.

<text>The International Peace Garden (French: &quot;Jardin international de la paix&quot;) is a park located adjacent to the International Peace Garden Border Crossing along the Canada–United States border between the province of Manitoba and the state of North Dakota. It was established on July 14, 1932, as a symbol of the peaceful relationship between the two countries.

The slogan &quot;Peace Garden State&quot; originates from the International Peace Garden, and was added to vehicle registration plates of North Dakota in 1956, In the next year, the North Dakota Legislative Assembly made the slogan an official state nickname.

==Features==
The park plants over 150,000 flowers each year. Main features of the garden include an floral clock display, and fountains. A chime and twin concrete towers straddled the border with a peace chapel at their base; the chapel walls were inscribed with notable quotations about peace. However, the concrete towers had been declared unsafe due to irreparable weather-related erosion and were demolished in 2017. As of 2018, a new tower was slated for construction on the spot.

The Arma Sifton bells are a chime of 14 bells cast by Gillett &amp; Johnston bellfounders. The bells were a gift from Central United Church of Brandon, Manitoba in 1972. The tower was supplied by North Dakota Veterans and dedicated in 1976. Some building remains of the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001, have been placed in part of the garden.

The Masonic Auditorium, built in the shape of a Masonic Square and Compasses, was completed in 1981 as a centennial project of Grand Lodges of Manitoba and North Dakota and features seating for 2,000 people. The Peace Garden Lodge of Freemasons holds an annual communication on the property. The officers, ritual and program are rotated each year between the Grand Lodges of Manitoba, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Saskatchewan.

The Peace Garden hosts two youth camps every summer, the International Music Camp and the Legion Athletic Camp. Additionally, it has hosted the International Hamfest, an amateur radio meet-up, every year since 1964.

Located at the garden is the North American Game Warden Museum.

The park lies near the center of the Turtle Mountain plateau, whose climate, topography, wildlife, and natural vegetation differ considerably from the surrounding prairies.

==Access==
The park is located north of Dunseith, North Dakota, at the northern terminus of U.S. Highway 281 in northwestern Rolette County. It is also adjacent to the southeast corner of Turtle Mountain Provincial Park in the Municipality of Boissevain – Morton, south of Boissevain, Manitoba, at the southern terminus of Manitoba Provincial Highway 10. Paid admission is required.

Visitors from either country can enter the park via US 281 or MB 10, without passing through customs, and may move throughout the park (crossing the international boundary at will) without restriction. However, the International Peace Garden Border Crossing stations for Canada and the U.S. are located on the roads just north and south (respectively) of the access drives for the garden, requiring all visitors – including those returning to the country from which they arrived – to go through the immigration procedures of their destination country upon leaving the garden.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–21, the garden was closed in April 2020; it reopened in May the same year, but with Canadian visitors subject to two weeks quarantine on return to their own country.

International Peace Garden Airport is located to the east of the garden on the U.S. side of the border.

<doc id="444104" wikidata="Q24620" url="?curid=444104" title="Due South">
<text>Due South is a Canadian crime comedy-drama television series created by Paul Haggis, and produced by Alliance Communications from its premiere on April 23, 1994, to its conclusion after four seasons on March 14, 1999. The series starred Paul Gross, David Marciano, Gordon Pinsent, Beau Starr, Catherine Bruhier, Camilla Scott, Ramona Milano, and Callum Keith Rennie. The show follows the adventures of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Constable Benton Fraser, who first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of his father, and has remained, attached as liaison with the Canadian Consulate. He works alongside a detective of the Chicago Police Department to solve crimes. Both are aided at times by Fraser&#x27;s deaf white wolf, Diefenbaker.

The show&#x27;s format mixed between elements of a police drama and comedy, derived from the stereotypical differences between Canadian and American culture at the time. It also included elements of fantasy derived from Gross&#x27; character being visited by the memory of his father who often provides mixed advice on situations. The series itself was mostly filmed in Toronto, and was assisted with financing on later seasons by the BBC, which aired episodes on British television.

==History==
&quot;Due South&quot; originally debuted as a television movie on CTV in Canada and CBS in the United States. After higher-than-anticipated ratings, &quot;Due South&quot; was turned into a continuing drama series in 1994. It was the first Canadian-made series to have a prime time slot on a major US network.

After the 24-episode first season, CBS cancelled the series, but the show&#x27;s success in Canada and the United Kingdom enabled the production company to raise enough money to mount a second thirteen-episode season, which ran from 1995 to 1996. The show was once again shown on CBS in late 1995 after many fall shows had failed (CBS ordered an additional five episodes, raising the number to eighteen, but broadcast only four of them), but CBS did not renew the series.

After a one-year hiatus, CTV revived the series in 1997 with international investment (from the BBC, ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, and TF1), and it ran for two further seasons, until 1999. In the United States, seasons three and four were packaged together as a single 26-episode season for syndication. Despite critical acclaim and a consistently warm reception by American audiences, &quot;Due South&quot; never became a huge hit in the United States; however, it was one of the most highly rated regular series ever broadcast by a Canadian network. The show remains popular in the United Kingdom, and became one of the few non-British shows to have a prime-time weeknight slot on BBC One.

===UK===
In the UK, &quot;Due South&quot; was first broadcast on Tuesday May 9, 1995, earning critical acclaim with comparisons to &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; and ratings of over eight million. The series continued on either a Tuesday or Friday every week except August until November 28, 1995. Season two was broadcast on Saturday nights from July 27, 1996 and fared similarly well, but was pulled from the schedules in mid October, with &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; taking its slot. The remaining 6 episodes were shown in January 1997, with the last episode going out on Easter Monday. The series was given a full repeat during the 1997 summer holidays each weekday morning.

The BBC helped co-finance the third series, however the BBC struggled to find a suitable slot on Saturday nights, with only six episodes being broadcast from May - July, with three further episodes before Christmas 1998, and a further two in early January 1999. From May 1999, the remaining episodes from series 3 and all of series 4 were broadcast until November 1999, on BBC Two and consistently performed well, with ratings of over two million viewers, regularly appearing in the top-ten weekly shows for the channel. Upon the end of the series in 1999, BBC Two immediately began to screen repeats, and the series ITV3 rescreened the series in 2006, while BBC Two from October 18, 2010, give the series another repeat run. A rerun on digital channel True Entertainment began on October 10, 2014, with the pilot, with regular-series episodes following on weekdays from October 13. When True Entertainment closed mid-2019 it was replaced with Sony Channel where the series was broadcast in full commencing late 2020.

==Premise==

The premise of the series centres on the exploits of Constable Benton Fraser, an officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who travels south to Chicago to initially solve the murder of his father, Sergeant Robert Fraser. However, during his investigation he inadvertently stumbles upon a scheme by several corrupt members of the RCMP that results in the shutdown of a new dam and the loss of many jobs, resulting in him being permanently stationed as a liaison officer in the Canadian consulate, which is depicted as a stand-alone building rather than as the 24th floor of Two Prudential Plaza. During his time in Chicago, Fraser works alongside Detective Raymond Vecchio - [Raymond Vecchio is a struggling police officer *Mr Armani] a tough, streetwise cop - in solving a series of cases around the city and occasionally across the border in Canada. After the second season, Fraser is forced to work alongside a second partner, Stanley Raymond Kowalski, who poses as Vecchio after he leaves to assist in an undercover operation.

Fraser often differs in his manners, including his politeness and honesty, and his methods of solving crimes, but is determined and dogged in pursuing and bringing down suspects, including his ability to predict where they might attempt to escape. Alongside his partner in the Chicago Police Department, Fraser is accompanied at times by a deaf lip-reading half-wolf named Diefenbaker, whom he adopted after the canine saved his life. After the first episode, Fraser finds himself visited by the ghost of his father Robert, whom only he can see, often providing mixed advice on his cases - with Robert appearing at random, infrequent moments up until the third series. The ghost then appears more frequently, often within the wardrobe of his son&#x27;s office at the consulate; anyone else who tries to follow merely finds Fraser.

In others, prominent city landmarks such as the CN Tower and the Union Station can be glimpsed. Part of the series was shot in Banff National Park, Alberta.

==Soundtrack==
The producers of &quot;Due South&quot; sought to showcase various Canadian artists within the show&#x27;s episodes, with many of the featured tracks released the CD soundtrack &quot;Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack&quot; (1996). Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s music was most prominently featured with no fewer than seven songs over the full run of the series; other recurring artists included The Headstones, Loreena McKennitt and Colin James. &quot;The Blue Line&quot; (episode #1.16) featured &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot;, the longtime theme song of CBC Television&#x27;s sports series &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

The show&#x27;s theme was written and composed by Jay Semko of The Northern Pikes (who recorded a version of the song with lyrics, played during the show&#x27;s closing credits) working with Jack Lenz and John McCarthy. Semko also scored the first two seasons of &quot;Due South&quot;. In November 1996, the first album was released, including an in-character soliloquy by Paul Gross on the subject of bravery, taken directly from the episode &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;.

When the show returned for its third season, Semko returned to complete the second soundtrack. The second soundtrack album, &quot;Due South, Volume II: The Original Television Soundtrack&quot;, was released in June 1998. Both albums are filled largely with the vocals used in the series.

=== &quot;Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack&quot; (1996) ===
The final scene of the series was set to Stan Rogers&#x27; &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, a classic Canadian folk song that has been referred to as an unofficial Canadian anthem.

Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack was a soundtrack album for the Canadian television series &quot;Due South&quot;, released by Nettwerk Records on October 1, 1996.

==Awards==
Over the three-season run of the series, &quot;Due South&quot; and its cast and crew earned a number of awards. Most significantly, the show earned 53 Canadian Gemini nominations, winning 15, including &quot;Best Dramatic TV series&quot; three years running (1995–1997), Paul Gross winning &quot;Best Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role&quot; two years running (1995–1996) and creator Paul Haggis winning &quot;Best Writing in a Dramatic Series&quot; the same two years.

==Critical reception==

Fraser&#x27;s methods, usually more sensitive and understanding than is typical for police work, gave the series a reputation for well-rounded characters. &quot;Variety&quot; critic Adam Sandler praised the acting of Gross and Marciano and attributed the &quot;show’s charm&quot; to the writers&#x27; development of the two lead characters&#x27; relationship. It was named as one of TV&#x27;s most underrated shows by &quot;The Guardian,&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; critic William Thomas reviewed season 1 and concluded that &quot;At its worst, &quot;Due South&quot; is a witty and well-written genre hit; at its best, it’s one of the most original and quietly influential shows of the mid-’90s.&quot;

A reviewer from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was less positive, finding the show&#x27;s portrayal of RCMP officers unrealistic and unfunny.

==Fan conventions==
A number of fan conventions were organized by &quot;Due South&quot; fans during the 1990s, the biggest and best-known of which was &quot;RCW 139&quot;, so named after the license plate number that recurred throughout the series. RCW 139 was held annually in Toronto between 1996 and 1999, attracting approximately 300 fans from more than 10 countries in both 1998 and 1999. The convention featured games, discussion panels, a formal dinner, and guest panels. Numerous cast and crew members have attended, including David Marciano (1998), Paul Gross (1999), Gordon Pinsent (1998), Tom Melissis (1997, 1998, 1999), Tony Craig (1997), Catherine Bruhier (1998, 1999) and Jay Semko (1998, 1999). Draco (Diefenbaker) and his trainer, Gail Parker, were guests in both 1998 and 1999.

After a nine-year hiatus, the convention was revived in 2008, with guest panels from David Marciano, Jay Semko, Tom Melissis, Catherine Bruhier, and Gail Parker with Cinder, Draco&#x27;s sister and stunt-double. Another convention was held in August 2010, with Paul Gross, Jay Semko, Tom Melissis, Camilla Scott, Tony Craig, Catherine Bruhier, and Ramona Milano.

RCW 139: From a Million Miles was held from August 17–19, 2012 in Toronto. This event included tours and dining in the Distillery District of Toronto and the Patrician Grill, both of which were frequently used for location filming.

RCW 139: Thank You Kindly was held from August 15–17, 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Due South.&quot; Catherine Bruhier, Ramona Milano, Tom Melissis, and Tony Craig, along with guest star Lisa Jakub (&quot;Chicago Holiday&quot; [#1.07/1.08]), appeared on the cast panel; assistant directors Michael Bowman and Woody Sidarous, costume supervisor Alex Kavanagh, and prop master Craig Williams formed the crew panel. Paul Haggis made an appearance via Skype chat. Included in the activities were a tour of the Distillery District, a bus tour of filming locations, a game of &quot;Due South Jeopardy&quot;, and a charity auction of props, scripts, costume pieces, and other series memorabilia. This was the first &quot;Due South&quot; convention to be webcast for the benefit of fans unable to attend.

She replies that &quot;He has gone South, Due South.&quot; The next scene shows Jarod participating in the RCMP Musical Ride.

<text>Enterobacteria phage T2 is a virus that infects and kills &quot;E. coli&quot;. It is in the genus &quot;Tequatrovirus&quot;, and the family &quot;Myoviridae&quot;. Its genome consists of linear double-stranded DNA, with repeats at either end. The phage is covered by a protective protein coat.

The T2 phage can quickly turn an &quot;E. coli&quot; cell into a T2-producing factory that releases phages when the cell ruptures. Experiments conducted in 1952 by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase demonstrated how the DNA of viruses is injected into the bacterial cells, while most of the viral proteins remain outside. The injected DNA molecules cause the bacterial cells to produce more viral DNA and proteins. These discoveries supported that DNA, rather than proteins, is the hereditary material.

The first phages that were studied in detail included seven that commonly infect &quot;E. coli.&quot; They were named Type 1 (T1), Type 2 (T2), etc., for easy reference; however, due to structural similarities between the T2, T4, and T6 bacteriophages, these are now commonly referred to as T-Even phages.

The phage can attach to the surface of a bacterium using the proteins on its &#x27;feet&#x27; (tail fibers), and inject its genetic material (either DNA or RNA). This genetic material uses the host cell&#x27;s ribosomes to replicate, and synthesize proteins for the capsid and tail of the phage. New phages are assembled within the cell until the cellular membrane &quot;lyses&quot; (splits open). The newly made phages are now free to attack more cells. This process is known as the Lytic cycle.

<text>The Emblem of Yemen depicts a golden eagle of Saladin with a scroll between its claws. On the scroll is written the name of the country in (&#x27;The Yemeni Republic&#x27;). The chest of the eagle contains a shield that depicts a coffee plant and the Marib Dam, with seven blue wavy stripes below. The flagstaffs on the right and left of the eagle hold the flag of Yemen.
==Historical emblems==

===North Yemen===
From 1945 to 1990, Yemen was split into North and South. The North had an emblem more similar to the present day one, and its shield has similarities with the shield of the former Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.

<text>Elminster Aumar is a fictional character appearing in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. He is also known as the Sage of Shadowdale, and is depicted as a powerful wizard featured in several novels by &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; creator Ed Greenwood. Certain aspects of his appearance and demeanor seem to echo Gandalf, Merlin, or Odin.

Elminster was one of the first characters that Greenwood created for the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. Information about him can be found in virtually all &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; game products, but the novels in &quot;The Elminster Series&quot; are perhaps the most definitive sources of information. The series includes &quot;&quot;, &quot;Elminster in Myth Drannor&quot;, &quot;The Temptation of Elminster&quot;, &quot;Elminster in Hell&quot;, and &quot;Elminster&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

==Basics==

===Appearance===
Elminster appears as a gray-bearded man of weathered visage, with a hawk-like nose and alert, dancing eyes. He speaks in a gruff tone and generally wears nondescript attire. He is almost always smoking a meerschaum pipe that spouts vile-smelling blue or green smoke.

===Personality===
Elminster is normally a witty, clever, and very charming man. He can, however, be imperious, grave, and terrible. Furthermore, he is a natural storyteller and a consummate actor. He rarely reveals the full extent of his true nature to anyone who is not an extremely close friend. He can portray himself as a trickster, rake, stern father figure, fool, or any other stereotype that he wants to assume, depending on what he wants to accomplish or what reaction he wants to elicit from those around him.

===Family===
Readers learn that Elminster has several daughters at the end of &quot;Elminster&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Besides Narnra Shalace, two others are Laspeera of the War Wizards and the dowager queen Filfaeril of Cormyr. He has no known wife, but retains contact with several previous lovers, including the goddess Mystra — although his relationship with Mystra changed when the goddess was slain during the Time of Troubles and the sorceress Midnight assumed the mantle of the Lady of Mysteries.

===Allies===
Elminster&#x27;s allies included the Harpers, the other Chosen of Mystra (especially the Simbul), and his scribe Lhaeo. The Knights of Myth Drannor were also close friends and confidants, and two or three knights were always in Shadowdale in case it was in peril.

==Media==
In &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; articles written by Ed Greenwood, Elminster often appeared as a wise sage imparting knowledge to a fictional interviewer. He divulged lore on various &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; monsters in &quot;The ecology of ...&quot; articles, such as &quot;The ecology of the ochre jelly&quot;. He was used as a source of information for Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;Pages from the Mages&quot; articles in which various spells were described, as well as various miscellaneous articles such as &quot;Cloaked in magic&quot;.

&quot;The Wizards Three&quot;, a series of short fiction pieces in &quot;Dragon&quot;, featured Elminster holding meetings with wizards from other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; settings. The metafictional conceit central to the series was that, unbeknownst to the other wizards, the meetings were being held in the home of real-world author Ed Greenwood. Greenwood himself was included in the stories as a character, sequestered in hidden locations in order to eavesdrop and take the notes from which the stories were supposedly written later.

==Novels==

===&quot;The Making of a Mage&quot;===
The first novel in &quot;The Elminster Series&quot;, &quot;&quot;, recounts the character&#x27;s origin story, which explains why he has such extensive and varied experience. Elminster was born around 212 DR to Elthryn, the lord of the village of Heldon and a prince of Athalantar, and his wife Amrythale, in the kingdom of Athalantar. His family was killed by a malaugrym posing as Undarl, one of the magelords of the ancient kingdom of Athalantar. Taking up his father&#x27;s broken sword, the Lion Sword, the symbol of the great king of the Stag Throne (who was Elminster&#x27;s grandfather), Elminster became a brigand.

He soon realized that he had no taste for killing, and gave it up when he went to become a burglar in the city of Hastarl, the capital of Athalantar. He met and became friends with Farl, a local thief, who knew Elminster as Eladar &quot;the Dark&quot;. They worked together frequently, eventually forming a gang dubbed the Velvet Hands in opposition to another local gang, the Moonclaws, who were servants of the magelords. Later, while eavesdropping on a possible thieving mark, Elminster met that era&#x27;s Magister, the wizard who bore the mantle of Azuth&#x27;s power. When asked if he was interested in learning sorcery, Elminster refused, hating all mages because of the magelords.

While in a temple, Elminster was visited by Mystra, the Goddess of All Magic. She spoke to and left the awestruck Elminster with the message that he should learn of magic and worship her. Soon thereafter, while he was still a young adult, Mystra transformed Elminster into a woman named Elmara to strengthen his bond with magic and to know what it is to be a woman. This change also allowed him to move within his enemies&#x27; circles without their knowledge that he was in fact the last surviving prince of Athalantar. For a few years, Elmara was a priestess of Mystra. Later, an avatar of Mystra (who went by the name Myrjala &quot;Darkeyes&quot;) trained Elmara in the ways of a mage and brought her to an ancient Netherese arcanist who taught Elmara a spell that would transform her back into Elminster. In the time that followed, Elminster learned much about magic from Myrjala, reaching the point where he could finish taking his revenge against the evil magelords who had usurped the kingdom. After a terrific battle, Elminster persevered and assumed the throne of Athalantar.

However, after regaining his kingdom, he passed the monarchy to Helm Stoneblade, a knight of Athalantar, stating that he had wanted to avenge his family&#x27;s death, not rule. As he and Myrjala left the kingdom, the so-called Mage Royal, Undarl, attacked them, and the sorceress revealed herself to be Mystra. She offered to make Elminster one of her Chosen, and he readily accepted.

===&quot;Elminster in Myth Drannor&quot;===
A sequel to &quot;Making of a Mage&quot;, &quot;Elminster in Myth Drannor&quot; takes place shortly afterwards. In this novel, Elminster travels to the city of Cormanthor. The book details the ancient elven society and its people, as well as highlighting Elminster&#x27;s continued magical studies, as he serves as an apprentice to a cruel and powerful wizard.

Elminster remains in Cormanthor for over two decades, and is present when the mythal is raised and the city is renamed Myth Drannor.

===&quot;The Temptation of Elminster&quot;===
&quot;The Temptation of Elminster&quot;
moves the timeline ahead several centuries. At the outset of the novel, Elminster emerges from a dusty tomb, after being trapped there in stasis for many years.

During much of this book, Elminster restricts his use of magic (on orders from Mystra) and he must again learn to survive by his wits and the skills he picked up earlier in his life. He later undergoes further magical training under the tutelage of a wicked sorceress who seeks to tempt him away from Mystra&#x27;s path.

Following the events of the novel, Elminster served as a foster parent to three of Mystra&#x27;s other Chosen: Laeral, Storm, and Dove. It is also suspected that he had something to do with the founding of Waterdeep, or at least with the organizing of the city&#x27;s lords.

===The Time of Troubles===
Elminster was instrumental in forming the Rangers Three, who aided him in recurring battles with the mysterious Shadowmasters during this time. Elminster also took time to defend Shadowdale from an army of Zhentarim led by the avatar of Bane. Bane and Elminster battled, and both were caught up in the spell that Elminster had called upon to dispose of the avatar. Elminster was originally thought to have been destroyed, but when he later reappeared it became apparent that he had merely been transported to another plane of existence for a time.

===The Avatar Crisis===
The forces of evil tried to rally in Elminster&#x27;s absence, but the other Chosen, the Knights of Myth Drannor, and the Rangers Three held them at bay until he returned. With the present crisis averted, all seemed calm, but the Shadowmasters had other ideas. Elminster and the Rangers Three, along with their allies, managed to frustrate and foil the plans of this race of shapeshifters.

Elminster also confronted the overgod, Lord Ao, over his instigation of the Time of Troubles while innocents were being killed. As the critical moment of the Time of Troubles approached, Mystra knew of what was to come and shed most of her power into the human wizard Midnight, so that all of her essence would not cease to exist. Since Elminster obtained his power from Mystra, this change left him personally powerless at a critical juncture.

He recruited one of the Rangers Three, Sharantyr, and they equipped themselves from Elminster&#x27;s cache of magical items. The two of them were later reunited with the other two members of the band, Itharr and Belkram, but even the Rangers Three could not prevent Elminster from being wounded in battle. Despite this setback, Elminster and the rangers, along with their allies, freed High Dale and defeated Manshoon of the Zhentarim. They also outlasted the Time of Troubles, and Elminster regained his magic.

===&quot;Elminster in Hell&quot;===
&quot;Elminster in Hell&quot; describes what happened after the floating city of Shade returned to Faerûn from the Plane of Shadow. The immortal rulers of the city came to Shadowdale, and one of the shadow princes was struck by Storm&#x27;s silver fire. The collision tore at the fabric of reality and created a rift to the Nine Hells. Elminster realized that the only way to close the portal before a legion of devils spilled forth onto Toril was to close it from the other side.

In the opening of &quot;Elminster in Hell&quot;, Elminster narrowly managed to close the portal at the expense of much of his magical strength. Once in Hell he was abducted and enslaved by an outcast Arch-Devil known as Nergal, who wished to discover the secret of Mystra&#x27;s silver fire. In the most graphic scenes of The Elminster Series, Elminster was subjected to brutal tortures, surviving only because of his exceptional endurance and ability to heal himself with silver fire. While the arch-fiend plundered Elminster&#x27;s thoughts and memories, Mystra became aware of her favorite servant&#x27;s plight and entered Hell herself to find him. Realizing that her presence in Hell was less than inconspicuous, due to the Pact Primeval that prohibits the presence of any god in the Nine Hells, Mystra retreated and dispatched more subtle agents to find him; first Halaster Blackcloak, the Mad Mage of Undermountain (who was defeated) and then the Simbul. After much searching, the Simbul found him, and together they defeated Nergal and returned home.

===&quot;Elminster&#x27;s Daughter&quot;===
&quot;Elminster&#x27;s Daughter&quot; takes place a few years after &quot;Elminster in Hell&quot;. A relatively light-hearted book when compared to the more violent &quot;Elminster in Hell&quot;, it focuses primarily on the life of one of Elminster&#x27;s children, Narnra Shalace.

Narnra is a thief who was raised by a single mother in Waterdeep. She eventually finds her way to Marsember and becomes involved in the intrigues of the Cormyrean nation. She also meets an old man who turns out to be Elminster, and learns that he is her father.

==Effects of the Spellplague==
Following the events of the Spellplague caused by the destruction of his patron, Mystra, Elminster lost much of his power but remained unaging. He continued to live in Shadowdale, but he became bitter and withdrawn.

==Other media==

===Video games===
Elminster is a featured character in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;gold box&quot; game &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot;, where he serves as the primary foil to the god Bane, who plots to steal the cities of the Realms. Elminster aids the player&#x27;s party from Limbo, offering advice and direction and shuttling them back and forth between the dimensions they must travel in order to undo Bane&#x27;s plot. He also serves as a trainer, equipment store and healer to the party. In the final climactic battle, Elminster is captured by the balor Gothmenes and dragged from Limbo to be used as a bargaining chip for the crystal of Bane, which the party has stolen. Elminster breaks free of the balor&#x27;s whip and battles him only to be swept into the Abyss as the party defeats Bane&#x27;s minions. When the party finally crushes Gothmenes, Elminster is rescued from the Abyss as the gods return reality to normal. He makes a final appearance to thank the party for rescuing him and implies that they are the only ones with knowledge of how close the Realms came to falling under Bane.

In the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; role-playing video game series, Elminster made brief and sporadic appearances to check on the protagonist&#x27;s progress and impart words of wisdom. In Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, he is part of the companion mission of Gale of Waterdeep, acting as an emissary between Mystra and Gale when the goddess needs to consult him (he appears as a simulacrum - a duplicate of the real Elminster created by magic, as opposed to actually appearing in person). 

Elminster was added to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot; in the &quot;Menace of the Underdark&quot; expansion.

In &quot;Neverwinter Online&quot;, Elminster ran the store for the &quot;Protector&#x27;s Jubilee&quot; event. He also appeared as the primary quest giver in &quot;Well of Dragons&quot;.

===Comic books===
Elminster is involved in the story arc &quot;Dragonreach&quot; in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; comics. He assists another wizard, Dwalimor Omen, in stopping an individual who was slaying dragons in the Realms.

==Reception==
In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken describes Elminster as &quot;the most powerful, important, and smartest wizard in the Forgotten Realms, and one of the setting&#x27;s most important characters [...] more Merlin than Gandalf, which makes him less enigmatic and prone to tomfoolery than other major fantasy wizards, which I count as a good thing.&quot;

<doc id="444113" wikidata="Q2175059" url="?curid=444113" title="U.S. Route 281">
<text>U.S. Route 281 (US 281) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway. At it is the longest continuous three-digit U.S. Route.

The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is at the International Peace Garden, north of Dunseith, North Dakota, at the Canadian border, where it continues as Highway 10. The route between Dunseith and the border is shared with North Dakota Highway 3. US 281 has two southern termini. The western terminus, known as International Blvd. in Hidalgo, begins from the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge. The southern eastern terminus of US 281 is in Brownsville, Texas, just short of the Mexican border ending on Bus. 77. The two spurs come together at South Cage Blvd in Las Milpas, Texas going north into Pharr, Texas. Thus, US 281 is the only continuous three-digit US route to extend from the Canadian border to the Mexican border.

The original &quot;Military Telegraph Road&quot; was incorporated into the US-281 route.

US 281 is a &quot;child&quot; of US 81. As a result of decommissioning portions of the parent route that have been superseded by concurrent Interstate Highways, the length of US 281 is greater than that of its parent. US 281 no longer connects to its &quot;parent&quot;, US 81.

==Route description==
===Texas===

US 281, beginning at the west, or the lower Rio Grande Valley, at an intersection with Business US 77 and SH 48 about from the Mexico border. It travels along close to the border through the Rio Grande Valley. At the east, or Upper Rio Grande Valley, turning north from Hidalgo, travelling through Las Milpas, Pharr, Edinburg, and many small towns while also having a Border Patrol checkpoint in Brooks County south of Falfurrias, Texas. It is alternating as a divided highway and main street, until joining I-37. It splits with I-37 and travels through Pleasanton as Business 281, travelling north to San Antonio. In San Antonio, US 281 overlaps I-410 on the south side of the city until the interchange with I-37. US 281 and I-37 then overlap north into downtown San Antonio until I-37 ends at I-35. US 281 continues north from downtown San Antonio as a freeway, intersecting I-410 again on the north side of the city, with access to the San Antonio International Airport. A project to construct a stack interchange at I-410 (the &quot;San Antonio Web&quot;) was completed June 9, 2008; formerly there was no direct access between the two freeways and surface streets were required travel between the freeways. North of San Antonio, US 281 is not a freeway and forms the Main Street of Blanco. It overlaps US 290 south of Johnson City. US 290 continues toward Austin, so US 281 and US 290 between San Antonio and Austin are available as a scenic and less congested alternate to I-35.

North of San Antonio, US 281 continues through central and north-central Texas, passing through many towns, including Stephenville, Mineral Wells and Jacksboro before reaching Wichita Falls, where the highway begins a concurrency with I-44 north across the Red River into Oklahoma.

===Oklahoma===
US 281 enters the state of Oklahoma at the Red River bridge north of Burkburnett, Texas on a route concurrent with I-44 starting in Wichita Falls. About north of the Red River, US 281 leaves I-44 at Randlett and follows a two-lane roadway parallel to the newer I-44, which becomes the Wichita Falls–Lawton section of the H.E. Bailey Turnpike, from Randlett to a point south of Lawton.

Through the Lawton/Fort Sill metropolitan area, US 281 again overlaps a toll-free section of I-44, while the former US 281 alignment through the city of Lawton is designated as Business US 281 between I-44 exits 34 and 39B. About north of downtown Lawton, US 281 departs from I-44 to continue north through the cities of Apache, Anadarko, Gracemont, Binger and Hinton. About north of its junction with I-40 near Hinton, US 281 crosses a 1930s-vintage 38-span steel pony truss bridge over the South Canadian River that served traffic of the former east–west US 66 before that highway was superseded by I-40 in the 1960s. A section of US 281&#x27;s paving from north of I-40 to a point south of Geary is the original concrete surface of US 66.

Through central and northern Oklahoma, US 281 then proceeds through the cities of Geary, Watonga, Seiling, Waynoka and Alva. The highway crosses the Kansas state line about north of Alva at Hardtner, Kansas.

===Kansas===

Passing largely through sparsely populated areas of central Kansas, US 281 enters the state at Hardtner in Barber County and passes through Medicine Lodge, Pratt, St. John and Great Bend, the only city along the route in Kansas which has more than 7,000 people. Along its venture through southern Kansas, US 281 intersects several major east–west routes: first US 54 and US 400, which heads east to Wichita and west to Dodge City, Garden City and Liberal; US 50, which veers east to Hutchinson and west to Garden City; and US 56, heading to Dodge City westbound and Overland Park eastbound.

Following a four-mile (6 km) concurrency with K-4 near Hoisington, the highway intersects I-70 at Russell before joining K-18 near Paradise for an concurrency.

The two highways split at Luray, and US 281 turns north into Osborne County, passing through the town of Osborne before joining US 24 and K-9 for another concurrency. US 281 joins US 36 at Smith Center, turning east before the two highways split; US 281 turns north for its final stretch in the state, passing through Lebanon. All sections of US 281 in Kansas are two-lane. The last stretches of the highway overlaid with bricks, through downtown Pratt and Hoisington, were recently resurfaced with concrete.

===Nebraska===
US 281 enters Nebraska south of Red Cloud and meets US 136 there. It continues north to Hastings and meets US 6 and US 34. Between Hastings and Grand Island, US 281 overlaps US 34 and is designated as the Tom Osborne Expressway after the former Nebraska Cornhuskers football coach and U.S. Representative, who is a native of Hastings.

At Grand Island, US 281 intersects I-80, loses US 34 and intersects US 30. US 281 continues north of Grand Island to St. Libory as American Legion Memorial Highway. From there northward, US 281 is a two-lane undivided highway passing mostly through unpopulated areas, with the exception of the regional trade center O&#x27;Neill, where it junctions US 20 and US 275. US 281 exits the state north of Spencer.

===South Dakota===
US 281 enters South Dakota in Gregory County. Just north of the South Dakota-Nebraska border, it is cosigned with US 18. It crosses the Missouri River at Fort Randall Dam. Just south of Armour, US 18 leaves the US 281 alignment. North of Armour, US 281 makes a short jaunt west on South Dakota Highway 44, then continues north. US 281 and I-90 intersect at Plankinton. On both sides of Wolsey, US 14 is cosigned with US 281 for a stretch of - from 3 miles south of Wolsey to 4 miles north of town. US 281 becomes an expressway at South Dakota Highway 20. This expressway continues through Aberdeen to a point near Westport. South Dakota Highway 10 is cosigned with US 281 for near Barnard. It exits the state north of Frederick.

US 281 was recently realigned in the city of Aberdeen. A bypass was built that travels on the west side of Aberdeen, and the US 281 designation was moved onto that new roadway. It runs north from US 12 and connects with the old alignment south of 24th Avenue Northeast.

The South Dakota section of US 281, with the exception of concurrencies with US 18 and US 14, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-229.

===North Dakota===

In North Dakota, US 281 is a major north–south artery. It enters south of Ellendale and intersects I-94 and US 52 at Jamestown. US 281 and US 52 remain paired together to Carrington. From there, US 281 continues northward through Sheyenne. north of Sheyenne, the highway curves in order to go around Devil&#x27;s Lake, and it then continues to west of Minnewaukan, North Dakota. From there it goes to North Dakota Highway 5 at Rocklake. US 281 follows ND 5 westward to Dunseith, where the highway turns north in concurrence with North Dakota Highway 3 to its end at the Canadian border in the International Peace Garden. The northernmost section of US 281 passes through North Dakota&#x27;s Turtle Mountains. Recently, US 281 was rebuilt near Minnewaukan, North Dakota to accommodate flooding close to the city.

==Future==
US 281 will be upgraded between US 59 in George West in Texas to I-2 in Pharr to become I-69C, a spur of I-69. An segment exists running from Business US 281 in Edinburg to I-2 in Pharr.

US 281 between Grand Island and St. Paul in Nebraska is planned to be a four-lane expressway for its entire length. Currently, some sections are still two lanes, with stubs and grading in place for expansion to four lanes in these areas.

==Bypass==

U.S. Route 281 Alternate was a long alternate of U.S. Route 281 running within the northeastern and eastern portions of Great Bend, Kansas. US-281 Alternate was formed in 1955 and was decommissioned about 1983. Since then it has been known as US 281 Bypass, which is mostly unsigned, two-lane surface highway bypasses downtown Great Bend. The only visible indication of this being a bypass is via street signs along intersecting streets; thus it is not a true bypass route, but a local street that is named as a bypass.

===Route description===

281 Bypass begins its journey near the intersection of 10th (US-56/K-96/K-156) and Pine Streets. 10th Street, which is normally east–west, travels slightly southwest-northeast for one block with its intersection with the bypass.

The bypass travels mostly to the northwest until near Park and Frey Streets. Then, it steers towards the north-northwest.

After intersecting with 22nd Street, 281 Bypass starts to curve to the west until it intersects with 24th Street. It remains unsigned on 24th Street until its northwestern terminus with its parent route on Main Street (US-281). The northwestern terminus of U.S. Highway 281 Bypass is directly adjacent to Brit Spaugh Park in Great Bend.

<doc id="444118" wikidata="Q77311" url="?curid=444118" title="Helmut Jahn">
<text>Helmut Jahn (January 4, 1940 – May 8, 2021) was a German-American architect, known for projects such as the Sony Center on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany; the Messeturm in Frankfurt, Germany; the Thompson Center in Chicago; One Liberty Place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Suvarnabhumi Airport, in Bangkok, Thailand, among others.

His recent projects included 50 West Street, a residential tower in New York City in 2016 and the ThyssenKrupp Test Tower in Rottweil, Germany in 2017. He was also behind 1000M in Chicago which began construction in 2019.

==Life and career==
Jahn was born January 4, 1940, in Zirndorf, near Nuremberg, Germany. His father, Wilhelm Anton Jahn, was a schoolteacher in special education. His mother, Karolina Wirth, was a housewife. Jahn grew up watching the reconstruction of the city, which had been largely destroyed by Allied bombing campaigns.

He studied architecture at the Technical University of Munich from 1960 to 1965, and worked with for a year after graduation. In 1966, he went to Chicago to further study architecture under Myron Goldsmith and Fazlur Khan at the Illinois Institute of Technology on a Rotary Scholarship, earning a Master&#x27;s degree in 1967.

===Murphy/Jahn===
Jahn joined Charles Francis Murphy&#x27;s architecture firm, C. F. Murphy Associates, in 1967 and was appointed Executive Vice President and Director of Planning and Design of the firm in 1973. He took sole control in 1981, renaming the firm Murphy/Jahn (even though Murphy had retired). Murphy died in 1985.

===Death===
Jahn was killed after being hit by two cars on May 8, 2021, while riding his bicycle in Campton Hills, a suburb of Chicago. The collision happened near his home and horse farm in St. Charles, Illinois, a Chicago suburb.

==Architectural style and influences==
Generally inspired by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, yet opposed to the doctrinal application of modernism by his followers, in 1978, Jahn became the eighth member of the Chicago Seven. His architectural style shifted from the modernism of the Miesian tradition to a postmodernist one with high-tech stylizations. Jahn established his reputation in 1985 with the State of Illinois Center in Chicago which prompted him to be dubbed &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. In addition to the main seat in Chicago, the company has offices in Berlin and Shanghai.

On October 26, 2012, Helmut Jahn renamed Murphy/Jahn to simply JAHN.

==Personal life==

Jahn was interested in yachting, and in the late 1990s owned at least three yachts named &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (one of his nicknames). In 1995, Jahn&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon 2&quot; won the annual Chicago to Mackinac Race, the oldest freshwater yacht race in the world. In 1998, Jahn invited his fellow Vietnam War veteran, George Henry, to race with him in the Waterbury Channel Open. In 1997, &quot;Flash Gordon 3&quot; won the Admiral&#x27;s Cup. It was the Farr 40 design yacht called &quot;Flash Gordon 6&quot; that he had the most success winning the 2012 Farr 40 World Championship and they captured three straight North American Championship between 2015 and 2017. 

He married Deborah Ann Lampe, an interior designer, in December 1970. Their son Evan was born in 1978.

<text>Muharram () is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the four sacred months of the year when warfare is banned. It precedes the month of Safar. The tenth of Muharram is known as Ashura, an important day of commemoration in Islam. For Sunni Muslims, the day marks the parting of the Red Sea by Moses and the salvation of the Israelites, celebrated through supererogatory fasting and other acceptable expressions of joy. By contrast, Ashura is a day of mourning for Shia Muslims, who annually commemorate the death of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the third Shia imam. Husayn was killed, alongside most of his relatives and his small retinue, in the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE against the army of the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (). The Shia rituals span the first ten days of Muharram, culminating on Ashura with mourning processions in Shia cities. Also in Muharram, the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem was initially set as the direction of prayer for early Muslims.

==Origins==
Muharram () is the first month of the Islamic calendar, with (at most) thirty days. Warfare in Muharram is forbidden and it has been so since before the advent of Islam. The word is short for &quot;Muharram Safar&quot; (), which distinguishes in the ancient Arab calendar between Safar I, which was sacred, and Safar II, which was not. Over time, however, the adjective itself became the name of the first month of the year.

== Ashura ==
Tenth of Muharram is known as Ashura, an important day of commemoration in Islam. For Sunni Muslims, Ashura marks the parting of the Red Sea by Moses and the salvation of the Israelites. Also on this day, Noah disembarked from the Ark, God forgave Adam, and Joseph was released from prison, among various auspicious events on Ashura in Sunni tradition. Ashura is celebrated in Sunni Islam through supererogatory fasting, and also other pious acts and acceptable expressions of joy. In some Sunni communities, the annual Ashura festivities include carnivals, bonfires, and special dishes, even though some Sunni scholars have criticized such practices.

By contrast, for Shia Muslims, Ashura is a day of mourning as they commemorate the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the third Shia imam. Husayn refused on moral grounds to pledge his allegiance to the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya () and was subsequently killed, alongside most of his male relatives and his small retinue, by the Umayyad army in the Battle of Karbala on Ashura 61 AH (680 CE). Among the Shia, mourning for Husayn is viewed as an act of protest against oppression, and as such a struggle for God (). Mourners also hope to secure the intercession of Husayn in the afterlife. Ashura is observed annually through mourning gatherings, processions, and reenactments. 
==Timing==

The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the lunar year (of twelve lunar months) is eleven or twelve days shorter than the solar year. Muharram days are different in consecutive solar years.

== Battle of Karbala ==

* 2 Muharram: Arrival of Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala, Iraq, in 680. On their way to the nearby Kufa, Husayn and his small caravan were intercepted by the Umayyad army and eventually forced to camp in the desert lands of Karbala, away from water and fortifications.

* 7 Muharram: The Umayyad army cut off Husayn&#x27;s access to the drinking water of the nearby Euphrates river. Under the siege, Husayn&#x27;s camp suffered from thirst and hunger in the coming days.
* 9 Muharram (Tasu&#x27;a): Negotiations between Husayn and the Umayyads failed on this day in 680. The Umayyad commander Umar ibn Sa&#x27;d () was set to attack after the afternoon prayer on Tasu&#x27;a but was persuaded to delay the confrontation until the following day. Husayn and his men spent the night in prayer.
* 10 Muharram (Ashura): The Battle of Karbala was fought on this day in 680. Husayn and most of his male relatives and his small retinue were slaughtered by the Umayyad army by the end of the day. After the battle, the women and children in Husayn&#x27;s camp were taken prisoner and marched to the Umayyad capital Damascus in Syria.

==Other Islamic events==
* 1 Muharram: Death of Caliph Umar () by injuries from the attack of Persian slave Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz. Sunnis carry rallies on 1 Muharram to commemorate Umar.
* 210 Muharram: Most mourning rituals for Karbala take place during the first ten days of Muharram, culminating on the tenth with processions in major Shia cities.
* 5 Muharram: Baba Farid, a Punjabi Sufi saint, died on this day in 1266. His death is celebrated (&quot;urs&quot;) for six days during Muharram, in Pakpattan, Pakistan.
* 8 Muharram: In what became known as the 1782 Muharram Rebellion, on this day Bengali Muslims in Sylhet staged one of the earliest anti-British uprisings in the Indian subcontinent.
*16 Muharram: On this day, the Islamic prophet Muhammad set the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem as the , towards which early Muslims prayed. This was superseded later by the ancient Ka&#x27;ba sanctuary in Mecca in connection with verse 2:144 of the Quran, the central religious text in Islam.
* 17 Muharram: Arrival of the &quot;people of the elephant&quot; in Mecca, a reference to al-Fil (), a (chapter) in the Quran.

<text>Noodling is fishing for catfish using one&#x27;s bare hands or feet, and is practiced primarily in the southern United States. The noodler places their hand or foot inside a discovered catfish hole in order to catch the fish. Other names for the same activity are used in different regions, primarily in the South and Midwest, and include hogging, dogging, grappling, grabbling, tickling, and catfisting.

The term &quot;noodling&quot;, although today used primarily towards the capture of flathead catfish, can and has been applied to all hand fishing methods, regardless of the method or species of fish sought. The origin of the term is unknown. Noodling as a term has also been applied to various unconventional methods of fishing, such as any which do not use bait, rod and reel, speargun, etc., but this usage is much less common. The term has also been applied to the similar capture of snapping turtles.

Due to concerns over the safety of noodlers and sustainability of fish populations, the technique is illegal in some states where it was once traditionally practiced. , it was legal in some form in fourteen states, sometimes with restrictions on the species or sizes of fish, and on the specific methods that may be employed: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. It has since been legalized in Texas and West Virginia.

==Method==
Although the concept of catching fish with only the use of the arm or foot in the water is simple, the process of noodling is more complicated. The choice of catfish as the prey is not arbitrary, but comes from the circumstances of their habitat. During the spawn, catfish will dig or enter a hole underneath a structure submerged in the water. The female will lay the eggs in the hole and the male will guard the eggs. When the eggs become fry, they will leave and the male will also leave the hole. To begin, a noodler goes underwater to depths ranging from only a few feet to and places their hand inside a discovered catfish hole. If all goes as planned, the catfish will swim forward and latch onto the fisherman&#x27;s hand, usually as a defensive maneuver, in order to try to escape the hole. If the fish is particularly large, the noodler can hook the hand around its gills.

Noodlers often have spotters who help them bring the catfish in, either to shore or to their boat; noodling in pairs is considered important for safety, and also makes it a more social activity, with noodling partners often forming long-term partnerships. 

The Oklahoma lake record catfish that was caught by noodling weighed 87.85 pounds (39.85 kg), was long, and in girth. A typical weight for a flathead catfish caught by noodling is 40 lb (18 kg).

==In popular culture==
Noodling is just one name used for fishing with your hands or feet, but there are other names for it that are derived from different cultures. The activity is most common in the southern and midwestern United States. 

The sport of noodling in popular culture has been featured or referred to in various television programs, including &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; (1989), &quot;Okie Noodling&quot;, which was televised in two-parts on PBS (2001), &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; on the Discovery Channel (2003), &quot;River Monsters&quot; on Animal Planet (2012), and &quot;Mudcats&quot; (2012) on the History Channel. It also received media attention in the American sitcom &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, and in the animated sitcoms, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;The Redneck on Rainey Street&quot;, and the 12th episode of &quot;Ben 10: Omniverse&quot;, &quot;Gone Fishin&quot;. An episode of &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; YouTube series titled &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot; (2019) featured Brad Leone and Matty Matheson noodling.

Noodling was also featured in the 2009 movie &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; with Keri Russell as a noodler, in the 2009 film &quot;Fish Tank&quot;, and in the 2016 movie &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;.

The Noodler&#x27;s brand of fountain pen ink was named in reference to noodling, described as &quot;a southern sport that attempts to equalize the struggle between man and animal in the quest for a sense of fair play&quot;, and included bottles of ink with images of catfish on the label.

Noodling on guitar is freestyle, in the moment playing, where one explores seemingly random notes and relies more on trial and error and intuition than rigid musical systems and rules.

==Dangers==
Other than drowning, or being injured by underwater hazards, noodlers face other physical threats, including the potential for fatal injury caused by other forms of aquatic life that may be residing in the abandoned holes of cavity spawning catfish, such as snapping turtles, snakes, beavers, and alligators. Loose fitting clothes may get tangled or snagged on roots or rocks, and various physical injuries may be incurred while underwater, ranging anywhere from superficial wounds to losing fingers. Several articles suggest precautionary measures, such as using the buddy system, wearing tight clothing that hugs the skin, and inspecting potential holes with a stick. Other recommendations include noodling shirtless or while wearing a short sleeve shirt, to wear gloves that offer some level of protection for one&#x27;s hands, and to not wear any jewelry. 

The mortality rate per capita for noodling indicates that it is extremely dangerous in comparison to other forms of fishing. Noodling related deaths have been reported.

<text>Stephen Simpson Hillage (born 2 August 1951) is an English musician, best known as a guitarist. He is associated with the Canterbury scene and has worked in experimental domains since the late 1960s. Besides his solo recordings he has been a member of Uriel, Khan, Gong and System 7.

==History==
===Bands 1968–75===
Hillage was born in Chingford, which was then in Essex but is now part of Greater London. Whilst still at school, he joined his first band, a blues rock band called Uriel, with Dave Stewart, Mont Campbell and Clive Brooks. The band split up in 1968 with the other members going on to form Egg, but they briefly re-united under assumed names to record the album &quot;Arzachel&quot; in 1969. Hillage also guested on Egg&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;The Civil Surface&quot;.

In 1969, Hillage began studies at the University of Kent in Canterbury, befriending local bands Caravan and Spirogyra and occasionally jamming with them. Meanwhile, he wrote songs and, by late 1970, had accumulated enough material for an album. Caravan put him in touch with their manager Terry King, who got Hillage signed with Deram on the basis of a demo of his material recorded with the help of Dave Stewart of Egg. In early 1971, Hillage formed Khan with bassist/vocalist Nick Greenwood, formerly of Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Although future Gong and Hatfield and the North drummer Pip Pyle was involved in the early stages, the line-up finally settled with the inclusion of organist Dick Heninghem and drummer Eric Peachey, both of whom had recently collaborated on Greenwood&#x27;s solo project &quot;Cold Cuts&quot;, recorded in California in 1970 but belatedly released in 1972.

Following a series of concerts throughout 1971, several of them supporting label mates Caravan, Khan began recording their debut album in November, by which time Heninghem had left, forcing Hillage to bring in his former bandmate Dave Stewart to play the keyboard parts. By the time &quot;Space Shanty&quot; came out in May 1972, Canadian Val Stevens (formerly of Toronto&#x27;s popular soul-rock band Grant Smith &amp; The Power) had filled the vacancy, making his debut on a short European tour (including a televised appearance at the Montreux Festival) and continuing with a UK tour supporting Caravan in June.

By then, musical disagreements between Hillage and Greenwood culminated with the latter&#x27;s departure. Hillage decided to form a new line-up with a slightly different direction, retaining the services of Peachey and asking Stewart back, and adding Nigel Griggs (later of Split Enz) on bass. New compositions by Hillage and Stewart were added to the repertoire, including &quot;I Love Its Holy Mystery&quot;, which would form the basis of Hillage&#x27;s later &quot;Solar Musick Suite&quot;. Hillage broke up the band in October 1972.

Hillage promptly joined Kevin Ayers&#x27; new live band Decadence, participating in Ayers&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Bananamour&quot; (Harvest, May 1973) and touring the UK and France for two months. Having in the meantime become a fan of Gong after meeting Daevid Allen, hearing &quot;Camembert Electrique&quot; and Allen&#x27;s solo album &quot;Banana Moon&quot;, as well as meeting his longtime partner Miquette Giraudy through Allen, Hillage stayed in France after the Ayers tour to join the band.

In January 1973, he took part in the sessions for &quot;Flying Teapot&quot;, the first installment of the &quot;Radio Gnome&quot; trilogy, and soon after graduated to full-time membership with the departure of bassist/lead guitarist Christian Tritsch. The &#x27;classic&#x27; line-up of Gong was now in place, with Daevid Allen, Gilli Smyth, Didier Malherbe, Tim Blake, Mike Howlett and Pierre Moerlen, and recorded two further albums, &quot;Angels Egg&quot; and &quot;You&quot; (the latter also featuring Giraudy).

In June 1973, Hillage (along with Pierre Moerlen) participated in the debut live performance of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; at Queen Elizabeth Hall. Both Hillage and Moerlen also took part in a live-in-studio performance filmed for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Second House&quot; series, filmed in November 1973. The BBC performance is available on Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; DVD.

From August 1974 to February 1975 Hillage worked on his debut solo album &quot;Fish Rising&quot; at Manor Studios with the group, less Allen and Smyth, and contributions from others such former as Khan bandmate Dave Stewart.

Blake left Gong at the beginning of 1975 due to tensions with Allen, then Allen abruptly left in April. Hillage continued with the group, but he increasingly became uncomfortable feeling that Virgin wanted him to assume a leadership role which he saw at odds to the group&#x27;s communal essence. After a Marquee gig on 21 December, he left to set-up his own band, although he did contribute to the sessions of their next album &quot;Shamal&quot;.

===Solo 1976–79===

For his first post-Gong solo work, Hillage and Giraudy relocated to Woodstock, New York in May and June 1976 to record with Todd Rundgren and his band Utopia on &quot;L&quot;, which included covers of &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot; that became integral to his live set. The album was released on 24 September and spent 12 weeks on the UK album chart peaking at #10. Needing to tour to promote the album, he put together a band with Christian Boulé (guitar), Clive Bunker (drums), Colin Bass (bass), Phil Hodge (keyboards) and Basil Brooks (synthesiser, flute). They debuted supporting Queen at a free Hyde Park, London concert on 18 September, then toured heavily in the UK and France to promote the album including a BBC Radio 1 &quot;In Concert&quot; broadcast. In January and February 1977 they supported Electric Light Orchestra on their US tour and appeared on the German television music programme Rockpalast in March.

In May 1977, Hillage was part of a live performance of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; in Glasgow with the Scottish National Orchestra. He participated in the Gong re-union concert in Paris as part of the trilogy band, a solo set and also accompanied Blake. In late summer, Hillage produced Nik Turner&#x27;s &quot;Xitintoday&quot; album which featured contributions from other Gong members, Harry Williamson and drummer Andy Anderson. Hillage also contributed to Williamson&#x27;s protest single &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot; issued as The Radio Actors with lead vocals by Sting.

During the US tour Hillage had taken an interest in funk music and became disheartened that he was being perceived as &quot;progressive rock&quot; and so deliberately chose to move in that direction. He had met Malcolm Cecil of Tonto&#x27;s Expanding Head Band who he felt may help in his pursuit of a new style and in July they entered the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles to record &quot;Motivation Radio&quot;. A new band was put together with Reggie McBride on bass and Joe Blocker on drums, although Curtis Robertson Jr. took over bass duties for the live dates. The album was issued in September and the band toured through to November visiting Germany, France and the UK.

Retaining his touring band, from December into February 1978 he recorded the album &quot;Green&quot; co-produced with Nick Mason at Ridge Farm Studio and Britannia Row Studios. For the supporting tour, he refreshed his band with Anderson (who had made an appearance on the album) being joined by John McKenzie on bass and Boulé rejoining from the &quot;L&quot; touring band. On 25 August, Hillage guested with Sham 69 during their performance at the Reading Festival,

Hillage felt he was nearing exhaustion by mid-1978 so chose to reflect on the live shows that had been recorded and compile the album &quot;Live Herald&quot;. With Anderson and McKenzie from the &quot;Green&quot; tour, he recorded some studio sessions at the end of the year to be included on one side of the album, then promoted its February 1979 release with live dates including an appearance on &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot; and a BBC Radio 1 &quot;In Concert&quot; broadcast.

In January 1979, Hillage and Giraudy recorded the commissioned album &quot;Rainbow Dome Musick&quot; at Om Studios, consisting of two side-long beatless instrumentals described as &quot;a relaxing and pleasantly divergent journey through a sorted spectrum of instruments&quot;. The album was issued on 13 April and performed for the &quot;Festival for Mind Body and Spirit&quot; at Olympia London that month. Rainbow Dome was a concept created by Rupert Atwill.

Stewart and Paul Francis joined, replacing Boulé and McKenzie respectively, and this line-up played the 1979 Glastonbury Festival. The group recorded &quot;Open&quot; at Ridge Farm Studio in August with a guest contribution from Jean-Philippe Rykiel. The album was released on 12 October followed by a tour of the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands through to December.

===Producer 1980–89===
During the 1980s, Hillage worked as a record producer, working for artists such as Simple Minds, It Bites, Murray Head, Nash the Slash, Real Life, Cock Robin, Tony Banks and Robyn Hitchcock.

In 1982, Hillage and Giraudy issued the albums &quot;For To Next&quot; and &quot;And Not Or&quot;, the last studio albums issued under Hillage&#x27;s own name. The titles were derived from BASIC programming language and reflect the pair&#x27;s movement into computer-based music production, this being mainly synthetic except for Hillage&#x27;s guitar.

He returned to producing in the 1990s, working on The Charlatans 1994 album &quot;Up to Our Hips&quot;.

===Electronica 1989–present===

After hearing the likes of The Orb playing his 1979 ambient record &quot;Rainbow Dome Musick&quot;, Hillage and Giraudy began performing in the early 1990s as ambient dance act System 7. They soon became part of the underground dance scene in London and Hillage was also a key figure in getting the Glastonbury Festival to recognise the dance scene and set up the Dance Tent, which he programmed in its first year. Hillage also produced in the 1990s a raï musical show called &#x27;1, 2, 3 Soleils&#x27;, featuring Algerian singers Faudel, Rachid Taha and Khaled. He also arranged many songs of Latifa. 
In November 2006, he made a surprise return to the Gong fold when he and Giraudy performed with (most of) the &quot;classic era&quot; lineup of Gong performing a set consisting almost entirely of material from the Radio Gnome Trilogy and Camembert Electrique at the Gong Unconvention at the Melkweg in Amsterdam.

In January 2007, four of his albums – &quot;Fish Rising&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;Motivation Radio&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Dome Musick&quot; – were released in the UK remastered on CD, each, except the latter, with previously unreleased bonus tracks. In February 2007, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Live Herald&quot;, &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;For To Next/And Not Or&quot; followed, similarly remastered with bonus content.

Hillage and Giraudy&#x27;s participation in the Gong Unconvention was reprised in a small number of concerts held by Gong in London in June 2008, where Hillage and Giraudy were among the line-up which also included Daevid Allen, Gilli Smyth, and Mike Howlett. At these concerts, Hillage would often open the show performing &quot;Steve Hillage Band&quot; material, as he had at the Uncon. Hillage and Giraudy worked most recently on their 2009 album 2032 (which Hillage also produced), and has continued to tour with the band throughout 2009 and 2010. After the 2010 tour, citing musical differences, Steve &amp; Miquette again parted ways with Gong.

His next association with Gong was a guest guitar solo on the title track of their 2016 album &quot;Rejoice! I&#x27;m Dead&quot;, their first album recorded after the death of Daevid Allen. Though no longer featuring any original members, the current lineup of Kavus Torabi (guitar/vocals), Fabio Golfetti (guitar/vocals), Dave Sturt (bass), Ian East (saxophone/flute) and Cheb Nettles (drums/vocals) had the blessing of Allen (along with the blessing of other surviving members) to continue using the Gong name. Soon after, Hillage made a few guest appearances at Gong gigs (sometimes being billed as &quot;Gong featuring Steve Hillage&quot;), culminating in late 2018 with the announcement that Hillage &amp; Giraudy had tapped the current lineup of Gong to be their backing band/opening act for a series of Steve Hillage Band shows in 2019. Continued touring plans for 2020, however, were halted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hillage also collaborated with Ozric Tentacles on the 2004 album &quot;Spirals in Hyperspace&quot;.

Hillage played live with Hawkwind in December 2015 at The Coronet, London, and also played a one-hour set with Dave Brock and Tim Blake of the band at Hawkwind&#x27;s Hawkeaster festival in Morecambe, Lancashire at Easter, 2018.

&quot;Light in the Sky&quot;, from his 1977 album &quot;Motivation Radio&quot;, was used as the theme for &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot; on Channel 4.

Hillage played on a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot; on William Shatner&#x27;s 2011 release &quot;Seeking Major Tom&quot;.

Hillage won the &quot;Visionary&quot; award at the 2013 Progressive Music Awards.

<text>Come Back, Little Sheba is a 1950 play by the American dramatist William Inge. Inge wrote the play while he was a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis.

==Plot==
Set in the Midwestern house of Lola and Doc Delaney, the plot centers on how their life is disrupted by the presence of a boarder, Marie, a college art student who has a keen interest in the young men around her.

Middle-aged Lola engages in mild flirtations with the milkman and the mailman. She sees in Marie a younger version of herself and encourages her pursuit of her hometown boyfriend, the wealthy Bruce, but also her classmate, the athletic Turk.

Doc, a chiropractor, abandoned a different career in medicine when he married a pregnant Lola, who subsequently lost the baby.

A recovering alcoholic, Doc maintains a precarious sobriety. To him, Marie represents youth and opportunities long gone; seeing her with Turk brings out resentments against Lola for ruining his life. Ultimately these feelings cause him to fall off the wagon, and act violently toward Lola. Frightened, she calls Doc&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, who comes to collect Doc and take him to a state asylum where he can be sobered up. When he comes back four days later, Marie has married Bruce and left, and he and Lola reconcile.

The title refers to Lola&#x27;s missing dog, who disappeared before the play&#x27;s opening and remains gone throughout the story. Lola hopes for the puppy&#x27;s return throughout the play by calling &quot;Come back, little Sheba&quot; daily from the front door, but eventually faces reality and gives up on Sheba&#x27;s return.

==Productions==
The play premiered at the Westport Country Playhouse. Presented by the Theatre Guild and directed by Daniel Mann, the first Broadway production premiered at the Booth Theatre on February 15, 1950, and ran 190 performances. The opening night cast included Shirley Booth as Lola, Sidney Blackmer as Doc, and Joan Lorring as Marie. Booth won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, and Blackmer won Best Actor.

Reprising her Broadway role, Booth starred opposite Burt Lancaster as Doc and Terry Moore as Marie in a 1952 film adaptation. Booth won both the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress and Best Actress - Drama Golden Globe for her portrayal of Lola.

In 1974, Clint Ballard Jr. and Lee Goldsmith adapted the play for the musical stage. Kaye Ballard portrayed Lola in the Chicago tryout, but the production never reached Broadway as planned. In 2001, it was revived under the title &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; at the White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut, with Donna McKechnie as Lola. A recording of this production was released by Original Cast Records.

A 1977 television version starred Laurence Olivier as Doc, Joanne Woodward as Lola, and Carrie Fisher as Marie. Granada Television produced the film as part of its &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; anthology series. In 2006, Acorn Media released the film as part of a DVD set with six other productions from the series.

In 1984, the Roundabout Theatre Company mounted an Off Broadway revival, directed by Paul Weidner and starring Shirley Knight as Lola, Philip Bosco as Doc, Mia Dillon as Marie, Steven Weber as Bruce, and Kevin Conroy as Turk. In his review in &quot;Time&quot;, William A. Henry III observed: &quot;Like all of Inge&#x27;s best plays, &quot;Sheba&quot; is slight of plot but musky with atmosphere...Middle age is portrayed as a time of aching sexual frustration, made more acute by the close-at-hand vision of youth...Inge did not transform his characters: they end where they began. But he understood them. In their interplay was genuine life, often blunted but ever resilient&quot;.

A Broadway revival of the Inge play opened on January 24, 2008, at the Biltmore Theatre. Directed by Michael Pressman, it starred S. Epatha Merkerson as Lola, Kevin Anderson as Doc, and Zoe Kazan as Marie, and ran through March 16. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley called it a &quot;deeply felt revival&quot; and a &quot;revitalizing production of a play often dismissed as a soggy period piece&quot; and added &quot;Ms. Merkerson allows a kind of intimate access traditionally afforded by cinematic close-ups, when the camera finds shades of meaning in impassive faces. She rarely signals what Lola&#x27;s feeling; she just seems to feel, and we get it, instantly and acutely. Such emotional sincerity is the hallmark of this revival from the Manhattan Theater Club, directed with gentle compassion by Michael Pressman and featuring first-rate performances from Kevin Anderson and Zoe Kazan. The production&#x27;s commitment to its characters uncovers surprising virtues in William Inge&#x27;s play&quot;.

In 2017, the Transport Group put up a production &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, which won the Obie Award for performance by Heather MacRae.

<text>The chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), or simply chukar, is a Palearctic upland gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae. It has been considered to form a superspecies complex along with the rock partridge, Philby&#x27;s partridge and Przevalski&#x27;s partridge and treated in the past as conspecific particularly with the first. This partridge has well-marked black and white bars on the flanks and a black band running from the forehead across the eye down the head to form a necklace that encloses a white throat. Native to Asia, the species has been introduced into many other places and feral populations have established themselves in parts of North America, Malta and New Zealand. This bird can be found in parts of Middle East and temperate Asia.

==Description==

The chukar is a rotund long partridge, with a light brown back, grey breast, and buff belly. The shades vary across the various populations. The face is white with a black gorget. It has -streaked flanks, red legs and coral red bill. Sexes are similar, the female slightly smaller in size and lacking the spur. The tail has 14 feathers, the third primary is the longest while the first is level with the fifth and sixth primaries.

It is very similar to the rock partridge (&quot;Alectoris graeca&quot;) with which it has been lumped in the past but is browner on the back and has a yellowish tinge to the foreneck. The sharply defined gorget distinguishes this species from the red-legged partridge which has the black collar breaking into dark streaks near the breast. Their song is a noisy &quot;chuck-chuck-chukar-chukar&quot; from which the name is derived. The Barbary partridge (&quot;Alectoris barbara&quot;) has a reddish-brown rather than black collar with a grey throat and face with a chestnut crown.

Other common names of this bird include chukker (chuker or chukor), Indian chukar and keklik.

==Distribution and habitat==
This partridge has its native range in Asia, including Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Turkey, Kurdistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and India, along the inner ranges of the western Himalayas to Nepal, as well as southeasternmost Europe in Bulgaria and Greece. Further west in southeastern Europe it is replaced by the rock partridge, &quot;Alectoris graeca&quot;. It barely ranges into Africa on the Sinai Peninsula. The habitat in the native range is rocky open hillsides with grass or scattered scrub or cultivation. In Israel and Jordan it is found at low altitudes, starting at below sea level in the Dead Sea area, whereas in the more eastern areas it is mainly found at an altitude of except in Pakistan, where it occurs at . They are not found in areas of high humidity or rainfall.

It has been introduced widely as a game bird, and feral populations have become established in the United States (Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, high desert areas of California), Canada, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand and Hawaii. Initial introductions into the US were from the nominate populations collected from Afghanistan and Nepal. The birds are hunted across the dry, rocky Columbia Basin, especially in the vicinity of the Snake River in Washington and Oregon. It has also been introduced to New South Wales in Australia but breeding populations have not persisted and are probably extinct. A small population exists on Robben Island in South Africa since it was introduced there in 1964.

The chukar readily interbreeds with the red-legged partridge (&quot;Alectoris rufa&quot;), and the practice of breeding and releasing captive-bred hybrids has been banned in various countries including the United Kingdom, as it is a threat to wild populations.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The chukar partridge is part of a confusing group of &quot;red-legged partridges&quot;. Several plumage variations within the widespread distribution of the chukar partridge have been described and designated as subspecies. In the past the chukar group was included with the rock partridge (also known as the Greek partridge). The species from Turkey and farther east was subsequently separated from &quot;A. graeca&quot; of Greece and Bulgaria and western Europe.

===Subspecies===
The chukar has 14 recognized subspecies:

* &quot;A. c. chukar&quot; (nominate species) 
* &quot;A. c. cypriotes&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. dzungarica&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. falki&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. kleini&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. koroviakovi&quot; (
* &quot;A. c. kurdestanica&quot; – 
* &quot;A. c. pallescens&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. pallida&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. potanini&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. pubescens&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. sinaica&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. subpallida&quot; 
* &quot;A. c. werae&quot; 

==Population and status==
This species is relatively unaffected by hunting or loss of habitat. Its numbers are largely affected by weather patterns during the breeding season. The release of captive stock in some parts of southern Europe can threaten native populations of rock partridge and red-legged partridge with which they may hybridize.

British sportsmen in India considered the chukar as good sport although they were not considered to be particularly good in flavour. Their fast flight and ability to fly some distance after being shot made recovery of the birds difficult without retriever dogs. During cold winters, when the higher areas are covered in snow, people in Kashmir have been known to use a technique to tire the birds out to catch them.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In the non-breeding season, chukar partridge are found in small coveys of 10 or more (up to 50) birds. In summer, chukars form pairs to breed. During this time, the cocks are very pugnacious in their calling and fighting. During winter they descend into the valleys and feed in fields. They call frequently during the day and especially in the mornings and evenings. The call is loud and includes loud repeated &quot;chuck&quot; notes and sometimes duetting &quot;chuker&quot; notes. Several calls varying with context have been noted. The most common call is a &quot;rallying call&quot; which when played back elicits a response from birds and has been used in surveys, although the method is not very reliable. When disturbed, it prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance often down a slope on rounded wings, calling immediately after alighting. In Utah, birds were found to forage in an area of about and travel up to to obtain water during the dry season. The home range was found to be even smaller in Idaho.
The breeding season is summer. Males perform tidbitting displays, a form of courtship feeding where the male pecks at food and a female may visit to peck in response. The males may chase females with head lowered, wing lowered and neck fluffed. The male may also perform a high step stiff walk while making a special call. The female may then crouch in acceptance and the male mounts to copulate, while grasping the nape of the female. Males are monogamous. The nest is a scantily lined ground scrape, though occasionally a compact pad is created with a depression in the centre. Generally, the nests are sheltered by ferns and small bushes, or placed in a dip or rocky hillside under an overhanging rock. About 7 to 14 eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in about 23–25 days. In captivity they can lay an egg each day during the breeding season if eggs are collected daily. Chicks join their parents in foraging and will soon join the chicks of other members of the covey.As young chukars grow, and before flying for the first time, they utilize wing-assisted incline running as a transition to adult flight. This behaviour is found in several bird species, but has been extensively studied in chukar chicks, as a model to explain the evolution of avian flight.

Chukar will take a wide variety of seeds and some insects as food. It also ingests grit. In Kashmir, the seeds of a species of &quot;Eragrostis&quot; was particularly dominant in their diet while those in the US favoured &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;. Birds feeding on succulent vegetation make up for their water needs but visit open water in summer.

Chukar roost on rocky slopes or under shrubs. In the winter, birds in the US selected protected niches or caves. A group may roost in a tight circle with their heads pointed outwards to conserve heat and keep a look out for predators.

Chukar are sometimes preyed on by golden eagles.

Birds in captivity can die from &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; infection and outbreaks of other diseases such as erysipelas.

==In culture==
The name is onomatopoeic and mentions of &quot;chakor&quot; in Sanskrit, from northern Indian date back to the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; (c. 250–500 AD). In North Indian and Pakistani culture, as well as in Hindu mythology, the chukar (referred as Chakor) sometimes symbolizes intense, and often unrequited, love. It is said to be in love with the moon and to gaze at it constantly. Because of their pugnacious behaviour during the breeding season they are kept in some areas as fighting birds.

<doc id="444156" wikidata="Q3084003" url="?curid=444156" title="Heavy metal fashion">
<text>Heavy metal fashion is the style of dress, body modification, make-up, hairstyle, and so on, taken on by fans of heavy metal, or, as they are often called, metalheads or headbangers. While the style has changed from the 1970s to the 2020s, certain key elements have remained constant, such as black clothes, long hair and leather jackets. In the 1980s, some bands began wearing spandex. Other attire includes denim or leather vests or jackets with band patches and logos, t-shirts with band names, and spiked wristbands. It can also include with heavier subgenres of metal: bullet belts, gas masks, and war gear.

==Origins==
The clothing associated with heavy metal has its roots in the biker, rocker, and leather subcultures. Heavy metal fashion includes elements such as leather jackets; combat boots, studded belts, hi-top basketball shoes (more common with old school thrash metalheads); blue or black jeans, camouflage pants and shorts, and denim jackets or kutte vests, often adorned with badges, pins and patches. As with the bikers, there is a fascination with Germanic and German imagery, such as the Iron Cross.

Distinct aspects of heavy metal fashion can be credited to various bands, but the band that takes the most credit for revolutionizing the look was Judas Priest, primarily with its singer, Rob Halford. Halford wore a leather costume on stage as early as 1978 to coincide with the promotion for the &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (&quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; in the USA) album. In a 1998 interview, Halford described the leather subculture as the inspiration for this look. Halford may have been the one to popularize leather but K.K. Downing wanted a look that suited the music they were creating. Downing started wearing studded leather outfits on stage. Soon, the rest of the band followed. An example of this can be seen from live concert recordings from 1978. Downing is the only one on stage appearing with black studded leather jacket.

It was not long before other bands appropriated the leather look; Iron Maiden&#x27;s original singer Paul Di&#x27;Anno began wearing leather jackets and studded bracelets, Motörhead innovated with bullet belts, and Saxon introduced spandex. This fashion was particularly popular with followers of the New wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) movement in the early 1980s, and sparked a revival for metal in this era.

The studded leather look was extended in subsequent variations, to the wearing of combat boots, studded belts and bracelets, bullet belts, spiked gauntlets, etc. The codpiece, however, appears to have been less popular among the general public.

==Other influences==
The style and clothing of metal has absorbed elements from influences as diverse as the musical influences from which the genre has borrowed. It is from this linking of different sub-styles of clothing and music influences that one can sometimes determine a person&#x27;s specific taste in music simply from overall appearance. However, such signs are not hard and fast rulings in the majority of cases. This uncertainty is what makes the first key aspect of the metalheads&#x27; identity below so important.

Some of the influences of modern military clothing and the Vietnam War can be seen by the fans and bands of thrash metal, with the members of thrash metal bands of the 1980s like Metallica, Destruction, and Megadeth wearing bullet belts around their waists on stage. (It is likely that the thrash metal bands got the idea of wearing bullet belts from NWOBHM bands such as Motörhead, who have incorporated the bullet belt as part of their aesthetic since their inception, since many thrash metal bands in the 1980s were influenced by Motörhead.) This style is often connected to punk-metal and anti-fashion, as akin to the hardcore punk scene, as the formentioned style reflects similar attitudes. German Heavy Metal band Accept ex lead singer Udo Dirkschneider also contributed to the military clothing by wearing military pants from 1982, being considered as the first Heavy Metal musician to wear them.

Fans of glam metal often have long or very long, teased hair, and are dressed in spandex pants and/or leather jackets. They also may use (though not necessarily) some makeup (lipsticks, eye-shadows, tonal creams, etc.). Bands who play in glam metal genre may have instruments with extravagant colour(s) and attributes, like guitars with pink, violet, dalmatian or pink rose colour(s); microphone stands with (often) a leopard or silk scarf (there may be some different attributes attached to the microphone stand, but mostly only leopard-colour scarfs have been seen); drumsets with some artwork (this kind of drum set is seen in other metal genres as well, not only in glam metal).

The imagery and values of historic Celtic, Saxon, Viking and Chivalric culture is reflected heavily in metal music, by bands such as Blind Guardian, and has its impact upon the everyday fashion and especially the stagegear of metal artists. The independence, masculinity and honor of the warrior ethos is extremely popular amongst metalheads, as is the rejection of perceived modern-day consumerist and metrosexual culture. Folk metal, Viking metal, black metal and power metal fans often grow long thick hair and beards reminiscent of a stereotypical Viking, Saxon or Celt, and wear Thor&#x27;s Hammer pendants and other pagan symbols. On stage, in photoshoots, and in music videos, it is very common for bands of these genres such as Turisas and Moonsorrow to wear chain mail, animals skins, warpaint (such as woad) and other Dark Ages themed battle gear.

Corpse paint is another style of black-and-white makeup, used mainly by black metal bands to insinuate ones appearance as dead or not from this world. It is often composed of a white layer covering a person&#x27;s face with black details on top, often in the shape of crosses or around the eyes. Bands such as Cradle of Filth and Kiss have stated that this has been born as a homage to early silent black-and-white horror movies. Black metal fans also sport goatees, all black outfits, leather jackets (sometimes with black and white band patches sewed on), spikes, jewelry, facial piercings and boots.

Power metal fans and musicians such as Rhapsody of Fire often wear attire reminiscent of the Renaissance and the Middle Ages including tight black or brown leather trousers and wide sleeved, buttonless shirts of various colors. The imagery of bards and minstrels as well as knights is a popular part of power metal fashion.

Some stoner metal bands and fans have incorporated &quot;retro&quot; looks- boot-cut or bell-bottom jeans, headbands, and tie-dye or other colorful shirts inspired by 1960s and 1970s psychedelic rock as well as cannabis culture.

Nu metal fashion includes baggy pants or cargo shorts (borrowing from hip hop culture), spiked hair or dreadlocks, and an abundance of accessories.

Also notable is that the dark business suit now relates to some metal bands, most often doom, gothic or stoner acts. Bands such as Akercocke (although the band is death metal), The Vision Bleak, Lacrimosa, Motionless In White, Fleshgod Apocalypse (although band is death metal), Northern Kings (although the band is symphonic metal) are known for use of formal clothing in music videos and stage performances, sometimes followed by fans.

<doc id="444157" wikidata="Q2737371" url="?curid=444157" title="Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal">
<text>Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal, a major component of the Port of New York and New Jersey, is the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan area and the northeastern quadrant of North America. 

Located on Newark Bay, the facility is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Its two components, Port Newark and the Elizabeth Marine Terminal (sometimes called Port Elizabeth) sit side by side within the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey, just east of the New Jersey Turnpike and Newark Liberty International Airport.

==Operations==
, the facility was the largest on the U.S. East Coast and the second-largest in the country.

Container goods typically arrive on container ships through The Narrows and the Kill Van Kull before entering Newark Bay, a shallow body of water that has been dredged to accommodate large ships. Some ships enter Newark Bay via the Arthur Kill. The port facility consists of two main dredged slips and multiple loading cranes. Shipping containers are arrayed in large stacks visible from the New Jersey Turnpike before being loaded onto rail cars and trucks.

Since 1998, the port has seen a 65% increase in traffic. In 2006, it handled more than 20% of all US imports from Germany, more than any other US port.

In 2009, the major port operators at Port Newark–Elizabeth included Maher Terminals, APM Terminals (part of A. P. Moller-Maersk), and Port Newark Container Terminal (owned by Ports America Inc.).

===Improvements===
The port received new cranes in May 2014.

The height of ships serving the port is limited by the Bayonne Bridge over Kill Van Kull. This limitation grew more serious with the Panama Canal&#x27;s 2016 expansion that enabled bigger, New Panamax ships to reach the port from Asia. In 2012, the Port Authority announced plans to raise the Bayonne Bridge&#x27;s roadway to over the water, at a cost of around $1.7 billion. The increased navigational clearance was achieved in June 2017, and the overall bridge project was completed in 2019. Other improvements are expected to cost additional billions of dollars, including larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.

==Rail facilities==

ExpressRail, an initiative of the PANYNJ, provides dockside transloading operations at both Port Elizabeth (operated by Millennium Marine Rail) and Port Newark. Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) is the terminal railroad connecting to the Chemical Coast for CSX Transportation (CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NS).

The auto-processing facilities at the north end of Port Newark and the adjacent Doremus Ave. Auto Terminal are served by dockside trackage. Oak Island Yard, the major classification yard in the region, is just north of the port. NS operates an ExpressRail yard south of the port next to Jersey Gardens.

==History==
The western edge of Newark Bay was originally the Newark Meadows, shallow tidal wetlands covering about . In the 1910s, the city of Newark began excavating an angled shipping channel in the northeastern quadrant of the wetland. This became the basis of Port Newark. Work on the channel and terminal facilities on its north side accelerated during World War I, when the federal government took control of Port Newark. During the war, nearly 25,000 troops were stationed at the Newark Bay Shipyard.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was formed in 1921, and the Newark Bay Channels were authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Acts in 1922. Shipping operations languished after the war, and in 1927, the city of Newark started construction of Newark Airport (now known as Newark Liberty International Airport) on the northwestern quadrant of the wetlands that lay between Port Newark and the edge of the developed city. The port authority took over the operations of Port Newark and Newark Airport in 1948 and began modernizing both facilities and expanding them southward.

The SS &quot;Ideal X&quot;, considered the first container ship, made her maiden voyage as a container carrier on April 26, 1956, carrying 58 containers from Port Newark to the Port of Houston. SeaLand expanded its operations into the newly developed container terminal.

In 1958, the port authority dredged another shipping channel, which straightened the course of Bound Brook, the tidal inlet forming the boundary between Newark and Elizabeth. Dredged materials were used to create new upland south of the new Elizabeth Channel, where the port authority constructed the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The first shipping facility to open on the Elizabeth Channel was the new Sea-Land Container Terminal, which was the prototype for virtually every container terminal constructed thereafter.

This new port facility antiquated most of the traditional waterfront port facilities in New York Harbor, leading to a steep decline in such areas as Manhattan, Hoboken, Jersey City and Brooklyn. The automated nature of the facility requires far fewer workers and does not require the opening of containers before onward shipping.

In 2000, a Congressional study deemed the port and other transportation, communications, oil, and chemical facilities along a stretch of New Jersey &quot;the nation&#x27;s most enticing environment for terrorists&quot;, according to a 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article.

In 2011, PANYNJ restructured the lease of a major tenant, Port Newark Container Terminal (PNCT), whose owner had been subject of the Dubai Ports World controversy. The agreement calls for a 20-year extension of PNCT&#x27;s existing lease through 2050, subject to PNCT&#x27;s investment of $500 million and an expansion from to about to accommodate additional volume. It is expected to generate an annual increase in container volume from Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world&#x27;s second-largest shipping company, from 414,000 to 1.1 million containers by 2030. Various planned steps to accommodate this growth include deepening the Kill van Kull, raising the Bayonne Bridge, and expanding rail freight facilities. Highstar Capital, the owner of PNCT&#x27;s parent company Ports America is shopping the company. In 2017, a Turkish company seeks to buy Ports America.

In July 2023, an Italian-flagged ship owned by the Grimaldi Group carrying close to 1,200 vehicles for export caught fire, resulting in the death of two Newark Fire Department firefighters.

<text>The Treaty House () at Waitangi in Northland, New Zealand, is the former house of the British Resident in New Zealand, James Busby. The Treaty of Waitangi, the document that established the British Colony of New Zealand, was signed in the grounds of the Treaty House on 6 February 1840.

The grounds had previously been the site of other important events, such as the signing of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand in 1835. The house and grounds remained in private hands until 1932, when they were purchased by Governor-General Viscount Bledisloe and donated to the nation. They were dedicated as a national reserve in 1934, in a ceremony attended by thousands of people, both Māori and Pākehā, and including the Māori King. It was the site of another major event in 1940, when the centenary of the Treaty signing was celebrated. From 1947 the grounds became the site of annual Waitangi Day celebrations.

==Architectural history==
The Treaty House was built in 1833–34 for Busby and his family. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s oldest surviving buildings. Originally the building consisted of two main rooms, plus an entrance hallway, verandah, and a detached rear block containing a kitchen and servants&#x27; room. Busby considered the house to be too small for someone of his standing, but for 1830s New Zealand it was a large house. It was expanded in the 1830s and 1840s with the addition of a lean-to and two wings.

The property remained in the Busby family until 1882, when it was sold to a local farmer. For at least some of the next few years it was used for agricultural purposes, including shearing sheep. It fell into disrepair, despite some efforts to bring it into public ownership. These were successful in 1932, when Bledisloe made his purchase, and the house was subsequently restored by leading architect William Henry Gummer. This was one of the earliest major state restorations of a historic building in New Zealand. In preparation for the 1990 sesquicentennial of the Treaty signing, the house was modified to more accurately reflect what it would have been like in 1840.

==Heritage site and grounds==
The Treaty House has been a Heritage New Zealand Category I listed building since 1983. It contains a museum devoted to the Treaty and to life in the house in the mid nineteenth century. The grounds contain a carved whare runanga (meeting house) and the large waka taua (war canoe) &quot;Ngā Toki Matawhaorua&quot;, both built for the 1940 celebrations. A flagstaff stands on the spot where the Treaty was signed. The original flagstaff was erected by the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy just prior to the Waitangi Day celebrations of 1934. The Waitangi Treaty Monument, built in circa 1880–1881 and also registered as a Category 1 heritage item, is located nearby.

<text>The music of Aragon has through history absorbed Roman, Celtic, Moorish and French influences, much like its culture. Traditional instruments used in the region include bagpipes, drums, flutes, tambourines, rattles and, perhaps most distinctively, the guitarro and bandurria.

Jota (music) is the best-known style of music from Aragon. While regionally emblematic to Aragon, the Jota is also danced in most regions of Spain, unlike for instance flamenco which until recently was uniquely regional to Andalucia and some neighbouring areas. The Jota is played instrumentally, danced, and sung. 

Other genres of traditional Aragonese music include albadas and rondas.

Some of the most notable Spain cupletistas were born in Aragon in the first decades of the 20th century. Raquel Meller became a major international star. Other important cupletistas included Preciosilla, Paquita Escribano, Matilde Aragón, Mercedes Serós, one of the creators of the Catalan couplet, Ofelia de Aragón and Elvira de Amaya.

Recent artists with folk influences include José Antonio Labordeta, La Bullonera or Joaquín Carbonell. In Pop and Rock music, the most popular groups have been Héroes del silencio and Amaral.

<text>Stella () is a 1955 Greek film is a retelling of &quot;Carmen&quot; featuring Melina Mercouri. The film was directed by the Greek Cypriot Michael Cacoyannis and written by Cacoyannis and Iakovos Kambanelis. The music was composed by Manos Hadjidakis and Vassilis Tsitsanis.

&quot;Stella&quot; was originally intended to be a stage play with the title &quot;Stella with the Red Gloves&quot;, but it was never staged. It has been claimed that this story was the perfect vehicle for the thirty-five-year-old Mercouri&#x27;s film debut. Indeed, it was the hit that Melina Mercouri needed. The film sparked great controversy, and although it was initially rejected by Greek critics, it is now considered one of the five greatest Greek films.

At the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, where the film was screened, Melina met Jules Dassin, her future husband, mentor, and director. He helped her to secure major roles in such films as &quot;Topkapi&quot;, &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Phaedra&quot;, and &quot;10:30 P.M. Summer&quot;, which became major international successes.

==Plot==
The story of a fiercely independent and uncompromising young woman. Stella, a rembetiko singer at Paradise nightclub, lives a guiltless, turbulent life. Her innate independence and assertive nature lead her to numerous passionate love affairs. While with Aleko, son of a wealthy family, she decides, as is her habit, to break up before the relationship wears off. Once she meets Miltos, a young soccer player, she seems to change. At first, she avoids his advances, but, later, gives in to him. However, she can only be with him on her own terms. No matter how much she loves him, she mostly values her freedom. Things turn complicated when she is called to choose. She repeatedly rejects Miltos&#x27; marriage proposals. When Miltos finally forces her to accept the idea of marriage, Stella does not appear in church, despite Miltos repeatedly warning her that he will kill her if she doesn&#x27;t marry him. (Curiously, the wedding day shares a date with the day that Greece rejects Mussolini&#x27;s demands to let his fascist forces enter Greece.) Miltos kills her with a dagger at the end of the film and awaits his arrest by the police.

<doc id="444171" wikidata="Q392570" url="?curid=444171" title="Western reef heron">
<text>The western reef heron (Egretta gularis), also called the western reef egret, is a medium-sized heron found in southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. It has a mainly coastal distribution and occurs in several plumage forms: a slaty-grey plumage in which it can only be confused with the rather uncommon dark morph of the Little egret (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;); a white form which can look very similar to the little egret although the bill tends to be paler and larger and the black form with white throat &quot;E. g. gularis&quot; of West Africa. There are also differences in size, structure and foraging behaviour. There have been suggestions that the species hybridizes with the Little Egret, and based on this, some authors treat &quot;schistacea&quot; and &quot;gularis&quot; as subspecies of &quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;. Works that consider the Western Reef Heron as a valid species include the nominate &quot;gularis&quot; and &quot;schistacea&quot; as subspecies.

==Description==

This bird has two plumage colour forms. There is an all-white morph and a dark grey morph; morphs can also occur with intermediate shades of grey which may be related to age or particoloured in grey and white. The white morph is similar in general appearance to the little egret, but has a larger yellower bill, extended yellow on thicker legs, and when foraging tends to be very active, sometimes also moving its wing or using it to shade the water surface. The grey morph has a whitish throat and is unlikely to be confused with any other species within the range of this egret with beak and legs similar to that of the white morph. During the breeding season the legs and facial skin are reddish. Breeding birds have two long feathers on the sides of the nape. The nominate subspecies &quot;gularis&quot; has a range from West Africa to Gabon, with some birds breeding in southern Europe. Subspecies &quot;schistacea&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1828) breeds from the Persian Gulf along the coast of India to the east of the India Peninsula. The bill of &quot;gularis&quot; is more pointed while &quot;schistacea&quot; has the larger bill especially towards the base. The form on the eastern coast of South Africa is usually separated as the dimorphic egret &quot;Egretta dimorpha&quot;. The dark and white morph is thought to be controlled by a single allele with the dark character being incompletely dominant over the gene for white.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The species was first described as &quot;Ardea gularis&quot; from a specimen obtained in Senegal by the French naturalist Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc in 1792. The distinctive white throat (or gular region) in the dark morph gives it the species name. Later authors have treated it the genera &quot;Demiegretta&quot; (in which dimorphic egrets were once included), &quot;Herodias&quot; and &quot;Lepterodius&quot; until its current stable position in the genus &quot;Egretta&quot;. The distinctness of this species from &quot;Egretta garzetta&quot; has however been highly debated with some authors treating &quot;garzetta&quot; as a polytypic superspecies. There has been confusion related to what were thought to be dark little egrets and the possibility of hybrids. Dark morphs in little egrets are extremely rare and nearly all specimens of what were thought to be dark morphs have turned out to be western reef herons. In India some research claimed circumstantial evidence of interbreeding with little egrets, but the same researchers noted that the breeding seasons of the two species were different. Hybridization has also been claimed to occur in Morocco and Kenya (but this might refer to &quot;Egretta dimorpha&quot;). Christidis and Boles quote a report by McCracken and Sheldon (2002) that the nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b genes from a sampled little egret and a western reef heron were identical and use this as evidence for demotion. The sequences and the origins of the samples are not publicly available or verifiable. In the past the Indian form which was also described as &quot;Ardea asha&quot; by William Henry Sykes has been treated as a subspecies of the little egret as &quot;Egretta garzetta schistacea&quot; on the basis of presumed hybridization with &quot;Egretta gularis&quot;. The lores of breeding little egrets are blue while those of the reef heron are reddish although some individuals of &quot;schistacea&quot; show blue and this is thought to be due to hybridization. The dark coastal form of Madagascar, Aldabra, Comoro Islands, Seychelles and parts of East Africa (southern Kenya to Tanzania) was earlier treated as a subspecies (the mainland African form has sometimes been considered as &quot;schistacea&quot;) but is now raised to full species as the dimorphic egret (&quot;Egretta dimorpha&quot;).
==Distribution and status==

It occurs mainly on the coasts in tropical west Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf (Iran) extending east to India. It also occurs in the Lakshadweep Islands and Sri Lanka where breeding was once recorded at Chilaw. The nominate subspecies breeds in west Africa from Mauritania to Gabon. Birds may also be found off the mainland such as in the Canary Islands. 
Small numbers breed in Spain. Subspecies &quot;schistacea&quot; is found from the Red Sea coast east round the Indian coast. Breeding colonies are known from the east coast of India around Pulicat Lake. They occasionally occur further inland.

The western reef heron (nominate subspecies) occurs as a vagrant in North America, South America and the Caribbean islands. Based on the growing number of records it is suspected that they may establish breeding colonies in Brazil. Several records around 1980–90 in Germany, Austria and France have been attributed to birds that escaped from an animal dealer in Mittelfranken.

==Behaviour and ecology==

These birds stalk their prey in shallow water, often running or stirring the water with their feet or flicking their wings to disturb prey; they may also stand still and wait to ambush prey. They eat fish, crustaceans, and molluscs. In coastal areas, they regularly feed on mudskippers. Laboratory studies show them to be capable of making corrections for refractions but the probability of missing increases when they are forced to strike at prey at very acute angles to the water surface. Like other herons and egrets they have few vocalizations, making a low &quot;kwok&quot; or grating sounds when disturbed or near the nest.

The western reef heron&#x27;s breeding habitat is coastal wetlands. In the Red Sea region the breeding season is from June to August. The nominate subspecies breeds in West Africa from late April to September. In India the breeding season is during the monsoon rains from April to August and end of May in the former breeding colony at Chilaw in Sri Lanka. Most of the breeding colonies in Gujarat in western India were on mangroves. They nest in colonies usually of their own species but sometimes with other egrets and smaller herons, usually on platforms of sticks placed in trees or shrubs. The male fetches sticks of the nest while the female places them to form the platform. The nest height varies from about 5 to 15 meters, but very low nesting (as low as 0.6 meters) has been observed in mangrove trees in salt pans. The usual clutch is three to four eggs which are light blue as in the little egret. Incubation begins when the first egg is laid resulting in chicks with size disparities. Both parents take turns to incubate and the eggs hatch after about 23 to 24 days. The chicks are white with grey dapples. Young birds sometimes die after falling off from the nest platform. Adults will shade the chicks during the hotter parts of the day. Predators of eggs include rats and young chicks may be taken by cats and crows. Adults usually guard the nest when eggs or young chicks are present. Adults feed the young by regurgitating semi-digested food at the nest. This diet includes mainly small fishes of the families Clupeidae, Gobiidae and Engraulidae. The young birds leave the nest after about a month.

<text>&#x27; (; sometimes called &#x27; and sometimes shortened to just &quot;macchiato&quot; in English) is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, means &#x27;stained&#x27; or &#x27;spotted&#x27;, so the literal translation of is &#x27;stained coffee&#x27; or &#x27;marked coffee&#x27;.

==History==
The origin of the name stems from baristas needing to show the serving waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it; the latter was &quot;marked&quot;. The idea is reflected in the Portuguese name for the drink: , meaning &#x27;coffee with a drop&#x27;.

==Preparation==

The has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients. The intent is that the milk moderates, rather than overwhelms, the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetness. The drink is typically prepared by pouring a small amount of steamed milk directly into a single shot of espresso. One recipe calls for 5–10 g (1–2 teaspoons) of milk heated to .

==Regional variants==
In Australia the drink is referred to simply as a &quot;macchiato&quot;, often shortened to just &quot;mac&quot;, and has some variants. A traditional long macchiato is usually a double-shot of espresso with a dash of textured milk and most of the glass left empty. In Perth, a &#x27;long mac topped up&#x27; is usually ordered, which is a double-shot of espresso with the glass filled with textured milk. In Melbourne, a macchiato is a double-shot of espresso, a glass half-filled with water, and a dash of textured milk on top.

<doc id="444180" wikidata="Q1636085" url="?curid=444180" title="Mills bomb">
<text>&quot;Mills bomb&quot; is the popular name for a series of British hand grenades which were designed by William Mills. They were the first modern fragmentation grenades used by the British Army and saw widespread use in the First and Second World Wars.

==Development==

William Mills, a hand grenade designer from Sunderland, patented, developed and manufactured the &quot;Mills bomb&quot; at the Mills Munitions Factory in Birmingham, England, in 1915. The Mills bomb was inspired by an earlier design by Belgian captain Leon Roland, who later engaged in a patent lawsuit. Col. Arthur Morrow, a New Zealand Wars officer, also believed aspects of his patent were incorporated into the Mills Bomb. The Mills bomb was adopted by the British Army as its standard hand grenade in 1915 as the No. 5.

The Mills bomb underwent numerous modifications. The No. 23 was a No. 5 with a rodded base plug which allowed it to be fired from a rifle. This concept evolved further with the No. 36, a variant with a detachable base plate for use with a rifle discharger cup. The final variation of the Mills bomb, the No. 36M, was specially designed and waterproofed with shellac for use in the hot climate of Mesopotamia in 1917 at first but remained in production for many years. By 1918 the No. 5 and No. 23 had been declared obsolete and the No. 36 (but not the 36M) followed in 1932.

The Mills was a classic design; a grooved cast iron &quot;pineapple&quot; with a central striker held by a close hand lever and secured with a pin. According to Mills&#x27;s notes, the casing was grooved to make it easier to grip, not as an aid to fragmentation; and it has been shown that it does not shatter along the segmented lines . The Mills was a defensive grenade meant to be thrown from behind cover at a target in the open, wounding with fragmentation, as opposed to an offensive grenade, which does not fragment, relying on short-range blast effect to wound or stun the victim without endangering the thrower with fragments, which travel a much longer distance than blast. Despite the designations and their traits, &quot;defensive&quot; grenades were frequently used offensively and vice versa. A competent thrower could manage with reasonable accuracy, but the grenade could throw lethal fragments farther than this. The British Home Guard were instructed that the throwing range of the No. 36 was about with a danger area of about .

At first the grenade was fitted with a seven-second fuse but in the Battle of France in 1940 this delay proved to be too long, giving defenders time to escape the explosion, or even to throw the grenade back. Therefore, the delay was reduced to four seconds. The British Army continued to use grenades with a seven-second fuse for use in rifle mounted grenade projectors where the fuse time was required to allow the grenade to reach its full range.

The heavy segmented bodies of &quot;pineapple&quot; type grenades result in an unpredictable pattern of fragmentation. After the Second World War, Britain adopted grenades that contained segmented coiled wire in smooth metal casings. The No. 36M Mk.I remained the standard grenade of the British Armed Forces and was manufactured in the UK until 1972, when it was replaced by the L2 series. The 36M remained in service in some parts of the world such as India and Pakistan, where it was manufactured until the 2000s. Mills bombs were still being used in combat as recently as 2004, for example in the incident which killed US Marine Jason Dunham and wounded two of his comrades. The last major operator of the Mills bomb was India who only replaced it in August 2021 with a new Multi-Mode Hand Grenade (MMHG).

==Models==
* The &quot;No. 5 Mk 1&quot; was the first version. The explosive was filled through a small circular plug on the upper half, the detonator assembly was inserted into the centre tube through the bottom of the grenade body via the base plug, the striker and spring was held in tension through the middle by the lever that was held down on the lugs (ears) located on the top of the grenade body via a split pin and ring called the safety pin/pull ring. It was issued in May 1915 and entered general issue when mass production caught up a year later in 1916.
* The &quot;No. 23 Mk 1&quot;, the hand/rifle-grenade had a base plug drilled with a threaded hole for a rifle launching rod. The No. 23 Mk II had a new-style iron base plug that was easier to tighten with the fingers without the need for a spanner. The No. 23 Mk III was a new-style body with a larger filler hole plug and more solid -lever lugs/ears but retaining the Mk II style plug.
* The &quot;No. 36 Mk. 1&quot; was introduced in May 1918. It used the No. 23 Mk III body with a new-style plug. Mostly made of iron, it was drilled and threaded for attaching a metal disk called a gas check to fire the grenade from a cup discharger (Burns) mounted on a rifle&#x27;s muzzle and launched using a balastite blank cartridge.
* The shellac-coated &quot;Mesopotamian&quot; variant (&quot;No. 36M Mk I&quot;) was designed to keep moisture and humidity out of the detonator&#x27;s fuse. The No. 36M Mk I was the British army&#x27;s standard hand-grenade from the 1930s to 1972.

==Identification marks==
* A green band around the middle originally indicated an Amatol filling (1915–1920s), while it later indicated a Baratol or Trotyl filling (1920s–1970s).
* A pink band around the middle indicates an Ammonal or Alumatol filling. (Alumatol is defined by the &quot;&quot; as &quot;a mixture of ammonium nitrate, TNT and &#x27;a small quantity&#x27; of aluminium powder&quot;.) A red band around the base plug on the bottom indicated the detonator was already installed and that the grenade was live.
* Three red &quot;X&quot;s along each side indicates that it is the waterproofed No.36M model.

==Rifle grenade==
The Mills bomb was developed into a rifle grenade by attaching a metallic rod to its base. This rod-type rifle-grenade had an effective range of about . The operating procedure was to insert the Mills bomb rod down the barrel of a standard rifle, put a special blank cartridge (Ballistite cartridge) in the rifle&#x27;s chamber, place the rifle stock on the ground, then pull the Mills bomb&#x27;s safety pin, releasing the safety lever and immediately fire the rifle. If the soldier did not launch the grenade quickly, the grenade&#x27;s fuse would time out and explode. The British soon developed a simple cradle attached to the rifle&#x27;s bayonet lug to hold the safety-lever in place and prevent accidental detonations. However, it was found that the repeated launching of rod-type grenades caused damage to the rifle&#x27;s barrel, causing the middle to bulge out due to the prolonged pressure spike from driving the much heavier, larger projectile up the barrel (typically a much faster process with a normal bullet); a rifle cartridge rapidly burns up all the available powder, which fills the volume behind the bullet with extremely high pressure gases (tens of thousands of PSI), the pressure rising as the bullet moves up the barrel, peaking at some point before the bullet leaves the muzzle. With the much heavier grenade and rod, the cartridge had to accelerate a much heavier mass, which resulted in the powder burning up and the pressure peaking before the rod had got more than a part of the way up the barrel, putting peak pressure on sooner and sustaining it for longer.

The British subsequently developed a cup-type launcher to replace the rod-type rifle-grenade. In this design, a can-shaped launcher was attached to the muzzle of the rifle and a gas check disc was screwed onto the base of the grenade before the grenade was placed in the launcher. The safety pin could then be removed as the launcher cup kept the safety-lever in place. The operator inserted the ballistite cartridge into the rifle before setting the stock, angled on the ground to absorb the recoil of the weapon. When the cartridge was fired it pushed the grenade out of the cup releasing the lever. The cup-type launcher could launch the grenade about . Lee–Enfield rifles equipped with the cup launcher were sometimes modified with copper wire wrapped around the stock, to prevent the wood from splitting under the increased recoil. If necessary, both the rod and the gas check grenade could be thrown as a standard hand-grenade. The cup discharger was typically on issue to the British Home Guard rather than the regular British Army.

<text>Cordyline australis, commonly known as the cabbage tree, or by its Māori name of &quot;tī&quot; or &quot;tī kōuka&quot;, is a widely branched monocot tree endemic to New Zealand.

It grows up to tall with a stout trunk and sword-like leaves, which are clustered at the tips of the branches and can be up to long. With its tall, straight trunk and dense, rounded heads, it is a characteristic feature of the New Zealand landscape. Its fruit is a favourite food source for the kererū and other native birds. It is common over a wide latitudinal range from the far north of the North Island at 34° 25′S to the south of the South Island at 46° 30′S. Absent from much of Fiordland, it was probably introduced by Māori to the Chatham Islands at 44° 00′S and to Stewart Island / Rakiura at 46° 50′S. It grows in a broad range of habitats, including forest margins, river banks and open places, and is abundant near swamps. The largest known tree with a single trunk is growing at Pākawau, Golden Bay / Mohua. It is estimated to be 400 or 500 years old, and stands tall with a circumference of at the base.

Known to Māori as , the tree was used as a source of food, particularly in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, it is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.
It is also grown as an ornamental tree in higher latitude Northern Hemisphere countries with maritime climates, including parts of the upper West Coast of the United States, Canada and the British Isles, where its common names include Cornish palm, cabbage palm, Torbay palm and Torquay palm.

==Description==
&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; grows up to tall with a stout trunk in diameter. Before it flowers, it has a slender unbranched stem. The first flowers typically appear at 6 to 10 years old, in spring. The right conditions can reduce the first flowering age to 3 years (Havelock North, 2015 mast year). After the first flowering, it divides to form a much-branched crown with tufts of leaves at the tips of the branches. Each branch may fork after producing a flowering stem. The pale to dark grey bark is corky, persistent and fissured, and feels spongy to the touch.

The long narrow leaves are sword-shaped, erect, dark to light green, long and wide at the base, with numerous parallel veins. The leaves grow in crowded clusters at the ends of the branches, and may droop slightly at the tips and bend down from the bases when old. They are thick and have an indistinct midrib. The fine nerves are more or less equal and parallel. The upper and lower leaf surfaces are similar.

In spring and early summer, sweetly perfumed flowers are produced in large, dense panicles (flower spikes) long, bearing well-spaced to somewhat crowded, almost sessile to sessile flowers and axes. The flowers are crowded along the ultimate branches of the panicles. The bracts which protect the developing flowers often have a distinct pink tinge before the flowers open. In south Canterbury and North Otago the bracts are green.

The individual flowers are in diameter, the tepals are free almost to the base, and reflexed. The stamens are about the same length as the tepals. The stigmas are short and trifid. The fruit is a white berry in diameter which is greedily eaten by birds. The flowers have a &quot;strong and sweet scent&quot;, and the nectar attracts great numbers of insects to the flowers.

Large, peg-like rhizomes, covered with soft, purplish bark, up to long in old plants, grow vertically down beneath the ground. They serve to anchor the plant and to store fructose in the form of fructan. When young, the rhizomes are mostly fleshy and are made up of thin-walled storage cells. They grow from a layer called the secondary thickening meristem.

===Regional diversity===
New Zealand&#x27;s native &quot;Cordyline&quot; species are relics of an influx of tropical plants that arrived from the north 15 million years ago in the warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, &quot;C. australis&quot; varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: in the north, in the central uplands, in the east and in the west.
In Northland, &quot;C. australis&quot; shows a great deal of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which botanist Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with &quot;C. pumilio&quot;, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, &quot;C. australis&quot; generally has narrow, straight dark green leaves, but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, &quot;C. obtecta&quot;, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These &quot;obtecta&quot;-like characteristics appear in populations of &quot;C. australis&quot; along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called grows. When young, are generally very spindly, and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.

In the central Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, relatively unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves tend to be relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu is adapted to the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and pumice. Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.

Tarariki are found in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of particularly tough, durable fibre. Tarariki&#x27;s strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region&#x27;s hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke&#x27;s Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatū Gorge.

Wharanui grow to the west of the North Island&#x27;s main divide. They have long, broad flaccid leaves, which may be an adaptation to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in Wellington, Horowhenua and Whanganui, and extends with some modifications to the southern Taranaki coast. In Taranaki, cabbage trees generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves. In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from Cape Campbell to the northern Catlins, and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana. In Marlborough&#x27;s Wairau Valley, cabbage trees tend to retain their old, dead leaves, lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.

In north-west Nelson, there are three ecotypes defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island&#x27;s East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to the full force of the salt-laden coastal winds.

 In Otago, cabbage trees gradually become less common towards the south until they come to an end in the northern Catlins. They reappear on the south coast at Waikawa, Southland, but they are not the wharanui type. Rather they are vigorous trees with broad, green leaves and broad canopies. They extend along the coast towards Fiordland, and inland to the margins of some of the glacier-fed lakes. Very vigorous when they are young, these trees seem well adapted to the very cold winters of the south.

A study of seedlings grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this colouration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust from north to south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.

==Taxonomy and names==
&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; was collected in 1769 by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the &quot;Endeavour&quot; during Lieutenant James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to the Pacific. The type locality is Queen Charlotte Sound / Tōtaranui. It was named &quot;Dracaena australis&quot; by Georg Forster who published it as entry 151 in his &quot;Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus&quot; of 1786. It is sometimes still sold as a &quot;Dracaena&quot;, particularly for the house plant market in Northern Hemisphere countries. In 1833, Stephan Endlicher reassigned the species to the genus &quot;Cordyline&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Cordyline&quot; derives from an Ancient Greek word for a club (&quot;kordyle&quot;), a reference to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes, while the species name &quot;australis&quot; is Latin for &quot;southern&quot;. The common name &quot;cabbage tree&quot; is attributed by some sources to early settlers having used the young leaves as a substitute for cabbage. However, the name probably predates the settlement of New Zealand — Georg Forster, writing in his &quot;Voyage round the World&quot; of 1777 about the events of Friday, April 23, 1773, refers on page 114 to the discovery of a related species in Fiordland as &quot;not the true cabbage palm&quot; and says &quot;the central shoot, when quite tender, tastes something like an almond&#x27;s kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage.&quot; Forster may have been referring to the cabbage palmetto (&quot;Sabal palmetto&quot;) of Florida, which resembles the Cordyline somewhat, and was named for the cabbage-like appearance of its terminal bud.

&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; is the tallest of New Zealand&#x27;s five native &quot;Cordyline&quot; species. Of these, the commonest are &quot;C. banksii&quot;, which has a slender, sweeping trunk, and &quot;C. indivisa&quot;, a handsome plant with a trunk up to tall bearing a massive head of broad leaves up to long. In the far north of New Zealand, &quot;C. australis&quot; can be distinguished by its larger heavily branched tree form, narrower leaves and smaller seeds from &quot;C. obtecta&quot;, the Three Kings cabbage tree, its closest relative. &quot;C. australis&quot; is rather variable, and forms from the northern offshore islands may be hybrids with &quot;C. obtecta&quot;. Hybrids with &quot;C. pumilio&quot; and &quot;C. banksii&quot; also occur often where the plants are in close vicinity, because they flower at about the same time and share the chromosome number 2n=38, with &quot;C. australis&quot;.

The tree was well known to Māori before its scientific discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the genus &quot;Cordyline&quot; is &quot;tī&quot;, cognate with Tongan &quot;sī&quot; and Hawaiian &quot;kī&quot; (from Proto-Austronesian *&quot;siRi&quot;, &quot;C. fruticosa&quot; or &quot;C. terminalis&quot;). Names recorded as specific to &quot;C. australis&quot; include &quot;tī kōuka&quot;, &quot;tī kāuka&quot;, &quot;tī rākau&quot;, &quot;tī awe&quot;, &quot;tī pua&quot;, and &quot;tī whanake&quot;. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight the characteristics of the tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (&quot;tī rākau&quot;, &quot;tī pua&quot;), the whiteness of its flowers (&quot;tī puatea&quot;), whether its leaves were broad (&quot;tī wharanui&quot;), twisted along the edges (&quot;tī tahanui&quot;), or spiky (&quot;tī tarariki&quot;). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (&quot;tī manu&quot;), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (&quot;tī whanake&quot;) and nets (&quot;tī kupenga&quot;). The most widely used name, &quot;tī kōuka&quot;, refers to the use of the leaf hearts as food.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===
A quote from Philip Simpson sums up the wide range of habitats the cabbage tree occupied in early New Zealand, and how much its abundance and distinctive form shaped the impression travellers received of the country:
&quot;In primeval New Zealand cabbage trees occupied a range of habitats, anywhere open, moist, fertile and warm enough for them to establish and mature: with forest; around the rocky coast; in lowland swamps, around the lakes and along the lower rivers; and perched on isolated rocks. Approaching the land from the sea would have reminded a Polynesian traveller of home, and for a European traveller, conjured up images of the tropical Pacific&quot;.

&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; occurs from North Cape to the very south of the South Island, where it becomes less and less common, until it reaches its southernmost natural limits at Sandy Point (46° 30&#x27; S), west of Invercargill near Oreti Beach. It is absent from much of Fiordland, probably because there is no suitable habitat, and is unknown on the subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand, probably because it is too cold. It occurs on some offshore islands—Poor Knights, Stewart and the Chathams—but was probably introduced by Māori. In the Stewart Island region, it is rare, growing only on certain islands, headlands and former settlement sites where it may have been introduced by muttonbird collectors, while on the Chatham Islands it is also largely &quot;a notable absentee&quot;.

Generally a lowland species, it grows from sea level to about , reaching its upper limits on the volcanoes of the central North Island, where eruptions have created open spaces for it to exploit, and in the foothills of the Southern Alps in the South Island, where deforestation may have played a part in giving it room to grow. In the central North Island, it has evolved a much sturdier form (with the Māori name &quot;tī manu&quot;, meaning &quot;with branches bearing broad, straight upright leaves&quot;). This form resembles that found in the far south of the South Island, suggesting that they are both adapted to cold conditions.

&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; is a light-demanding pioneer species, and seedlings die when overtopped by other trees. To grow well, young plants require open space so they are not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides unless there is a seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why &quot;C. australis&quot; is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.

Early European explorers of New Zealand described &quot;jungles of cabbage trees&quot; along the banks of streams and rivers, in huge swamps and lowland valleys. Few examples of this former abundance survive today—such areas were the first to be cleared by farmers looking for flat land and fertile soil. In modern New Zealand, cabbage trees usually grow as isolated individuals rather than as parts of a healthy ecosystem.

===Reproduction===

The cabbage tree&#x27;s year begins in autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves projecting from the centre of each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers on the outside of the tree, exposed to insects and birds.

Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds.

Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.

===Response to fire===
&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; is one of the few New Zealand forest trees that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the protected rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.

Older trees sometimes grow epicormic shoots directly from their trunks after storm or fire damage. Aerial rhizomes can also be produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow and grow down into the soil to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.

===Biodiversity===

Many plants and animals are associated with &quot;C. australis&quot; in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern &quot;Asplenium&quot;, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. &quot;Astelia&quot; species and &quot;Collospermum&quot; often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include &quot;Griselinia lucida&quot;, as well as a range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—&quot;Phanaerochaeta cordylines&quot; and &quot;Sphaeropsis cordylines&quot;—occur almost exclusively on &quot;C. australis&quot;.

Animals and birds associated with &quot;C. australis&quot; include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among the leaves of the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree standing in the middle of a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.

The berries of &quot;C. australis&quot; are enjoyed by bellbirds, tūī, and kererū. Māori sometimes planted groves of cabbage trees () to attract kererū which could be snared when they came to eat the berries. Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a tapu grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: &quot;About four miles from our house, there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (bracœna) [sic] and got so heavy with fat that they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Māoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of the stupid pigeons as they were feeding.&quot; As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of starlings which descend upon the fruit.

The nectar of the flowers is sought after by insects, bellbirds, tūī, and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide excellent homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, fly larvae, wētā, snails and slugs. Many of these are then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While it is said that they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.

Insects, including beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, leaves and flowers of the tree in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for wētā to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of the tree have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.

There are nine species of insect only found on &quot;C. australis&quot;, of which the best known is &quot;Epiphryne verriculata&quot;, the cabbage tree moth, which is perfectly adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs at the base of the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.

==Threats, pests and diseases==

===Sudden decline===

Cases of sick and dying trees of &quot;C. australis&quot; were first reported in the northern part of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.

For some years, the cause of the disease was unknown, and hypotheses included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupō in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium &quot;Phytoplasma australiense&quot;, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.

Populations of &quot;C. australis&quot; were decimated in some parts of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.

===Rural decline===
The plight of &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; in the Sudden Decline epidemic drew attention to another widespread threat to the tree in rural areas throughout New Zealand. Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists to refer to a decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.

Often farmers would leave a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because livestock eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree is the only shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in the centre of the stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like &quot;Phanerochaete cordylines&quot;, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.

Other mammals can be destructive. Possums tend not to eat the leaves of the tree but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich flowering stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.

==Māori cultural uses==

In traditional times, Māori had a rich knowledge of the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, the use of the tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.

===Food===
The stems and fleshy rhizomes of &quot;C. australis&quot; are high in natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (&quot;umu tī&quot;, a large type of &quot;hāngī&quot;) to produce &quot;kāuru&quot;, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called &quot;kōuka&quot;—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around &quot;C. australis&quot;. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.

Large parties trimmed the cut stems and left them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk below the surface of the ground shaped like enormous carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.

After drying, the harvested stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 hours or more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then flattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until the time came to add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed and was said to smell and taste like molasses.

Evidence of large cooking pits (umu tī) can still be found in the hills of South Canterbury and North Otago, where large groves of cabbage trees still stand. Europeans used the plant to make alcohol, and the often alcoholically potent brews were relished by whalers and sealers.

The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, it was called the kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small artichoke heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.

===Fibre===
A tough fibre was extracted from the leaves of &quot;C. australis&quot;, and was valued for its strength and durability especially in seawater. The leaves are suitable for weaving in its raw state, without any need to further process the fibres. The leaves were used for making anchor ropes and fishing lines, cooking mats, baskets, sandals and leggings for protection when travelling in the South Island high country, home of the prickly speargrasses (&quot;Aciphylla&quot;) and tūmatakuru or matagouri (&quot;Discaria toumatou&quot;). Because of the water-resistant properties of the plant, the leaves were traditionally used for cooking baskets.

Mōrere swings provided a source of amusement for Māori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from the leaves or fibre of &quot;C. australis&quot;, which were much tougher than the fibres of New Zealand flax. The leaves were also used for rain capes, although the mountain cabbage tree &quot;C. indivisa&quot;, was preferred. The fibre made from cabbage tree leaves is stronger than that made from New Zealand flax.

===Medicine===
The Māori used various parts of &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; to treat injuries and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.

==Cultivation today==

&quot;Cordyline australis&quot; is one of the most widely cultivated New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It can also be grown successfully in Mediterranean climates. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.

It grows well as far north as the eastern coast of Scotland, including the village of Portgower. It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in southern Europe, California and Japan. Even though its natural distribution ranges from 34° S to 46°S, and despite its ultimately subtropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61ºN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.

===Cultivars===

In the North Island, Māori cultivated selected forms of &quot;C. australis&quot; for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple fleshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of &quot;C. australis&quot;, it has a rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar &quot;Cordyline&quot; &#x27;Thomas Kirk&#x27;. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from &quot;C. australis&quot; of the central North Island.

&quot;Cordyline&quot; &#x27;Tī Tawhiti&#x27; was &quot;the subject of an intense discussion amongst the leading botanists of New Zealand at a meeting of the Royal Society ... in Wellington 100 years ago. It was saved from extinction because its dwarf form found favour with gardeners and it came to be known as Cordyline &#x27;Kirkii&#x27; recording the interest Thomas Kirk had in the plant. Its origin as a Māori selection was forgotten until rediscovered in 1991. The name &#x27;Tawhiti&#x27; is equivalent to &#x27;Hawaiki&#x27; and indicates the traditional belief that the plant was introduced to Aotearoa by the ancestral canoes of Māori. However, it is more probable that the name arose from it being moved around its native land as a domesticated plant.&quot;

Numerous cultivars of &quot;C. australis&quot; are sold within New Zealand and around the world. Like other &quot;Cordyline&quot; species, &quot;C. australis&quot; can produce sports which have very attractive colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: &quot;Cordyline australis&quot; &#x27;Lentiginosa&#x27; was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included &#x27;Veitchii&#x27; (1871) with crimson midribs, &#x27;Atrosanguinea&#x27; (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, &#x27;Atropurpurea&#x27; (1886) and &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; (1890) with purple leaves, and a range of variegated forms: &#x27;Doucetiana&#x27; (1878), &#x27;Argento-striata&#x27; (1888) and &#x27;Dalleriana&#x27; (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other &quot;Cordyline&quot; species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of &quot;C. australis&quot; and &quot;C. banksii&quot; in their 1925 catalogue and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.

Immature forms have become a popular annual house or ornamental plant under the name &#x27;Spikes&#x27;, or &quot;Dracaena&quot; &#x27;Spikes&#x27;. 
 To add to the confusion, these may be misidentified as &quot;Cordyline indivisa&quot; (syn. &quot;Dracaena indivisa&quot;).

&quot;C. australis&quot; is hardy to USDA zones 8–11.

<text>Banisteriopsis caapi, also known as, caapi, soul vine, yagé (yage), or ayahuasca, the latter of which also refers to the psychedelic decoction made with the vine and a plant source of dimethyltryptamine, is a South American liana of the family Malpighiaceae. It is commonly used as an ingredient of ayahuasca, a decoction with a long history of its entheogenic (connecting to spirit) use and holds status as a &quot;plant teacher&quot; among the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforest.

According to &quot;The CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names&quot; by Umberto Quattrocchi, the naming of the genus &quot;Banisteriopsis&quot; was dedicated to John Banister, a 17th-century English clergyman and naturalist. An earlier name for the genus was &quot;Banisteria&quot; and the plant is sometimes referred to as &quot;Banisteria caapi&quot;. Other names include &quot;Banisteria quitensis&quot;, &quot;Banisteriopsis inebrians&quot;, and &quot;Banisteriopsis quitensis&quot;.

==Description==
Caapi is a giant vine with characteristic white or pale pink flowers which most commonly appear in January, but are known to bloom infrequently. It resembles &quot;Banisteriopsis membranifolia&quot; and &quot;Banisteriopsis muricata&quot;, both of which are related to caapi.
The vine can grow up to in length, twining on other plants for support.

==Phytochemicals==
===Alkaloids===
Caapi contains the following harmala alkaloids:

*Harmine, 0.31–8.43%
*Harmaline, 0.03–0.83%
*Tetrahydroharmine, 0.05–2.94%

These alkaloids of the beta-carboline class act as monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOIs). The MAOIs allow the primary psychoactive compound, DMT, which is introduced from the other common ingredient in ayahuasca &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot;, to be orally active.

The stems contain 0.11–0.83% beta-carbolines, with harmine and tetrahydroharmine as the major components.

Alkaloids are present in all parts of the plant.

=== Polyphenols ===
In addition to beta-carbolines, caapi is known to contain proanthocyanidins, epicatechin and procyanidin B2, which have antioxidant properties.

==History==
The first mentions of caapi come from early Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries who visited South America in the 16th century, describing ayahuasca brews as &quot;diabolic&quot; and dangerous decoctions.

Although utilised among the indigenous tribes of South America for hundreds and perhaps even thousands of years, caapi was not identified by westerners until 1851, when Richard Spruce, an English botanist, described it as a new species. He observed how Guahibos,
the indigenous people of Llanos (Venezuela), chewed the bark of caapi instead of brewing it as a drink.

==Legality==

===United States===
In the United States, caapi is not specifically regulated. A 2006 Supreme Court decision involving caapi-containing ayahuasca, which also contains other plants containing the controlled substance DMT, introduced from the &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot; component, &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal&quot;, was found in favor of the União do Vegetal, a Brazilian religious sect using the tea in their ceremonies and having around 130 members in the United States.
===Australia===
In Australia, the harmala alkaloids are scheduled substances, including harmine and harmaline; however, the living vine, or other source plants are not scheduled in most states. In the State of Queensland as of March 2008, this distinction is now uncertain. In all states, the dried herb may or may not be considered a scheduled substance, dependent on court rulings.
===Canada===
In Canada, harmala is listed under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as a schedule III substance. The vine and the ayahuasca brew are legal ambiguities, since nowhere in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is it stated that natural material containing a scheduled substance is illegal, a position supported by the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board.
===France===
Caapi, as well as a range of harmala alkaloids, are scheduled in France following a court victory by the Santo Daime religious sect allowing use of the tea due to it not being a chemical extraction and the fact that the plants used were not scheduled. Religious exceptions to narcotics laws are not allowed under French law, effectively making any use or possession of the tea illegal.

==Patent==
The caapi vine itself was the subject of a dispute between U.S. entrepreneur Loren Miller and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). In 1986, Miller obtained a U.S. patent on a variety of &quot;B. caapi&quot;. COICA argued the patent was invalid because Miller&#x27;s variety had been previously described in the University of Michigan Herbarium, and was therefore neither new nor distinct. The patent was overturned in 1999; however, in 2001, the United States Patent Office reinstated the patent because the law at the time the patent was granted did not allow a third party such as COICA standing to object. The Miller patent expired in 2003. &quot;B. caapi&quot; is now being cultivated commercially in Hawaii.

<text>The Indian pond heron or paddybird (Ardeola grayii) is a small heron. It is of Old World origins, breeding in southern Iran and east to the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and Sri Lanka. They are widespread and common but can be easily missed when they stalk prey at the edge of small water-bodies or even when they roost close to human habitations.

They are distinctive when they take off, with bright white wings flashing in contrast to the cryptic streaked olive and brown colours of the body. Their camouflage is so excellent that they can be approached closely before they take to flight, a behaviour which has resulted in folk names and beliefs that the birds are short-sighted or blind.

==Description==

Indian pond herons are stocky with short necks, short thick bills and buff-brown backs. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Their appearance is transformed from dull colours when they take to flight and the white of the wings makes them very prominent. They are very similar to the squacco herons, &quot;Ardeola ralloides&quot;, but darker backed. To the east of their range, they are replaced by the Chinese pond herons, &quot;Ardeola bacchus&quot;.

During the breeding season, there are records of individuals with red legs. The numbers do not suggest that this is a normal change for adults during the breeding season and some have suggested the possibility of it being genetic variants.

 plumage has been noted. The race &quot;phillipsi&quot; has been suggested for the populations found in the Maldives, without much acceptance. It forms a superspecies with the closely related Chinese pond heron, Javan pond heron and the Madagascar pond heron.

They are usually silent but may make a harsh croak in alarm when flushed or near their nests.

This bird was first described by Colonel W. H. Sykes in 1832 and given its scientific name in honour of John Edward Gray. Karyology studies indicate that pond herons have 68 chromosomes (2N).

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are very common in India, and are usually solitary foragers but numbers of them may sometimes feed in close proximity during the dry seasons when small wetlands have a high concentration of prey. They are semi-colonial breeders. They may also forage at garbage heaps. During dry seasons, they sometimes take to foraging on well watered lawns or even dry grassland. When foraging, they allow close approach and flush only at close range. They sometimes form communal roosts, often in avenue trees over busy urban areas.

===Food and feeding===
The Indian pond heron&#x27;s feeding habitat is marshy wetlands. They usually feed at the edge of ponds but make extensive use of floating vegetation such as water hyacinth to access deeper water. They may also on occasion swim on water or fish from the air and land in deeper waters. They have also been observed to fly and capture fishes leaping out of water.
 Sometimes, they fly low over water to drive frogs and fishes towards the shore before settling along the shoreline. They have been noted to pick up crumbs of bread and drop them on the water surface to bait fishes.

The primary food of these birds includes crustaceans, aquatic insects, fishes, tadpoles and sometimes leeches (&quot;Herpobdelloides&quot; sp.). Outside wetlands, these herons feed on insects (including crickets, dragonflies and bees), fish (&quot;Barilius&quot; noted as important in a study in Chandigarh) and amphibians.

===Breeding===

The breeding season begins with the onset of the monsoons. They nest in small colonies, often with other wading birds, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Most nests are built at a height of about 9 to 10 m in large leafy trees. The nest material is collected by the male while the female builds the nest. Three to five eggs are laid. The eggs hatch asynchronously, taking 18 to 24 days to hatch. Both parents feed the young. Fish are the main diet fed to young. Nest sites that are not disturbed may be reused year after year.

===Mortality factors===
They have few predators but injured birds may be taken by birds of prey.

An arbovirus that causes &quot;Balagodu&quot;, trematodes and several other parasites have been isolated from the species. Antibodies to Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus has been detected in pond herons and cattle egrets from southern India. Traces of heavy metals acquired from feeding in polluted waters may be particularly concentrated in the tail feathers.

==In culture==

The habit of standing still and flushing only at the last moment has led to widespread folk beliefs that they are semi-blind and their name in many languages includes such suggestions. In Sri Lanka the bird is called &quot;kana koka&quot; which translates as &quot;half-blind heron&quot; in the Sinhala language. The Hindustani phrase &quot;bagla bhagat&quot; has been used to describe a &quot;wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot; or a hypocrite appearing like a meditating saint and occurs in a Marathi proverb. The paddy-bird also appears as a character in the Hitopadesha where, in one story, it takes injury to itself to save a king. The bird was noted by Anglo-Indian naturalist-writers for the surprising transformation in colours. Phil Robinson described the bird as one that sits all dingy gray and flies all white. It is said to have been eaten by many in India in former times.

During the height of the plume trade, feathers were collected from the &quot;paddy bird&quot; and exported to Britain.

<text>Lord Emsworth and Others is a collection of nine short stories by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 19 March 1937 by Herbert Jenkins, London; it was not published in the United States. The Crime Wave at Blandings, which was published on 25 June 1937 by Doubleday, Doran, New York, is a very different collection, sharing only three of its seven titles with the UK book. Penguin Books published a UK edition of &quot;The Crime Wave at Blandings&quot; in 1966. The stories in both books had all previously appeared in both British and American magazines.

&quot;Lord Emsworth and Others&quot; contains one story set at Blandings Castle, three golf stories narrated by the Oldest Member, one story featuring Drones Club member Freddie Widgeon, one tale narrated by Mr Mulliner, and three Ukridge stories.

&quot;The Crime Wave at Blandings&quot; contains the Blandings, Mulliner and Freddie Widgeon stories, to which were added two more Drones stories, a Bingo Little story, and a novella, &quot;The Medicine Girl&quot;, which had been published separately in the UK as &quot;Doctor Sally&quot; (1932).

==Contents==

===&quot;Buried Treasure&quot;=== 
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, September 1936
* US: &quot;This Week&quot;, 27 September 1936 (as &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot;)

Mr Mulliner&#x27;s nephew Brancepeth wants to marry his beloved Muriel, but hasn&#x27;t a sou to do it on, so her father Lord Bromborough is forcing her to marry the boob of the first water Edwin Potter (heir of Potter&#x27;s Potted Meats). Bromborough has a weakness, though: his great moustache Joyeuse, which he compares favorably to Love in Idleness, the facial decoration of Potter&#x27;s father Sir Preston. Having been invited to Rumpling Hall to paint a portrait of Lord Bromborough, Brancepeth realizes that if he can turn a moustachless Bromborough into an animated cartoon in Hollywood, fame, fortune, and Muriel are his.

===&quot;The Letter of the Law&quot;===

* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, April 1936
* US: &quot;Red Book&quot;, April 1936 (as &quot;Not Out of Distance&quot;)

The President&#x27;s Cup and the love of Gwendoline Poskitt occasion the only time the Oldest Member ever saw profit from driving into anyone. Young Wilmot Byng loves Gwendoline, but has recently smitten her father (a member of the Wrecking Crew) a juicy one on the leg for holding up play. To win her hand, the Oldest Member recommends that Wilmot appease Poskitt, and he does so—up to the day of the President&#x27;s Cup match. In that match, Poskitt plays well above form, but ends up in match play against Wadsworth Hemmingway, an ex-lawyer-turned-golfer who carries the Book of Rules in his bag and makes it his best club. With one swing, Wilmot ensures that Poskitt gets the Cup and Wilmot gets his bride.

===&quot;Farewell to Legs&quot;=== 
* US: &quot;This Week&quot;, 14 July 1935 (omitting Oldest Member introduction)
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, May 1936

The title is a play on Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1929 novel, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;.

The betrothal of Evangeline Brackett to Angus McTavish is built, in large part, on the way she bites her lip and rolls her eyes when she tops her drive, says the Oldest Member. But when Legs Mortimer takes up residence in the Clubhouse, Evangeline&#x27;s mind wanders from her golf, and Angus worries that she is losing her form for the Ladies&#x27; Medal. But the scales fall from Evangeline&#x27;s eyes when Legs does the unthinkable on the links.

===&quot;There&#x27;s Always Golf&quot;=== 
* US: &quot;Red Book&quot;, February 1936 (as &quot;A Triple Threat Man&quot;)
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, March 1936

Clarice Fitch was a force to be reckoned with, recalls the Oldest Member, and weedy, bespectacled accountant Ernest Plinlimmon is powerfully affected by the impact of her personality. But like hundreds of others, he escapes her notice, until he encounters her on the eighteenth fairway, needing a four to win the Medals Competition. But she is not playing—she is tying her shoelace. When a forceful woman comes between a man and a coveted tournament medal, she sees the true depths of his soul.

===&quot;The Masked Troubadour&quot;=== 
* US: &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, 28 November 1936 (as &quot;Reggie and the Greasy Bird&quot;, with different setting &amp; characters)
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, December 1936

&quot;Reggie and the Greasy Bird&quot; is a rewritten version of the story with different characters, created because Wodehouse needed the money for his taxes.

At the Drones Club, two Beans see Freddie Widgeon handing money to a greasy-looking man. A Crumpet explains that the man, Jos. Waterbury, is a professional pianist, and Freddie feels obliged to give him money occasionally. The Crumpet tells the following story.

Freddie has lunch with his uncle, Lord Blicester (pronounced &quot;blister&quot;). Blicester has invited his friend Lady Pinfold and her daughter Dora to lunch. He wants Freddie to marry Dora. Freddie falls in love with Dora. She volunteers at a sort of Mission where they are putting on an entertainment. Freddie sings for the event, accompanied by Dora on the piano. He is a hit and invites the audience to return in a week for buns and cocoa. However, he does not have enough money to pay for the food. His uncle gives him ten pounds, but Freddie thinks he needs more. At the Drones, Freddie sees a kid, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps&#x27;s cousin Egbert. Fellow Drone Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright says that Egbert can hit anything with a Brazil nut fired from a catapult. Freddie bets Catsmeat five pounds that Egbert cannot shoot the hat off an old gentleman leaving a cab. Freddie loses the bet, and sees that it was Blicester whose hat was knocked off. Incidentally, Blicester came to get two pounds ten shillings back.

Freddie decides to sing in an East End music hall&#x27;s Amateur Night to win the five-pound prize. He pays Waterbury five shillings to be his accompanist. Blicester is nearby, so Freddie disguises himself with a mask and calls himself The Masked Troubadour. Freddie sings well, but a red-headed man in the audience, &quot;Ginger&quot; Murphy, recognizes Waterbury. He throws an egg at Waterbury, which misses. They argue and a food fight breaks out. Waterbury flees to a pub, where Freddie and Murphy follow. A bar-room brawl ensues. Outside, Blicester sees Freddie get thrown out. When he grabs Freddie&#x27;s arm, Freddie mistakes him for a brawler and hits him in the midriff before rejoining the brawl. The next day, Blicester decides to send Freddie away to the country for a few weeks. Freddie calls Dora and tells her everything; she hangs up on him. Waterbury thanks Freddie for saving him in the brawl, and plays on Freddie&#x27;s sympathy to get some money from him.

The version titled &quot;Reggie and the Greasy Bird&quot; features Reggie Mumford and is very similar to the Freddie Widgeon version. Reggie is a member of the Junior Rotters Club instead of the Drones, where his fellow member is Beano Bagshot rather than Catsmeat. His uncle is Lord Uppingham, and the girl he falls for is Constance Rackstraw. At the Amateur Night competition, he is accompanied by the greasy-looking pianist Sid Montrose. Ginger Murphy&#x27;s name is not changed.

===&quot;Ukridge and the Home from Home&quot;=== 
* US: &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, February 1931
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, June 1931

Ukridge arrives at his friend James Corcoran&#x27;s house at 3 a.m., dressed in his pyjamas and mackintosh. He relates to his friend how he had been left in charge of his Aunt Julia&#x27;s house, and had come up with the ingenious idea of renting out rooms to an exclusive clientele of boarders while she was away.

For a time the plan goes smoothly. With the staff bribed to help, he fills the house with paying guests, and rakes in their money while playing the gracious host. However, meeting an old friend of his Aunt&#x27;s, he hears she is returning sooner than expected, and tries to think of a way to get rid of the guests before their contracted stays are up.

After a plot to imply the drainage in the house is faulty fails, Ukridge decides to claim the house is infected with Scarlet fever, but receiving a telegram from his aunt saying she will arrive in Paris the following week, and knowing a trip there always takes his aunt a few weeks, decides to delay shutting down his plan to grab a few more weeks rent.

Soon after, the house is aroused by shooting. One of guests, the retired Lieutenant-Colonel B. B. Bagnew, convinced he has seen a burglar, opened fire with his service revolver. Ukridge calms the house, but on retiring to bed, finds Aunt Julia hiding in the cupboard, convinced the butler has gone insane. Ukridge attempts to smuggle her out of the house, but she insists on getting some things from her bedroom. Entering the room, she disturbs the guest staying there, who screams; the Colonel rushes in and opens fire once more. Ukridge, taking advantage of the confusion, grabs his coat and slips away, ending up at his friend&#x27;s bedside in the small hours of the night.

===&quot;The Come-back of Battling Billson&quot;=== 
* US: &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, June 1935
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, July 1935

Corky, having had a story idea turned down by Hollywood, attacks the talking picture, but his friend Ukridge comes to its defence. He has, he says, always had a special affection for the talkies. He tells his friend why...

About to be left alone once more at his Aunt Julia&#x27;s house, Ukridge realises he can make some quick cash by renting out the lawns to a party of folk dancers. Of course, Aunt Julia&#x27;s trip is unexpectedly cancelled, and Ukridge needs some cash to pay back the dancers, who are upset at having their party cancelled at the last minute.

Ukridge sets up a bout for &quot;Battling&quot; Billson, using the man&#x27;s desire to wed his girl Flossie to persuade him to take part. Finding Billson&#x27;s training methods (mostly involving ale and cigars) somewhat lacking, Ukridge inveigles the big boxer into his Aunt&#x27;s house as an odd-job man, allowing him to personally supervise the training regime. His aunt is a little nonplussed, but is soon persuaded everything is alright.

The training continues apace, but Billson seems to be benefitting little. His waist expands and his wind does not. The butler Oakshott, it emerges, having wowed Billson with his dignified manner, is now plying the boxer with an excess of food, cigars and port. Ukridge has just discovered that the conniving butler has money on Billson&#x27;s opponent in the upcoming bout, when Aunt Julia learns of Ukridge&#x27;s dance scheme, and throws him out of the house. He tries to persuade Billson to leave with him, but the big man resolutely refuses.

Ukridge, seeing disaster loom, fetches Flossie to the house to talk some sense into Billson. They find he has gone to the movie theatre with the butler, and hasten down there, but Flossie is as weak before the butler&#x27;s fatherly gaze as Billson himself. All four of them end up in the cinema, at a screening of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. When the talking starts up, Billson is enraged, calling loudly for quiet in the cinema. The audience reacts strongly, fighting ensues, and Billson is hauled off to jail for two weeks. He emerges trim and in top form, easily besting his opponent in the ring.

===&quot;The Level Business Head&quot;=== 
* UK: &quot;Strand&quot;, May 1926
* US: &quot;Liberty&quot; 8 May 1926

Corky is surprised to find himself dining at Ukridge&#x27;s Aunt Julia&#x27;s house, where he is not usually welcome; Ukridge explains that he has recently acquired a certain degree of power over his aunt, thanks to his having pawned her brooch. He explains...

Ukridge runs into Joe the Lawyer, a notorious bookmaker, and is offered the chance to buy a half-share in a dog with excellent prospects. Ukridge can&#x27;t afford the stake £50, of course, so at first refuses, but later that day Aunt Julia, about to depart on yet another tour, tasks him with collecting her brooch from a jeweller&#x27;s and locking it safely in her desk. He pawns the brooch, and hands the cash over to Joe the Lawyer. The next day, Joe informs him that the dog has died and offers to reimburse him £5, leaving Ukridge considerably short of the money he needs to buy back the brooch.

Angelica Vining, a friend of Aunt Julia&#x27;s, arrives having been told she can borrow the brooch and lent the key to the drawer, but Ukridge pockets the key and sends the woman away. He heads to Lewes races to rake back some money, and there meets Joe the Lawyer once more. He tries to borrow money from him, but is refused, and learns that Joe has raffled the dead dog for a considerable sum. He gets a lift with Joe to the next race meet at Sandown Park Racecourse, as a favour.

On the way, the car overheats and breaks down. Visiting a nearby house to fetch water, they find it guarded by a fearsome dog; Joe, afraid of dogs, drops his bag full of money in the garden as he flees. Ukridge sees that the dog is harmless, and tells Joe he will retrieve the bag for £50, an offer which Joe accepts, but while Ukridge is playing merrily with the dog, Joe grabs the bag himself, and refuses to pay.

When Joe goes off to find water elsewhere, Ukridge meets the owner of the house, and buys his dog from him for 5 shillings. He puts the dog in the car, and when Joe returns and finds he cannot get into his car, Ukridge offers to sell him the dog, for £100. He then charges a further £50 to remove the dog from the car, returns it to its previous owner, and returns home with his pockets full.

Aunt Julia, returning in a rage at hearing her friend has been refused the loan of her brooch, tells Ukridge she is sure he has pawned it; she makes him force open the drawer, and is deflated to find it sitting there, having been returned just in time, giving Ukridge an advantage over his distrustful aunt.

<text>The Orkhon River (; ) is the longest river in Mongolia.

It rises in the Khangai Mountains in the Tsenkher sum of Arkhangai aimag at the foot of the Suvraga Khairkhan mountain.
From there, it crosses the border into Övörkhangai aimag and follows the upper Orkhon valley in an eastern direction until it reaches Kharkhorin. On this stretch, very close to the Orkhon, the Ulaan Tsutgalan river features a waterfall, wide and high, which is a popular destination for tourists.

From Kharkhorin it flows northwards until it reaches Bulgan aimag, and then north-east to join the Selenge River next to Sükhbaatar city in Selenge aimag, close to the Russian border.
The Selenge then flows further north into Russia and Lake Baikal.

With , the Orkhon is longer than the Selenge, making it the longest river in Mongolia. Major tributaries of the Orkhon river are the Tuul River and Tamir River.

There are two sets of ancient ruins along the river valley: Khar Balgas, the ancient capital of the Uyghur Kingdom and Karakorum, the ancient capital of the Mongol Empire. Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov excavated several Xiongnu Imperial tombs in the area of the river valley.

Fish in the Orkhon River include pike, carp, perch, taimen and catfish.

UNESCO lists the Orkhon Valley as a World Heritage Site.

<doc id="444207" wikidata="Q4665655" url="?curid=444207" title="Abdul Rahman Yasin">
<text>Abdul Rahman Yasin (; born April 10, 1960) is an Iraqi-American terrorist and fugitive who took part in the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing terrorist attack. Yasin is presumed to have helped assemble the bombs and explosives. He has been characterized in the American media as &quot;the only participant in the first attempt to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993 who was never caught.&quot; Yasin&#x27;s whereabouts remain unknown.

== Personal information ==
==Early life and education==
Yasin was born in Bloomington, Indiana, where his father, originally from Iraq, went to study for a PhD. Yasin is therefore an American citizen. Shortly after his birth, Yasin&#x27;s family moved back to Iraq. Yasin&#x27;s FBI report states that he is epileptic.

==Arrival in United States, 1992==
In 1992, Yasin was able to use his American birth citizenship to obtain a US passport and thus enter the United States.

Recruited by Ramzi Yousef, he had acid burns on his legs from bomb chemicals.

Soon following investigation of the attack on February 26, 1993, Yasin was picked up by the FBI on March 4, 1993, the same day as the arrest of Mohammed A. Salameh, in a sweep of sites associated with Salameh. Yasin was found in the apartment in Jersey City, New Jersey, that he was sharing with his mother. Yasin was taken to New Jersey FBI headquarters in Newark, where he was reportedly very cooperative. Agents had Yasin retrace where and how the WTC bomb had been built in New York and New Jersey. Yasin said he was released after giving agents names and addresses, and went to Iraq.

==Return to Iraq and imprisonment, 1993==
In March 1993, Yasin boarded Royal Jordanian flight 262 to Amman, Jordan. From Amman, Abdul Rahman Yasin went on to Baghdad. November 1997 marked the month when two others were convicted in a court for their contributions to the bombing, but only &quot;one other man believed to be directly involved in the attack, Iraqi Abdul Rahman Yasin, remained at large.&quot;

In 1994, the Iraqi authorities arrested and imprisoned Yasin, and sent an emissary to the State Department to inform them that they had crucial information about a perpetrator of the World Trade Center attack and were prepared to cooperate. The State Department did not respond to the offer.

In spite of the fact that the U.S. government had been informed of Yasin&#x27;s whereabouts, on October 10, 2001, Yasin&#x27;s name appeared at the top of the list of the FBI&#x27;s 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President George W. Bush with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture.

In 2002, following the September 11th attacks, Iraq attempted to hand Yasin over to the US government and began negotiating extradition protocols with the Americans via Egypt. However, negotiations hit a snag when US intelligence refused to provide Iraq with a receipt citing unfair demands—an official statement acknowledging Yasin had been handed over.

On May 23, 2002, the Iraqis gave Lesley Stahl of CBS News access to an Iraqi prison to interview Yasin for a segment on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; where Yasin appeared in prison pajamas and handcuffs. The Iraqis stated they had held Yasin prisoner on the outskirts of Baghdad since 1994. Yasin has not been seen or heard from since the 2002 prison interview.

After the invasion, large numbers of Iraqi government documents were retrieved by U.S. intelligence. An anonymous US intelligence official claimed to &quot;USA Today&quot; that &quot;some of the analysts concluded that the documents show that Saddam&#x27;s government provided monthly payments and a home for Yasin.&quot; However, intelligence and law enforcement officials disagreed on its conclusiveness.

==Al-Qaeda sanctions listing==

Despite the fact that a direct al-Qaeda role in the 1993 WTC attack was never established, Abdul Rahman Yasin was listed on 17 October 2001 as being associated with the organization known as al-Qaeda, the individual named Osama bin Laden and the organization known as the Taliban, for his participation:

<text>The 2008 Rugby League World Cup was the thirteenth World Cup for men’s rugby league national teams. It was held between 26 October and 22 November and was won by New Zealand, who defeated Australia 34–20 in the final in one of the greatest upsets in the sports history.

Originally there was a plan to hold a World Cup in Australia in 2004, however the lack of competitiveness at the 2000 World Cup and rise of the Tri-Nations between Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain meant that plans for another World Cup were shelved.

For the World Cup to regain some credibility, the number of teams was reduced to ten with Australia, England, France Papau New Guinea and New Zealand automatically qualifying and a qualifying tournament to determine the other five teams. The tournament ended a year of celebrations commemorating the centenary of the game in the southern hemisphere and was part of the Festival of World Cups.

== Format ==

=== Qualification ===
The hosts, Australia, were given automatic entry into the World Cup, along with New Zealand, England, France and Papua New Guinea. The five remaining places in the World Cup were determined by qualification rounds. Two European rounds and Pacific, Atlantic and Repêchage rounds were scheduled.

Tonga and Fiji became the first two nations to qualify after Tonga defeated Samoa 18–10 in Leeds on 22 October, forcing Samoa to enter the repêchage. In the European Group Two, Ireland drew 16–16 with Lebanon to ensure qualification, while Lebanon were forced to enter the repêchage. The final automatic place went to Scotland, who defeated Wales 37–32 on aggregate after two legs. Wales then faced Lebanon in the repêchage semi-final, where they lost in a surprise 50–26 defeat, to knock them out of World Cup Qualifying. Lebanon then faced Samoa, who beat USA 42–10 in the first semi-final, on 14 November for the final qualifying position. The game was won by Samoa, 38–16, and so they booked the tenth and final place. Many qualification matches were broadcast live by Sky Sports in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, whilst BigPondTV broadcast matches online for other fans around the world.

=== Draw ===
The draw, after being confirmed by the RLIF on 19 April 2007, involved three groups. The first group was made up of four teams; Australia, England, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Whilst the other two groups involved three teams each. The semi finals were made up of the first three teams in the first group and the winner of a playoff between the winners of the second and third groups.

The draw was put into doubt after the Papua New Guinea team claimed that it was unfair to them and threatened to boycott the tournament should it not be changed. Marcus Bai, former Papua New Guinean winger and captain, said:

Fortunately for the tournament, this separate island competition did not eventuate. Papua New Guinea still remained upset with the draw, seeing it as a huge challenge but one which would have seen them be rewarded if they had won. The draw was finalised on 4 October 2007.

The first match took place in Townsville between England and Papua New Guinea, although the official opening ceremony of the competition occurred before the Australia and New Zealand match the following day in Sydney. The final took place at Lang Park (Suncorp Stadium) in Brisbane.

Teams received 2 points for a win, and 1-point for a draw. This meant that, unlike in the Australasian National Rugby League, there was no &quot;golden point&quot; rule enforced. In group stages, if two teams had the same number of points then positions were determined on points difference, the number of points scored minus the number of points conceded.

After group matches were completed, a match featuring the second placed teams in Group B and Group C took place with the winner receiving 7th place. Similarly the third placed teams in Group B and Group C played off for 9th place. It was believed that these results were to be taken into account in the 2009 RLIF World Rankings.

===Squads===

Each nation competing in the tournament named 24-man squads in the weeks prior to the group stage commencing.

== Venues ==
Due to Rugby League World Cup rules prohibiting the use of commercial venue names, all venues were known by their non-commercial names, e.g. Suncorp Stadium was known as Lang Park during the tournament. Lang Park would also host the World Cup final.
== Officiating ==
Six referees from four countries controlled matches in the tournament. These four nations also provided touch judges while England and Australia provided the video referees. In support of the Australian National Breast Cancer Foundation, the referees wore pastel pink shirts while officiating matches to raise awareness. The shirts, which carried the NBCF logo on the collar, were signed by the team captains at each World Cup game and were later auctioned off with the proceeds going to the NBCF.

== Opening ceremony ==
On Sunday night, 26 October, the Sydney Football Stadium hosted the Opening Ceremony of the World Cup. It started with Greg Inglis reciting a speech about &quot;Playing Fair&quot;. Following Inglis&#x27; speech there was an Aboriginal Smoking ceremony to welcome all the athletes and participants. This included a rather large sized Rainbow Serpent which represented the Aboriginal Dreamtime. The last part of the ceremony involved a performance of the Rugby League World Cup anthem &quot;Hero&quot; by Natalie Bassingthwaighte. A curtain raiser to the Australia vs. New Zealand match included an Indigenous Australian squad playing against New Zealand Māori which featured several prominent NRL players and rising stars, including Chris Sandow, Wairangi Koopu, Preston Campbell, Sam Thaiday, Shaun Kenny-Dowall and Carl Webb.

As part of the official opening of the World Cup on 26 October, an exhibition game was played between an Aboriginal selection and a New Zealand Māori side.


== Group stage ==
The 2008 Rugby League World Cup&#x27;s eighteen matches were played during October and November in various locations throughout the east coast of Australia. The tournament&#x27;s teams were divided into three pool groups. The teams finishing highest amongst those groups progressed to the play-offs.

All teams from group A (shaded in green) with the exception of the bottom qualifying team progressed to the semi-finals, the other two groups the top finisher progressed to a playoff match, in which the winner would qualify to the semi-finals.

== Critical reception ==
Due to the generally poor response of the 2000 World Cup, there were several key criticisms of the tournament before any matches had kicked off. The RLIF were forced to defend the credibility of the tournament in October 2007 after New Zealand, one of the favourites for the competition, were heavily beaten in a Test match 58–0 in Wellington against Australia. Another concern was whether there would be enough competitiveness throughout the ten teams, with some fans worried about the possibility of too many one-sided matches, which was a common sight in the Group Stages of the 2000 tournament.

Ricky Stuart, coach of the Australian team, was reported to be so incensed by his team&#x27;s defeat in the final that he verbally attacked Geoff Carr, the chief executive of Australian Rugby League, claiming that tournament organisers and match officials conspired to cause the Australian loss. The next morning he had a chance meeting with Ashley Klein, who refereed the final, and Stuart Cummings, the Rugby Football League&#x27;s director of match officials, at their hotel. He reportedly abused both officials in front of a number of witnesses, calling Klein a cheat, and behaved in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner. Stuart later apologised for his behaviour and resigned from his post.

The tournament proved a commercial success, delivering a profit of over and re-establishing the credibility of the competition.

== Marketing ==
===Branding===
The World Cup&#x27;s &quot;Heroes Here 08&quot; promotional campaign was launched at the Sydney Opera House on 6 May 2008. At the launch, Paul Kind, the World Cup Director of Marketing, explained, &quot;Heroes Here 08 underlines that fact that the international game, and particularly this tournament, will bring out the best in every player who takes part. It will create heroes.&quot;

Natalie Bassingthwaighte recorded an &quot;Australian version&quot; of the Mariah Carey song &quot;Hero&quot; which accompanied the &quot;Heroes 08&quot; promotional video and other World Cup advertising. The World Cup Opening Ceremony featured a live performance of the song by Bassingthwaighte.

Filming of visuals for the promotional video began in Leeds during the worldwide ticketing launch for the event in November 2007.

Advertising agency MJW, celebrity photographer Garry Heery and production company Engine worked together to combine the latest digital animation with a dark and determined set that highlighted the passion players feel in representing their country on the international stage.

The Heroes campaign featured Mark Gasnier (Australia), Roy Asotasi (New Zealand), Rob Burrow (England), Keith Peters (PNG), Waisale Sukanaveita (Fiji), Nigel Vagana (Samoa), Jerome Guisset (France), Lee Paterson (Scotland), Stuart Littler (Ireland) and Lopini Paea (Tonga). Gasnier was later removed from some of the promotional material after he left the sport mid-season and was replaced by Darren Lockyer.

The video also appeared in the video game Rugby League 2: World Cup Edition, which featured a world cup mode based on the event.

===Ticketing===

Tickets for Australian residents went on sale 7 November 2007 and internationally on 18 February. However tickets were not distributed until 3 March. Ticketek were announced as the official ticketing agency for the competition, selling tickets for all matches. Ticketmaster and Pilbeam Theatre were selling tickets to the Telstra Dome and Browne Park matches respectively.

The World Cup final sold out months in advance.

Channel 9 broadcast all Group A matches and the Knockout Stage matches in Australia. Fox Sports broadcast all Group B and C matches plus Ranking Stage matches live. In the United Kingdom, Sky Sports broadcast all matches live, meaning that all were shown in the morning and some as early as 06:00 am with highlights being shown on the BBC. Sky Sport showed all games live across New Zealand. Mai TV broadcast all matches live in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Cook Islands and the Solomon Islands.

<text>The III Corps is a formation of the Indian Army that was formed during World War I in Mesopotamia during its respective campaign. Prior to the reorganization of the British and Indian forces in Mesopotamia, it was designated as the Tigris Corps.

A new III Corps was formed by the Indian Army during World War II for service in Southeast Asia. The corps fought in the Battle of Singapore where it surrendered in February 1942.

It is headquartered in the state of Nagaland of India in the city of Dimapur, at Rangapahar Military Station.

== History ==
3 Corps was raised during World War I by Lt Gen Ahlmer and soon thereafter, the command was changed to Lt Gen Frederick Stanley Maud, who was appointed as the Corps Commander on 09 Dec 1915. 3 Corps was allotted the 6th (Poona) Division and 12th Indian Division along with a Cavalry Brigade and tasked with the defence of the Tigris Line.  The Corps thereby earned the sobriquet of &quot;The Tigris Corps&quot;. 3 Corps played a major role in the Mesopotamian front, which was a campaign in the middle eastern theatre of World War I, fought between the Allies represented by the British Empire, troops from Britain, Australia and vast majority of British Raj, against the central powers, mostly the Ottoman Empire. The Theatre was vast and consisted of hot, inhospitable desert terrain.  Tank warfare had still not achieved its primacy and deserts remained primarily a no man’s land. The fight was concentrated along the course of Tigris and the Euphrates rivers where Ottomans had a head start. The British had realised that they needed to secure and control the delta of Tigris at Shatt-El-Arab and Basra to deny the Ottomans access to Abadan Refinery and the oil rich delta. It also provided the British with a bridgehead for the induction of troops through the sea route and to maintain their forces logistically during future operations in the north. Keeping this as the broad objective, the British dispatched the 6th Indian Division as the Indian Expeditionary Force to Basra in 1915.

The Corps was later split into two separate formations, namely 1 and 3 Corps.  I Corps moved northwards towards Mosul, while 3 Corps led a renewed offensive towards Baghdad, which finally fell to 3 Corps in 1916. The composition of 3 Corps was largely Indian troops and the credit for the swift capture of Baghdad was attributed to them. The Allied forces controlled a major part of Mesopotamia because of the fall of Baghdad, and most importantly, had direct access to the sea and the oldest refinery of Asia at Abadan.  In view of the strategic objective of bringing Mesopotamia under British control and liberation of Kuwait from Ottoman control being achieved, an armistice was signed between the British and the Ottoman Empire.

The military phase of the operations in the Middle East was over, paving the way for political and diplomatic overtures.  3 Corps which had played a great role in achievement perhaps did not get its due compared to similar forces fighting in the European Theatre. The Corps was finally demobilized in 1919, only to be resurrected in 1941 during World War II.

=== World War II ===
HQ 3 Corps was raised on 27 Apr 1941 with headquarters at Kuala Lumpur.  Lt Gen Percy Heath was placed in Command of the Corps.  It had two Divisions, namely the 9th and 11th Indian Divisions under command.

11th Indian Division which was tasked to defend Kuala Lumpur and withdraw towards Thailand was outflanked by the Japanese. The Division fought major battles at Jitra from 08-12 Dec 1941, Kampar from 30 Dec 1941 to 02 Jan 1942, Slim River from 06 Jan to 08 Jan 1942, Gemas and Muar River from 14 Jan to 02 Jan 1942 and gave a good account of themselves, despite debilitating logistic shortcoming and virtually no air support. 9th and 11th Indian Division suffered significant casualties without any significant reinforcements.

During the Malayan campaign, 3 Corps had borne the brunt of War, and men suffered from inclement weather and tropical diseases apart from enemy action.  Jungle terrain coupled with intolerable tropical weather and humidity made the conditions insuperable. Fighting here required the very best of human endurance, both mental and physical.  3 Corps had fought most of its battles in these virtually inhuman conditions, but there was little coverage of the same. While the trenches of Ypres, Somme, Alsace and Lorraine and those who fought in them were widely covered, the contributions of the anonymous Indians who died in Malaya remain un-recounted. 3 Corps virtually ceased to exist post Feb 1942.

=== III Corps: The Third Reincarnation ===
The Naga insurgency, over a period, gained inroads into the Hill districts of Manipur, Tirap and Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh bordering Nagaland. 8 Mountain Division was re-raised in 1962 located at Zakhama.

Spear Corps participated in the 1962 Indo – China war. The famous Battle of Walong was in the then NEFA (Arunachal Pradesh). In autumn of 1962, during the Sino-Indian War, Walong was the scene of the Battle of Walong, where the Indian Army 11th Infantry Brigade battled the Chinese advances.[7] The killed and wounded numbered 642 Indians and 752 Chinese.[8] Indians were defeated at Walong, however the Chinese withdrawal allowed India to regain the territory.[6] A canopied memorial to the Indian war dead of 1962 was erected next to the airstrip with the following verses composed by a Walong veteran inscribed on it:[6]

&quot;The sentinel hills that round us stand&quot;

&quot;bear witness that we loved our land.&quot;

&quot;Amidst shattered rocks and flaming pine&quot;

&quot;we fought and died on Namti Plain&quot;

&quot;O Lohit gently by us glide&quot;

&quot;pale stars above us softly shine&quot;

&quot;as we sleep here in sun and rain.&quot;

Spear Corps was the formation directly under Headquarters Eastern Command to conduct operations against Naga insurgents. The spread of insurgency into new areas of Mizoram and Tripura necessitated the induction of additional troops.  With the raising of 57 Mountain Division in 1969 at Masimpur, 8 Mountain Division was entrusted with Counter Insurgency Operations in Nagaland and Manipur, while 57 Mountain Division was responsible for conduct of operations in Mizoram and Tripura.  Assam Rifles units were also involved in counter insurgency operations under respective brigade sized sector headquarters. There was a need to adopt a common cause and manifest a common effort.  It was this requirement which precipitated the thought process for establishing a new headquarters as an umbrella organisation to counter the eco system of insurgency and eradicate it in a comprehensive manner.  The seed for raising of a new Corps headquarter was sown in response and the idea of 3 Corps sprouted.

In 1984, Lt Gen Chiman Singh, the then General Officer Commanding-in Chief, Eastern Command deliberated upon the command, control and coordination of operations of the two Divisions fighting insurgency in the North East and decided to coordinate and streamline functioning of both these Formations under a Corps Headquarter. Headquarters 3 Corps was raised on 04 Feb 1985, by Lt Gen Joginder Singh Bakshi, MVC, at Rangapahar Military Station (RMS) in Dimapur (Nagaland) for coordination and conduct of Counter Insurgency Operations in Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, South Assam (including Dhubri Districts) and Arunachal Pradesh (Tirap and Changlang districts). 3 Corps replaced 8 Mountain Division as the highest Formation responsible for coordinating Counter Insurgency Operations in Nagaland and the adjoining Naga inhabited areas of other states.

=== Formation Sign : Spears Corps ===
The formation sign is inspired by the primary role of Infantry. Fittingly, the formation signs of the two formations under Head Quarters 3 Corps, the Bayonet of                         8 Mountain Division and Crossed Spears of 57 Mountain Division, were superimposed to make the 3 Corps formation sign.

At the time of its formation, 3 Corps consisted of 8 Mountain Division and 57 Mountain Division, under its command. Additionally, Headquarters Inspector General Assam Rifles (North) (IGAR(N) was raised at Jorhat on 15 May 1985 and placed under operational control of 3 Corps. Post raising, the Headquarters IGAR(N) moved to Imphal and took over the operational responsibility of Manipur from 8 Mountain Division on 12 Nov 1986.  8 Mountain Division took over the responsibility of Tirap Sector.

3 Corps was actively involved in counter-insurgency operations in Manipur, Tripura and North Cachar Hills district of Assam. Besides, 3 Corps was also aiding the civil administration and paramilitary forces in maintaining peace in Nagaland and Mizoram. At the time, 3 Corps seemed likely to be replaced by the Directorate-General of Assam Rifles based in Shillong.  The 57 Mountain Division based at Leimakhong in Manipur had already been shifted to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.

Defending the LAC became an additional responsibility, apart from countering insurgency. With this additional responsibility to fulfil, two more Divisions were placed under command of HQ 3 Corps.  With the raising of the Division Headquarters, its formations and units commenced its operations on 7 September 2009 under Major General Raj Nandan Singh. It took over the operations and entire responsibility of Western Arunachal Pradesh on 01 Jun 2010.

== Structure ==
Jane&#x27;s estimates that it consists of:
*2 Mountain Division (Dao Division) - The division joined III Corps in late 2000s and is headquartered at Dinjan, Dibrugarh district, Assam.
** 5 Mountain Brigade at Aalo (Along) - the oldest infantry brigade in the Indian Army.
** 82 Mountain Brigade at Tezu in Lohit district
** 181 Mountain Brigade at Laipuli, Tinsukia
** 2 Mountain Artillery Brigade at Dinjan
*56 Infantry Division - was raised at Zakhama, Nagaland and presently located at Likabali, North of the Brahmaputra, Responsible for guarding of northern borders, internal security situation and disaster management in selected districts of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.
*57 Mountain Division (Red Shield Division) - headquartered at Leimakhong. Raised in 1966 for counterinsurgency operations in Mizoram. Until 1990, headquartered at Aizawl with III Corps. Globalsecurity.org reports the 57 Mountain Division headquarters are at Manipur near Silchar. The formation and units of 57 Mountain Division are deployed in some of the remotest corner of Manipur and Indo-Burmese border. 57th Mountain Division took part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 as part of IV Corps. It also successfully conducted Operation Golden Bird in 1995 to eliminate rebels in Northeast India.

<text> (, also , ) is an unofficial written Norwegian language form or spelling standard, meaning the &quot;National Language&quot;, closely related and now almost identical to the dominant form of Bokmål, known as .

Both Bokmål and Riksmål evolved from the Danish written language as used in Norway during the countries&#x27; union and beyond, and from the pronunciation of Danish that became the native language of Norwegian elites by the 18th century. By the late 19th century, the main written language became known as in both Denmark and Norway; the written language in Norway remained identical to Danish until 1907, although it was generally known as &quot;Norwegian&quot; in Norway. From 1907, successive spelling reforms gradually introduced some orthographic differences between written Norwegian and Danish. The name was adopted as the official name of the language, to differentiate it from (now Nynorsk); in 1929, the name of the official language was changed to Bokmål.

From 1938, spelling reforms introduced by the Labour government met increasing resistance as they were seen as &quot;radical&quot;, and language organisations independent of the state started publishing their own spelling standard known as Riksmål. The struggle between and eventually led to the Norwegian language struggle that was at its most intense in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result the &quot;Language Peace Committee&quot; was appointed by the government, and subsequent reforms have moved and closer together, to the extent that few differences remain. and Bokmål were clearly separate spelling standards until a major reform of Bokmål in 2005 that (re)introduced numerous forms as part of Bokmål; some subsequent reforms in the 21st century have eradicated most remaining, mostly small differences. National librarian Aslak Sira Myhre argued in 2017 that in practice has &quot;taken over&quot; Bokmål and peacefully &quot;won&quot; the language struggle.

==History==
After the dissolution of the union with Denmark in 1814, Norway had no national language standard of its own, the written language being Danish, while the spoken language consisted of numerous dialects – that to some extent were not mutually intelligible. The new union partner Sweden had a different language, Swedish, and there was a fear that if no measures were taken, its language would be imposed upon the Norwegians.

Hence, prominent Norwegians, such as Henrik Wergeland and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, advocated a standardized Norwegian language, to be based on the legacy of the Danish language as used in Norway by the upper class of Christiania (now Oslo) and other Eastern Norwegian cities. This was proposed by Knud Knudsen, a schoolteacher, who had witnessed how schoolchildren struggled with the Danish language they were taught, since it was very different from the spoken language they were used to. However, as late as in 1883 the Danish intellectual Georg Brandes stated that the language in Norway was Danish, and that the Norwegians did not have a language of their own.

===Introduction by Knud Knudsen===
Knud Knudsen presented his Norwegian language in several works from the 1850s until his death in 1895, while the term &quot;Riksmaal&quot; (&quot;aa&quot; was a contemporary way of writing &quot;å&quot;) was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the non-governmental organisation Riksmålsforbundet in 1907. Bjørnson became its first leader, until his death in 1910.

===Spread===
Riksmål became the chosen language for Norwegian pupils from the latter part of the 19th century, and Norwegian newspapers adapted to the language. However, many Norwegian authors, such as Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Knut Hamsun, did not adhere and continued using Dano-Norwegian. Riksmål got an official writing norm in 1907, and in 1917 a new reform introduced some elements from Norwegian dialects and Nynorsk as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. This was part of an official policy to bring the two Norwegian languages more closely together, intending eventually to merge them into one. These changes met resistance from the Riksmål movement, and &quot;Riksmålsvernet&quot; (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919. They have later been the purist protectors of the traditional riksmål, in opposition to Bokmål and Nynorsk, and especially Samnorsk.

In the 1938 reform of Bokmål introduced more elements from dialects and Nynorsk, and more importantly, many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms were excluded. This so-called &quot;radical&quot; Bokmål or &quot;Samnorsk&quot; (Common Norwegian) met even stiffer resistance from the Riksmål movement, culminating in the 1950s under the leadership of Arnulf Øverland. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents&#x27; campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and the radical reforms were partially reverted in 1981 and 2005.

==Current status==
Currently, Riksmål denotes the moderate, chiefly pre-1938, unofficial variant of Bokmål, which is still in use and is regulated by the Norwegian Academy and promoted by Riksmålsforbundet. Riksmål has gone through some spelling reforms, but none as profound as the ones that shaped Bokmål. A Riksmål dictionary was published in four volumes in the period 1937 to 1957 by Riksmålsvernet, and two supplementary volumes were published in 1995 by the Norwegian Academy. After the latest Bokmål reforms in 2005, the difference between Bokmål and Riksmål have diminished and they are now comparable to American and British English differences, but the Norwegian Academy still upholds its own standard.

The daily newspaper is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers&#x27; letters, which are &quot;translated&quot; into the standard.

<text>The Boeing T-43 is a retired modified Boeing 737-200 that was used by the United States Air Force for training navigators, now known as USAF combat systems officers, from 1973 to 2010. Informally referred to as the Gator (an abbreviation of &quot;navigator&quot;) and &quot;Flying Classroom&quot;, nineteen of these aircraft were delivered to the Air Training Command (ATC) at Mather Air Force Base, California during 1973 and 1974. Two additional aircraft were delivered to the Colorado Air National Guard at Buckley Air National Guard Base (later Buckley Space Force Base) and Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, in direct support of cadet air navigation training at the nearby U.S. Air Force Academy. Two T-43s were later converted to CT-43As in the early 1990s and transferred to Air Mobility Command (AMC) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), respectively, as executive transports. A third aircraft was also transferred to Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) for use as the &quot;Rat 55&quot; radar test bed aircraft and was redesignated as an NT-43A. The T-43A was retired by the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) in 2010 after 37 years of service.

==Design and development==
On 27 May 1971, the United States Air Force (USAF) placed an order for 19 T-43s, modified versions of the Boeing 737-200 as a replacement for the USAF&#x27;s aging fleet of Convair T-29 navigation trainers, as part of the Undergraduate Navigator Training System. The Boeing aircraft was selected in preference to a trainer based on the Douglas DC-9.

From its entry into service in 1974 until the mid-1990s, the T-43As were used for all USAF Undergraduate Navigator Training. Starting in the mid-1990s, the T-43As were used for USAF Undergraduate Navigator/Combat Systems Officer training with the exception of those USAF navigators/CSOs slated for the F-15E and B-1B.

In 1976, with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s retirement of its T-29 aircraft and deactivation of its associated Training Squadron Twenty-Nine (VT-29) at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, those student naval flight officers destined for land-based naval aircraft such as the P-3 Orion, including its EP-3 variant, and various versions of the C-130 in U.S. naval service, began training in USAF T-43s at Mather AFB under a program known by USAF as &quot;Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training&quot; (IUNT) and by the U.S. Navy as the NAV pipeline for training student naval flight officers slated for eventual assignments to land-based naval aircraft.

Externally, the T-43A differs from the civilian Boeing 737-200 aircraft by having more antennas and fewer windows.

The T-43A has stations on board for twelve navigator students, six navigator instructors, as well as a pilot and co-pilot. The student training compartment was equipped with avionics gear as used in contemporary operational aircraft from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s. This included search and weather radar; VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and tactical air navigation system (TACAN) avionics systems; a long range navigation system (LORAN-C); an inertial navigation system (INS); radar altimeter; and all required VHF, UHF and HF communications equipment. Five periscopic sextant stations spaced along the length of the training compartment were used for celestial navigation training. However, with the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS), student navigators were no longer taught celestial navigation or LORAN.

The T-43A aircraft had considerably more training capability than the aircraft it replaced, the reciprocating-engine, propeller-driven T-29 Flying Classroom that was based on the Convair C-131 Samaritan. VT-29 had been training student naval flight officers for various land-based naval aircraft such as the P-3 Orion, EP-3 Aries, and variants of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules while the 323 FTW and its predecessor organizations at Mather AFB, the former Ellington AFB (now Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, the former James Connally Air Force Base, and the former Harlingen Air Force Base had been training undergraduate navigators for all USAF aircraft with a navigator, weapon systems officer, and/or electronic warfare officer, ranging from bomber, cargo and air refueling aircraft such as the B-52 Stratofortress, C-130 Hercules and KC-135 Stratotanker, to fighter and reconnaissance aircraft that included the F-4C, F-4D, F-4E and RF-4C Phantom II, the F-111, and the RC-135 RIVET JOINT aircraft, as well as those recruited with previous experience in other aircraft to the SR-71. 

Inside each T-43A training compartment were two minimum proficiency, two maximum proficiency and 12 student navigator stations. Two stations form a console, and instructors could move their seats to the consoles and sit beside students for individual instruction. The large cabin allows easy access to seating and storage, and reduced the distance between student stations and instructor positions.

The aircraft were initially assigned to the 323rd Flying Training Wing (323 FTW) of the Air Training Command (ATC) at Mather AFB, California, plus two additional aircraft assigned to the 140th Wing (140 WG) of the Colorado Air National Guard at Peterson AFB, Colorado, to support introductory air navigation training for cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. When the 323 FTW was inactivated and Mather AFB closed by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action in 1993, most of the T-43s were transferred to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at Randolph AFB, Texas, with the 12 FTW assuming the specialized undergraduate navigator training (SUNT) role while the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Training Air Wing SIX (TRAWING SIX), a Naval Air Training Command organization at NAS Pensacola, Florida, assumed a role for training those USAF student navigators slated for eventual assignment to the F-111, EF-111, F-15E Strike Eagle and B-1B Lancer.

==Operational history==


The T-43 was last based at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas and operated originally by the 558th Flying Training Squadron (558 FTS) and from 1996 to 2010 by the 562d Flying Training Squadron and by the 563d Flying Training Squadron from 1999 to 2010. The two additional aircraft used for introductory air navigation training of USAF Academy cadets were operated by the 200th Airlift Squadron (200 AS), 140th Wing (140 WG), Colorado Air National Guard at then-Buckley Air Force Base and then-Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado until 1997. The 200 AS was inactivated in 2018.

In addition, as navigator training requirements were reduced when several USAF mission design series aircraft eliminated the navigator position, several T-43A aircraft had their navigator training systems removed and were modified to a transport aircraft configuration designated as CT-43A, such as one previously operated by the then-6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) at MacDill AFB, Florida, in support of United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) for transport of the USSOUTHCOM commander in Central and South America. The 6 AMW&#x27;s CT-43A aircraft was replaced by a Gulfstream C-37A aircraft in early 2001.

Throughout its service in the ATC and the successor AETC, no T-43 was ever lost in a mishap. Among the T-43s removed from navigator training and converted to CT-43A executive transports, one aircraft assigned to the 86th Airlift Wing (86 AW) at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, to support United States European Command (USEUCOM) crashed in Croatia in 1996 while carrying U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and 34 other passengers. There were no survivors and subsequent investigation determined that this was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) mishap as a result of pilot error.

On 17 September 2010, the last T-43A navigational training flight was flown at Randolph Air Force Base, and the aircraft was subsequently retired from the active Air Force service after 37 years of service. With the redesignation of USAF navigators as combat systems officers, the 12 FTW discontinued SUNT at Randolph AFB, the training of F-15E and B-1B navigators by the U.S. Navy at TRAWING SIX at NAS Pensacola was terminated, and a new Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) flight training program was established with the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 12 FTW based at NAS Pensacola, utilizing a combination of USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. 

As of 2022, a single heavily modified NT-43A remains flying as a testbed aircraft in the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC).
