<text>The England and Wales Cricket Board, aka ECB, is the national governing body of cricket in England and Wales. It was formed on 1 January 1997 as a single governing body to combine the roles formerly fulfilled by the Test and County Cricket Board, the National Cricket Association and the Cricket Council. In April 1998 the Women&#x27;s Cricket Association was integrated into the organisation. The ECB&#x27;s head offices are at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in north-west London.

The board oversees all levels of cricket in England and Wales, including the national teams: England Men (Test, One Day International and T20I), England Women, England Lions (Men&#x27;s second tier), Physical Disability, Learning Disability, Visually Impaired, and Deaf.

Although the organisation is the England and Wales Cricket Board, it is referred to as the ECB, as a result of a decision by those overseeing the transition from the previous bodies.

==Structure and role==
The ECB is run by an executive management team that reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO). Richard Gould took over as permanent CEO in February 2023, replacing Clare Connor, who had held the office on an interim basis since May 2022. He in turn reports to the Chairman of the ECB Board, a position held by Richard Thompson since September 2022.

An executive committee chaired by the CEO is responsible for delivering the ECB&#x27;s strategic plans. Three other committees – Cricket; Audit, Risk and Governance; and Regulatory – work with the senior management team on policy, planning and strategic issues.

The ECB Management Board is composed of a Chair, a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, three Independent Non-Executive Directors, five Cricket Non-Executive Directors, the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer.

There are 41 members of the ECB:

* The Chairs of the 18 First-Class Counties
* The Chairs of the 21 County Boards in National Counties (formerly the Minor Counties)
* The Chair of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)
* The Chair of the National Counties Cricket Association

One of the main responsibilities of the ECB is the preparation and development of the teams that represent England at the highest level in Test and ODI play. The National Selector, head coach and other coaches are ECB employees. The ECB also employs the English Test match captain and other centrally contracted players, as well as being responsible for the National Cricket Performance Centre, currently based at Loughborough University in Leicestershire.

The long-term strategy to deliver world championships in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s games had a successful conclusion in the summer of 2019. England won the ICC Cricket World Cup for the first time, emulating the feat of their female counterparts, who had become world champions for the fourth time in 2017.

The ECB is responsible for the financial direction and commercial exploitation of England cricket. It raises revenue from the proceeds of sales for tickets at One Day International and Test matches in England and Wales. The ECB is also responsible for the generation of income from the sale of sponsorship and broadcasting rights, primarily in relation to the English team.

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the UK. More than 1.1 million adults attend cricket matches each year, while 2.5 million people play the game at all levels in England and Wales. Almost 10 million people – about 20% of the adult population – follow the sport. Since 2009, 4 million schoolchildren have been introduced to cricket by the Chance To Shine programme.

In 2017 the ECB signed a new media rights deal valued at £1.1 billion to cover the five years between 2020 and 2024. This deal will be used to fund a broad range of initiatives across the sport at all levels, including a guaranteed and unprecedented £475 million to fund the county network – First-Class Counties, National Counties and County Boards.

While the ECB administers all aspects of English cricket, the laws of the game remain under the control of MCC.

In April 2017 the Articles of Association were changed to allow a new White-ball Cricket competition to be run from 2020, comprising 8 teams and run during school summer holidays. The T20 event has become The Hundred.

In May 2018 ECB launched an action plan for engaging South Asian audiences in England and Wales. In January 2019 ECB launched its Inspiring Generations strategy for cricket across 2020–2024. The strategy aims to &quot;Inspire a generation to say Cricket is a game for me&quot;. Alongside its five-year plan, in October 2019 ECB launched plans to transform women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; cricket.

The ECB also leads the sport&#x27;s efforts with regard to the integrity of cricket, including anti-doping and anti-corruption initiatives, and safeguarding of all who play and administer the game. In the 2017-2018 financial year, the ECB&#x27;s turnover was £125.5 million.

== National teams ==
Men&#x27;s Test team: England played in the first Test match, against Australia in 1877, and has been one of the world&#x27;s leading exponents of the five-day form of cricket ever since. England has been a full member of the International Cricket Council since 1909. The position of Men&#x27;s Test captain, as of 28 April 2022, is occupied by Ben Stokes.

Men&#x27;s white ball team: England featured in the first One-Day International, against Australia in 1971. England won the men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup for the first time in a thrilling final against New Zealand at Lord&#x27;s in July 2019. As of May 2023, the team&#x27;s captain was Jos Buttler.

Women&#x27;s team: England featured in the first Women&#x27;s Test series, against Australia in 1934–35, where they won 2-0 despite the enduring rancour from the Bodyline series of two winters before. They have won the World Cup four times, most recently in 2017. The team is captained, as of July 2020, by Heather Knight.

Disability teams: The ECB aims to have 300 clubs offering disabled provision by 2024. The four teams administered by the ECB are Physical Disability, Learning Disability, Visually Impaired, and Deaf.

== County Cricket ==
First-Class Counties: There are 18 First-Class Counties, 17 in England and one, Glamorgan, in Wales. County cricket developed in the 1740s and the first County Championship was played in 1890. From 2020 onwards there are 10 teams in Division One and eight in Division Two. The ECB plays a part in the administration of a county through the County Partnership Agreement, a structure set up in late 2019 designed to improve two-way communication between the ECB and the counties and to ensure the successful implementation of the inspiring Generations strategy between 2020 and 2024.

National Counties: Formerly known as the Minor Counties, these are the 21 areas where cricket is played on a county-wide basis but without first-class status. The Minor Counties Championship was first staged in 1895. From 2020 onwards, the counties’ Western and Eastern divisions are split into two five-team groups between which sides are relegated and promoted. Each county also has a County Partnership Agreement with the ECB.

County Boards: Recreational cricket at all levels in each county is administered by a county board. There are more than 6,500 recreational cricket clubs and 40 county boards in total, including boards for Wales and the Isle of Wight. Each board has a County Partnership Agreement with the ECB. The intention is for the whole of cricket to think collectively about how to work together for the present and future stability and growth of the game.

The ECB also works at grassroots level with organisations such as Chance To Shine that are dedicated to encouraging talented and enthusiastic youngsters to play as much cricket as possible and maximise their potential.

Cricket in Wales: Historically, there have been claims that Wales should break away from the ECB and have its own international team, like Ireland and Scotland. However, Cricket Wales and Glamorgan have consistently supported the ECB and the concept that Welsh players of international standard will continue to represent England.

Domestic competitions: First-class counties compete in the following:

* LV= Insurance County Championship
* Metro Bank One-Day Cup
* Vitality Blast T20

=== The County Boards ===

Subject to certain exceptions, each historic county in England has either an ECB County Cricket Club or Cricket Board as below.
The first-class counties are represented directly at the ECB, whereas the national counties retain a Cricket Board.

* Bedfordshire Cricket Board
* Berkshire Cricket Board
* Buckinghamshire Cricket Board
* Cambridgeshire Cricket Board
* Cheshire Cricket Board
* Cornwall Cricket Board
* Cumbria Cricket Board
* Derbyshire County Cricket Club
* Devon Cricket Board
* Dorset Cricket Board
* Durham County Cricket Club

* Gloucestershire County Cricket Club
* Hampshire County Cricket Club
* Herefordshire Cricket Board
* Hertfordshire Cricket Board
* Huntingdonshire Cricket Board
* Isle of Wight Cricket Board
* Kent County Cricket Club

Rutland shares a board with neighbouring Leicestershire, an echo of the 18th century Leicestershire and Rutland Cricket Club. Hampshire as such has two boards given that the Isle of Wight has its own. Westmorland and Cumberland are replaced by Cumbria, a ceremonial county created in 1974. An additional board exists for the whole country of Wales and is incorporated within the ECB.

Most counties have clubs which are members of either the County Championship or the National Counties Cricket Championship. Rutland and the Isle of Wight do not have county clubs and are wholly integrated for that purpose with Leicestershire and Hampshire respectively. Huntingdonshire County Cricket Club has a chequered history and now plays informal matches only. Cumberland and Westmorland originally shared Cumberland County Cricket Club as a joint county club. It is now representative of Cumbria as a whole and plays matches in both of the two traditional counties; there has never been a club called Westmorland.

== Status of Wales ==
Historically, the England team represented the whole of Great Britain in international cricket, with Scottish or Welsh national teams playing sporadically and players from both countries occasionally representing England. Following Ireland&#x27;s membership in 1993, Scotland became an independent member of the ICC the next year.

With Welsh players pursuing international careers exclusively with an England team, there have been a number of calls for Wales to become an independent member of the ICC, or for the ECB to provide more fixtures for a Welsh national team. However, both Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have continually supported the ECB, with Glamorgan arguing for the financial benefits of the Welsh county within the English structure, and Cricket Wales stating they are &quot;committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB&quot;

The absence of a Welsh cricket team has seen a number of debates within the Welsh Parliament. In 2013 a debate saw both Conservative and Labour members lend their support to the establishment of an independent Welsh team.

In 2015, a report produced by the Welsh Parliament&#x27;s petitions committee reflected the passionate debate around the issue. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the ECB. Jenkins noted that Ireland (with a population of 6.4 million) was an ICC member with 6,000 club players whereas Wales (with 3.2 million) had 7,500. Jenkins said: &quot;Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is ‘an emotive subject’, of course having a national team is emotive, you only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.&quot;

In 2017, the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones called for the reintroduction of the Welsh one day team stating: &quot;[It] is odd that we see Ireland and Scotland playing in international tournaments and not Wales.&quot;

In 2019, Plaid Cymru member Jonathan Edwards called for Wales to separate from the England and Wales Cricket Board by 2020 and to establish itself as an independent national team, Mr. Edwards said; “We have a Welsh rugby team, football team, basketball team, even a national lacrosse team. In cricket, however, we are still incorporated into England. That surely can&#x27;t be right.”

== Inspiring Generations ==
In 2019 the ECB launched a game-wide strategy to grow interest in, and engagement with, cricket over the five years between 2020 and 2024. Its vision is that by the latter date a new generation of fans will have been inspired to say: “Cricket is a game for me.”

Inspiring Generations has been made possible by the signing of a media rights deal worth about £1.1billion, the vast majority of which will be paid by Sky television. As a result, the ECB has identified 26 activities that will make up the overarching Inspiring Generations strategy.

The key focus is on six areas, in which the ECB has pledged to:

* Grow and nurture cricket&#x27;s core, the county network
* Inspire through the exploits of elite teams
* Make cricket accessible to as many people as possible
* Engage children and young people
* Transform women&#x27;s and girls’ cricket
* Support its communities

== Women&#x27;s and Girls’ Strategy ==
One of the most important elements of the Inspiring Generations strategy is the delivery of a plan to make cricket a truly gender-balanced sport and to build on the significant progress in the women&#x27;s game in the first two decades of the 21st century.

The ECB has promised by 2021 to invest £20million specifically into the transformation of women&#x27;s and girls’ cricket. This process is built around the following five targets:

* Participation – bringing girls’ cricket to more schools and clubs
* Pathway – raising standards in local girls’ cricket
* Performance – unveiling a new regional elite domestic structure for the women&#x27;s game
* Profile – promoting awareness of elite female players
* People – increasing the number of women in the cricket workforce and leadership roles

More than 850 clubs now offer women&#x27;s and girls’ cricket, a total that was fewer than 100 in 2009.

== The Hundred ==
In 2020 the ECB launched a new competition called The Hundred which the board said was designed to appeal to families and younger cricket fans. The new competition, where each side has 100 balls, is aimed at a younger audience with the aim of games being completed in less than three hours.

Eight new teams were created by the ECB and based in cities across England and Wales. The teams do not align with existing counties, though they share stadiums. The team names are:

* Birmingham Phoenix
* London Spirit
* Manchester Originals
* Northern Superchargers
* Oval Invincibles
* Southern Brave
* Trent Rockets
* Welsh Fire

The competition also sees the return after 15 years of live cricket to free-to-air television, with a contract seeing the BBC screening at least ten matches live from the men&#x27;s competition, including the final.

The launch of The Hundred competition was planned for 2020, but was officially delayed to 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== The South Asian Action Plan ==
In 2018, the ECB launched an initiative designed to increase engagement in cricket in England and Wales among people who trace their ancestry to nations in south Asia – such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka – where cricket has historically been hugely popular.

The decision was taken to engage with this community in particular because more than 30% of active cricketers in England and Wales at the time identified as being of South Asian extraction.

The SAAP was driven by research and community-led in an attempt to break down barriers to playing and watching cricket.

The 11 principal action points included installing non-traditional playing facilities in urban areas and delivering cricket at schools with a higher than national average representation of BAME pupils.

One significant early success was the opening in 2019 of the Leyton Cricket Hub in east London, the first urban cricket centre of its kind in the country. The SAAP also led to the installation of 110 non-turf pitches in urban areas and the recruitment of 600 female volunteers to boost the initiative.

== All Stars Cricket ==
All Stars Cricket is the ECB&#x27;s entry-level participation programme for boys and girls aged between five and eight. It consists of eight one-hour sessions over eight weeks and the emphasis is on fun and activity.

The programme is designed for all children who are new to cricket and focuses on the sport&#x27;s specific skills, as well as activity and teamwork in general.

In 2019, more than 67,000 children took part in sessions at more than 2,200 clubs.

== Disability Premier League (DPL) ==
In 2021, the ECB launched the Disability Premier League (DPL), a T20 competition bringing together players from three different disability groups – Physical Disability (PD), Learning Disability (LD) and Hearing Impairment/Deaf. The DPL sits between county cricket at the England international setups in the ECB Disability Cricket pathway. It is designed to benefit disability cricket in a number of ways, including promoting the sport to a new audience and encouraging new players to take up the sport. 

There are four teams with 16 players in each squad (64 players overall). Every year, the squads are selected through a draft. Each squad has roughly five players from each impairment, who are also tiered to ensure each team is as evenly balanced as possible. Each disability group must bowl at least 20% of a team&#x27;s overs, meaning a minimum of four overs are to be bowled at least one player from the PD, LD and Deaf pool.

The teams are:

* Black Cats
* Pirates 
* Tridents
* Hawks

<text>Kim Woo-Choong (19 December 1936 – 9 December 2019) was a South Korean businessman who was the founder and chairman of Daewoo Group until its collapse in 1999.

==Background==

Born in Daegu, Kim was the son of the provincial governor of North Gyeongsang Province. He then became a newspaper delivery boy once his father was removed from power after the independence of Korea from Japanese rule. He graduated from the prestigious Kyunggi High School, then finished his education with an Economics Degree at Yonsei University in Seoul. Kim&#x27;s father was the mentor of future President, Park Chung Hee, who in turn supported Kim to a great degree financially

==Daewoo==
After graduating from Yonsei, Kim entered a small trading corporation specializing in textiles and clothing. He left and created Daewoo Industries with five other associates. He managed to do well using his connections in the alumni network of Yonsei University and with political backing.

Kim rapidly expanded the renamed Daewoo Group by using borrowed money to purchase near-bankrupt companies. After 30 years in business, Daewoo Group was listed as second in assets and third in revenues in Korea. Daewoo had the most overseas branch offices among all the major Korean chaebols, a sign of the company&#x27;s rapid growth.

However, due to its poor financial structure; the unstable Daewoo Group plummeted into chaos when the Asian Financial Crisis hit in 1997. It had to sell off nearly 50 subsidiaries, only focusing on the core divisions.

Soon after the demise, Kim Woo-choong fled to Vietnam, and was charged with accounting fraud worth 41 trillion won (US$43.4 billion), illegally borrowing 9.8 trillion won (US$10.3 billion), and laundering US$3.2 billion out of the country while in exile. Kim Woo-choong was wanted by Interpol for his irresponsible spending as chairman of Daewoo Group.

He was arrested soon after he returned to South Korea on 14 June 2005, and apologized &quot;for hurting the nation&quot; and accepted full responsibility for the collapse of the group, adding that he was &quot;ready to accept whatever the authorities have in store for him,&quot; according to &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot;.

==Criminal charges==
In May 2006, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement and accounting fraud. In addition, 21 trillion won (US$22 billion) of his fortune was seized and he was fined an additional 10 million won (about US$10,000).

Citing health concerns, his sentence was reduced to 8 1/2 years; on 30 December 2007, he was pardoned by President Roh Moo-hyun. South Korean presidents traditionally hand out pardons for the new year.

==Death==
On 9 December 2019, Kim died due to pneumonia at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon, 10 days before his 83rd birthday.

<doc id="431462" wikidata="Q1052575" url="?curid=431462" title="Water cannon">
<text>A water cannon is a device that shoots a high-velocity stream of water. Typically, a water cannon can deliver a large volume of water, often over dozens of meters. They are used in firefighting, large vehicle washing, riot control, and mining. Most water cannons fall under the category of a fire monitor.

==Firefighting==

Water cannons were first devised for use on fireboats. Extinguishing fires on boats and buildings near the water was much more difficult and dangerous before fireboats were invented. The first fireboat deployed in Los Angeles was commissioned on 1 August 1919. The first fireboat in New York City was &quot;Marine 1&quot;, deployed 1 February 1891. There may have been other fireboats elsewhere even earlier.

Fire trucks deliver water with much the same force and volume as water cannons, and have even been used in riot control situations, but are rarely referred to as water cannons outside this context.

==Riot control==

The first truck-mounted water cannon was used for riot control in Germany in the beginning of the 1930s.

The most modern versions do not expose the operator to the riot, and are controlled remotely from within the vehicle by a joystick. The Austrian-built WaWe 10.000 by Rosenbauer used by German police can carry of water, which can deploy water in all directions via three cannons, all of which are remotely controlled from inside the vehicle by a joystick. The vehicle has two forward cannons with a delivery rate of , and one rear cannon with a delivery rate of 

Water cannons designed for riot control are still made in the United States and the United Kingdom, but most products are exported, particularly to Africa and parts of Asia such as Indonesia.

===Safety===
Use of water cannon in riot control contexts can lead to injury or death, with fatalities recorded in Indonesia (in 1996, when the cannon&#x27;s payload contained ammonia), Zimbabwe (in 2007, when the use of cannons on a peaceful crowd caused panic), Turkey (in 2013, when the payload was laced with &quot;liquid tear gas&quot;), Ukraine (in 2014, with the death of activist and businessman Bogdan Kalynyak, reportedly catching pneumonia after being sprayed by a water cannon in freezing temperatures) and South Korea (in 2016, when a 68-year-old farmer died after injuries sustained by a water cannon the previous year).
Water cannons in use during the 1960s, which were generally adapted fire trucks, would knock protesters down and on occasion, tear their clothes.

On 30 September 2010, during a protest demonstration against the Stuttgart 21 project in Germany, a demonstrator was hit in the face by a water cannon. Dietrich Wagner, a retired engineer, suffered damage to his eyelids and retinas, resulting in near-complete loss of his eyesight. Graphic imagery was recorded of the event, sparking a national debate about police brutality and proportionality in the use of state force.

According to a report issued in the United Kingdom, using plastic bullets instead of water cannons was justified because the latter &quot;are inflexible and indiscriminate&quot;, although several people had previously been killed or seriously injured by plastic bullets.

===Media effect===
The presence of the media at riots has had a significant impact on water cannon use. There is much pressure on police departments to avoid bad publicity, and water cannons often play badly in the press. It is considered that this is a likely reason that they are not used more often in some countries.

Confrontations that took place in the era of the American Civil Rights Movement, where water cannons were used by authorities to disperse crowds of protesting African Americans, has led to the demise of water cannons in the United States.

==Alternative payload==
===Dye===
In 1997 pink dye was reportedly added to the water used by South Korean and Indonesian police to disperse a riot. The implication is that they might use this mark to make it easier to arrest rioters later. The United Kingdom, which had sold the water cannon to Indonesia, condemned this practice (although the Royal Ulster Constabulary had used a water cannon with purple dye during The Troubles in Northern Ireland) but later approved the sale of further water cannons to them. Most modern water cannons are also capable of adding tear gas to the stream.

===Electrified water jet===
In 2004 Jaycor Tactical Systems was experimenting with additives (salt and additives to reduce the breakup of the stream into droplets) that would allow electricity to be conducted through water. They have demonstrated delivery from a distance of up to , but have not yet tested the device on people.

Although referred to as an electrified water cannon, this experiment involved a water jet much less powerful than a water cannon.

==Other types==
Water cannon differ from other similar devices in the volume of water delivered in a given time, the nozzle speed, the pressure that it is delivered at, and to a lesser extent the total volume that can be delivered. They are also generally portable. The method of employment is also important in labeling a device a water cannon. Nevertheless, the distinction between a water cannon and other similar devices is fuzzy. For example:-
*Pressure washers generally produce an extremely high pressure stream where the power of the stream drops off significantly over a very short distance.
*Water pistols and other toys deliver much lower volumes of water at a much lower pressure.
*Ultra high pressure water jet cutters are used to cut a wide variety of materials including granite, concrete (see hydrodemolition), ceramics, fabric and even Kevlar. One such cutter delivers through a nozzle in diameter at 1 kilometre per second, which can cut a person at a close range. There are reports of accidental deaths involving the industrial use of high-pressure water.

==Usage==
Water cannon are still in large scale use in Chile, Belgium, the Netherlands and other parts of the world.

===Australia===
The New South Wales Police Force purchased a water cannon in 2007 and had it deployed on standby during an APEC meeting in Sydney that year. It was the first purchase of a water cannon by a police service in Australia. However, it ended up not being used during the APEC meeting, and was never used during any instance of civil unrest. Eventually it was retired and converted to a water tanker for fire department use.

===Germany===

The annual riots on 1 May in Berlin, the Schanzenfest fair in Hamburg, which regularly ends in riots, or other demonstrations, are usually accompanied by water cannon, which support riot police. The most commonly used water cannon in Germany over years was the Wasserwerfer 9000. Since 2019, the only water cannon type used by riot police, which are around 50 units in total, is the Wasserwerfer 10000.

===Hong Kong===

Three truck-mounted water cannon, officially known as &#x27;Specialised Crowd Management Vehicles&#x27;, were purchased by Hong Kong Police from France in mid-2018. The truck chassis were provided by Mercedes-Benz and the water spray devices were also made by German firm Ziegler. The three water cannon cost HK$27 million to purchase, a sum that was criticised as overpriced. The vehicles were frequently used by police on participants and bystanders during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Blue dye was often added to the water to allow police to identify protesters. Pepper spray solution was also often added as an irritant.

On 20 October 2019, police used a water cannon to target and shoot a small group of pedestrians standing outside Kowloon Mosque, in Tsim Sha Tsui, using blue-dyed water mixed with a pepper solution. A large number of Hong Kong residents spontaneously went to the scene to clean up, with the incident resulting in an increased sense of inclusiveness among the Hong Kong public toward the city&#x27;s Muslim and other minorities.

=== Israel ===
Since the 1980s, Israel has been exporting water cannons to numerous countries around the world. Bet Alpha Technologies, a company owned by Kibbutz Bet Alpha, has sold water cannons to Russia, China, Turkey, the United States, Latvia, Zambia, Argentina and Swaziland amounting to millions of dollars in sales. The Israel Police have made extensive use of water cannons during demonstrations. Its water canons are capable of spraying jets of water, paint (used to mark protesters for later arrest), gas, and Skunk in long or short pulses in an effective range of 40 meters. They are controlled controlled by a joystick and set of cameras and is equipped with a mine plow allows the vehicle to break through and push through hard barriers like barricades placed on the road. During the 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests, the Israel Police allegedly violated its own procedures when on several occasions they fired water streams directly toward protesters&#x27; heads, causing damage to the vision of some of them.

=== Thailand ===
During the 2020 Thai protests, on 16 October 2020, the police used water cannon claimed to have water containing an irritant that made protesters&#x27; eyes sting to disperse a peaceful protest in Bangkok.

===Turkey===
The Turkish police water cannon TOMA has been used against protesters many times, including the 2013 protests in Turkey, and are often present at protests of all sizes.

===United Kingdom===
Only six water cannons are operational in the United Kingdom, all held by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); these are Somati RCV9000 Vehicle Mounted Water Cannons built on GINAF chassis, which after extensive evaluation by a Defence Scientific Advisory Council sub-committee as a less-lethal replacement of baton rounds, began to enter service with the PSNI from 2004 onwards. Water cannon use outside Northern Ireland is not approved, and would require the statutory authorisation from the Home Secretary for use in England and Wales or the parliament of Scotland for use in Scotland. 

In June 2014, London&#x27;s Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Stephen Greenhalgh authorised the Metropolitan Police to buy three-second-hand Wasserwerfer 9000s from the German Federal Police. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the purchase had been authorised before Parliamentary approval, as the three cannons cost £218,000 to purchase and would require a further £125,000 of work before being deemed suitable for service, as opposed to £870,000 for a single new machine. But after a study of their safety and effectiveness, Home Secretary Theresa May said in Parliament in July 2015 that she had decided not to license them for use. They were sold in November 2018 with the intention of them being dismantled for spare parts. The resale resulted in a net loss of £300,000.

===United States===
Truck-based water cannon, and fire hoses used as improvised water cannons, were used widely in the United States during the 1960s for both riot control and suppressing peaceful civil rights marches, including the infamous use ordered by Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. The newsreel footage of police turning water cannons and police dogs on civilians—both student protesters and bystanders alike, including children as young as six—widely viewed as shocking and inappropriate and helped turn public sympathies towards civil rights. Water cannons were used in November 2016 during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. In August 2020, state senator Floyd Prozanski suggested water cannons be used by police against protesters in Portland, Oregon.

The New York City Police Department previously had a water cannon made from a 1982 Oshkosh P-4 as part of their Disorder Control Unit, which was in their fleet until at least the 2000s. There are no recorded instances of it ever being deployed.

==Mining==
Water cannons are used in hydraulic mining to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.

== Gallery ==
==Other meanings==
The term &quot;water cannon&quot; could also refer to:-
*Similar land vehicles used for firefighting
*Numerous large stationary toys
*Waterjet in hydraulic mining
*A type of railway wagon used to remove fallen leaves off the track: e.g. seen at Alexandra Palace on 25 October 2003
*Tool for powerwashing large construction equipment.

<text>Edward Richard Holmes, CBE, TD, VR, JP (29 March 1946 – 30 April 2011), known as Richard Holmes, was a British military historian. He was co-director of Cranfield University&#x27;s Security and Resilience Group from 1989 to 2009 and became Professor of Military and Security Studies at Cranfield in 1995.

==Early life and education==
Holmes was educated at Forest School, Walthamstow; Emmanuel College, Cambridge; Northern Illinois University; and the University of Reading, where he was awarded a PhD in 1975.

==Military career==
In 1964, he enlisted in the Territorial Army, the volunteer reserve of the British Army. Two years later he received a commission as a second lieutenant with the Territorial Army, and was promoted to lieutenant on 17 June 1968. He was promoted to acting captain in 1972, substantive captain in 1973, acting major in 1978 and substantive major in 1980. In 1979, he was awarded the Territorial Decoration.

Holmes was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1986, whereupon he transferred to and took command of the 2nd Battalion, The Wessex Regiment (Volunteers), filling the appointment until 1988. In the 1988 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) (Military Division). He was promoted to colonel on 29 January 1989. In June 1991, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the Queen, holding the post until February 1997.

In January 1994, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Southampton University Officer Training Corps, and that February he was appointed brigadier of the Territorial Army at Headquarters Land Command.

In 1995, he became Professor of Military and Security Studies at Cranfield University. From 1997 until his retirement in 2000, Holmes was Director General, Reserve Forces and Cadets, the Army&#x27;s senior reservist. In the 1998 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) (Military Division).

From September 1999 to 1 February 2007, he was Colonel of the Regiment of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (successor to The Queen&#x27;s and Royal Hampshire Regiments). On 19 September 2000, he was awarded the Volunteer Reserves Service Medal.

==Academic career==
Between 1969 and 1985, Holmes was a lecturer at the Department of War Studies at the RMA Sandhurst, becoming Deputy Head of the department in 1984.

In 1989 he was appointed as the co-director of Cranfield University&#x27;s Security Studies Institute at the Royal Military College of Science, at Shrivenham. He became Professor of Military and Security Studies there in 1995, retiring from both positions, although retaining some part-time responsibilities in 2009.

Holmes was also President of the British Commission for Military History, and the Battlefields Trust. He was also a patron of the Guild of Battlefield Guides. He received the Order of the Dannebrog and held honorary doctorates from the universities of Leicester and Kent.

==Publications and television work==
Holmes wrote more than twenty published books, including &quot;Firing Line&quot; and &quot;Redcoat&quot;, and was also Editor-in-Chief of the Oxford University Press&#x27; &quot;Companion to Military History&quot;. His television works included writing and presenting documentary series on the American War of Independence, such as &quot;Rebels and Redcoats&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Battlefields&quot;, a series concentrating on the bloody battles of the Second World War. His &quot;War Walks&quot; television series has been regularly repeated on British terrestrial and digital television channels, including BBC Two and UKTV History. One of his documentary series was &quot;Wellington: The Iron Duke&quot;, in which he chronicled the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s life, travelling to India, to Waterloo and numerous other locations.

He used a similar format in his series, &quot;In the Footsteps of Churchill&quot;, a documentary on Winston Churchill. In this, he travelled across the world, including South Africa, Sudan, Egypt and various locations in the United Kingdom and Europe. He also wrote a book to accompany the series.

In 2003 he presented &quot;Britain&#x27;s Finest Castles&quot;, part of an eight-part documentary series for Channel 5.

==Personal life==
Holmes married Katharine Saxton in 1975, with whom he had two daughters.

===Death===
Holmes died on 30 April 2011, aged 65, from the effects of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

<doc id="431475" wikidata="Q725292" url="?curid=431475" title="James Kent (jurist)">
<text>James Kent (July 31, 1763 – December 12, 1847) was an American jurist, New York legislator, legal scholar, and first Professor of Law at Columbia College. His &quot;Commentaries on American Law&quot; (based on lectures first delivered at Columbia in 1794, and further lectures in the 1820s) became the formative American law book in the antebellum era (published in 14 editions before 1896) and also helped establish the tradition of law reporting in America. He is sometimes called the &quot;American Blackstone&quot;.

==Early life==
Kent was born in what was then the town of Fredericksburg (the present-day towns of Patterson, Kent, Carmel, Southeast and Pawling) in Dutchess County, New York. His father, Moss Kent, was a lawyer in that county, as well as the first Surrogate of nearby Rensselaer County, New York. Despite interruptions caused by the American Revolutionary War, Kent graduated from Yale College in 1781, having helped establish Phi Beta Kappa society there in 1780. Returning to New York, Kent read law under Egbert Benson (then the state Attorney General and later a state judge).

==Early career==

Admitted to the New York bar in January 1785, Kent began practicing law in Poughkeepsie, New York and neighboring areas. Voters in Dutchess County elected him in 1791 and 1792–93 as their representative in the New York State Assembly. He was also the Federalist candidate in the January 1793 election for the 5th congressional district, losing to Theodorus Bailey. However, he had married and supporting his growing family based on his scholarship and nearly rural legal practice proved difficult.

In 1793, Kent moved his family to New York City, where he had been appointed the first professor of law in Columbia College, where he would teach (part-time) for the next five years. He was soon appointed a master in chancery for the city.

Kent again served in the Assembly in 1796–97. In 1797, he was appointed Recorder of New York City and in 1798, a justice of the New York Supreme Court, in 1804 Chief Justice, and in 1814 Chancellor of New York. Kent was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. In 1821 he was a member of the New York State Constitutional Convention where he unsuccessfully opposed the raising of the property qualification for African American voters. Two years later, Chancellor Kent reached the constitutional age limit and retired from his office, but was re-elected to his former chair.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1829.

He lived in retirement in Summit, New Jersey between 1837 and 1847 in a simple four-roomed cottage (the original cottage no longer stands and has been incorporated into a large mansion at 50 Kent Place) which he referred to as &#x27;my Summit Lodge&#x27;, a name that has been offered as the derivation for the city&#x27;s name.

==Work==
Kent has been long remembered for his &quot;Commentaries on American Law&quot; (four volumes, published 1826–1830), highly respected in England and America. The &quot;Commentaries&quot; treated state, federal and international law, and the law of personal rights and of property, and went through six editions in Kent&#x27;s lifetime.
Kent rendered his most essential service to American jurisprudence while serving as chancellor. Chancery, or equity law, had been very unpopular during the colonial period, and had received little development, and no decisions had been published. His judgments of this class cover a wide range of topics, and are so thoroughly considered and developed as unquestionably to form the basis of American equity jurisprudence.

As chancellor, Kent inspired the development of modern American discovery by allowing masters to actively examine witnesses during depositions (rather than following the old English procedure of merely reading static interrogatories), and he allowed parties and counsel to be present for depositions. These innovations led to the modern deposition by oral examination. Depositions are still one of the most unique and distinctive aspects of civil procedure in the United States and Canada.

==Family==

Kent married Elizabeth Bailey, and they had four children: Elizabeth (died in infancy), Elizabeth, Mary, and William Kent (1802–1861) who was a circuit judge and ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Washington Hunt in 1852.

His brother Moss Kent was a Congressman.

==Monuments and memorials==
* Kent County, Michigan and Kent City, Michigan are named in his honor, probably because he represented Michigan Territory in its dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip.
* Chicago-Kent College of Law is named in his honor.
* The Chancellor Kent Professorship at Columbia Law School is named after him, as is Kent Hall, which was built for the law school, but which now contains the C.V. Starr East Asian Library. Students who have high honors status (generally those who are in the top two to eight percent of the class) during any one of their years at Columbia Law School are called James Kent Scholars in honor of James Kent&#x27;s status as Columbia&#x27;s first professor of law.
* The Chancellor Kent Professorship at Yale Law School is also named after him.
* Kent Place School, an independent all-girls school in New Jersey, is located where his summer house was.
* James Kent&#x27;s original &quot;Summit Lodge&quot; is now incorporated into a large mansion at 50 Kent Place Boulevard, Summit, NJ. Most of the original architecture including the kitchen and long room still exist today.
* Bronze statues of Chancellor Kent and Solon (the Athenian lawmaker whose reforms laid the foundations for democracy) represent law on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. These statues are among sixteen representing men whose works have shaped human development and civilization.
* In 1900, Kent was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans with a bust sculpted by Edmond Thomas Quinn.

<doc id="431483" wikidata="Q212937" url="?curid=431483" title="Magpie goose">
<text>The magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata) is the sole living representative species of the family Anseranatidae. This common waterbird is found in northern Australia and southern New Guinea. As the species is prone to wandering, especially when not breeding, it is sometimes recorded outside its core range. The species was once also widespread in southern Australia but disappeared from there largely due to the drainage of the wetlands where the birds once bred. Due to their importance to Aboriginal people as a seasonal food source, as subjects of recreational hunting, and as a tourist attraction, their expansive and stable presence in northern Australia has been &quot;ensured [by] protective management&quot;.

==Description==
Magpie geese are unmistakable birds with their black and white plumage and yellowish legs. The feet are only partially webbed, and the magpie goose feeds on vegetable matter in the water, as well as on land. Males are larger than females. Unlike true geese, their molt is gradual, so no flightless periods result. Their voice is a loud honking. 

==Systematics and evolution==
This species is placed in the order Anseriformes, having the characteristic bill structure, but is considered to be distinct from the other species in this taxon. The related and extant families, Anhimidae (screamers) and Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans), contain all the other taxa. The magpie goose is contained in the genus &quot;Anseranas&quot; and family Anseranatidae, which are monotypic now.

A cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese, and swans.

This family is quite old, a living fossil, having apparently diverged before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event — the relative &quot;Vegavis iaai&quot; lived some 68-67 million years ago. The fossil record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus &quot;Anatalavis&quot; (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene of New Jersey, USA - London Clay Early Eocene of Walton-on-the-Naze, England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known. Other Paleogene birds sometimes considered magpie-geese are the genera &quot;Geranopsis&quot; from the Hordwell Formation Late Eocene to the Early Oligocene of England and &quot;Anserpica&quot; from the Late Oligocene of Billy-Créchy (France).

The earliest known member of the group in Australia is Eoanseranas represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland. Additional fossils from North America and Europe suggest that the family was spread across the globe during the late Paleogene period. The Australian distribution of the living species ties in well with the presumed Gondwanan origin of Anseriformes, but Northern Hemisphere fossils are puzzling. Perhaps the magpie geese were one of the dominant groups of Paleogene waterfowl, only to become largely extinct later.

==Ecology and status==

The magpie goose is found in a variety of open wetland areas such as floodplains and swamps, where they wade and swim. They eat mostly vegetation such as dry grass blades, grass seeds, spike rush bulbs and wild rice.

Magpie geese are fairly sedentary apart from some movement during the dry season. They are colonial breeders and are gregarious outside of the breeding season when they can form large and noisy flocks of up to a few thousand individuals. Magpie geese nest on the ground or in trees where they can be five meters or higher above the ground. Their typical clutch is between 5-14 eggs. Some males mate with two females, all of which raise the young, unlike some other polygamous birds. This may be beneficial when predation of young is high as chicks raised by trios are more likely to survive.

This species is plentiful across its range, although this is significantly reduced in comparison to the range at time of European settlement. The range once extended as far south as the Coorong and the wetlands of the southeast of South Australia and Western Victoria. For Australia as a whole, it is not threatened and has a controlled hunting season when numbers are large. However, most of the southern populations were extirpated in the mid-20th century by overhunting and habitat destruction. The species has been subject to reintroduction projects such as Bool Lagoon between Penola and Naracoorte. Populations in more northern areas have again reached a level where it can be regularly utilized by hunters, although not in the example provided. The magpie goose was listed as near threatened on the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria. In the December 2007 Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act list of threatened fauna, it is also listed. As of early 2008, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species had not been prepared.

With the advent of climate change, and more frequent seawater inundations of the current extensive freshwater floodplains, CSIRO scientists argue that magpie geese populations may be at risk.

==In Aboriginal languages==
The Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land know this bird as &quot;manimunak&quot;. It became an important food item with the formation of wetlands about 1500 ya, and is depicted in rock art from this period. Mimi figures are often shown holding goose-feather fans. In Yolŋu Matha the bird is known as &quot;gurrumaṯtji&quot;, or around Ramingining as &quot;gumang&quot;.

In the Wadawurrung language, the magpie goose is known as Ngangok.

<doc id="431501" wikidata="Q1392562" url="?curid=431501" title="Heber J. Grant">
<text>Heber Jeddy Grant (November 22, 1856 – May 14, 1945) was an American religious leader who served as the seventh president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Grant worked as a bookkeeper and a cashier, then was called to be an LDS apostle on October 16, 1882, at age 25. After the death of Joseph F. Smith in late 1918, Grant served as LDS Church president until his death.

The first president born after the exodus to Utah, Grant was also the last LDS Church president to have practiced polygamy. He had three wives, though by the time he became church president in 1918 only his second wife, Augusta Winters, was still living.

In business, Grant helped develop the Avenues neighborhood of Salt Lake City. In 1884, he served a term as a representative to the Utah Territorial Legislature.

==Early life==

Grant was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, the son of Rachel Ridgeway Ivins and Jedediah Morgan Grant. His father was a counselor in the First Presidency to Brigham Young. Rachel Grant was a native of New Jersey, where she had converted to the LDS Church at about 20. Her cousin and later brother-in-law (he married her older sister Anna), Israel Ivins, was the first person baptized a Latter-day Saint in New Jersey.

Jedediah Grant died when Heber J. Grant was nine days old. After Jedediah&#x27;s death, Rachel married Jedediah&#x27;s brother, George Grant, but he fell into alcoholism so she divorced him. Rachel became the dominant influence in Heber&#x27;s life. She served for many years as president of the 13th Ward Relief Society in downtown Salt Lake City.

He was known for his determination to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond his reach. As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically awkward to be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship. In similar fashion, Grant expressed a desire to be a successful bookkeeper although many of his associates criticized his penmanship. He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach penmanship at one of the local academies.

There were no free public schools in Salt Lake City when Grant was a child, but his mother kept him enrolled in various schools while he was growing up.

==Business activities==
After working as a bookkeeper in the insurance business in 1877, Grant became an assistant cashier with Zion&#x27;s Savings Bank and afterwards opened an insurance business with Nephi Clayton. Later, Grant became a partner with Benjamin W. E. Jennens. He later founded an additional insurance agency in Ogden and, for a time, owned the Ogden Vinegar Works.

In the late 1890s, Grant served as the business manager for the newly-formed official LDS magazine, the &quot;Improvement Era&quot;. Grant&#x27;s insurance company advertised in the publication.

Grant continued to be involved in business activities after his call as an apostle. He founded many new businesses, including a bank. He was a founder of the Utah Sugar Company and the main founder of the Salt Lake Theatre.

Grant lost a large amount of money in the Panic of 1893 and never recovered from its adverse financial effects. He was also the main person to negotiate new financing to the LDS Church in New York at the time. His efforts kept the church going until Lorenzo Snow&#x27;s late-1890s call for tithing placed the church in a better financial situation.

==Early LDS Church service==
Grant was made a block teacher (similar to the modern position of home teacher) when he was still a youth, which was rare at the time. He was ordained a seventy at 15, which was also rare at the time.

In June 1875, when the first Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA) was organized in the Salt Lake 13th Ward, Grant, then 19, was called to serve as a counselor to Junius F. Wells in its presidency.

At 26, he served a mission to the Native Americans from 1883 to 1884.

Grant&#x27;s early church assignments included service on the Church Salary Committee and the Sunday School General Board. Grant was made Second Assistant in the Superintendency of the General YMMIA in 1898. When Joseph F. Smith became president of the church and head of the YMMIA, Grant was made First Assistant, where he served until he became church president.

In 1880, Grant became president of the Tooele Utah Stake, moving there with his wife, Lucy, and their children. Around then, Lucy began to develop health problems.
In 1882, Grant was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Early in his service in the quorum, he made many trips to Arizona, earning the title &quot;The Arizona Apostle&quot;. Grant twice served missions among the Yaqui in Mexico.

In 1901, Grant was sent to Japan to open the church&#x27;s Japanese Mission. He served as the mission president until 1903, when he returned home but was almost immediately sent to preside over the British and other European missions of the church. He returned from the British mission in 1906.

During the ensuing decade and later, Grant oversaw church education programs, the Genealogical Society of Utah and the &quot;Improvement Era&quot;.

==Church president==
Grant succeeded Joseph F. Smith as church president in November 1918. He was not sustained in the position by the general church membership, however, until June 1919 because of the influenza pandemic of 1918, which forced a delay of the church&#x27;s traditional springtime general conference.
During his tenure as church president, Grant enforced the 1890 Manifesto outlawing polygamy and gave guidance as the church&#x27;s social structure evolved away from its early days of &#x27;plural marriage&#x27;. In 1927, he authorized the implementation of the church&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; policy, which was intended to reduce antagonism between Latter-day Saints and the US government. Grant dedicated the first temples outside of Utah since Kirtland. The first was the Hawaii Temple, followed by the Alberta Temple, the first outside the United States, and the Arizona Temple. The church also began the Idaho Falls Temple, which was not completed until after his death.

Also under Grant, the first stakes outside the Intermountain West were organized. The first stake in Los Angeles was organized in the 1920s. Grant still operated on old methods, such as personally asking LeGrand Richards to move to California with the intention of calling him as a stake president there. He also personally negotiated the purchase of the land on which the Los Angeles Temple would be built.

In the 1930s, stakes were organized in New York and Chicago and in the 1940s in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC. Grant presided at the dedication of an LDS chapel in Washington, DC, in 1933, which was seen to mark a new phase of nationwide expansion in the church.

In 1935, Grant excommunicated members of the church in Short Creek, Arizona, who refused to sign the loyalty pledge to the church that included a renunciation of plural marriage. That signaled the formal beginning of the Mormon fundamentalist movement, and some of the excommunicated members went on to found the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

One of Grant&#x27;s greatest legacies as president is the church&#x27;s welfare program, which he instituted in 1936: &quot;our primary purpose was to set up, insofar as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves.&quot; Grant also placed strong emphasis on the importance of sacrament meeting attendance and oversaw expansion of the seminary program and the creation of the institute of religion.

His administration also emphasized the practice of the LDS health code known as the Word of Wisdom. During the early 1900s, general authorities differed in their observance of the proscription against beer, wine, tobacco, coffee and tea, but among the apostles, Grant was one of the most vocal in opposing such substances. In 1921, Grant&#x27;s administration made adherence to the health code compulsory for advancement in the priesthood or for entrance to temples. Grant also spoke out in favor of Utah&#x27;s Prohibition movement, which occurred around the same time.

Despite being a Democrat, Grant was opposed to the election of U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and wrote a front-page editorial for the &quot;Deseret News&quot; urging church members not to vote for him during the 1936 election. Grant shared the view of J. Reuben Clark and David O. McKay that the New Deal was socialism, which they all despised. Roosevelt greatly alienated Grant also for opposing Prohibition, another subject.

Roosevelt still won Utah in each of his four presidential elections. Grant regarded that as &quot;one of the most serious conditions that has confronted me since I became President of the Church.&quot; Later, when Utah voters agreed by plebiscite to become the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, thus completing the process of ratification and repealing prohibition, Grant was devastated. In a general conference, he told the Latter-day Saints, &quot;I have never felt so humiliated in my life over anything as that the State of Utah voted for the repeal of Prohibition.&quot;

Under Grant&#x27;s administration, the position of Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve was created.

==Death==
Grant died in Salt Lake City, at age 88, from cardiac failure as a result of arteriosclerosis. As the final surviving member of the church&#x27;s Council of Fifty, his death marked the formal end of the organization. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Grant&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2004 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==Wives==
Grant was the last LDS Church president known to practice polygamy. He married a first time in 1877 and then twice more in 1884. However, by the time he became church president, only one of his wives, Augusta, was still alive.

One of his grandchildren was longtime CBS News producer Leslie Midgley, last husband of Betty Furness.

=== Lucy Stringham ===
Grant married Lucy Stringham (1858–1893) on November 1, 1877. She was a daughter of Briant Stringham, who came to the Salt Lake Valley with Brigham Young in 1847.

Lucy had been closely associated with Grant essentially from her birth, and they attended Mary Cook&#x27;s school together. Like Grant, she was a member of the 13th Ward. It was not until Grant broke off his courtship with Emily H. Wells (see below) that he started actively courting Lucy. Lucy was initially reticent to fully accept Grant&#x27;s advances, seeing herself as just a temporary replacement for Emily, but after he regularly walked her home from church services for several weeks without being invited into the Stringham home, she gave up and invited him in. They married a few months later. For a time, Lucy was a school teacher.

Grant felt very close to Lucy. On an early assignment as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve in Arizona, he surprised his traveling companion, Brigham Young Jr., with how many letters he wrote to Lucy.

Lucy and Grant would become the parents of six children. He praised her &quot;business foresight and judgment&quot; and credited her with much of his business success. She died in 1893, after a long illness during which he gave constant, tender devotion to her, as he had throughout their marriage.

=== Augusta Winters ===
Grant married Hulda Augusta Winters (1856–1952) on May 26, 1884. She was a school teacher for a time and was described as the ablest school teacher in Utah Territory. In the late 1880s, Augusta took up residence in New York City to try and prevent Grant&#x27;s arrest on polygamy charges. Augusta bore one daughter. She accompanied Grant to Japan when he was sent to open the Japanese mission in 1901. She would often travel with him when he was president of the church, especially when he went to address non-Mormon audiences. She died in 1952.

=== Emily H. Wells ===
Grant married Emily Harris Wells (1857–1908) on May 27, 1884. She was a daughter of Daniel H. Wells.

Emily and Grant were five months apart in age and from Emily&#x27;s birth she had been Grant&#x27;s next-door neighbor. They were among the most prominent young orators in Salt Lake society in the 1870s, both connected with the Wasatch Literary Association and Grant was a counselor to Emily&#x27;s brother in the 13th Ward YMMIA presidency. The marriage of Grant and Emily was expected by all who knew them. However, Emily then announced publicly her opposition to polygamy, which caused a falling out between Grant and Emily.

Emily was a full sister of Briant H. Wells, who was a Major General in the United States Army. Another of her brothers, Heber M. Wells, later the first governor of the state of Utah, stayed with her for part of the time of her exile in Manassa.

Emily attended the University of Deseret. For a time, she was a school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that was in many ways a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then had a change of heart and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far worse than it had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant having to go to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.

In 1889, to avoid being forced to testify in pending unlawful cohabitation charges against her husband, Emily went to Manassa, Colorado, where she stayed for a year and a half. Grant accompanied her on the train-ride from Pueblo, Colorado, to Manassa, having been on a different train on the previous part of the journey to avoid arrest. Grant stayed two weeks, setting up for Emily the most comfortable house in the town, and leaving his mother to help Emily. She remained in Manassa until March 1891, when she returned to Salt Lake City.

Emily and Grant were the parents of four daughters and a son. The son, Daniel Wells Grant, died while he was still a child. Emily&#x27;s last child was born in 1899, when she was 42, the same year Grant pleaded guilty to unlawful cohabitation and paid a $100 fine.

Emily accompanied Grant when he served as mission president in England, bringing her four daughters and two of Lucy&#x27;s daughters. Because of their daughters&#x27; presence, the Grants relocated the mission home to a more respectable part of Liverpool.

Emily developed stomach cancer in 1907, which caused her death in 1908. At the time of her death, she was considered one of the most prominent women in Salt Lake City.

<text>Mathurin Jacques Brisson (; 30 April 1723 – 23 June 1806) was a French zoologist and natural philosopher.

Brisson was born on 30 April 1723 at Fontenay-le-Comte in the Vendée department of western France. His parents wished him to take ecclesiastic orders, but in 1747, he abandoned his studies, and from 1749, was employed by the wealthy French naturalist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur as the curator of a large private collection of objects related to natural history that de Réaumur kept at his ancestral home at Réaumur in the Vendée.

Brisson became interested in the classification of animals and was influenced by the works of Carl Linnaeus and Jacob Theodor Klein. His book &quot;Le Règne animal&quot; was published in 1756, and the highly regarded six-volume work &quot;Ornithologie&quot; was published in 1760.

The English ornithologist Alfred Newton wrote of Brisson&#x27;s &quot;Ornithologie&quot; that it was &quot;a work of very great merit so far as it goes, for as a descriptive ornithologist the author stands even now unsurpassed;...&quot;. For each species Brisson clearly indicated whether he had examined a specimen or whether he was relying on descriptions by other authors. Although in Brisson coined a Latin name for each bird species, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). However, Brisson also introduced names for genera and these are accepted by the ICZN. Linnaeus relied heavily on Brisson&#x27;s work when updating his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition in 1766. Linnaeus added 386 bird species of which 240 were based exclusively on Brisson.

De Réaumur died in 1757 and although in his will he left his large collection to the French Academy of Sciences, it was instead absorbed into the &quot;Cabinet du roi&quot;, the royal natural history collection in Paris. Brisson abandoned zoology and in 1762 succeeded Jean-Antoine Nollet as professor of physics at the College of Navarre in Paris.

For a period of time, Brisson was an instructor of physical sciences and natural history to the family of the monarch. From 1759, he was a member of the Academy of Sciences.

A significant work involving the &quot;specific weight of bodies&quot; was his &quot;Pesanteur Spécifique des Corps&quot; published in 1787. In his investigations of electricity, Brisson was opposed to the theories of Priestley and Franklin.

He married Marie-Denise Foliot de Foucherolles on 24 April 1775. They had three children.
He died on 23 June 1806 at Magny-les-Hameaux near Versailles.

<text>George Edwards (3 April 1694 – 23 July 1773) was an English naturalist and ornithologist, known as the &quot;father of British ornithology&quot;.

Edwards was born at West Ham, then in the county of Essex. In his early years, he travelled extensively through mainland Europe, studying natural history, and gained a reputation for his coloured drawings of animals, especially birds. He was appointed as beadle to the Royal College of Physicians in 1733.

Over a period of 21 years, Edwards published seven volumes containing descriptions and hand-coloured etchings of birds. In a few cases, he depicted other animals. None of the species were native to the British Isles. The first four volumes were published between 1743 and 1751 with the title &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. The three subsequent volumes were published between 1758 and 1764 with the title &quot;Gleanings Of Natural History&quot;. The volumes contain a total of 362 hand-coloured etchings of which 317 depict birds. The etchings were all drawn by Edwards. He numbered the plates consecutively through the seven volumes.

When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition in 1758, he listed a binomial name for every plant and animal. For many of the birds he cited the description and illustration in &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Later, when he updated the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the 12th edition in 1766, he cited the &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;.

Edwards was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1757. He never married and died aged 79 in 1773 in Plaistow, Essex.

==Early years==
George Edwards was born on April 3, 1694, in Stratford, then a hamlet that formed part of the village of West Ham in Essex. He had two sisters, Ann and Mary, and a half-brother James Frost. When around six years of age he was sent to a boarding school in Leytonstone, after which he went to Brentwood Grammar School.

His parents wished him to train to become a merchant, and so after leaving school he was apprenticed to John Dod in Fenchurch Street, London. Dod had a large collection of various books, which Edwards read eagerly. The books inspired him to abandon his business career and to travel. In August 1716, after seven years with Dod, he left London for Holland where he spent two months visiting most of the larger cities. The next two years were spent without a job back in England.

In 1718, through a merchant friend in London, he was invited to join a ship sailing to Norway. He spent much of his two month visit in the town of Frederikshald (now Halden) which is close to the frontier with Sweden. This was during the Great Northern War, so his opportunities for travel were limited. At one point he was mistaken for a Swedish spy and arrested. He returned with the ship to Bristol and then travelled by land to London. The following year in May of 1719 he left England and travelled via Dieppe to Paris. He found the city expensive and moved to the village of Guyancourt near Versailles, from the centre of Paris, where he boarded with a schoolmaster. From his base in Guyancourt he made two journeys on foot. One to Châlons-en-Champagne with the son of his host and the second to Orléans and Blois dressed as a vagrant to avoid tempting robbers. After spending nearly two years in France he returned to London at the end of January 1721. In June of the same year he visited Newcastle upon Tyne with the same merchant that had taken him to Norway.

==Beadle for the Royal College of Physicians==
In 1733, on the recommendation of Hans Sloane, he was appointed beadle to the Royal College of Physicians in London. The beadle was the administrator of the college and the person in charge of the college property. Edwards styled himself as the &quot;librarian&quot; of the college; one of his duties was to take care of the library. Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum, had employed George Edwards as a natural history painter for some years, and had Edwards draw miniature figures of animals for him. Edwards visited Sloane once a week to share news and a coffee. Sloane kept track of Edwards&#x27;s expenses and reimbursed him annually. He then served as college librarian for 36 years and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and of the London Society of Antiquaries.

==Ornithology==
In 1743 Edwards published the first volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;, the fourth volume of which appeared in 1751. The title page stated: &quot;Printed for the author, at the College of Physicians, in Warwick-Lane&quot;. The printer was probably William Bowyer of Leytonstone who was the printer used by the Society of Antiquaries and was later used by the College of Physicians. At the same time Edwards published a French edition of the book. The four parts were published in 1745, 1748, 1751 and 1751. The translator is given on the title page as &quot;traduit de l&#x27;Anglais par M. D. de la S. R.&quot;. This was David Durand, a French protestant minister and a Fellow of the Royal Society who was living in London. Three additional volumes, under the title &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;, were issued in 1758, 1760 and 1764. The two works contain etchings and descriptions of more than 600 subjects in natural history not before described or delineated. He likewise added a general index in French and English, which was afterwards supplied with Linnaean names by Linnaeus himself, with whom he corresponded.

The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1750 with the citation: &quot;On account of a very curious Book lately published by him, and intiyled, &quot;A Natural History of Birds, &amp;c.&quot; - containing the Figures elegantly drawn, and illuminated in their proper colours, of 209 different Birds, and about 20 very rare Quadrupeds, Serpents.&quot; This was a significant honour. The clockmaker John Harrison had been awarded the medal the previous year for his invention of a chronometer suitable for calculating longitude while at sea. Edwards included a picture of the medal on the overall title page in the first volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot; and an explanation in the preface.

About 1764 he retired to Plaistow, Essex, still a rural village, where he later died at the age of 77.
He also wrote &quot;Essays of Natural History&quot; (1770).

The Nuremberg engraver Johann Seligmann, realised the popular appeal of the illustrated volumes by Edwards and Mark Catesby and re-etched all 474 of the original plates. They were published with a German text in nine volumes between 1749 and 1776 with the title &quot;Sammlung verschiedener ausländischer und seltener Vögel&quot;. The German text was translated into French and published as &quot;Recueil de Divers Oiseaux Étrangers et Peu Communs&quot;, and translated into Dutch and published as &quot;Verzameling van uitlandsche en zeldzaame vogelen, benevens eenige vreemde dieren en plantgewassen: in &#x27;t Engelsch naauwkeurig beschreeven en naar &#x27;t Leven met Kleuren afgebeeld, door G. Edwards en M. Catesby&quot;.

Some of the colour plates in his &quot;Natural History of Birds&quot; were painted by Peter Paillou.

==Eponyms==
&quot;Diadophis punctatus edwardsii&quot;, a subspecies of North American snake, is named in honor of George Edwards. The puffadder shyshark, first described by Edwards in 1760, is now named &quot;Haploblepharus edwardsii&quot;.

<doc id="431523" wikidata="Q445560" url="?curid=431523" title="Pierre Belon">
<text>Pierre Belon (1517–1564) was a French traveller, naturalist, writer and diplomat. Like many others of the Renaissance period, he studied and wrote on a range of topics including ichthyology, ornithology, botany, comparative anatomy, architecture and Egyptology. He is sometimes known as Pierre Belon du Mans, or, in the Latin in which his works appeared, as Petrus Bellonius Cenomanus. The Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (known for Pavlov&#x27;s dogs) called him the &quot;prophet of comparative anatomy&quot;.

==Life==
Belon was born in 1517 at the hamlet of Souletière near Cérans-Foulletourte in the Pays de la Loire. Nothing is known about his descent. Somewhere between 1532 and 1535 he started working as an apprentice to René des Prez, born in Foulletourte but by then an apothecary to the bishop of Clermont, Guillaume Duprat. Between 1535 and 1538 he entered the service of René du Bellay, bishop of Le Mans, who allowed him to study medicine at the University of Wittenberg with the botanist Valerius Cordus (1515-1544). He travelled around Germany with Cordus in 1542, and on his return, he travelled through Flanders and to England. By the end of summer in 1542 he continued his studies at Paris. With the recommendation of Duprat, he became an apothecary to Cardinal François de Tournon. Under this patronage, he was able to undertake extensive scientific voyages. Starting in December 1546, he travelled through Greece, Crete, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia and Palestine, and returned to France in 1549. A full account of his &quot;Observations&quot; on this journey, with illustrations, was published in Paris, 1553. Returning to the household of Cardinal de Tournon at Rome for the Papal conclave, 1549-1550, Belon encountered the naturalists Guillaume Rondelet and Hippolyte Salviani. He returned to Paris with his copious notes and began to publish. In 1557 he travelled again, this time in northern Italy, Savoy, the Dauphiné and Auvergne.

Belon was highly favoured both by Henry II and by Charles IX, the latter of whom accorded him lodging in the Château de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne. There he undertook the translations of Dioscurides and Theophrastus. Belon was murdered, possibly by thieves, one evening in April 1564, when coming through the Bois on his return from Paris.

==Works==
Belon was typical of the Renaissance scholar and took an interest in &quot;all kinds of good disciplines&quot; in his lifetime. He was interested in zoology, botany and classical Antiquity. Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value.

His first book was &quot;Histoire naturelle des estranges poissons&quot; (1551) and despite its title was a work mainly on the dolphin; it did have woodcuts of some fishes, possibly the first among printed books in the West.

His second book, &quot;De aquatilibus&quot; (in Latin, 1553) greatly expanded on the first and included a description of 110 species of fish, with illustrations; it was a work that laid the foundation of modern ichthyology. Its French translation &quot;La nature et diversite des poissons&quot; (Paris, 1555) was followed by an edition of 1560, and the volume was reprinted in Frankfurt and Zurich. His works were translated by Carolus Clusius, and he was held in high authority by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi.

In his &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de la nature des oyseaux&quot; (1555) he included two figures of the skeletons of humans and birds, marking the homologous bones. This is widely seen as one of the earliest demonstrations of comparative anatomy.

<doc id="431529" wikidata="Q114739" url="?curid=431529" title="Supersolid">
<text>In condensed matter physics, a supersolid is a spatially ordered (i.e. solid) material with superfluid properties. In the case of helium-4, it has been conjectured since the 1960s that it might be possible to create a supersolid. Starting from 2017, a definitive proof for the existence of this state was provided by several experiments using atomic Bose–Einstein condensates. The general conditions required for supersolidity to emerge in a certain substance are a topic of ongoing research.

== Background ==
A supersolid is a special quantum state of matter where particles form a rigid, spatially ordered structure, but also flow with zero viscosity. This is in contradiction to the intuition that flow, and in particular superfluid flow with zero viscosity, is a property exclusive to the fluid state, e.g., superconducting electron and neutron fluids, gases with Bose–Einstein condensates, or unconventional liquids such as helium-4 or helium-3 at sufficiently low temperature. For more than 50 years it was thus unclear whether the supersolid state can exist.

== Experiments using helium ==
While several experiments yielded negative results, in the 1980s, John Goodkind discovered the first anomaly in a solid by using ultrasound. Inspired by his observation, in 2004 Eun-Seong Kim and Moses Chan at Pennsylvania State University saw phenomena which were interpreted as supersolid behavior. Specifically, they observed a non-classical rotational moment of inertia of a torsional oscillator. This observation could not be explained by classical models but was consistent with superfluid-like behavior of a small percentage of the helium atoms contained within the oscillator.

This observation triggered a large number of follow-up studies to reveal the role played by crystal defects or helium-3 impurities. Further experimentation has cast some doubt on the existence of a true supersolid in helium. Most importantly, it was shown that the observed phenomena could be largely explained due to changes in the elastic properties of the helium. In 2012, Chan repeated his original experiments with a new apparatus that was designed to eliminate any such contributions. In this experiment, Chan and his coauthors found no evidence of supersolidity.

== Experiments using ultracold quantum gases ==
In 2017, two research groups from ETH Zurich and from MIT reported on the creation of an ultracold quantum gas with supersolid properties. The Zurich group placed a Bose–Einstein condensate inside two optical resonators, which enhanced the atomic interactions until they started to spontaneously crystallize and form a solid that maintains the inherent superfluidity of Bose–Einstein condensates. This setting realises a special form of a supersolid, the so-called lattice supersolid, where atoms are pinned to the sites of an externally imposed lattice structure. The MIT group exposed a Bose–Einstein condensate in a double-well potential to light beams that created an effective spin–orbit coupling. The interference between the atoms on the two spin–orbit coupled lattice sites gave rise to a characteristic density modulation.

In 2019, three groups from Stuttgart, Florence, and Innsbruck observed supersolid properties in dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates formed from lanthanide atoms. In these systems, supersolidity emerges directly from the atomic interactions, without the need for an external optical lattice. This facilitated also the direct observation of superfluid flow and hence the definitive proof for the existence of the supersolid state of matter.

In 2021, confocal cavity quantum electrodynamics with a Bose–Einstein condensate was used to create a supersolid that possesses a key property of solids, vibration. That is, a supersolid was created that possesses lattice phonons with a Goldstone mode dispersion exhibiting a 16 cm/s speed of sound.

In 2021, dysprosium was used to create a 2-dimensional supersolid quantum gas, in 2022, the same team created a supersolid disk in a round trap and in 2024 they reported the observation of quantum vortices in the supersolid phase

== Theory ==
In most theories of this state, it is supposed that vacancies – empty sites normally occupied by particles in an ideal crystal – lead to supersolidity. These vacancies are caused by zero-point energy, which also causes them to move from site to site as waves. Because vacancies are bosons, if such clouds of vacancies can exist at very low temperatures, then a Bose–Einstein condensation of vacancies could occur at temperatures less than a few tenths of a Kelvin. A coherent flow of vacancies is equivalent to a &quot;superflow&quot; (frictionless flow) of particles in the opposite direction. Despite the presence of the gas of vacancies, the ordered structure of a crystal is maintained, although with less than one particle on each lattice site on average. Alternatively, a supersolid can also emerge from a superfluid. In this situation, which is realised in the experiments with atomic Bose–Einstein condensates, the spatially ordered structure is a modulation on top of the superfluid density distribution.

<text>Murder by Decree is a 1979 mystery thriller film directed by Bob Clark. It features the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who are embroiled in the investigation surrounding the real-life 1888 Whitechapel murders committed by &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. Christopher Plummer plays Holmes and James Mason plays Watson. Though it features a similar premise, it is somewhat different in tone and result to &quot;A Study in Terror&quot;. It is loosely based on &quot;The Ripper File&quot; by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd.

The film&#x27;s premise of the plot behind the murders is influenced by the book &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; (1976), by Stephen Knight, who theorised that the killings were part of a Masonic plot. The original script contained the names of the historical suspects, Sir William Gull and John Netley. In the actual film, they are represented by fictional analogues: Thomas Spivy (Gull) and William Slade (Netley). This plot device was later used in other Jack the Ripper-themed fiction, including the graphic novel &quot;From Hell.&quot;

==Plot==
After the Metropolitan Police fail to apprehend the serial killer Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes is approached to investigate the recent murders of prostitutes in the Whitechapel district of London. Helped by Dr. Watson and the medium Robert Lees, Holmes discovers that all the victims were companions of Annie Crook, a woman locked in a mental institution.

Members of the police hierarchy and several politicians, all Freemasons, seem to be protecting one of their own. Furthermore, Inspector Foxborough, the policeman who is in charge of the case, is in fact the secret leader of the radicals, a political movement waiting for the British government to fall because of its inability to solve the Whitechapel murders. Holmes must rely on his skills to find and confront the murderer.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was directed by Bob Clark and written by playwright John Hopkins, who scripted the Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). The script partially was inspired by Elwyn Jones&#x27;s book &quot;The Ripper File&quot;. Hopkins referenced Conan Doyle&#x27;s work, particularly Holmes&#x27; deduction and science skills but downplayed other aspects of the characters, such as Holmes&#x27; drug use, in favour of making them more likeable and human.

The film stars Christopher Plummer and James Mason as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, and presents a largely different version of Holmes from the Basil Rathbone movies of the 1940s, with the aesthete still prevailing, yet tinged with humanity and emotional empathy. Plummer stated that he tried to make Holmes more human and caring, saying &quot;This is a passionate and caring Holmes.&quot; James Mason&#x27;s Watson is also a departure from previous incarnations; although he may appear at first to resemble the bumbling Nigel Bruce version of the character, he soon shows his level head and scientific and medical training to be as valuable assets as they were in the original stories. Like Plummer, Mason wanted to play up Watson&#x27;s skills and avoid the buffoonish way the character had been portrayed before. Mason received especially good reviews for his performance. Plummer had earlier portrayed Holmes in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Silver Blaze&quot;.

The supporting cast includes Donald Sutherland, Susan Clark, John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, David Hemmings and Geneviève Bujold. Frank Finlay plays Inspector Lestrade, a part he had portrayed in the similar film &quot;A Study in Terror&quot; (1965), in which Quayle also played a supporting role. Finlay continued his association with Holmes by appearing in an episode of Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Jeremy Brett.

The film was shot on location in London in 1978. The interior sets, including a vast Victorian era street, were created at Elstree Studios. The docks set was built at Shepperton Studios.

$3 million of the budget came from Canada, $2 million from the UK.

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a good deal of uncomplicated fun, not in a class with Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Percent Solution&quot;, but certainly miles ahead of many other current movies that masquerade as popular entertainment&quot;. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;probably the best Sherlock Holmes film since the inimitable pairing of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the 1940s series at Universal. Unfortunately, it also shares some of the defects of those films, i.e. slow pacing, an improbable story line, and an undue emphasis on odd characters.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that its &quot;biggest problem is its script, which runs on for a full 120 minutes with no place to go. We see a couple of murders, meet a psychic (Donald Sutherland) and a long-suffering woman trapped in a psychiatric prison (Genevieve Bujold), then the story doubles back with recapitulation after recapitulation. The film has at least two false endings. I mistakenly put on my coat with one reel to go. All of this is a shame, because the cast is excellent.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Unfortunately, under Bob Clark&#x27;s uninspired, plodding direction, Hopkins&#x27; elaborations make for a slow and ponderous film, despite a starry cast and some scary moments. Not helping matters is Christopher Plummer&#x27;s rather colorless Sherlock Holmes. The one real joy in the film is James Mason&#x27;s warm, loyal, sometimes dense Dr. Watson.&quot; Lawrence O&#x27;Toole of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; declared, &quot;If you were to look for the right word to describe &quot;Murder By Decree&quot; you would have to go into the archives, lift it lightly from its resting place, and dust it off. The word? Splendid.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated, &quot;While never as playful or ingenious as Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s screenplay for &#x27;The Seven Per-Cent Solution,&#x27; Hopkins&#x27; mystery is crisp and chilling right up to the denouement. At that point it might be wise to edge toward the exits, since the solution leaves much to be desired.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;not a new idea&quot; but declared it &quot;a decided success. Christopher Plummer and James Mason seize their roles like a couple of happy musicians handed prize antique instruments: their duets are by turns droll, lyric and touching.&quot;

The film was nominated for eight Genie Awards in 1980, of which it won five, including Best Achievement in Direction (Bob Clark), Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Geneviève Bujold) and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Christopher Plummer).

The film was the fourth highest-grossing film ever in Canada, with a gross of $1.9 million. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 87% from 15 reviews.

<text>Itzik Kol (; January 12, 1932 – July 8, 2007) was an Israeli television and film producer considered by many to be a pioneer and originator of Israeli cinema. He died following complications from pneumonia.

==Biography==
Yitchak Kolker (later Itzik Kol) was born in Petach Tikva, Mandatory Palestine, the only child of Tova Rosset, a Polish immigrant, and Shalom Kolker, a Ukrainian immigrant who worked as a union organizer and fought for Palestinian-Israeli rights. As a child, Kol trained to be a classical violinist at the urging of his mother. Despite noticeable talent, his interests shifted to politics and socialism during his adolescence and young adulthood when he became a prominent leader in the Israeli youth movement, Hashomer Hatzair. He was one of the founders Kibbutz Nachshon. There he married Noemi Glass and officially changed his last name from Kolker to Kol. They had two children: Ayelet Kol Engelman (born 1953) and Shahar Kol (born 1956). Kol left Kibbutz Nachshon in 1960.

In 1982, he divorced Noemi and married his second wife, Hadassa Degani, in 1991. They adopted a daughter two years later, Gabriella Kol (born 1993). In 1991–1994, Kol lived in Mount Olympus, Los Angeles, California. In 2002, he divorced Hadassa and married his third wife, a Colombian interior designer, Sarita Shalev in 2004.

In the last three years of his life, he was involved in the production of herbal remedies for Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD), one of which he actively promoted in the media.

==Film and theater career==

In 1960 coproduced the film, &quot;They Were Ten&quot; directed by Baruch Dinar. In 1960-1967 he was General Manager of the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv. During this period the theater achieved national and international recognition, including invitations to perform in Paris, London and Montreal.

1967-1978 President of Herzliya Studios where he produced critically acclaimed TV shows, such as: &quot;Lul&quot; with Uri Zohar and Arik Einstein, &quot;That is my secret&quot; with Uri Zohar, &quot;Nine square&quot; with Tuvia Tzafir, &quot;That&#x27;s it&quot; and &quot;Play it&quot; with Dudu Topaz, &quot;Take it or leave it&quot; with Dudo Dotan. All these shows were awarded the &quot;David&#x27;s Harp&quot; awards, the Israeli equivalent of the &quot;Emmy&quot;.

1978-1983 President of United Studios where he initiated and planned the merging of Herzliya Studios with Berke-Pathe-Humphries Studios into one company. Under his leadership the company became the industry leader in film and TV production in Israel as well as satellite broadcasting throughout the world.

1983-1991 President of G.G. Israel Studios where he devised and developed the foundation of the Neve Ilan Communications Center near Jerusalem. The complex includes vast stages and various other studios for film TV and video production.

In 1997, he made &quot;Hachaverim Shel Barney&quot; (החברים של ברני, &quot;Barney&#x27;s Friends&quot;), an Israeli co-production based on &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;. Kol&#x27;s daughter loved the character of the purple dinosaur, which inspired him to pursue the rights to produce an Israeli adaptation of the show. He approached Lyrick Studios in March 1996, but was initially turned down, told that he was only allowed to air a Hebrew dubbed version of the original series. He felt that &quot;Hebrew words into American songs and American kids&#x27; mouths&quot; wouldn&#x27;t work. Realizing that Sheryl Leach and her father-in-law, Richard Leach, were devout Christians, he asked &quot;Why not have Barney speak in the language of the Bible?&quot; This sealed the deal and, under strict guidelines, the show could be produced. One of these guidelines was that the episodes could only be adapted from those of the American show, with very few script changes. When the agreement went through, the show cost Roll Communications $41,000 per episode to produce (Only $500 per episode went to Lyrick), making it one of the most expensive children&#x27;s shows produced in Israel. Israeli songwriter and translator Ehud Manor was brought on board to translate the songs, while his daughter Libby translated the show&#x27;s scripts. Hachaverim Shel Barney premiered on November 2th 1997 and was immediately a smash hit. 

Kol supervised and executed live satellite broadcasts from Israel (1973–1983) and directed the following live shows:
Face The Nation (CBS)
Meet The Press (NBC)
Issues and Answers (ABC)

==Awards and honors==

*1971: Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film - nomination: &quot;The Policemen&quot;
*1971: Golden Globes: Best Foreign Language Film - winner: &quot;The Policemen&quot;

==Influence==

Many Israeli actors, directors, and producers have praised Itzik Kol and cited both his work and persona as being influential in their own careers:
Avi Nesher, a producer and one of Israel&#x27;s leading directors (Halehaka, Dizengoff 99, Shovrim, Sof Haolam Smola) said about Itzik Kol: &quot;I remember him as having a sharp sense of humor; he was a funny man with a great love of film and of culture. I owe Itzik a lot for my career. Without his confidence in me as a young producer in the movie Halehaka, none of my later doings would not have happened. I was a young, frightened 24-year-old director, and he was the executive director of Herzliya Studios, who produced many of Uri Zohar&#x27;s films and TV shows. Today, being a producer myself, I can say that his decision to work with a young director such as myself was very courageous. Undoubtedly he is the one who made the film possible. His contribution in this respect was huge.&quot;

In a memorial evening held for Itzik Kol in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Cinemateque in August 2008 Nesher added that cinema students do not always realize Kol&#x27;s huge contribution to contemporary Israeli film industry: “All those quality movies that win prestigious international prizes in late years, could not have been made at all if it wasn’t for Itzik Kol&#x27;s contribution and the immortal path he paved in the Israeli qualitative cinematography.” Nesher described Kol as the “ultimate true producer” who is constantly involved in any and every aspect of the film, from casting, through directing and taking care of the needs of the cast, to paying attention to every detail in editing and beyond.

“Prass Israel” winner, actress and director Gila Almagor (Sallah Shabati, Hachayim al pi Agfa, Hakayitz shel Avia, Spielberg&#x27;s Munich), who hosted Itzik Kol&#x27;s memorial evening and worked with him since his days as general manager of the Cameri Theater, said at the occasion that aside for Kol&#x27;s huge contribution to Israeli culture, he will be remembered for his unique persona. She described him as being a true friend who cares about people he works with, and as having a special sense of wit and humor.

&quot;Kol was a great man, literally and figuratively, in girth and in spirit” said producer Shlomo Paz, who first met Itzik Kol when they both belonged to Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. “He knew how to take things and do them. He had daring; he had incredible reserves of energy, but mostly he was smart and did the right things.&quot; &quot;There is no part of the industry he didn&#x27;t touch. He made films and television shows, worked with the greatest artists and even helped found international commercial television station during the 1970s and 1980s.&quot;

Television host and actor Dudu Topaz describes Kol as his mentor and his spiritual father: “He was the first to give me a chance as a TV host on the show Sachek Ota, which brought us winning the Kinor David prize. He was the one to give Uri Zohar, Tuvia Tafir, myself and many others first chance in show biz. Along the years we have done many TV hit shows together such as Sachek Ota, Tze Mize, Ze Ma Yesh and Ten Kav. He was one of a kind!”

Producer and television host Meni Peer who worked with Kol both in Israeli Television&#x27;s Arutz 1 and Arutz 2, on shows like Mimeni Meni, Besha’a Tova and Siba LeMesiba said: “The word producer is too dull to describe Itzik Kol&#x27;s doings. He was the real creator of cinema and television in Israel. He was always involved with every aspect of the production. This man just knew and loved the stage!”.

<text>Maura Therese Tierney (born February 3, 1965) is an award-winning American actress. She is best known for her roles in the sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (1995–1999), the medical drama &quot;ER&quot; (1999–2009) as Abby Lockhart and the mystery drama &quot;The Affair&quot; (2014–2019).

Tierney&#x27;s film credits include &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; (1999), &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002), &quot;Baby Mama&quot; (2008), &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; (2018), &quot;The Report&quot; (2019), &quot;The Iron Claw&quot; (2023), and &quot;Twisters&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Tierney was born and raised in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, the eldest of three children in an Irish American Catholic family. Her mother Pat (née James) is a real estate broker, while her father, Joseph M. Tierney, was a prominent Boston politician who served on the Boston City Council for 15 years.

Tierney attended Mount Alvernia Academy Elementary School and Notre Dame Academy in Hingham, Massachusetts, where she studied drama, which led to her appearance at the Boston Globe Drama Festival. After graduation, she attended New York University, where she majored first in dance and then in drama.

==Career==
After appearing in several plays, Tierney moved to Los Angeles in 1987, beginning with a role in Disney&#x27;s made-for-TV film &quot;Student Exchange&quot;. Tierney&#x27;s first starring role in a film was in a low-budget independent film called &quot;Dead Women in Lingerie&quot;, which was shot in 24 days.

Tierney had a number of small roles in film and television and a co-starring role in &quot;704 Hauser&quot;, a short-lived 1994 spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. She first received regular national exposure with her leading role in the sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; from 1995 to 1999. While part of the &quot;NewsRadio&quot; cast, she also starred in several successful films of the late 1990s and early 2000s such as &quot;Primal Fear&quot;, &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Mooseport&quot;.

After &quot;NewsRadio&quot; was canceled, Tierney decided not to star in another sitcom:

From 1999 to 2008, Tierney played Nurse Abigail &quot;Abby&quot; Lockhart on &quot;ER&quot;, a character that began as a guest appearance in November 1999 and then expanded in February 2000 to a full-time regular role as an ER nurse and later after completion of medical school, a doctor. She was reunited with her &quot;NewsRadio&quot; co-star Khandi Alexander, who at that time also had a recurring role on &quot;ER&quot;. Within a year, Tierney&#x27;s work on &quot;ER&quot; earned her an Emmy Award nomination, a recognition she credits to a &quot;juicy&quot; story arc featuring Sally Field as Lockhart&#x27;s mother Maggie Wyczenski, who has bipolar disorder.

Tierney confirmed in April 2008 that she would be leaving &quot;ER&quot; shortly after the beginning of the show&#x27;s fifteenth season. In October 2008, she made her final regular appearance on the series after nearly 10 seasons on the show. She returned to make a cameo appearance in one additional episode later in 2009 toward the end of the final season.

Tierney&#x27;s highest-profile film while being part of the &quot;ER&quot; cast was the 2002 film &quot;Insomnia&quot;, which was directed by Christopher Nolan. That same year, she also starred in &quot;Scotland, Pa.&quot; where she portrayed a Lady Macbeth–like character written specifically for her by Billy Morrissette, her husband at the time. She was praised by critics for her performance. She also collaborated with &quot;NewsRadio&quot; writer Joe Furey for a special &quot;Working with Joe Furey&quot; featurette for Furey&#x27;s film &quot;Love and Support&quot;.

In 2004, Tierney won the second-season tournament of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; against Lauren Graham, who had a guest role in the fourth season of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;. Tierney returned to the stage in May 2006 in an appearance opposite Eric McCormack in the Off-Broadway premiere of &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot;. She also appeared in the 2008 films &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;, &quot;Baby Mama&quot;, &quot;The Go-Getter&quot; and &quot;Finding Amanda&quot;. Tierney also played the role of Laurel in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Three Changes&quot; with Dylan McDermott from September 16 to October 4, 2008.

Tierney returned to television, playing the recurring character Kelly McPhee on &quot;Rescue Me&quot; in 2009 and 2011 during its final season. She replaced Joely Richardson as the female lead of &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; after Richardson left to spend more time with her family. Tierney&#x27;s role in the series, a legal drama produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, marked her return to television after recovering from breast surgery and cancer treatments. ABC canceled &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; after four episodes owing to low ratings.

In 2010, Tierney became a member of the New York City–based experimental theatre company The Wooster Group. She performed along with Frances McDormand in the Wooster Group&#x27;s 2010 remounting of &quot;North Atlantic&quot;, directed by Elizabeth LeCompte. From 2016 to 2019, she played the feminist Germaine Greer in &quot; The Town Hall Affair&quot;, also directed by LeCompte. Tierney herself conceived the idea for this play, which recreates a raucous debate on Women&#x27;s Liberation that Norman Mailer organized with prominent feminists in 1971.

In February 2011, Tierney made her debut at the Gate Theatre in the Dublin premiere of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;God of Carnage&quot; (translation by Christopher Hampton) alongside Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon. Also in 2011, Tierney appeared in one episode of &quot;The Office&quot; as Robert California&#x27;s wife.

In September 2012, Tierney began a recurring role on the legal drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, playing Maddie Hayward. The role included scenes with the show&#x27;s lead character Alicia Florrick, as played by Julianna Margulies; the two actors had previously worked together on &quot;ER&quot;, Margulies like Tierney having previously played a lead character on that show. In 2013, Tierney joined the cast of &quot;The Affair&quot;, playing Helen Solloway, for which she won the Golden Globe Award in 2016.

In 2018, Tierney co-starred with Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet in the dark family drama film &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, based on the memoir of the same name by David Sheff. In 2019, Tierney appeared in &quot;The Report&quot; as &quot;an intense, driven, somewhat vengeful Counterterrorism expert determined to get behind any program that promises to get the intel that will stop another attack from happening.&quot; Also in 2019, Tierney originated the lead role of Elizabeth in the West Coast premiere of Jen Silverman&#x27;s play &quot;Witch&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse, directed by Marti Lyons.

In March 2020, Tierney joined the cast of &quot;American Rust&quot;. In October 2020, Tierney joined the cast of &quot;Your Honor&quot;. 

In 2023, she appeared in Sean Durkin&#x27;s wrestling drama &quot;The Iron Claw&quot;. In 2024, she appeared in Lee Isaac Chung&#x27;s &quot;Twisters&quot;, a sequel to the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;. That same year, Tierney joined the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; for season 24, portraying a new lieutenant replacing Camryn Manheim.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Tierney met actor-director Billy Morrissette&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=bb4USQAACAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmovie/p50814&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/1247379|0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day he arrived in Los Angeles. They married on February 1, 1993. Morrissette directed, and both he and Tierney appear in, the 2001 film &quot;Scotland, PA&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mptvimages/49090&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She filed for divorce in 2006 due to irreconcilable differences.

On February 1, 2009, Tierney officiated at the wedding of her friend and former &quot;ER&quot; co-star Parminder Nagra to photographer James Stenson.

Tierney had surgery to remove a tumor from her breast in 2009. She had been cast in &quot;Parenthood&quot; but schedule conflicts with her cancer treatments led her to leave and she was replaced by Lauren Graham. Tierney finished treatment and returned to work in a stage play in 2010.

<doc id="431556" wikidata="Q4714124" url="?curid=431556" title="Alick Downer">
<text>Sir Alexander Russell &quot;Alick&quot; Downer (7 April 1910 – 30 March 1981) was an Australian politician and diplomat. He was a member of the House of Representatives between 1949 and 1963, representing the Liberal Party, and served as Minister for Immigration in the Menzies Government. He was later High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1972.

==Family, early life and career==
Downer was born in Adelaide as a member of the influential Downer family. His father, Sir John Downer, was a Premier of South Australia and a member of the Australian Senate and was 66-years old at the time of his birth; he died when Alick was aged five. His mother was Una Russell, daughter of Henry Chamberlain Russell, who remarried when Alick was eight, to D’Arcy Wentworth Addison. Sir Alick&#x27;s son, Alexander Downer, also a Liberal politician, was Leader of the Opposition in 1994–95 and Foreign Minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007, before becoming Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018, five decades after Alick held the same role.

He was educated at Geelong Grammar School and at the University of Oxford, where he graduated in economics and political science. He was the godfather of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Earl&#x27;s godmother was Queen Elizabeth II.

After graduating from Oxford in 1932 he read law in London, and in 1934 he was admitted to the bar at Inner Temple. Returning to Adelaide, he joined the South Australian Bar in 1935. He practised as a barrister until joining the Australian Army in 1940. He served in Malaya and was a prisoner-of-war for three years, where he set up a camp library and gave lessons to other prisoners. He was promoted to sergeant due to these efforts, but the promotion was not recognised upon his release.

His book &quot;Six prime ministers&quot; (Robert Menzies, John Gorton, Harold Holt, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough) was published in 1982.

==Political career==

After the war, Downer joined the newly formed Liberal Party of Australia, and in 1949 he was elected to the House of Representatives for the rural-based Division of Angas. By invitation of the premier, Thomas Playford, he joined the board of the Electricity Trust of South Australia for three years and the Art Gallery board where he remained for seventeen years until his appointment as High Commissioner. He served as Minister for Immigration from 1958 to 1963. One of his first acts was to oversee the passage of the &quot;Migration Act 1958&quot;, which replaced the earlier &quot;Immigration Restriction Act 1901&quot; that had formed the basis of the White Australia policy. During his term in office, reforms to migration laws led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly from Britain and Europe, where new recruitment posts had been created. Many refugees were also accepted. As a result of his experience as a prisoner of war, he arranged for non-criminal deportees to be held in detention centres instead of being sent to jail.

==Diplomatic career==
He retired from Parliament upon his appointment as Australian High Commissioner in London, a position he held until 1972. The building of the High Commission, Australia House, has a Downer Room on the first floor, named in his honour. Downer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1965 Birthday Honours. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1965.

Downer actively lobbied both the prime minister, William McMahon, and the British government directly, for a peerage of the UK Parliament. McMahon wrote to 10 Downing Street with a proposal, but it was declined. Downer was reportedly &quot;very bitter&quot; about this rejection.

==Personal life==
On 23 April 1947, he married Mary Gosse, daughter of Sir James Gosse, whom he had met at a cocktail party in Adelaide. Together they had four children, Stella Mary (born 1948), Angela (born 1949), Alexander Downer (born 1951), who would later serve as the leader of the Liberal Party (1994 to 1995) and Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Howard government, and Una Joanna (born 1955).

==Arbury Park==
In 1932, Downer bought the property known as Raywood in the Adelaide Hills, which he renamed Arbury Park after Arbury Hall, near Nuneaton, Warwickshire where his friends the Newdigate family lived. He was responsible for the construction of the large Georgian mansion and extensive formal gardens and deer park, &quot;which was important to his concept of the property as an English estate&quot;. The property, after reversion to its former name when bought by the state government in 1965, is heritage-listed.

<doc id="431562" wikidata="Q726294" url="?curid=431562" title="Almost Famous">
<text>Almost Famous is a 2000 American comedy drama film written and directed by Cameron Crowe, starring Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It tells the story of a teenage journalist, played by Fugit, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in the early 1970s, touring with the fictitious rock band Stillwater, and writing his first cover story on the band. The film is semi-autobiographical, as Crowe himself was a teenage writer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Despite the film performing poorly in theatres, grossing $47.4 million against a $60 million budget, it received widespread acclaim from critics and received four Academy Award nominations, including a win for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Roger Ebert hailed it as the best film of the year and the ninth-best film of the 2000s. It won two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Hudson).

It has since become a cult classic and, in a 2016 international poll conducted by the BBC, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; was ranked the 79th greatest film since 2000. In a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; 2014 list voted on by &quot;studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty&quot;, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; was ranked the 71st greatest film of all time. A stage musical adaptation of the film opened on Broadway in November 2022.

== Plot ==

In San Diego 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed college-professor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strong-willed Elaine&#x27;s strict ban on rock music and her fear of pop culture have a lasting effect on her children, finally driving William&#x27;s 18-year-old sister Anita to move to San Francisco and become a flight attendant.

Four years later in 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anita&#x27;s secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in San Diego. Rock journalist Lester Bangs, impressed with William&#x27;s writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a Black Sabbath concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran groupie Penny Lane, who has taken him under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny insists she and her friends are &quot;band aids&quot;, a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves.

On seeing William&#x27;s article on Black Sabbath, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Ben Fong-Torres hires him to write an article about Stillwater and sends him on the road with the band aboard &quot;Doris&quot;, Stillwater&#x27;s aging but beloved bus. William interviews the other band members, but Russell avoids him. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe become evident when the band&#x27;s first T-shirt is produced, featuring Russell in full view while the rest of the band is in the shadows. William is jokingly called &quot;the enemy&quot; by the band as he is a journalist, but he gradually begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle.

The record label hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell&#x27;s girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three protégée band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalantly but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.

Penny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where William reveals to them that they are to be featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Penny is asked to leave after her attempts to get Russell&#x27;s attention are noticed. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on quaaludes.

Flying to a gig the following day, the plane encounters severe weather. Fearing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russell&#x27;s long-simmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in Tupelo, leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.

William arrives at the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says his perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to &quot;be honest... and unmerciful.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s editors rave over William&#x27;s completed article, but Russell lies to the magazine&#x27;s fact-checker, claiming most of it is false. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to San Diego, where their mother Elaine is glad to see them both.

Sapphire, one of the protégée &quot;Band Aids&quot;, chastises Russell for betraying William. He then calls Penny, wanting to meet with her, but she tricks him by giving him William&#x27;s address instead of her own. He arrives and finds himself face to face with William&#x27;s mother who, during the tour, scolded him over the phone for his behavior. He apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell verifies the article to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to go to Morocco while Stillwater tours again by bus.
== Cast ==
== Production ==
Cameron Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to create Stillwater, the emerging group that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. &quot;Stillwater&quot; was the name of a real band signed to Macon, Georgia&#x27;s Capricorn Records label, which required the film&#x27;s producers to obtain permission to use the name. In an interview, real Stillwater guitarist Bobby Golden said, &quot;They could have probably done it without permission but they probably would have had a bunch of different lawsuits. Our lawyer got in touch with them. They wanted us to do it for free and I said, &#x27;No we&#x27;re not doing it for free.&#x27; So we got a little bit of change out of it.&quot; Seventies rocker Peter Frampton served as a technical consultant on the film. Crowe and his then-wife, musician Nancy Wilson of Heart, co-wrote three of the five Stillwater songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs.

Patrick Fugit, then &quot;a complete unknown from Salt Lake City, Utah&quot;, was cast late in the process after Crowe and casting director Gail Levin watched Fugit&#x27;s self-taped audition.

The character of Russell Hammond was originally set to be played by Brad Pitt. But during rehearsal prior to filming, Crowe and Pitt mutually decided that it was &quot;not the right fit&quot;, and Pitt dropped out of the project. The line &quot;I am a golden god!&quot; in the pool-jumping sequence, as well as numerous references to Russell Hammond being unusually good looking, were written for Pitt, but remained in the script after Billy Crudup was cast. In a 2020 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Crowe confirmed that the &quot;golden god&quot; scene was inspired by Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant, who had uttered the quote on a &quot;Riot House&quot; balcony.

Jack Black and Jon Favreau auditioned for the role of Lester Bangs.

Crowe based the character of Penny Lane on the real-life Pennie Lane Trumbull and her group of female promoters who called themselves the &quot;Flying Garter Girls Group&quot;. Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe&#x27;s inspiration, for instance Pamela Des Barres and Bebe Buell. Sarah Polley was originally cast as Penny Lane, but, when Brad Pitt dropped out, she dropped out as well and was replaced with Kate Hudson. Natalie Portman was also considered.

The character of William Miller&#x27;s mother (played by Frances McDormand) was based on Crowe&#x27;s own mother, who even showed up on the set to keep an eye on him while he worked. Although he asked his mother not to bother McDormand, the two women ended up getting along well. Meryl Streep was also considered for the role.

Alice in Chains&#x27; guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell was Crowe&#x27;s first choice for the role of Stillwater bass player Larry Fellows. Cantrell is friends with Crowe and had previously appeared in two films directed by him, &quot;Singles&quot; (1992) and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). Cantrell was busy writing the songs for his solo album &quot;Degradation Trip&quot; and had to turn the role down. Mark Kozelek was cast instead.

Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Plant. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use &quot;Kashmir&quot; in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982)—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; for an intended scene (on the special &quot;Bootleg&quot; edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra, sans the song, where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it).

In his 2012 memoir &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, Gregg Allman writes that several aspects of the movie are based on Crowe&#x27;s time spent with the Allman Brothers Band. The scene in which Russell jumps from the top of the Topeka party house into a pool was based on something Duane Allman did: &quot;the jumping off the roof into the pool, that was Duane—from the third floor of a place called the Travelodge in San Francisco. My brother wanted to do it again, but the cat who owned the place came out shaking his fist, yelling at him. We told that story all the time, and I have no doubt that Cameron was around for it.&quot; He also confirms that he and Dickey Betts played a joke on Crowe by claiming clauses in their contract did not allow his story to be published—just before he was to deliver it to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

The airplane malfunction &quot;near Tupelo, Mississippi&quot; that occurred in the film is a thinly veiled reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd airplane crash on October 20, 1977.

Filming of the movie lasted 92 days.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===

It was subsequently given a limited release on September 15, 2000, in 131 theaters where it grossed $2.3 million on its first weekend. It was given a wider release on September 22, 2000, in 1,193 theaters where it grossed $6.9 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $31.7 million in North America and $14.8 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $47.4 million against a $60 million budget.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Almost Famous&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 91% approval rating, based on 227 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Almost Famous&quot;, with its great ensemble performances and story, is a well-crafted, warm-hearted movie that successfully draws you into its era.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, naming it the best film of 2000, and described it as &quot;funny and touching in so many different ways.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.O. Scott wrote, &quot;The movie&#x27;s real pleasures are to be found not in its story but in its profusion of funny, offbeat scenes. It&#x27;s the kind of picture that invites you to go back and savor your favorite moments like choice album cuts.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; praised the film&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;giving each character his reasons, making everyone in the emotional debate charming and compelling, creating fictional people who breathe in a story with an organic life.&quot; In her review for the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, Manohla Dargis wrote that &quot;the film shimmers with the irresistible pleasures that define Hollywood at its best—it&#x27;s polished like glass, funny, knowing and bright, and filled with characters whose lives are invariably sexier and more purposeful than our own.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Not since &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; has a movie caught the thrumming exuberance of going where the music takes you.&quot; In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;Character-driven, it relies on chemistry, camaraderie, a sharp eye for detail and good casting.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Every Cameron Crowe film is, in one way or another, about romance, rock &amp; roll, and his romance with rock &amp; roll. This power ballad of a movie, from 2000, also happens to be Crowe&#x27;s greatest (and most personal) film thanks to the golden gods of Stillwater and their biggest fan, Kate Hudson&#x27;s incomparable Penny Lane.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Crowe for depicting the 1970s as &quot;an era that found its purpose in having no purpose. Crowe, staying close to his memories, has gotten it, for perhaps the first time, onto the screen.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan praised Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s portrayal of Lester Bangs: &quot;Superbly played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, more and more the most gifted and inspired character actor working in film, what could have been the clichéd portrait of an older mentor who speaks the straight truth blossoms into a marvelous personality.&quot; However, in his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris felt that &quot;none of the non-musical components on the screen matched the excitement of the music. For whatever reason, too much of the dark side has been left out.&quot; Desson Howe, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, found it &quot;very hard to see these long-haired kids as products of the 1970s instead of dressed up actors from the Seattle-Starbucks era. I couldn&#x27;t help wondering how many of these performers had to buy a CD copy of the song and study it for the first time.&quot;

=== Publication of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article ===
In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published the article “Stillwater Runs Deep!” by William Miller, backdated to August 30, 1973.

<doc id="431570" wikidata="Q842258" url="?curid=431570" title="Ford Ka">
<text>The Ford Ka is a small car manufactured by Ford Motor Company from 1996 to 2016 as a city car and from 2014 to 2021 as a subcompact car. It entered its second generation in 2008, produced by Fiat in Tychy, Poland. A third generation was introduced in 2016.

The first two generations have a three-door hatchback body style, with the first generation also having a two-door convertible version that was marketed as the StreetKa and a sporty hatch version, the SportKa. The third generation was produced as a five-door hatchback and as a four-door sedan. It was initially only available in Brazil, and later was introduced in India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, South Africa (where it was marketed as the Ford Figo), Argentina, and Poland. European sales ended in 2020, and in 2021 was taken out of production in Brazil.

==Pronunciation==
The name Ka has three possible pronunciations. It can be said using a long or short &quot;a&quot; (, ), or with the letters pronounced separately (). Ford&#x27;s press office has used all three. According to &quot;Auto Trader&quot;, Ford &quot;top brass&quot; have given the correct pronunciation as &quot;Ka as in cat&quot; ().

==First generation (BE146; 1996)==

The car was introduced on September 11, 1996, as a small and low-cost addition to the Ford range. Developed under the BE146 development code, it was based on the Mark 3 Ford Fiesta platform, but with a completely different exterior design. The design borrowed from Ghia&#x27;s &quot;Saetta&quot; show car, a roadster designed by Filippo Sapino. The Ka evolved from concept vehicles to production with minor changes. The large, one-piece, moulded bumpers and wheel arches made the vehicle more durable and easier to repair. The vehicle was manufactured on the existing Fiesta production line in Almussafes, Valencia, minimising new model investment costs. The chief program engineer was Kevin O’Neill. The designer of the car was Chris Svensson of Sunderland, who had designed a similar-shaped car when at the Royal College of Art in 1992.

When the Ka was first introduced to the public, it provoked mixed reactions due to its unusual New Edge design, overseen by Jack Telnack and executed by Claude Lobo.

Besides the styling, the Ka, like its sister cars Fiesta and Puma, was lauded in the motoring press for its handling. Under Richard Parry-Jones&#x27; supervision, the suspension and steering settings allowed for hard cornering and high levels of grip, providing strong handling characteristics.

At launch, the Ka was produced as a single model with a number of production options, including air conditioning, power steering, height-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, adjustable position rear seat with head restraints, passenger airbag, central locking, and power windows. An anti-lock braking system option was added in January 1997.

The car&#x27;s main drawback was the 1,300 cc overhead valve four-cylinder Endura-E engine, a derivative of the Valencia unit used in all the previous generations of the Fiesta and based on the older &quot;Kent&quot; design, which dated back to the 1960s. Although not very modern, it provided enough torque to allow relaxed if not spirited driving. In 2002, the Endura-E was replaced by the overhead-cam Duratec engine, with claims of improved fuel efficiency and increased refinement, mostly caused by taller gearing on the cars without air conditioning.

=== Endura-E engine specs (Ka) ===
998 cc (Brazil):
* Power output - 53HP (5250 rpm)
* Torque - 77.2 Nm (4000 rpm)
* Bore - 68.68mm
* Stroke - 67.40mm
* Redline - 5450 rpm
* RPM Limit - 5675 rpm

1297 cc:
* Power output - 60HP (5000 rpm)
* Torque - 104.0 Nm (3500 rpm)
* Bore - 74mm
* Stroke - 75.5mm
* Redline - 5450 rpm
* RPM Limit - 5675 rpm

For the first three years of production, all models had black plastic bumpers to minimise parking damage to paintwork in city environments. These bumpers contained a stabiliser to prevent UV degradation, which made them unsuitable for painting because the paint would not adhere properly. Since many owners wanted body-coloured bumpers, they were introduced in 1999 using different bumper mouldings (without the stabiliser).

The Ka proved highly profitable for Ford despite its low selling price, largely due to low development costs. In 2006, Ford sold 17,000 cars in the United Kingdom. 
In Australia, the Ka was introduced in October 1999 and was on the market until 2002. It was unsuccessful; fewer than 2,000 were sold per year. This was partly due to the lack of an automatic transmission, which is preferred by a large proportion of Australian car buyers. The Ka was also sold in New Zealand between 1999 and 2004, and was replaced by the newer Fiesta.

=== Markets ===

==== United Kingdom ====
The Ka was the best-selling car in its class in the United Kingdom for a number of years and commanded around a fifth of the city-car market. The UK model range originally consisted of the base version, the Ka, and the higher specification Ka2, which standardised a number of the options listed above. The Ka2 badge was fitted by dealers. The Ka3 was introduced later. Power steering was added to the base Ka after the first year.

Concurrent with the introduction of body-coloured bumpers, Ka2 and Ka3 were replaced by Ka Collection and the LuxuryKa (later Ka Luxury).

The Luxury version came with a Quickclear heated windscreen, leather seats and interior trim, and standard air conditioning. A &quot;Ka Blue&quot; special edition was also launched in the UK with dark blue bumpers and a silvery-blue dashboard insert, rather than the standard models&#x27; silver. The Ka Sun Collection with a full-length fabric folding roof was also added to the range during the summer.

Unique to the UK was the Ford Ka Van variant, produced for BT Group and featuring a bespoke flat plywood floor with rubber overmat and white-ply covers instead of rear windows.

A further line-up revision gave Ka the following trim levels in the United Kingdom: Studio, Style, Style Climate, and Zetec Climate. In 2005, the Sublime model was introduced featuring special leather interior and features not found on other models. It was produced in only very small numbers and is now one of the most sought-after Kas. The SportKa was also added to the range. With the car&#x27;s impending replacement, in May 2008, a Finale special edition with distinguishing features such as roof decal and black wing mirrors was made available.

==== Latin America ====
From the 1997 launch, and until 2001, the Latin American Ka was substantially similar to the European Ka, differing only in levels of equipment and trim. The main differences from the European model were the very short gearing for the manual transmission (the only transmission available) and the lack of soundproofing, which had been gradually removed annually since 2000 as a way to cut down costs, following the practice of other Brazilian car makers at the time.

In 2001, the Latin American Ka received a midcycle facelift, which left it slightly different, externally, to the European model. The most noticeable difference was at the rear, where the number plate was moved from the bumper to the boot (trunk) lid, and the rear lights were made much taller.

===StreetKa and SportKa===
In 2003, the Ka brand was diversified, with the addition of a new SportKa featuring a sporty body kit, wider track with stiffened suspension and redesigned 16&quot; (40 cm) alloy wheels. Both models came with slightly widened bumpers front and rear with integral fog lamps. A convertible model called StreetKa also appeared, launched with the help of Australian pop star Kylie Minogue at the Paris Motor Show. It featured a manually folding soft top or an optional detachable hardtop (on the Winter Edition).

StreetKa was designed and built by Pininfarina (the 2000 motor show concept was designed by Ghia, Turin) in Italy, and all StreetKas have sill plates inscribed &quot;Pininfarina&quot;. Pininfarina produced 37,076 StreetKas between 2003 and 2005. The build quality of the Streetka was far superior to the standard three-door Ka, with improved rust proofing.

StreetKa came in two equipment levels, basic and luxury. The Basic had cloth seats and air conditioning was an option. The Luxury featured leather seats with matching leather door-card inserts, heated seats, a Thatcham approved alarm along with Ford&#x27;s PATS immobiliser, air conditioning, and heated door mirrors. Options included upgrading the single CD/radio to an in-dash six-disc CD/radio and additional rear speakers beneath the rollover bars and a heated windscreen, standard on winter models. All models featured remote-control central locking with remote boot release, driver and passenger air bags with passengers air bag deactivation, electric windows and door mirrors, electric headlight aim adjustment, antilock brakes, power steering, front fog lights, racing Puma aluminium gear knob, electric hood cover release, and a tachometer.

The engine used in StreetKa (and SportKa) is called a Duratec, but it is of South American origin, where it is known as the Zetec Rocam. StreetKa features MacPherson struts front and rear and uses unique wider front lower arms (wishbones), giving it exceptional handling. 
The only exterior panel shared with Ka is the bonnet. The front headlights are also shared with Ka, but appear different due to the front bumper covering them partly to change their shape. The interior shares most parts with Ka, except the StreetKa has its facia painted blue rather than silver. Its seats are mounted lower than Ka&#x27;s and it has aluminium effect detailing.

Both the StreetKa and SportKa received a new 1.6-litre eight-valve Duratec petrol engine, whereas Ka, Ka Collection, and LuxuryKa retained the 1.3-litre Duratec petrol engine. The SportKa was noted for its surprising advertising campaign, &quot;The Ka&#x27;s Evil Twin&quot;, denouncing the Ka&#x27;s traditionally perceived &quot;cute&quot; design. The StreetKa ceased to be officially on sale in late 2006.

A pink version was produced to promote the 2004 &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; film, and was supplied by Ford to the movie producer. The &quot;Thunderbird&quot; movie cars were unveiled at the Birmingham Motor Show. Only eight Pink StreetKas were produced by Ford for the film, five in right-hand drive and three in left-hand drive. All were signed by Sophia Myles (Miss Lady Penelope). The matching StreetKa dress designed by Bruce Oldfield of Ford was later sold in an auction during London Fashion Week to raise money for Barnados.

In 2005, all Ka models, including the SportKa and StreetKa, received a slightly updated interior, bringing the cabin back up to date, while still retaining the look and feel of the original. The SportKa continued to be available until 2008.

===Motorsport===
A Ford Ka rally championship was created in 1998. It has proved to be one of the most popular junior rally championships (Ford Ka Rally Cup) in the UK and Ireland. In 2007, Luke Pinder won the BRC Silverstone Tyre 1400 Championship in a Chris Birkbeck Ford Ka.

A Series based on Ford KA Mk1 1300cc (produced between 2002 and 2008) exists in UK as EnduroKA

====Ka Rally Car====
Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) works at Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was designed as an entry-level vehicle to compete in a one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 had just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998, 15 competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford&#x27;s Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine mounts and suspension bushes are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium sump and fuel tank guards, OZ Rally wheels, and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it, competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside, the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion, gone are all but the essentials - the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard, which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply dished rally steering wheel, competition seats, and harnesses are all supplied from the kit, and replacements are not allowed.
==Second generation (2008)==

=== European version (B420) ===

In 2008, the European Ka was replaced with a model developed and produced for Ford by Fiat in conjunction with Fiat&#x27;s own 500 vehicle. The car was built in Fiat&#x27;s Tychy, Poland, factory alongside the Fiat 500, Fiat Panda, and Lancia Ypsilon. Production started on 18 July 2008.

Based on the Fiat 500 architecture, its interior offers optional Bluetooth phone connection, wireless voice control, a USB port, a CD Radio, MP3, an AUX connector, steering-wheel audio controls, and a speaker system consisting of six speakers, a subwoofer, and an amplifier.

The second-generation Ka came with a choice of two engines, a 1.2-litre petrol with of power and of torque and a 1.3-litre TDCi diesel engine with of power and of torque. Both engines come with sub-120 g/km CO2 emissions (119 for the petrol and 112 for the diesel). Both engines are supplied from Fiat.

The Ka featured shock absorption revised from the Fiat 500 along with a rear antiroll bar enabling 30% softer springs and accordingly retuned dampers to improve ride performance over uneven road surfaces. Some of these improvements were subsequently adopted on Fiat 500 Abarth and Fiat 500C models. The Ka uses an electrically assisted steering system, which makes the steering much lighter and more energy efficient than its predecessor.

The second-generation Ka has an overall Euro NCAP safety rating of four stars, with standard driver and passenger single-stage front airbags, ABS, immobiliser, hazard warning lights, and remote central locking (except Studio version in UK). In addition, it has front side airbags and curtain airbags and electronic stability control with hydraulic brake assist and hill launch assist that come at an extra cost.

The Ka made its debut in the 22nd James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; and was unveiled in October 2008&#x27;s Paris Motor Show.

Production ended on 20 May 2016.

==== Ka Individual ====

Three &quot;Ford Individual packs&quot; were introduced with special characteristics each (in both the interior and exterior design), called Tattoo, Grand Prix, and Digital. the Tattoo was replaced in 2011 by the Metal. All Individual models are based on the Zetec.

=== Latin American version (B402) ===
The Latin American market received a separate model, which is based on the first-generation Ka chassis with redesigned exterior and interior design, adopting Ford&#x27;s &quot;Kinetic Design&quot;. It was introduced in December 2007 in Brazil, and went on sale in early January 2008 as a 2009 model year. The car was also exported to other markets in Latin America. However, it was not available in Mexico.

Developed under the B402 project code, the model was designed and engineered in Brazil. During development, 123 test prototypes were used, and involving 5,145 engineering tests and 430,000 km of durability tests. In the manufacturing plant at São Bernardo do Campo, the project included the replacement of 160 robots in the assembly line, as well as measuring machines and test stations.

In comparison to the original Ka, this model has a longer rear overhang and a redesigned rear seat to accommodate a fifth passenger. With a length of , it competed in the subcompact car class. The boot capacity was increased from the previous generation 186 liters to a 263 liters.

It was available with 1.0-litre and 1.6-litre Zetec Rocam petrol flex engines, both are four-cylinder units. The 1.0-litre engine produces with petrol fuel and with ethanol fuel, while the 1.6-litre engine produces with petrol fuel and with ethanol fuel.

In 2011, Ford presented a mid-cycle facelifted version following the Kinect concept car. In Brazil, only the Sport version offers a 1.6-litre engine.

==== Safety ====
The Ka in its most basic Latin American market configuration with no airbags received 1 star for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2011.
== Third generation (B562; 2014) ==

Developed by Ford Brazil, the Ford Ka Concept was unveiled in Brazil in November 2013. The production version of this new Ford Ka appeared in July 2014, in hatchback and sedan body styles, with the first units arriving in Brazil in September and October 2014 respectively. The next market where it was launched was India, where the sedan made its debut as the new Ford Figo Aspire in August 2015, with the hatchback arriving (as the new Ford Figo) a month later. It was launched in Europe (as the Ka+) in June 2016.

The new model was based on Ford&#x27;s global B platform, sharing its underpinnings with the Fiesta supermini, and embodies Ford&#x27;s Kinetic 2.0 design theme. The hatchback is a five-door only model and it is now longer than the previous European model, with the wheelbase increased by . The four-door sedan has the same wheelbase as the hatchback, but two length variants: a longer one in Brazil (dubbed Ka+), measuring , and a shorter one exclusively in India (dubbed Aspire), measuring .

In India, the range consists of either a 1.2-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing and , a 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel, developing and , or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing and . The latter is paired with Ford&#x27;s six-speed automatic PowerShift transmission, while for the rest a five-speed manual option is available.

It features equipment such as the Ford&#x27;s MyKey, MyDock, and SYNC systems, steering-mounted controls, automatic climate control, power-fold mirrors, keyless entry, electronic stability control, cruise control (in Europe), up to six airbags and high-strength steel body structure.

It was then launched in Mexico in September 2015, and in South Africa one month later. In March 2016, it was also introduced in Argentina.

The new Ka was produced at Ford&#x27;s factories in Camaçari, Brazil, (from where it is exported to Argentina) until January 13, 2021, and in Sanand, Gujarat, India, (from where it was exported to Mexico, South Africa and Europe).

The Ka+ was discontinued in Europe in September 2019.

=== Markets ===

==== Europe ====
The third-generation Ka was marketed in Europe as the Ka+. It was introduced in June 2016, with deliveries starting later that year. The &#x27;+&#x27; in the name shows the fact how Ford sees this as a budget B-segment car, rather than an A-segment car.

In Europe, the Ka+ came with only one engine, a 1.2-litre unit, that came with either , in the Studio or the Zetec trim levels, or , exclusively in the Zetec model.

==== Latin America ====
The new Ford Ka was introduced in the 2014 São Paulo Motor Show, becoming available on the market in August of that year and presented at the 2015 Buenos Aires Motor Show. The Ford Ka adopts the &quot;Kinetic&quot; design, presenting a more aggressive style, and it is slightly bigger than the previous model, adopting a five-door body, occupying the site of the former Ford Ka and Ford Fiesta One.

Also it adds a new body variant, a four-door sedan, called Ka+. In Brazil, it was offered with a choice of two petrol engines - a 1.0-litre three-cylinder, developing and or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder, developing and . Gearbox options are limited to the well-known five-speed IB5+ for both the 1.0- and the 1.5-litre variants.

According to local press, the current 1.0 L version of the new 2014 Ka is the most economical compact car without a turbocharged engine, achieving up to 12 km/L of ethanol (E100) in the city of São Paulo. E33 fuel (Brazilian standard gasoline specification) economy facts had not been publicized, although owners claim it does about 1.0 to 2.5 km/L more than with E100.

Its Sigma 1.5 L-equipped version had been well received by the Brazilian market due to its relatively vigorous launches and good torque at low and midrange engine speeds.

===Safety===
In November 2015, a Ka+ model in its most basic Latin American market configuration with two standard front airbags and standard anti-lock braking system with electronic brakeforce distribution was tested by Latin NCAP and was awarded four stars out of five for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers. In a frontal impact,the driver&#x27;s head and chest were considered to receive adequate protection, the passenger&#x27;s head and chest received good protection, while the driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s knee areas received marginal protection. The bodyshell was rated as stable and was capable of withstanding further loading.

The Ka+ in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 2 airbags and no ESC received 0 stars for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2017 (one level above 2015).

The updated Ka+ in its most basic Latin American market configuration and no ESC received 3 stars for adult occupants and 4 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2018.

The Ka+ in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 2 airbags, driver pretensioner and no ESC received 0 stars from Latin NCAP under its new protocol in 2020 (one level above 2018, similar to Euro NCAP 2014).

In March 2017, Euro NCAP released the results of the tests performed on the Ka+ in its standard European market configuration and it scored three out of five stars. For the adult occupants, it received a 73% rating, for the child occupant, a 61% rating, for the pedestrian, a 57% rating, and the safety assist category, a 29% rating. The car&#x27;s performance in the tests was rated as &quot;mediocre&quot;, being criticized for lacking rear seatbelt pretensioners and load limiters, poor chest protection in the full-width frontal crash test, and the lack of autonomous braking technology.
== UK Advertising controversy ==
In September 2003, Ogilvy &amp; Mather created two advertisements for the Internet to advertise the Ford SportKa in the UK, which proved controversial when they received complaints for their content. Both commercials concluded with the graphic, &quot;Ford SportKa. The Ka&#x27;s evil twin.&quot;

The first commercial included a parked SportKa as a pigeon flies toward it, presumably to befoul it. When the pigeon is within range, the SportKa violently pops its bonnet, bashing the bird to its death. Despite receiving complaints from the Royal Pigeon Racing Association, Ford refused to take the ad down.

The second advertisement proved to be more controversial. It had the SportKa opening its sunroof as if enticing a nearby cat to peer in. When the cat climbed on the roof and peeked inside, the sunroof closed and beheaded the cat. This advert was not included in the initial campaign, but ended up being leaked on 1 April 2004, sparking controversy worldwide. Ford apologized for the advert, claiming it was not sanctioned by them or the agency; by the time the advert was leaked, the original &quot;Evil Twin&quot; website was no longer operating.

<doc id="431572" wikidata="Q357126" url="?curid=431572" title="Andy Goldsworthy">
<text>Andy Goldsworthy (born 25 July 1956) is an English sculptor, photographer, and environmentalist who produces site-specific sculptures and land art situated in natural or urban settings.

==Early life==
Goldsworthy was born in Cheshire on 25 July 1956, the son of Muriel (née Stanger) and F. Allin Goldsworthy (1929–2001), a former professor of applied mathematics at the University of Leeds. He grew up on the Harrogate side of Leeds. From the age of 13, he worked on farms as a labourer. He has likened the repetitive quality of farm tasks to the routine of making sculpture: &quot;A lot of my work is like picking potatoes; you have to get into the rhythm of it.&quot; He studied fine art at Bradford College of Art from 1974 to 1975 and at Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire) from 1975 to 1978, receiving his BA from the latter.

==Career==
===History===

After leaving college, Goldsworthy lived in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria. He moved to Scotland in 1985, first living in Langholm and then settling a year later in Penpont, where he still resides. It has been said that his gradual drift northwards was &quot;due to a way of life over which he did not have complete control&quot;, but that contributing factors were opportunities and desires to work in these areas and &quot;reasons of economy&quot;.

In 1993, Goldsworthy received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford. He was an A.D. White Professor-At-Large in Sculpture at Cornell University 2000–2006 and 2006–2008.

In 2003, Goldsworthy produced a commissioned work for the entry courtyard of San Francisco&#x27;s de Young Museum called &quot;Drawn Stone&quot;, which echoes San Francisco&#x27;s frequent earthquakes and their effects. His installation included a giant crack in the pavement that broke off into smaller cracks, and broken limestone, which could be used for benches. The smaller cracks were made with a hammer adding unpredictability to the work as he created it.

===Art process===
The materials used in Goldsworthy&#x27;s art often include brightly coloured flowers, icicles, leaves, mud, pinecones, snow, stone, twigs, and thorns. He has been quoted as saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s incredibly brave to be working with flowers and leaves and petals. But I have to: I can&#x27;t edit the materials I work with. My remit is to work with nature as a whole.&quot;

Rather than interfering in natural processes, his work magnifies existing ones through deliberately minimal intervention in the landscape. Goldsworthy has said &quot;I am reluctant to carve into or break off solid living rock...I feel a difference between large, deep rooted stones and the debris lying at the foot of a cliff, pebbles on a beach...These are loose and unsettled, as if on a journey, and I can work with them in ways I couldn&#x27;t with a long resting stone.&quot; Goldsworthy&#x27;s commitment to working with available natural materials injects an inherent scarcity and contingency into the work.

In contrast to other artists who work with the land, most of Goldsworthy&#x27;s works are small in scale and temporary in their installation. For these ephemeral works, Goldsworthy often uses only his bare hands, teeth, and found tools to prepare and arrange the materials. His process reveals a preoccupation with temporality and a specific attention to materials which visibly age and decay, a view which stands in contrast to monumentalism in Land Art.

For his permanent sculptures like &quot;Roof&quot;, &quot;Stone River&quot; and &quot;Three Cairns&quot;, &quot;Moonlit Path&quot; (Petworth, West Sussex, 2002) and &quot;Chalk Stones&quot; in the South Downs, near West Dean, West Sussex he has employed the use of machine tools. To create &quot;Roof&quot;, Goldsworthy worked with his assistant and five British dry-stone wallers, who were used to make sure the structure could withstand time and nature.

Goldsworthy is generally considered the founder of modern rock balancing.

===Photography===
Photography plays a crucial role in his art due to its often ephemeral and transient state. Photographs (made primarily by Goldsworthy himself) of site-specific, environmental works allow them to be shared without severing important ties to place. According to Goldsworthy, &quot;Each work grows, stays, decays – integral parts of a cycle which the photograph shows at its heights, marking the moment when the work is most alive. There is an intensity about a work at its peak that I hope is expressed in the image. Process and decay are implicit.&quot;

Photography aids Goldsworthy in understanding his works, as much as in communicating them to an audience. He has said, &quot;Photography is my way of talking, writing and thinking about my art. It makes me aware of connections and developments that might have not otherwise have been apparent. It is the visual evidence which runs through my art as a whole and gives me a broader, more distant view of what I am doing.&quot;

===Documentary films on Goldsworthy===
Goldsworthy is the subject of a 2001 documentary feature film called &quot;Rivers and Tides&quot;, directed by German director Thomas Riedelsheimer. In 2018, Riedelsheimer released a second documentary on Goldsworthy titled &quot;Leaning Into the Wind&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Goldsworthy married Judith Gregson; they had four children together before separating. He now lives in the Scottish village of Penpont with his girlfriend, Tina Fiske, an art historian.

<doc id="431576" wikidata="Q340069" url="?curid=431576" title="Processional giant">
<text>Processional giants are costumed figures in European folklore, particularly present in Belgian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and English folkloric processions. The main feature of these figures is typically their wooden, papier maché or -more recently- synthetic resin head, whilst bodies are covered in clothing matching the costume&#x27;s theme.

Since 2008, Belgian and French processional giants have been recognised as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, as part of the binational listing of &#x27;Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France&#x27;.

==Background==
The processional giant is a gigantic costumed figure that represents a fictitious or real being. Inherited from medieval rites, tradition has it that it is carried, and that it dances in the streets during processions or festivals. Its physiognomy and size are variable, and its name-giving varies according to the regions; among the Flemings, it is known by the name of &quot;reus&quot; (plural: &quot;reuzen&quot;), among the Picards it is called &quot;gayant&quot;. The large biblical figures in the procession also served the purpose of catechising a largely illiterate population.

The first registered date for the &quot;gigantones e cabeçudos&quot; is the Corpus Christi festivity in Évora, Portugal, back in 1265. It included the snake, the demon and the dragon which represented the challenges that Jesus Christ had to defeat. In Spain, the first written references in novels date from 1276 in Pamplona (Navarra) with three giants representing three people from Pamplona: Pero-Suciales (woodcutter), Mari-Suciales (villager) and Jucef-Lacurari (Jew).

==Regional traditions==

===Belgium===
Belgium has nearly 1500 giants on its soil. Their appearance dates back to the 15th century; Goliath of Nivelles, which is mentioned as early as 1457, is the oldest known Belgian giant. Belgium also has the largest giant in Europe; Jean Turpin of Nieuwpoort, which exceeds .

The Belgian cultural heritage includes the following events:
* Ducasse d&#x27;Ath
* Ducasse de Mons
* Meyboom of Brussels
* Ommegang van Appels
* Ommegang van Dendermonde
* Ommegang van Lier
* Ommegang van Mechelen
* Reuzenstoet of Borgerhout

The giant is one of the symbols of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. It is the object of ancestral cultural practices that are still kept alive. Present at regional festivals and events, he represents the northern community.

The region currently has more than 450 giants, spread over the whole territory. There are nevertheless more dynamic intra-regional zones, located around central points. The Flemish part of the region is a land of giants; each city has one or more of them. Examples include Reuze Papa and Reuze Maman of Cassel, Tisje Tasje of Hazebrouck, Jean de Bûcheron and La Belle Hélène in Steenvoorde, and Totor of Steenwerck. In the South, in the Languedoc region, there is the Pézenas colt, and in the Provence, the tarasque of Tarascon (Bouches-du-Rhône).

* Cassel: Reuze Papa and Reuze Maman
* Douai: Gayant, Marie Cagenon, Fillon, Jacquot, Binbin
* Pézenas: le Poulain
* Tarascon: la Tarasque

====&quot;Gigantes&quot;====
The giants are usually hollow figures several meters tall, with a painted paper maché head and arms, the rest of the body being covered in cloth and other clothing. Their frame is usually made of wood or aluminium, with carton-pierre—a mixture of papier-mâché and plaster of paris—used to make the head and hands. The frame of the body is hidden by cloth, and the arms typically have no structural element to allow them to swing in the air when the giant is turned.

Within the frame is an individual controlling the giant. He carries a harness on his shoulder that is linked to the internal structure, and will move and shake the giant in a dance, usually accompanied by a local marching band. Typically, these dances will include at least two giants, the male &quot;gigante&quot; and the female giantess, called &quot;giganta&quot; or &quot;gigantona&quot;, though some towns have multiple couples. Badalona for example has two couples of giants.

The figures usually depict archetypes of the town, such as the bourgeois and the peasant woman, or historical figures of local relevance, such as a founding king and queen, or pairs of Moorish and Christian nobles.

====&quot;Cabezudos&quot;====
&quot;Cabezudos&quot; are smaller figures, usually to the human scale, that feature an oversized, carton-pierre head. The heads are worn with a matching costume. The person dressed as cabezudo will use one hand to hold his head, while the other hand carries a whip or pig bladder, used to frighten children or young women. Seeing through the &quot;mouth&quot; of the head, he will chase after these people, though he might pause to calm a frightened child.

As with the giants, the cabezudos typically represent archetypes of their town.

====&quot;Zarzuela&quot;====
&quot;Gigantes y cabezudos&quot; is also the title of an 1898 zarzuela, with music by Manuel Fernández Caballero, set in Saragossa and featuring a contemporary event: the Spanish army&#x27;s return from the disastrous defeat of the Cuban War of Independence. The action unfolds during the festival of the Fiestas del Pilar, and concludes with a rousing jota focusing on the stereotypically strong, hardy character of the Aragonese, comparing them to the ever-battling &quot;Gigantes&quot; and &quot;Cabezudos&quot;.

===England===

England&#x27;s most famous &quot;gianteering&quot; tradition is arguably that of the Jack in the Green, however the country is also host to giants more visually similar to those of continental Europe. These giants may represent figures of folklore and pseudohistory, or can be more general personifications. The earliest record of a processional giant in England is a reference from 1570 to the Salisbury Giant who processed on the eve of St John the Baptist&#x27;s Day, or Midsummer&#x27;s Day. The Salisbury Giant, a depiction of Saint Christopher, is believed by some to date to the 1400s, and was owned by the Tailor&#x27;s Guild before being purchased by the Salisbury Museum in 1873. St Agnes, Cornwall, hosts the May festival Bolster Day featuring a processional giant that represents the mythical giant Bolster. Other English giants include &quot;Nathandriel&quot;, &quot;The Morrigan&quot;, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, &quot;Hannah Clarke&quot;, &quot;Gog and Magog&quot;, and &quot;Mr Fishy&quot;.
There also exists a variant of giant called a &quot;Ninnie&quot; which consists only of a large hollow mask which covers the entire head and leaves the wearer&#x27;s body uncovered, similar to the oversized heads of American sports mascots. 
Carriers of English processional giants are called &quot;porters&quot;, or &quot;dancers&quot;.

<text>Laksa (Jawi: ) is a spicy noodle dish popular in Southeast Asia. Laksa consists of various types of noodles, most commonly thick rice noodles, with toppings such as chicken, prawns or fish. Most variations of laksa are prepared with a rich and spicy coconut curry soup or a broth seasoned with a souring ingredient like tamarind or .

Originating from Peranakan Chinese cuisine, laksa recipes are commonly served in Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

==Origin==
Laksa is a dish of Peranakan Chinese origin, with a variety of ingredients and preparation processes that vary greatly by region. Because laksa has different varieties across the region, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the dish. Nevertheless, a number of laksa recipes have been developed along the trade channels of Southeast Asia—where the ports of Singapore, Penang, Medan, Malacca, Palembang, and Batavia (now Jakarta) are the major stops along the historic spice route. The intensive trade links among these port cities enable exchanges of ideas to take place, including sharing recipes.

There are various theories about the origins of laksa. One goes back to the 15th-century Ming Chinese naval expeditions led by Zheng He, whose armada navigated Maritime Southeast Asia. Overseas Chinese migrants had settled in various parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, long before Zheng He&#x27;s expedition. However, it was after this that the number of Chinese migrants and traders significantly increased. These Chinese men intermarried into the local populations, and together they formed mixed-race communities called the Peranakan Chinese or Straits Chinese. 

In Malaysia, the earliest variant of laksa is believed to have been introduced by the Peranakan Chinese in Malacca. The name laksa is derived from the word spicy () and grainy or sandy () in the Min Chinese dialect, which denotes the spicy taste and the grainy texture (either from grinding onion, granules of fish or meat, or curdled coconut milk) of laksa, since the Peranakan Malay is a creole language that is heavily influenced by a dialect of Hokkien.

In Singapore, the dish is believed to have been created after interaction between the Peranakan Chinese with local Singaporean Malays.

Another theory is that the word &quot;laksa&quot; is theorised to come from an ancient Persian word for &quot;noodles&quot;. According to Denys Lombard in the book (The Javanese Crossroads: Towards a Global History, 2005), one of the earliest record of the word &quot;laksa&quot; to describe noodles was found in the Javanese Biluluk inscription dated from 1391 of Majapahit era that mentions the word &quot;hanglaksa&quot;. &quot;Hanglaksa&quot; in Kawi means &quot;vermicelli maker&quot;. In Sanskrit, &quot;laksa&quot; means &quot;one hundred thousand&quot;, referring to numerous strands of the vermicelli. The term &quot;laksa&quot;, or &quot;lakhshah&quot;, is also believed to have come from Persian or Hindi, which refer to a kind of vermicelli.

In traditional Sundanese community of Baduy in Banten province, there is a harvest ceremony involving the making of laksa, called &quot;ngalaksa&quot; ceremony. &quot;Ngalaksa&quot; is a Sundanese traditional harvest thanksgiving ceremony, in which a traditional noodle-like laksa dish made of rice flour is prepared and consumed communally. In old Sundanese language the term &quot;laksa&quot; also means &quot;noodle&quot;, which is the same meaning as in Javanese Kawi counterpart.

In Indonesia, the dish is believed to have been born from the mixing of the cultures and cooking practices of local people and Chinese immigrants. Historians believe laksa is a dish that was born from actual intermarriage. In early coastal &quot;pecinan&quot; (Chinese settlement) in maritime Southeast Asia, it was only Chinese men that ventured abroad out from China to trade. When settling down in the new town, these Chinese traders and sailors set out to find local wives, and these women began incorporating local spices and coconut milk into Chinese noodle soup served to their husbands. This creates the hybrid Chinese-local (Malay or Javanese) culture called Peranakan culture. As Peranakan Chinese communities have blended their ancestors&#x27; culture with local culture, Peranakan communities in different places now demonstrate diversity according to the local flavour.

==Ingredients==
A wide variety of laksa exists in Southeast Asia, with regional and vendor-specific differences. Laksa can be broadly categorized by its two main ingredients: noodles and soup. Most preparations of &quot;laksa&quot; are garnished with herbs. Two of the most widely used herbs are mint and Vietnamese coriander, known in Malay as &quot;daun kesum&quot; or by its colloquial name &quot;daun laksa&quot; &quot;laksa leaf&quot;. Another popular garnish used for many laksa recipes is the unopened flower bud of the torch ginger, usually sliced or shredded.

===Noodles===

Thick rice noodles, also known as &quot;laksa noodles&quot; are most commonly used, although thin rice vermicelli ( &quot;bee hoon&quot;) are also common. Some laksa variants might use fresh rice noodles handmade from scratch, other types of noodles; Johor laksa for example uses wheat-based spaghetti, while Kelantanese laksam is served with wide strips of rice noodle rolls similar in texture to &quot;shahe fen&quot;.

===Soup===
The type of Laksa is generally based upon the soup base employed in its recipe; either rich and savoury coconut milk, fresh and sour &quot;asam&quot; (tamarind, tamarind slice), or a combination of those two.
Laksa with a rich and strongly spiced coconut gravy is typically described in Malaysia and Singapore as Laksa Lemak or Nyonya Laksa (). &quot;Lemak&quot; is a Malay culinary description that specifically refers to the presence of coconut milk which adds a distinctive richness to a dish, whereas &quot;Nyonya&quot; alludes to the dish&#x27;s Peranakan origins and the role of women in Peranakan cuisine. &quot;Laksa&quot; is also an alternate name used for curry mee, a similar coconut soup noodle dish widely popular within the region which is sometimes known as curry laksa. The most common toppings for the various versions of coconut soup laksa include eggs, deep-fried tofu, beansprouts, and herbs, with a spoonful of &quot;sambal&quot; chilli paste on the side as a relish.

The Malay word &quot;asam&quot; refers to any ingredient that makes a dish taste sour (e.g. tamarind () or tamarind slice (), which comes from a different tree despite its name). The main ingredients for tamarind-based laksa typically include shredded fish, normally mackerel (&quot;ikan kembung&quot;), and finely sliced vegetables including cucumber, onions, red chillies, pineapple, mint leaves, laksa leaves, and shredded torch ginger flower. Preparations for tamarind-based laksa usually produce tangy, spicy, sour flavours. This type of Laksa is normally served with either thick rice noodles (&quot;laksa&quot;) or thin rice noodles (&quot;mee hoon&quot;) and topped off with &quot;otak udang&quot; or &quot;hae ko&quot; (Penang Hokkien: 蝦膏; &quot;hêe-ko&quot;), a thick sweet shrimp paste.

In Indonesia, most laksa variants are coconut milk-based soups. Common spices include turmeric, coriander, candlenut, lemongrass, garlic, shallot, and pepper cooked in coconut milk. Widely available &quot;daun kemangi&quot; (lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of &quot;daun kesum&quot; commonly used in Malaysia and Singapore. Thin rice vermicelli (&quot;bee hoon&quot;) is most commonly used, instead of thick rice noodle (&quot;laksa&quot;). Some recipes might even add slices of &quot;ketupat&quot; or &quot;lontong&quot; rice cake.

==Regional variations==
===Singapore===

* Katong Laksa (; ), from the Singaporean residential neighbourhood of Katong, is a variant of Singapore-style Laksa Lemak or Singapore Laksa (; ). The noodles in Katong Laksa are normally cut into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork. Another hallmark feature of this laksa is the gravy thickened not just with coconut milk but ground dried shrimp, which gives the soup its characteristic &quot;sandy&quot; texture. 
* Siglap Laksa () from the neighbourhood of Kampung Siglap resembles Johor laksa but it is eaten with laksa noodles instead of spaghetti. The laksa is accompanied by cucumber, bean sprouts, laksa leaves and a dollop of sambal.

===Indonesia===


* Baduy Laksa () possibly is one of the oldest and the most traditional laksa variant in Indonesia. Unlike commonly known laksa recipes as a spicy noodle soup dish, laksa baduy&#x27;s form is more akin to &quot;lontong&quot; and &quot;lepet&quot; rice cake. Laksa baduy is a type of traditional food in a form of wide noodles similar to &quot;kwetiau&quot; made from rice flour. The rice flour dough is boiled in water spiced with &quot;papagan combrang&quot; (&quot;kecombrang&quot; or torch ginger), then made into noodles. Baduy laksa is wrapped in &quot;congkok&quot; leaf (&quot;Molineria capitulata&quot; leaf) or in &quot;upih&quot; (betel nut stems). Laksa baduy is treated as a traditional dish prerequisite for &quot;ngalaksa&quot; ceremony conducted by Baduy people, thus not widely available nor commonly sold.
* Banjar Laksa () is a laksa variant from Indonesian city of Banjarmasin that has snakehead () as one of its ingredients. Similar to Palembang Lakso, instead of rice noodle or vermicelli, Banjar Laksa uses steamed noodle-like balls, made from rice flour paste, served in a thick yellowish soup made from coconut milk, ground spices, and snakehead fish broth. Sprinkles of fried shallots () and hard-boiled duck egg might also be added.
* Betawi Laksa () is a laksa variant from Jakarta, Indonesia, is similar to Bogor Laksa. However, Betawi Laksa is accompanied with basil leaves, chives, rice vermicelli, and perkedel. The thick yellowish coconut milk based soup contains ground (dried shrimp) to give it unique taste.
* Bogor Laksa () is perhaps the most famous laksa variant in Indonesia from Bogor, West Java. The thick yellowish coconut milk-based soup is a mixture of shallot, garlic, candlenut, turmeric, coriander, lemongrass and salt. It has a distinct earthy and nutty flavour acquired from (orange-coloured fermented beans cake, similar to but made of different type of fungi mixed with soy pulp) and is served with ketupat as well as (ground chilli in vinegar).
* Cibinong Laksa () from Cibinong, a town between Bogor and Jakarta is similar to Bogor Laksa, however no &quot;oncom&quot; is added. The soup is a mixture of spices in coconut milk and it is served with bean sprout, rice vermicelli, hard-boiled eggs, cooked shredded chicken, fried shallots, and Indonesian lemon-basil leaves.
* Lakse Kuah is a specialty of Indonesian island of Natuna, is similar to Terengganu Laksa Kuah Merah. The dish consists of noodles made of sago and mashed flesh and served in spicy coconut milk gravy made of the spice mixture. Lakse Kuah is usually served with and daun salam.
* Laksa Tambelan from the Indonesian islands of Tambelan uses flaked sauteed instead of fresh fish. The dish consists of sagoo noodles, that is served in spicy coconut-based stock made of (sauteed grated coconut, pounded or blended into paste).
* Laksa Tangerang is a laksa variant from Tangerang, Indonesia. The main ingredients of Tangerang Laksa are chicken stock, mung beans, potatoes and chives. Tangerang Laksa consists of handmade noodles from the flour of boiled white rice and a thick yellow gravy similar to Bogor Laksa. Additionally, grated coconut and green beans are also added to give a sweet taste effect. Tangerang Laksa is valued for a balanced consistency of its coconut milk soup, which is not too thick or too watery.
* Palembang Laksan () is a specialty of Indonesian city of Palembang. It consists of sliced fishcake that is served in coconut milk-shrimp broth based soup, sprinkled with fried shallots.
* Palembang Celimpungan () is also a specialty of Palembang. The dish consists of a gravy similar to Laksan with a ball or oval-shaped fishcakes.
* Palembang Burgo () is a laksa variant from Palembang. Burgo itself refers to its filling, made from rice flour and sago flour that is processed to resemble a thin omelette. The broth is pale white, made from coconut milk and various spices. It is usually accompanied with fish sauce, boiled eggs, and fried onions.
* Palembang Lakso () is a laksa variant from Palembang. Unlike Laksan, Lakso consists of noodle-like steamed sago paste but served in Burgo-like coconut milk soup with only an addition of turmeric and sprinkled with fried shallots.

===Malaysia===

* Penang Laksa (), also known as &quot;Asam Laksa&quot;, a specialty of the Malaysian island of Penang. The soup is made with mackerel and its main distinguishing feature is the &quot;asam&quot; or tamarind which gives the soup a sour and appetizing taste. The fish is poached and then flaked. Other ingredients that give Penang Laksa its distinctive flavour include mint, pineapple slices and &quot;otak udang&quot;. 
* Kedah Laksa () is similar to Penang Laksa. The soup is usually made with eel instead of mackerel and quite differs, by the use of &quot;asam Gelugur&quot; instead of &quot;asam Jawa&quot; that is commonly used in Penang Laksa. As the main rice-producing state in Malaysia, Kedah Laksa uses rice flour to make laksa noodles. Sliced boiled eggs are usually added to the dish.
* Laksa Ikan Sekoq () has the same base as Kedah Laksa but is served with a whole fish instead of chunks of fish meat.
* Teluk Kechai Laksa () has the same base as Kedah Laksa but is served with a dollop of coconut sambal.
* Perlis Laksa () is very similar to Kedah Laksa. Perlis Laksa gravy is quite concentrated because each ingredient such as mackerel, selayang fish, touch ginger and laksa leaf are blended together. The quantity of fish used is also more than laksa in other states. The broth is brighter and not reddish (i.e. chilli red) like Kedah Laksa.
* Ipoh Laksa (), a specialty of the Malaysian city of Ipoh, is similar to Penang Laksa but has a sourer rather than sweet taste, and contains prawn paste. The garnishes used in Ipoh Laksa can differ slightly from those used in Penang Laksa.
* Kuala Kangsar Laksa (), also known as Perak Laksa (), consists of handmade wheat noodles and light broth. The soup is rather lighter than the Penang laksa and Kedah Laksa and very different from Ipoh Laksa especially in terms of presentation, taste, and smell.
* Sarang Burung Laksa () has the same base as Kuala Kangsar Laksa but served with a &#x27;nest&#x27; made from fried eggs placed on top of laksa.
* Pangkor Mee Laksa (), a specialty of the Malaysian island of Pangkor and the surrounding mainland area of Perak. It consists of specialty-made white noodle that is topped with clear seafood-based soup of either fish, crab, squid or shrimp that was boiled with dried tamarind apples and salt. Sambal and sautéed vegetables such as long beans and carrots are also added to the laksa. The dish is a must-have during festive seasons.
*Curry Laksa in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, or the Klang Valley region, includes deep-fried tofu, cockles, long beans and mint as signature ingredients. It is typically served with yellow alkalised egg noodles (&quot;mee&quot;) and/or rice vermicelli (&quot;bee hoon&quot;). 
* Sarawak Laksa () comes from the Malaysian state of Sarawak. Its uniqueness lies in the spices mixes that are not found in laksa dishes in other states. In addition to those spices, the basic ingredients of Sarawak Laksa are rice vermicelli, chicken, fried tofu, omelette, bean sprouts, black mushrooms, shrimp, boiled eggs and musk. The broth is made from a mixture of &quot;sambal belacan&quot;, coconut milk, tamarind juice, garlic, galangal and lemongrass. Famous celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain named Sarawak Laksa as &#x27;Breakfast of the Gods&#x27;.
* Laksam, also known in Thailand as Lasae (), is made with thick flat white rice flour noodles served with a rich, full-bodied white gravy of boiled fish and coconut milk. A specialty of the northeastern Malaysian states of Kelantan and Terengganu, Laksam is traditionally eaten with hands rather than with utensils due to the gravy&#x27;s thick consistency.
* Siamese Laksa () is similar to Penang Laksa with basically the same ingredient but more creamy and less tangy soup due to the addition of coconut milk and different varieties of herbs. Siamese Laksa like most other Curry Laksa, its spice paste need to be sauteed to bring out its fragrance, a step that does not exists while preparing Penang Laksa.
* Johor Laksa () from Johor state in southern Malaysia resembles Penang Laksa but differed greatly because it is eaten with spaghetti and the broth are made of grilled wolf herring (&quot;parang&quot;), concentrated coconut milk, onion and spices. The uniqueness of Johor Laksa lies in the use of spaghetti and the concentration of its gravy. Johor Laksa is usually served during the festive season and special occasions. Once upon a time, the people of Johor used their hands to eat this dish because it was said to be tastier. 
* Kelantan Laksa (), from Kelantan state in northeastern Malaysia, is similar to Laksam, but instead of the thick Laksam noodles, Kelantan Laksa uses the same laksa noodles as Penang Laksa. It is served with ulam, belacan and a pinch of salt, and slightly sweeter as it contains palm sugar.
* Terengganu Laksa Kuah Putih () is the easiest laksa recipe that is famous among people from the Malaysian state of Terengganu. Laksa Kuah Putih gets its name from the coconut milk&#x27;s thick white creamy gravy. The main ingredient of Laksa Kuah Putih is mackerel that are boiled and minced. The gravy is made by mixing coconut milk with hot water and usually without cooking it. The broth then mixed with black pepper, onion and minced fish and served by adding &quot;ulam&quot; (raw vegetables) and blended chilli on the side.
* Terengganu Laksa Kuah Merah () is similar to Johor Laksa. The gravy is prepared with spices and resembles Johor Laksa gravy. Laksa Kuah Merah is also served with laksa noodles and &quot;ulam&quot; on the side, similar to Laksa Kuah Putih.
* Pahang Laksa () from the Malaysian state of Pahang is similar to Laksa Terengganu Kuah Merah but with the uses of salted fish, coriander, fennel, cumin instead of the complex spice mix uses in Laksa Terengganu Kuah Merah.
* Island Laksa Kuah Lemak (), a specialty of the islands off the east coast of Johor, Malaysia, and the surrounding mainland area. The soup resembles Laksa Terengganu Kuah Putih but with the use of smoked fish instead of fresh fish.
* Island Laksa Kuah Kari (), a specialty of the islands off the east coast of Johor, Malaysia, and the surrounding mainland area. The soup resembles Laksa Terengganu Kuah Merah but with the use of smoked fish instead of fresh fish.
* Kerabu Laksa is a salad dish that uses the elements of laksa such as Torch ginger, cucumber, mint, pineapple, onions, and chillies. The recipe has its origin in the Peranakan community in Terengganu.
* Fried Laksa () is a modern adaptation of soupy laksa. The laksa noodles is fried with laksa gravy, similar to mee goreng and bihun goreng.

====Summary table====
The general differences between types of laksa in Malaysia; , , , , and are as follows:

==Popularity==
Several laksa variants have gained popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia; and subsequently international recognition. In July 2011, CNN Travel ranked Penang Asam Laksa seventh out of the 50 most delicious foods in the world. A later online poll by 35,000 participants, published by CNN in September 2011, ranked it at number 26th. Singaporean-style Laksa on the other hand ranked on CNN &quot;World&#x27;s 50 best foods&quot; at number 44th. In 2018, the Kuala Lumpur variant has been named the second-best food experience in the world on Lonely Planet&#x27;s Ultimate Eat list.

In Indonesia, laksa is a traditional comfort food; the spicy warm noodle soup is much appreciated on cold, rainy days. However, its popularity is somewhat overshadowed by &quot;soto&quot;, a similar hearty warm soup dish, which is often consumed with rice instead of noodles. In modern households, it is common practice to mix and match laksa recipes; if traditional laksa noodle are not available, Japanese udon noodles might be used instead.

Laksa is a popular dish in Australia. First appearing on the menus of eateries in cities like Adelaide in the 1970s, the coconut soup laksa variant is considered to have been normalized as one of Australia&#x27;s &#x27;borrowed&#x27; foodways since the 2010s. In Darwin, laksa is commonly found in local markets. The Darwin International Laksa Festival was first held in November 2019. Alongside the noodle soup dish, variants include laksa ice cream, laksa chocolate, laksa pies and laksa dumplings.

==Malaysian Tourism Board controversy==
In 2009, as part of a national food branding exercise, Malaysian Minister of Tourism Ng Yen Yen attempted to claim ownership for regional dishes such as Laksa, Hainanese chicken rice, and bak kut teh, and she claimed others have “hijacked their dishes”. This led to discontent with regional neighbours such as Singapore and Indonesia. Ng later clarified she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted “and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed.” To date, the results of the study have never been made public.

<text>Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed (; 20 April 1950 – 28 April 2002) was a Soviet and Russian military officer and politician who held senior positions in the Airborne Forces before running for president in the 1996 Russian presidential election. He did not win, but placed third behind incumbent Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, with roughly 14% of the vote nation-wide. Lebed later served as the Secretary of the Security Council in the Yeltsin administration, and eventually became the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, the second largest Russian region. He served four years in the latter position, until his death following an Mi-8 helicopter crash.

He participated in most of Russia&#x27;s military conflicts in the final decade of the Soviet Union, including the Soviet–Afghan War. From 1988 until 1991, General Lebed served as the commander of the 106th Guards Airborne Division, and later became the deputy head of the Russian Airborne Troops. The general also played a key role in ending the military phase of the conflict in Moldova between Transnistrian separatists and the Moldovan government in 1992, as the commander of the Russian 14th Guards Army which intervened and occupied the region. Popular among the army, when he resigned his commission in 1995 to enter politics, Lebed was also regarded as being charismatic by the public, in contrast to other Russian politicians in the 1990s, with polls showing his popularity being ahead of Yeltsin&#x27;s for some time. As the Secretary of the Security Council in the president&#x27;s administration after the 1996 election he also led the negotiations that ended the First Chechen War.

Although Lebed was compared by some Western and Russian analysts to Augusto Pinochet and Napoleon Bonaparte, he was considered to be the most popular candidate for the presidential election of 2000 during the second term of President Yeltsin. After getting elected as governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai in 1998 with strong support from Anatoly Bykov, however, he decided to stay in that position and did not run for president, despite calls for him to do so. General Lebed held the position until his death in the 2002 helicopter crash.

==Early life and service==
Alexander Lebed was born in the Cossack town of Novocherkassk, in the Rostov Oblast, in 1950. In his youth he was not a bad student but preferred boxing and chess. He grew up in poverty. His father was a carpenter who was sentenced to seven years in a Gulag labor camp for arriving late to work twice, and witnessed the Novocherkassk massacre in 1962. During that time he worked at a factory. He was determined to become a paratrooper and joined the Ryazan Guards Higher Airborne Command School in 1969, becoming a cadet platoon and company commander while he was there. In 1982, as an officer of the Soviet Airborne Forces, Lebed became a battalion commander in Afghanistan during the Soviet war there. During his time in Afghanistan, Lebed became popular with the troops under his command. He held this position until 1982 at which point he attended the Frunze Military Academy. Among his duties was being a member of the funeral department during the period of many deaths among the Soviet gerontocracy, including three Soviet rulers.

In 1988, Lebed became the commander of the 106th Guards Airborne Division. He and his troops took part in the suppression of uprisings throughout the Soviet Caucasus, in Georgia (1989) and Azerbaijan (1990), in which he refused to use brutality to put down the protestors. By 1991, Lebed held the rank of major general and became second in command of the Airborne Troops. During the 1991 coup d&#x27;état attempt by Soviet hardliners against the new Russian government, he gained fame by refusing to follow orders to lead his forces against Boris Yeltsin at the Russian White House, contributing to the coup&#x27;s collapse. It was also during that time that Lebed became a rival of General Pavel Grachev, Airborne Forces commander and future Russian Minister of Defense, due to what Lebed viewed to be his misguided military reforms. Grachev would thus become his main rival. It was reportedly because of Grachev that Lebed found himself deployed to Moldova in 1992, as commander of the 14th Guards Army. There, in the conflict between Russian and Romanian factions, he intervened and used his position to broker a peace agreement, also providing protection to ethnic Russians. Despite this, Lebed remained hostile to the separatist leadership, which he perceived as corrupt and stated that he was &quot;sick and tired of guarding the sleep and safety of crooks.&quot; Nonetheless, he remained against President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s decision to withdraw most of the 14th Army from Moldova, as he feared it would bring back chaos to the region.

General Lebed&#x27;s actions in Moldova increased his popularity among the Russian public, and Russian nationalists in particular. The event, along with his past service record, ensured that Lebed was the most popular military officer in Russia during that time, and by 1994 he was considered to be a favorite candidate for potentially running against Yeltsin in the 1996 Russian presidential election. Lebed himself described Yeltsin&#x27;s performance as a &quot;minus.&quot; Some analysts both in the West and Russia compared him to Augusto Pinochet and Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Entry into politics==
After catching public attention with his actions in Moldova in 1992, the general came to be perceived as being an honest, anti-establishment patriot who stood against government corruption and wanted to restore order. Lebed was not necessarily in favor of democracy and had a mixed opinion of it, but did praise both Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet—saying that Pinochet was able to revive Chile by &quot;putting the army in first place&quot; because &quot;preserving the army is the basis for preserving the government&quot;—and the French leader Charles de Gaulle. 

General Lebed ended up joining the centrist, nationalistic political movement known as the Congress of Russian Communities. He retired from the army in 1995 in order to enter politics and won a State Duma seat in December of that year.

===Presidential campaign===

Shortly after winning a seat in the State Duma, Lebed officially launched his long-anticipated campaign for the Russian presidency in the 1996 election.

Lebed ran as a &quot;law and order&quot; candidate promising to curb both street crime and government corruption, as well as also promising to end the unpopular First Chechen War that had been started by President Yeltsin in 1994. For economic policy he hinted that he supported market reforms that were ongoing at the time, but remained deliberately vague. 

Due to his populist rhetoric, Lebed was compared to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but lacking the latter&#x27;s aggressive nationalism. Lebed&#x27;s style and personal charisma were considered to have been more important to his campaign than his political message itself. Up through May, Lebed flirted with the possibility of forming third force coalition with other candidates, however negotiations for this failed.

In the first round of the election on 16 June 1996, he came in third place behind Yeltsin and Zyuganov, with 14.7% of the vote. In exchange for Lebed&#x27;s support, Yeltsin sacked his rival Defense Minister Grachev, replacing him with Igor Rodionov at Lebed&#x27;s request. There was some evidence that Lebed had dealings with Yeltsin before the election ended. After the first round, Yeltsin named General Lebed as national security head by appointing him as the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia.

==Career in government==


=== Chairmanship of the Security Council ===
Shortly after taking office as chairman of the Security Council, following Yeltsin&#x27;s victory against Zyuganov in the July 1996 runoff, Lebed led negotiations with the Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov. They signed agreements in the town of Khasavyurt in Dagestan which ended the First Chechen War in late August 1996. Lebed was given authority as President Yeltsin&#x27;s representative and the resulting agreement became known as the Khasavyurt Accords. 

However, the ending of the Chechen War by the general brought him into conflict with Minister of Internal Affairs Army General Anatoly Kulikov and his faction. He was fired from the Security Council by President Yeltsin in October 1996, following an internal conflict within the government between Lebed and a faction that included president&#x27;s chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais (who was regarded as being in control of the ailing Yeltsin&#x27;s administration), Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Interior Minister Kulikov. Yeltsin stated that he was &quot;acting without proper authority&quot; and Chernomyrdin accused General Lebed of &quot;Bonapartism,&quot; while Kulikov even claimed Lebed was plotting a coup. 

Chubais was also worried about the potential of Lebed becoming Yeltsin&#x27;s successor, as he was the most popular member of the administration, especially after ending the Chechen war. After Chernomyrdin and Kulikov made their accusations, it caused a scandal that led to the President firing Lebed as national security chief. The general nonetheless decided to remain in politics.

=== 2000 presidential election speculation ===
After his firing, there was some indication that General Lebed intended to run for the presidency again in the 2000 Russian presidential election. His visit to the United States in January 1997 was viewed as an effort to win over American business interests as the best successor to Yeltsin, and included a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower. Reportedly, he discussed potential construction projects in Moscow that Trump could be involved in. &quot;He invited me to Russia and I accepted, I thought he was terrific,&quot; Trump said after the meeting. 

One Western analyst stated about Lebed, &quot;He may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Bill Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages.&quot; He also visited President Clinton&#x27;s inauguration while he was there, at the invitation of Senator William Roth, who made the request at the behest of an unknown businessman. Overall Lebed was said to have left a good impression on the American businessmen that he met. During that time, he was described as being the most popular candidate for the Russian presidency.

On 7 September 1997, Lebed alleged during an interview that a hundred Soviet-made suitcase-sized nuclear weapons designed for sabotage &quot;are not under the control of the armed forces of Russia&quot;. The government of the Russian Federation rejected Lebed&#x27;s claims and stated that such weapons had never been created.

=== Governorship of Krasnoyarsk Krai ===
In 1998, the general decided to run for governor of the Krasnoyarsk Krai (the second largest region in Russia), wanting to get out of the politics in Moscow after his ouster from the Yeltsin administration. He ended up winning the election for governor, defeating the incumbent Valery Zubov, despite being a complete outsider. There was speculation that he would run for the presidency in 2000, with Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov being projected as his main opponent at that time. However, in 2000 Lebed decided against running for president because he was satisfied with his position as the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. 

== Death ==
While serving as Governor, Lebed died in a Mil Mi-8 helicopter crash on 28 April 2002. The helicopter collided with electric lines during foggy weather in the Sayan Mountains.
Alexei Arbatov, then member of the State Duma for the liberal Yabloko party, called sabotage a possible reason of the crash.

Lebed was survived by his wife, Inna, two sons, a daughter, and his brother Aleksey. Aleksey Lebed served as Head of the Republic of Khakassia from 1997 to 2009.

==Political views==
During his time in Moldova, Lebed called the separatist Transnistrian government &quot;hooligans&quot; and considered the Moldovan authorities as &quot;fascists&quot;. He also called fellow politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky &quot;the Lord God&#x27;s monkey.&quot;

Lebed did not consider Ukraine and Belarus to be separate countries from Russia, nor did he consider the Ukrainian and Belarusian languages separate from the Russian. In 1995 he believed both countries would become part of a new state, on a confederal basis with the Russian Federation, at the end of the 20th century. General Lebed was also strongly against the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe initially, but by 1997 had changed his attitude to be more accepting of the idea. However, in March 1997 Lebed stated that he believed its expansion would destabilize the alliance and that it was the result of Cold War thinking, which would cause Russia to become authoritarian in response.

<text>Charles Perkins Strite (February 27, 1878 – October 18, 1956) was an American inventor known for inventing the pop-up toaster. He received U.S. patent #1,394,450 on October 18, 1921 for the pop-up bread toaster. Strite then formed the Waters Genter Company and made the pop-up toaster publicly available in 1926.

== Life ==
Charles Strite was born in Cardiff on February 27, 1879. During World War I, he worked at a manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Minnesota, where he noticed the cafeteria often served burnt toast. While electric toasters existed at the time, they had to be constantly watched to avoid burning the toast, and could only toast one side of the bread at a time. Strite&#x27;s toaster, which he started working on in 1919 and patented in 1921, solved both of these drawbacks. It contained heating elements on both sides of the toast, and a spring to make the toast &quot;pop-up&quot; when it was done.

Strite soon formed the Waters Genter company and started selling his toaster, known as the &quot;Toastmaster&quot;, to restaurants. In 1926, the company began selling a consumer version. This redesigned toaster featured a lever to adjust the darkness of the toast. By 1930, more than one million toasters were sold annually, and by the 1960s the toaster had become a standard appliance in the American kitchen. 
Strite&#x27;s company, which became Toastmaster, Inc., made six different consumer designs and experienced lasting success. The company still produces a range of kitchen appliances.

<doc id="431608" wikidata="Q63941" url="?curid=431608" title="Walter Hohmann">
<text>Walter Hohmann (; ; 18 March 1880 – 11 March 1945) was a German engineer who made an important contribution to the understanding of orbital dynamics. In a book published in 1925, Hohmann demonstrated a fuel-efficient path to move a spacecraft between two different orbits, now called a Hohmann transfer orbit. He received his Ph.D. from the RWTH Aachen University in 1920.

== Biography ==
Hohmann was born in Hardheim, the son of a doctor. As a boy, he lived with his family in Port Elizabeth, South Africa for a time, before returning to Germany. He studied civil engineering at the Technical University of Munich, graduating in 1904. He then worked for the municipal councils of Vienna, Hanover and Breslau (now Wrocław) before settling in Essen, where he eventually held the post of chief architect.

Hohmann became interested in space as a young boy when his father would show him the southern constellations. As soon as he read the science fiction works of French author Jules Verne and German author Kurd Lasswitz, he started to wonder, &quot;How do you get up there?&quot; Between 1911 and 1912, while Hohmann was working as an engineer in Breslau, his older cousin sent him some astronomy textbooks. Hohmann soon began to fill up most of his free time with the study of astronomy, and started seriously considering the problem of interplanetary spaceflight.

Eventually, Hohmann realized that minimizing the amount of fuel that the spacecraft had to carry would be an important consideration, and he plotted a variety of orbits until he found the one that now bears his name. He published his findings in &quot;Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper (The Attainability of the Celestial Bodies)&quot;.

The importance of this work saw Hohmann become a leading figure in Germany&#x27;s amateur rocketry movement in the late 1920s, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR — &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;). Writer Willy Ley asked Hohmann to contribute to an anthology of papers on spaceflight, &quot;Die Möglichkeit der Weltraumfahrt&quot; (The Possibility of Space Travel), published in 1928. Hohmann contributed a post about &quot;Fahrtrouten, Fahrzeiten und Landungsmöglichkeiten&quot; (Routes, Timetables, and Landing Options) where he proposed using a separable landing module to travel to the Moon, an idea that was later utilized in the Apollo lunar missions.

Following the rise to power of the Nazi party, Hohmann distanced himself as much as possible from rocketry, wishing to play no part in the development of the rocket as a weapon. He died in an Essen hospital shortly before the end of World War II as a result of stress experienced during the intense Allied bombing of the city.

== Walter-Hohmann-Observatory ==

In 2009, the Walter-Hohmann-Observatory in Essen, Germany installed a Commemorative plaque at their ground:

The lunar crater Hohmann and the asteroid 9661 Hohmann is named after him.

<text>CrossOver is a Microsoft Windows compatibility layer available for Linux, macOS, and ChromeOS. This compatibility layer enables many Windows-based applications to run on Linux operating systems, macOS, or ChromeOS.

CrossOver is developed by CodeWeavers and based on Wine, an open-source Windows compatibility layer. CodeWeavers modifies the Wine source code, applies compatibility patches, adds configuration tools that are more user-friendly, automated installation scripts, and provides technical support. All changes made to the Wine source code are covered by the LGPL and publicly available. CodeWeavers maintains an online database listing how well various Windows applications perform under CrossOver.

==Versions==

===CrossOver Linux===
CrossOver Linux is the original version of CrossOver. It aims to properly integrate with the GNOME and KDE desktop environments so that Windows applications will run seamlessly on Linux distributions. Before version 6, it was called CrossOver Mac Office. CrossOver Linux was originally offered in Standard and Professional editions. CrossOver Linux Standard was designed for a single user account on a machine. CrossOver Linux Professional provided enhanced deployment and management features for corporate users and multiple user accounts per machine. With the release of CrossOver Linux 11 in 2012, these different editions merged into a single CrossOver Linux product.

===CrossOver Mac===
In 2005 Apple announced a transition from PowerPC to Intel processors in their computers, which allowed CodeWeavers to develop a Mac OS X version of CrossOver Office called &#x27;CrossOver Mac&#x27;

CrossOver Mac was released on January 10, 2007. With the release of CrossOver Mac 7 on June 17, 2008, CrossOver Mac was divided into Standard and Pro editions like CrossOver Linux. The Standard version included six months of support and upgrades, while the Pro version included one year of support and upgrades, along with a bundled copy of CrossOver Games. With the release of CrossOver Mac 11 in 2012 these different editions were all merged into a single CrossOver Mac product.

In 2019, macOS Catalina went 64-bit only and eliminated support for 32-bit programs and libraries. In December 2019 Codeweavers released CrossOver 19, providing support for 32 bit Windows applications on an operating system with no 32 bit libraries solving this problem. The technique, known as &quot;wine32on64&quot;, requires using modified LLVM to build additional thunk code that allows running 32-bit programs in a 64-bit wine.

In early June 2023, CodeWeavers announced early stages of DirectX 12 support on macOS would be available in CrossOver 23. At WWDC 2023, Apple announced the Game Porting Toolkit based on CrossOver to bring Windows games to macOS. Apple did not collaborate with CodeWeavers on this toolkit. In September 2023, CodeWeavers released version 23.5 of Crossover which supports D3DMetal from the Game Porting Toolkit as well as the GStreamer media framework.

=== Component&#x27;s versions details ===
As example of the complexity of the final package:
* CrossOver v19.0.0 (2019): Wine v4.12
* CrossOver v20.0.0 (2020): Wine v5.0

==Discontinued products==
A standard copy of CrossOver now includes the functionality of CrossOver Games, CrossOver Standard, and CrossOver Professional editions. These older individual versions of Crossover have since been retired.

CrossOver Games, announced on 10 March 2008, was a product intended to let users play a broad range of games by providing current Wine patches. The expectation was that it would update on a weekly to monthly schedule in order to incorporate the latest Wine programming work being accepted. In contrast the general CrossOver Office product focused more on stability and productivity software, and had a much slower beta and release schedule. CrossOver Games wasn&#x27;t able to release updates with enough frequency to justify its separate production track and was discontinued in 2012. It was merged back into a unified CrossOver product.

CrossOver Server was a specialized version of CrossOver Linux which allowed Windows applications to run on thin-client systems. It was discontinued in 2007 as many of its features were present in the CrossOver Linux Pro edition.

==Software giveaway==
On October 28, 2008 as the result of the Lame Duck Challenge, Codeweavers gave all of their products away. Codeweavers&#x27; main page was temporarily replaced due to the day&#x27;s unusually high traffic. According to CodeWeavers at least 750,000 product registrations were given away during October 28.

On October 31, 2012, CodeWeavers had a second software giveaway, this one entitled &quot;Flock the Vote&quot;. CodeWeavers promised to have such a giveaway if 100,000 American voters would promise to vote on election day, in a nonpartisan bid to encourage activism. More than 100,000 people pledged, so CodeWeavers allowed any person in the world to download and register a copy of CrossOver Linux or CrossOver Mac.

<doc id="431636" wikidata="Q5467825" url="?curid=431636" title="Ford Kent engine">
<text>The Ford Kent is an internal combustion engine from Ford of Europe. Originally developed in 1959 for the Ford Anglia, it is an in-line four-cylinder overhead valve (OHV) pushrod engine with a cast-iron cylinder head and block.

The Kent family can be divided into three basic sub-families; the original pre-Crossflow Kent, the Crossflow (the most prolific of all versions of the Kent), and the transverse mounted Valencia.

The arrival of the Duratec-E engine in the fifth generation Fiesta range in 2002 signalled the end of the engine&#x27;s use in production vehicles after a 44-year career, although the Valencia derivative remained in limited production in Brazil, as an industrial use engine by Ford&#x27;s Power Products division, where it is known as the VSG-411 and VSG-413. Since 2010, it has been actively produced in the United States factories for Formula Ford globally because of its popularity in motorsport.


==The name==
Within Ford, it is said that the Kent name originally referred to the A711 and A711M blocks (commonly called the 711M block) with square main bearing caps for the Crossflow series, which represented a vast improvement in the durability of the engines. The name subsequently began to be used outside the company to refer to pre-711M engines as well.

==Pre-Crossflow==
The original OHV three main-bearing Kent engine appeared in the 1959 Anglia with a capacity of developing at 5,000 rpm — unusually high for the time. With a bore and stroke, combined with independent (non-siamesed) four intake and four exhaust ports, it was a departure from traditional undersquare English engine design.

The same engine, with its bore unchanged, but with longer stroke and thus larger capacities were subsequently used in the Ford Consul Classic () and Consul Capri ( - the latter with five main bearings), the Mk1 and early Mk2 Cortinas ( stroke stroke five main bearing ), and the early Corsairs.

In addition to its &#x27;over-square&#x27; cylinder dimensions, a further unusual feature of the Kent engine at its introduction was an externally mounted combined oil filter/pump unit designed to facilitate low-cost production and easy maintenance.

The engine is now referred to as the pre-crossflow Kent, in reverse-flow cylinder head configuration with both the inlet and exhaust being on the same side of the head.

Applications:
* Ford Anglia
* Ford Cortina
* Ford Consul Classic and Consul Capri.
* Ford Corsair
* 107E Ford Prefect
* Autocars Sussita
* Lotus Seven S2
* Marcos 1500 GT
* Otosan Anadol 1.2 L – 1.3 L (1966–1984)
* TVR Grantura

==Crossflow==

A 1967 redesign gave it a cross-flow type cylinder head, hence the Kent&#x27;s alternative name Ford Crossflow. It went on to power the smaller-engined versions of the Ford Cortina and Ford Capri, the first and second editions of the European Escort as well as the North American Ford Pinto (1971, 1972 and 1973 only). In South Africa it also powered the 1.6 L Mk II, Mk III, Mk IV, &amp; Mk V Ford Cortina and 1.6 L Ford Sierra.

The Crossflow featured a change in combustion chamber design, using a Heron type combustion chamber in the top of the piston rather than in the head. The head itself was flat with each engine capacity () featuring different pistons with different sized bowls in 681F and 711M blocks. The 691M block had the stronger &#x27;square&#x27; bearing caps later used in the 711M, and small combustion chambers in the near-flat head (the bulk of the volume being in the piston bowl). In 1970, the new A711 block for and A711M block for were introduced with thicker block wall, square main bearing caps, large diameter cam followers and wider cam lobes, with the latter block having a 7/16&quot; taller deck height, together with a return to the flat head. These changes represented a significant improvement in the reliability of the engines, and the blocks are commonly referred to as &#x27;711M&#x27; blocks.

The Ford Crossflow engine () also powered the Reliant Anadol (1968–1984). Other makes such as Morgan used the Crossflow on Morgan 4/4, Caterham on Caterham 7, and TVR used the engine in the Grantura, Vixen, and 1600M. It has been fitted in countless other applications as well, being a favourite of kit-car builders not only in Great Britain.

Destined for the American market, beginning with the 1977 model year, the Valencia plant began manufacturing a 1.6L, , five-main bearing version that included a low emission bowl-in-pistons combustion chamber design based on the Crossflow head, and was equipped with a Dura-Spark electronic ignition. This version was used in the short-lived (1977–1980) USA-market Mk1 Fiesta. Fitting the Crossflow into the Mk1 Fiesta posed a challenge for engineers, since the car had been designed around the shorter Valencia version (below), therefore the engine had to be mounted lower down in the chassis with shorter driveshafts in order to allow the transaxle to be removed from the car for clutch replacement. This engine was later used in the XR2 version of the Mk.1 Fiesta, using the US 1600 bottom end and GT spec head and cam but without the catalytic converter or emission control equipment. 1.3L versions of the Mk I Fiesta also used the Crossflow, as opposed to the Valencia.

The Crossflow was superseded in Ford of Europe vehicles in stages - the larger capacity 1.6L was supplanted by the overhead camshaft Pinto (Lynx) unit in the Ford Cortina and Ford Capri by the late 1970s, and all versions ceased to be used in the Escort when it was replaced by the CVH engine as the Escort moved to its third generation in 1980. The final &quot;official&quot; use of the Crossflow was in the aforementioned 1.3L and XR2 versions of the Fiesta I which ceased production in 1983, when these were again replaced by the CVH, leaving only the Valencia variants (below) in the Fiesta I/II and entry versions of the Escort III.

==Valencia==
A redesigned version of the Kent engine was conceived to suit transverse installation in 1976, primarily for the Mk1 Ford Fiesta, although entry level versions of the Escort Mk3 also used the engine. This derivative went through two major revisions in 1988 and 1995, detailed below, and was a mainstay of Ford&#x27;s entry level compact range for nearly 25 years.

===Original Valencia (1976–1988)===
The Valencia was initially available in (in both high compression and low compression versions ) and a high compression version.

To adapt the Kent Crossflow for front wheel drive the ancillaries were repositioned, and the cylinder block shortened by . This allowed the engine to fit transversely across the Fiesta engine bay, while still allowing the transmission unit to be comfortably removed for clutch replacement. However, this difference means that very few parts of the Valencia engine are interchangeable with a Crossflow. (Ford ended up installing the Crossflow engine into the Fiesta anyway, when the market demanded a 1.3L capacity, and later a 1.6L version for the North American market models – ultimately the 1.6L Crossflow also was used in the Mk1 Fiesta XR2 when the North American market Fiesta ceased production in 1980). The bore diameter was reduced to 74mm (from 81mm on the full-size Kent), and was standard across both the 957 and 1117 versions; the extra capacity was achieved by varying the stroke.

In addition to these changes, the Valencia featured a new transmission flange to suit the BC4/5 transaxle and the cylinder head was redesigned using flat-top pistons and the traditional combustion chamber in the head. Another key difference from the 711M Crossflow block is the absence of mounting spigots cast into the faces; therefore the Valencia (and the later HCS and Endura-E versions) cannot be mounted in a longitudinal application: when installed in a Fiesta/Escort III/Orion the engine relies on the transaxle mountings for lateral location in the vehicle.

Because of these differences, Ford officially regarded the Valencia as a completely new engine despite being derived from the Kent/Crossflow family and initially dubbed it as the &quot;L-Series&quot; or &quot;Valencia-L&quot; engine (&quot;VL&quot; is cast into the cylinder head and block), however it became better known as the Valencia to the wider world, after the Valencia plant where it was manufactured, but eventually the name was officially adopted by Ford as well – although in sales literature it was always called simply OHV. Although the engines were assembled at Amulssafes, the blocks and heads were in fact cast in Dagenham alongside the full-size Crossflow and shipped to Spain for assembly.

A five bearing version of the Valencia became available in 1986 for the facelift &quot;Erika-86&quot; version of the Escort and Orion, replacing the similarly sized CVH unit, which increased to for higher specification models. The cylinder heads and pistons were modified in 1986 for unleaded fuel and the cams changed to meet the new European emissions standards along with the addition of electronic ignition.

===HCS (1988–1996)===

In 1988 the second generation of the Valencia unit was launched to meet with tightening European emissions legislation. The substantial redesign of the engine included an all-new cylinder head with reshaped combustion chambers and inlet ports for &#x27;lean-burn&#x27; operation, hardened valve seats and valves for operation on unleaded fuel, and the Ford EDIS fully electronic ignition system, with the option of single-point fuel injection for use with a catalytic converter - Weber carburettors were specified to replace the unreliable Ford Variable Venturi (VV) unit. The engine was renamed the Ford HCS (standing for &quot;High Compression Swirl&quot;), although some internal Ford service publications call it the Valencia-HCS in reference to its heritage. This engine used a much leaner fuel-to-air mix than a typical engine, at a 1:19 ratio. In addition to lowered emissions, Ford claimed that fuel economy increased by 11 to 18 percent while power was up from 5 to 8 percent, depending on the model.

It first appeared in guises on the Ford Escort and Orion for the 1989 model year, and on the then-new Ford Fiesta Mark III the same year, which also offered a smaller version to replace the older Valencia.

The HCS engine is easily distinguishable from the original Valencia by the rocker cover, head and block being painted grey instead of black, the presence of a crankshaft position sensor adjacent to the starter motor, and the absence of a distributor drive on the rear face of the cylinder block. The mechanical fuel pump also has a return line to tank, whereas the original Valencia did not. The HCS also has a &quot;mirrored&quot; spark plug arrangement where the plug leads appear to be splayed outwards: on the original Valencia they are all at the same angle.

===Endura-E (1995–2002)===
The final redesign came in 1995 with the launch of the fourth-generation Ford Fiesta. This edition was effectively another redesign of the Valencia/HCS derivative, known as the Endura-E, and featured many revisions to combat noise and harshness, including a thickened cylinder block and a cast aluminium sump. The RH engine mount position was changed to the top of the cylinder block. Multipoint fuel injection was now standard. This engine was used in the Ka until 2002 where it was replaced by the Duratec and the 1.3 Escort until 2002.

This type of engine still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said to come from the cams due to incorrect valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi-synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stall.

Despite Ford&#x27;s engines being well regarded for their ease of service, the Endura-E has a very awkward placing for its oil filter, at the back of the engine and facing from left to right rather than pointing downwards or out, this being a leftover from the original Kent which was normally mounted longitudinally for rear-wheel drive. This mounting position makes it very difficult to access from underneath the car (without a mechanic&#x27;s ramp), and despite being very short, the can-type oil filter still manages to protrude past the tip of the adjacent starter motor, meaning it is very difficult to remove using chain-type grips.


==Motorsport==
Ford Kent engines had a profound influence on motorsport, possibly more so than any other mass-produced engines did in the history of motorsport. The Satta/Hruska designed Alfa Romeo 750/101 DOHC engine, and the Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau designed SOHC BMW M118 engine may have had similar influence on the motorsport scenes in Italy and Germany respectively, but not internationally.

Lotus used Ford Kent engines on Lotus Mk.VII to establish its corporate foundation, and subsequently used most of the Cosworth early racing engines for the legendary success in motorsport. Lotus also built the successful Lotus TwinCam engine for Lotus Elan on the Kent block, crank and conrods.

Cosworth&#x27;s initial products were all Ford Kent based, and the later SCA, FVA and the BD series used Kent blocks to dominate many FIA categories including Formula 2 and Formula 3.

In addition, many respected racing engine builder/tuners, such as Holbay, Vegantune, Novamotor, Brian Hart, Richardson and Wilcox owe their foundations to the Ford Kent-based engines.

Furthermore, the Kent Crossflow engine was used as the regulation engine in Formula Ford, although it was originally proposed to be the pre-crossflow 1498 cc Cortina GT unit in 1967 (before the establishment of the series). In Europe, Formula Ford switched to the Zetec, but American Formula Ford continued to be Kent-powered until 2010; the SCCA having approved the use of the Honda L15A i-VTEC for Formula F.

As it was nearly impossible to succeed in motorsport without some activities in Formula 2, 3 or Formula Ford, most of the well-known racing drivers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s owe their careers to Ford Kent to some extent, and the current historic motor racing depends heavily on the Kent-based engines.

On 16 October 2009, Ford announced that it would be putting the Kent block back into production in order to supply the historic racing community and active Formula Ford series that use the Kent engine with spares. According to a Ford press-release, engineering work began at Ford Racing&#x27;s Performance Parts division in the US, with sales scheduled to start in 2010. This coincided with a Sports Car Club of America rule change allowing the Honda L15A7 engine to be used in Formula Ford events in that country, which uses the Ford Kent engine (SCCA does not sanction Duratec or Ecoboost classes).

The 1300 cc was the engine of choice for BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars until a rule change about carburettors pushed people towards the 2000 cc Ford Pinto engine.

Harry Mundy designed the Lotus TwinCam engine for Colin Chapman, who needed the replacement for the Coventry Climax FWE engine used in Lotus Elite. As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam was carried out by Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE. Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same valve clearance adjustment shims with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production.

<doc id="431637" wikidata="Q860002" url="?curid=431637" title="Cockle (bivalve)">
<text>A cockle is an edible marine bivalve mollusc. Although many small edible bivalves are loosely called cockles, cockles are species in the family Cardiidae.

True cockles live in sandy, sheltered beaches throughout the world. The distinctive rounded shells are bilaterally symmetrical, and are heart-shaped when viewed from the end. Numerous radial, evenly spaced ribs are a feature of the shell in most but not all genera (for an exception, see the genus &quot;Laevicardium&quot;, the egg cockles, which have very smooth shells).

The shell of a cockle is able to close completely (i.e., there is no &quot;gap&quot; at any point around the edge). Though the shell of a cockle may superficially resemble that of a scallop because of the ribs, cockles can be distinguished from scallops morphologically in that cockle shells lack &quot;auricles&quot; (triangular ear-shaped protrusions near the hinge line) and scallop shells lack a pallial sinus. Behaviorally, cockles live buried in sediment, whereas scallops either are free-living and will swim into the water column to avoid a predator, or in some cases live attached by a byssus to a substrate.

The mantle has three apertures (inhalant, exhalant, and pedal) for siphoning water and for the foot to protrude. Cockles typically burrow using the foot, and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water. Cockles are capable of &quot;jumping&quot; by bending and straightening the foot. As is the case in many bivalves, cockles display gonochorism (the sex of an individual varies according to conditions), and some species reach maturity rapidly.

The common name &quot;cockle&quot; is also given by seafood sellers to a number of other small, edible marine bivalves which have a somewhat similar shape and sculpture, but are in other families such as the Veneridae (Venus clams) and the ark clams (Arcidae). Cockles in the family Cardiidae are sometimes referred to as &quot;true cockles&quot; to distinguish them from these other species.

==Species==
There are more than 205 living species of cockles, with many more fossil forms.

The common cockle (&quot;Cerastoderma edule&quot;) is widely distributed around the coastlines of Northern Europe, with a range extending west to Ireland, the Barents Sea in the north, Norway in the east, and as far south as Senegal.

The dog cockle, &quot;Glycymeris glycymeris&quot;, has a similar range and habitat to the common cockle, but is not at all closely related, being in the family Glycymerididae. The dog cockle is edible, but due to its toughness when cooked it is generally not eaten, although a process is being developed to solve this problem.

The blood cockle, &quot;Tegillarca granosa&quot; (not related to the true cockles, instead in the ark clam family, Arcidae), is extensively cultured from southern Korea to Malaysia.

==In cuisine and culture==
Cockles are a popular type of edible shellfish in both Eastern and Western cooking. They are collected by raking them from the sands at low tide. However, collecting cockles is hard work and, as seen from the Morecambe Bay disaster, in which 23 people died, can be dangerous if local tidal conditions are not carefully watched.

In England and Wales, , people are permitted to collect 5 kg of cockles for personal use. Those wishing to collect more than this are deemed to be engaging in commercial fishing and are required to obtain a permit from the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority.

Cockles are a street food in Cambodia where it is usually steamed or boiled and served with a dipping sauce consisting of crushed peppercorns, salt and lime juice.

Cockles are sold freshly cooked as a snack in the United Kingdom, particularly in those parts of the British coastline where cockles are abundant. Boiled, then seasoned with malt vinegar and white pepper, they can be bought from seafood stalls, which also often have for sale mussels, whelks, jellied eels, crabs and shrimp. Cockles are also available pickled in jars, and more recently, have been sold in sealed packets (with vinegar) containing a plastic two-pronged fork. A meal of cockles fried with bacon, served with laverbread, is known as a traditional Welsh breakfast.

Boiled cockles (sometimes grilled) are sold at many hawker centres in Southeast Asia, and are used in &quot;laksa, char kway teow&quot; and steamboat. They are called &quot;kerang&quot; in Malay and &quot;see hum&quot; in Cantonese.

In Japan, the Japanese egg cockle (&quot;Laevicardium laevigatum&quot;) is used to create torigai sushi.

A study conducted in England in the early 1980s showed a correlation between the consumption of cockles, presumed to be incorrectly processed, and an elevated local occurrence of hepatitis.

Cockles are an effective bait for a wide variety of sea fishes. The folk song &quot;Molly Malone&quot; is also known as &quot;Cockles and Mussels&quot; because the title character&#x27;s sale of the two foods is referred to in the song&#x27;s refrain. The shells of cockles are mentioned in the English nursery rhyme &quot;Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary&quot;. Cockles are also eaten by the indigenous peoples of North America.

==Alternative meanings==
The common English phrase &quot;&quot;, is used to mean that a feeling of deep-seated contentment has been generated.

Differing derivations of this phrase have been proposed, either directly from the perceived heart-shape of a cockleshell, or indirectly (the scientific name for the type genus of the family is &quot;Cardium&quot;, from the Latin for heart), or from the Latin diminutive of the word heart, corculum. Another proposed derivation is from the Latin for the ventricles of the heart, &quot;cochleae cordis&quot;, where the second word is an inflected form of &quot;cor&quot;, heart, while &quot;cochlea&quot; is the Latin for snail.

<doc id="431641" wikidata="Q4909226" url="?curid=431641" title="Bill Griffiths (poet)">
<text>Brian William Bransom Griffiths (20 August 1948 – 13 September 2007), known as Bill Griffiths, was a poet and Anglo-Saxon scholar associated with the British Poetry Revival.

==Overview==
Griffiths was born in Kingsbury, Middlesex, England. As a teenager, he became a Hells Angel; his experiences with bikers provided material for many early poems. From 1971, these poems were published in &quot;Poetry Review&quot;, under the editorship of Eric Mottram, and by Bob Cobbing&#x27;s Writers Forum. He also collaborated on a number of performance poetry pieces with Cobbing and others.

Griffiths soon started his own imprint, Pirate Press, which published work by himself and other like-minded poets. In addition to Cobbing and other Writers Forum poets, Griffiths listed his early influences as Michael McClure, Muriel Rukeyser, John Keats, George Crabbe, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Old English poetry.

In 1987, he obtained a Ph.D. in Old English from King&#x27;s College London. He published a number of editions and translations of Old English texts and authored &quot;Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Magic&quot;.

Griffiths was a prolific poet who published widely in Britain and the United States. In later years he lived in Seaham, County Durham, and ran Amra Press, which published his poetry and books of local studies.

Griffiths&#x27; books of poetry from other publishers include &quot;A Tract Against The Giants&quot; (Coach House Press, Toronto, 1984), &quot;Rousseau and the Wicked&quot; (Invisible Books, London, 1996), &quot;Etruscan Reader 5&quot; (with Tom Raworth and Tom Leonard) (Etruscan Books, Buckfastleigh, 1997), &quot;Nomad Sense&quot; (Talus Editions, London, 1998), &quot;A Book of Spilt Cities&quot; (Etruscan Books, 1999), &quot;Ushabtis&quot; (Talus, 2001) and &quot;Durham and other sequences&quot; (West House Books, 2002). A substantial collection of his work was also published in &quot;Future Exiles&quot; (Paladin 1992). In 2010, Reality Street released &quot;Collected Earlier Poems (1966 – 80)&quot;.

==Life, work, and scholarship==
Beginning in 1996 and up until his death, Griffiths worked with Bill Lancaster at the Centre for Northern Studies at Northumbria University, Newcastle. He became a highly active assistant editor to Lancaster&#x27;s &quot;Northern Review, a Journal of Regional and Cultural Affairs&quot;, which lasted ten years. This was a remarkably productive period for Griffiths which saw the publishing of a series of books on north east dialect, beginning with &quot;North East Dialect, Survey and Word list&quot; and &quot;North East Dialect, the Texts&quot; in 1998. Published by the Centre for Northern Studies, these ran to several editions before culminating in &quot;A Dictionary of North East Dialect&quot; by Northumbria University Press in 2004. The Dictionary attracted national attention and was hailed as a landmark in the history of English dialects. Griffiths was able to draw upon his vast scholarship of Saxon literature and Old English, providing sophisticated etymologies that drew upon sources as far back as the eighth century.

The centre was awarded a major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2005 to continue dialect research which facilitated the publication by Northumbria University Press of three more volumes of dialect studies: &quot;Stotties and Spicecake, the Story of North East Cooking&quot;, &quot;Pitmatic: the talk of the North East Coalfield&quot; (a volume that was featured heavily in the media and is credited with capturing for posterity the rapidly disappearing yet distinctive dialect of the northern coalfields), and &#x27;Fishing and Folk: Life and Dialect on the North Sea Coast&#x27;, this last published posthumously in 2008.

Griffiths was working with Bill Lancaster at the time of his death to secure funding for another dialect project on children&#x27;s games and pastimes. In 2003, the centre was commissioned by Sage/Music North to catalogue the archive of Northern Sinfonia and produce a history of the orchestra for the opening of the Sage music centre. A highly skilled archivist and talented classical musician, Griffiths was considered the ideal person to do this work which was completed ahead of schedule. Subsequently, &quot;Northern Sinfonia, a Magic of its Own&quot;, was published in 2004. His last work at the centre was the cataloguing of the T. Dan Smith archive of taped recordings.

Of tangential interest to these projects, it could be noted that Griffiths organised an exhibition in his adopted home of Seaham which was seen by the Queen on her Golden Jubilee Tour and he published numerous small books and pamphlets dealing with his adopted community.

<doc id="431646" wikidata="Q282493" url="?curid=431646" title="Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March">
<text>Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and Earl of Ulster (1 February 135227 December 1381) was an English magnate who was appointed Lieutenant of Ireland, but died after only two years in the post. 

==Early life==
He was the son of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, and his wife Philippa, daughter of William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and his wife Catherine Grandison.

An infant at the death of his father, Edmund, as a ward of the crown, was placed by Edward III of England under the care of William of Wykeham and Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The position of the young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary influence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important by his marriage on 24 August 1369 at the age of 17 to the 14-year-old Philippa, the only child of the late Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the second son of Edward III.

Lionel&#x27;s late wife, Elizabeth, had been daughter and heiress of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and Lionel had himself been created Earl of Ulster before his marriage. Edmund inherited the title Earl of Ulster on Lionel&#x27;s death. Therefore, the Earl of March not only represented one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in right of his wife Philippa, but Philippa&#x27;s line was also the second most senior line of descent in the succession to the crown, after Edward, the Black Prince and his son, King Richard II of England. John of Gaunt, younger brother of Prince Edward, had become the 1st Duke of Lancaster and thus the source of the House of Lancaster&#x27;s claim to the throne.

This marriage had, therefore, far-reaching consequences in English history, ultimately giving rise to the claim of the House of York to the crown of England contested in the Wars of the Roses between the Yorks and the Lancasters; Edward IV being descended from the second adult son of Edward III as the great-great-grandson of Philippa, countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund of Langley, the first Duke of York and the fourth adult son of Edward III. Edmund Mortimer&#x27;s son Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, would become heir presumptive to the English crown during the reign of Richard II.

==Political advancement==
Mortimer, now styled Earl of March and Ulster, became Marshal of England in 1369, and was employed in various diplomatic missions during the next following years. He was a member of the committee appointed by the Peers to confer with the Commons in 1373the first instance of such a joint conference since the institution of representative parliaments on the question of granting supplies for John of Gaunt&#x27;s war in France.

He participated in the opposition to Edward III and the court party, which grew in strength towards the end of the reign, taking the popular side and being prominent in the Good Parliament of 1376 among the lords who supported the Prince of Wales and opposed the Court Party and John of Gaunt. The Speaker of the House of Commons in this parliament was March&#x27;s steward, Peter de la Mare, (1294-1387 of Little Hereford, Hereford), who firmly withstood John of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting the impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring the banishment of the king&#x27;s mistress, Alice Perrers. March was a member of the administrative council appointed by the same parliament after the death of Edward, the Black Prince to attend the king and advise him in all public affairs.

Following the end of the Good Parliament, its acts were reversed by John of Gaunt, March&#x27;s steward was jailed, and March himself was ordered to inspect Calais and other remote royal castles as part of his duty as Marshal of England. March chose instead to resign from the post.

===Sent to govern Ireland===
On the accession of Richard II, a minor, in 1377, the Earl became a member of the standing council of government; though as the husband of the heir-presumptive to the crown he wisely refrained from claiming any actual administrative office. The richest and most powerful person in the realm was, however, the king&#x27;s uncle John of Gaunt, whose jealousy led March to accept the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1379. 

March succeeded in asserting his authority in eastern Ulster, but failed to subdue the O&#x27;Neills farther west. Proceeding to Munster to put down the turbulent southern chieftains, March was killed at Cork on 27 December 1381. He was buried in Wigmore Abbey, of which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa was also interred.

==Children==
The earl had two sons and two daughters:
*Elizabeth (1371–1417), married Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, and had issue. She may have later married Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys and had issue.
*Roger (1374–1398), succeeded him as 4th Earl of March and Ulster; married Alianore Holland and had issue.
*Edmund (1376–1409), married Catrin ferch Owain Glyndŵr and had issue.
*Philippa (1375–1401), married firstly John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke; after his death in 1389 she became the second wife of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel; she married thirdly Sir Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing.

<text>Vernix caseosa, also known as vernix, is the waxy gray substance found that consumes the skin of newborn human babies. It is produced by dedicated cells and is thought to have some protective roles during fetal development and for a few hours after birth.

==Etymology==
In Latin, &quot;vernix&quot; means &quot;varnish&quot; and &quot;caseosa&quot; means &quot;cheesy&quot;. The term was first published in 1846 in the &quot;Dunglison Dictionary of Medical Sciences&quot;.

==In-utero development==
Vernix is produced during a distinct phase of the epidermal development. Around the 21st week of gestation, periderm cells are being shed and replaced with stratum corneum; these shedding mix with secretions of sebum by the sebaceous glands to form vernix, which gradually covers the body in an anteroposterior and dorsoventral pattern. Vernix, in itself, is also believed to aid in the formation of stratum corneum. By early third trimester, the process is complete.

Soon enough, part of the vernix is emulsified by increasing concentrations of pulmonary surfactants and desiccates, only to be consumed by the fetus; a corresponding increase in amniotic fluid turbidity is noticed.

==Characteristics==

===Composition===
Vernix has a highly variable makeup but is primarily composed of sebum, cells that have sloughed off the fetus&#x27;s skin and shed lanugo hair. Chemically, it is water (80%), lipids (10%) and proteins (10%). The lipids include ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and sterol esters, squalene, and phospholipids; multiple detailed analyses of the polar components have been done. The total fatty acid profile in vernix (either as part of lipids or as fatty acids) contains a variety of less common fatty acids, such as omega-7 polyunsaturated fatty acids or non-methylene-interrupted omega-3 fatty acids. 

The protein composition is relatively understudied. Vernix of term infants has more squalene and a higher wax ester to sterol ester ratio than preterm infants.

===Morphology===
Vernix is composed of mobile corneocytes embedded in an amorphous lipid matrix. Precise biological mechanisms leading to its formation are poorly understood.

The cells are polygonal or ovoid in shape, malleable, and lack nuclei; typical thickness is 1-2 μm. Nuclear ghosts are frequently observed and Acid Phosphatase Activity is nonuniform. Keratin filaments build a scaffold like structure which form a water-storage area. As opposed to stratum corneum, the vernix corneocytes lack desmosomal attachment and the lipid layer is more disordered.

===Physical properties===
Vernix is a white viscous cream-like substance in appearance.

The water is not uniformly distributed throughout, but rather exclusively present in the sponge-like corneocytes; despite its high water content, vernix is non-polar (due to lipids) and more vapor-permeable than stratum corneum.

==Functions==
Vernix appears in all full term infants but with widely varying body-coverage, while premature and post-mature births generally do not display any.

It is theorized (and observed) to serve several purposes:

* Waterproofing the skin, whilst in gestation.
* Lubricating the infant&#x27;s skin, and facilitating easy passage through the birth canal.
*Preventing infections — primarily as a mechanical barrier and secondarily via the presence of lysozyme, lactoferrin and antimicrobial components in peptide layer.
*Moisturizing the stratum corneum whilst in gestation (and controlled drying in post-partum phase).
* Thermoregulation in post-partum phase — evidence is mixed.
*Quick healing of epidermal wounds.
*Development of gut, after intra-uterine consumption.

Electrical isolation of the fetus is also thought to occur due to vernix caseosa (this could affect accurate fECG measurement of fetal heartbeat).

== Medical uses ==
Vernix is used as a reliable site-of-record for measuring cocaine exposure in pregnant women. Using vernix for diagnosing uterine rupture and amniotic fluid embolism has been proposed.

=== Disorders ===
Granuloma and peritonitis of vernix have been observed in Caesarean sections. High volumes of vernix cause Neonatal Aspiration Syndrome.

== Other species ==
Vernix is thought to be unique to human fetal development; in 2018, vernix-like material was reportedly obtained from pups of the California sea lion.

<doc id="431668" wikidata="Q2560049" url="?curid=431668" title="Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)">
<text>Pokémon Trading Card Game is a digital collectible card video game developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. It is an adaptation of the card game of the same name. It was initially released in Japan in December 1998 and internationally in 2000. The game includes the first three sets of the trading card game, as well as exclusive cards not available elsewhere.

A second Game Boy Color game, &quot;Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjo! (Pokémon Card GB2: Here Comes Team Great Rocket!)&quot;, was released in Japan in 2001, having a centered storyline. Although this sequel was not released in North America or Europe, several enthusiasts have released unofficial English translations.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; is a video game simulation of the original tabletop collectible card game with role-playing elements similar to the main &quot;Pokémon&quot; RPG-series. Players control a young boy and must travel around the game world interacting with non-player characters and challenging them to card battles using 60-card decks. During gameplay, the player must defeat eight Club Masters, each with a different deck representing one of the game&#x27;s elemental card types. Finally, the player faces four Grand Masters, and defeating them earns the player the right to inherit four powerful Legendary Cards. A total of 226 cards exist within the game, which include cards from the first three sets of the real-life game, as well as exclusive cards not available outside of the game. The player is given the opportunity to choose one of three starter decks at the start of their journey, each containing Pokémon cards revolving around the three possible starting creatures from &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. As players defeat opponents, they are rewarded with booster packs containing a random assortment of additional cards they may use in their deck, with up to four separate decks able to be saved at a time.

Up to two players may interact with each other using the Game Boy&#x27;s infrared and/or Link Cable to battle or trade cards. As players trade with one another, they are given access to a special feature called &quot;Card Pop!&quot;, which allows them to obtain cards that would otherwise be inaccessible in the main game. This feature is not accessible in the 3DS version.

==Development==

&quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; was co-developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures. Creatures&#x27; official website describes their work on the game as &quot;planning and game design, card design&quot;. Tsunekazu Ishihara, founder of Creatures and designer of the card game, is credited as one of the game&#x27;s producers. Curiously, Hudson is not credited anywhere on the game&#x27;s package, cartridge, or title screen. However, the ending credits list them as the game&#x27;s developer.
Although &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; features most cards from the first three sets of the collectible card game, two real-life cards are absent from the Game Boy Color version: Electrode from the base set, and Ditto from Fossil. The cards were excluded as it was difficult to translate their tabletop effects to the video game engine, but they are replaced by game-exclusive cards of the same Pokémon (the Electrode card was later made available in Japan via an online card shop). The game features cameos from President and CEO of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara as &quot;Mr. Ishihara&quot;, and musician Tomoaki Imakuni under his stage name Imakuni?.

==Release==
The game was revealed in November 1998 and released in Japan on December 18, under the title one month before the tabletop version debuted in English. In September 1999, Nintendo of America announced that they would be releasing an English version in North America with the proposed title of simply &quot;Pokémon Card&quot;. Though initially planned for release the following winter, the game, now known under its finalized title of &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, was pushed back to April 2000, which IGN attributed to the company wanting to focus their efforts on the upcoming &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; for the Nintendo 64. The following February, the game made an appearance at the 2000 Toy Fair in New York City as part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon 2000&quot; interactive line-up along with &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. An exclusive tabletop version promotional card from Wizards of the Coast featuring Meowth was included with the game.

===Re-releases===
The game was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in Europe on July 10, 2014, Australia on July 11, 2014, North America on November 13, 2014, and Japan on December 24, 2014. It was rereleased as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service on August 8, 2023.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; sold 607,193 copies in Japan by the end of 1999, becoming the 20th most-bought console game of that year in the region. It would go on to sell an additional 1.51 million copies during its first year in North America, and received mostly positive reception from critics, earning an 81.25% average score from aggregate review website &quot;GameRankings&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; referred to the game as &quot;a faithful and amusing adaptation of the collectible card game&quot; calling the gameplay &quot;addictive&quot;, but found it to be overall less satisfying than the original &quot;Pokémon&quot; role-playing games, stating that its goal of &#x27;collecting all 226 pieces of paper&#x27; just doesn&#x27;t satisfy like &#x27;catching &#x27;em all&#x27; can and does.&quot; Others, such as &quot;IGN&quot; called the game &quot;a blast to play&quot; and that it offered mostly the same experience as the tabletop version &quot;without the clutter or cost&quot;, yet acknowledged that the video game adaptation could not fully replicate the original given the finite number of cards available. Though the website found its main story to be &quot;simple and basic&quot;, and gameplay to be largely luck-based, it ultimately declared that &quot;whether you like or hate those darn Pokémon... if Nintendo keeps making Pokémon videogames of this quality, those creatures aren&#x27;t going away anytime soon.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 50th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff called it an &quot;excellent addition to &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s Game Boy catalog.&quot;

In a 2009 retrospective of &quot;Pokémon&quot; spin-offs, &quot;IGN&quot; retained their high praise for the game, stating &quot;It was really kind of ridiculous how awesome this game turned out to be...if there was one spin-off [we] could ask Nintendo to reintroduce, it&#x27;d be the TCG game.&quot;

===Censorship===
The game was banned in Saudi Arabia because it supposedly promoted Zionism. According to Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game and cards have symbols that are &quot;the star of David, which everyone knows is connected to international Zionism and is Israel&#x27;s national emblem&quot;.

==Sequel==
, released March 28, 2001, is a Japanese-exclusive sequel to the original &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, also for the Game Boy Color. Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures, but unlike its predecessor, it was only published by The Pokémon Company, which also marks the first time a &quot;Pokémon&quot; game was ever published by The Pokémon Company. It was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose one of two genders for the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player&#x27;s deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack&quot;, bringing the total number of cards to 445.

Like the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game&#x27;s final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed &quot;likely&quot; by website &quot;IGN&quot; in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan. &quot;Pokémon Card GB2&quot; earned a 29 out of 40 score from Japanese &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; magazine.

<text>The Northeastern United States (also referred to as the Northeast, the East Coast, or the American Northeast) is one of the four census regions defined by the United States Census Bureau. Located on the Atlantic coast of North America, the region borders Canada to its north, the Southern United States to its south, the Midwestern United States to its west, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east.

The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau defines the region as including the six New England states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, and three lower North-Eastern states of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Some expanded definitions of the region include Mid-Atlantic locations such as Delaware, Maryland, Northern Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

The region is the base for the Northeast megalopolis, which includes many of the nation&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas, including Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. The megalopolis makes up 67% of the region&#x27;s total population of 57,609,148. The gross domestic product of the region was $5.1 trillion as of 2022 and contains some of the most developed states based on the Human Development Index, with every state above the national average. It is also the most densely populated region in the United States, with . The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Northeast United States as having a total area of , making it the smallest region of the United States by total area.

==History==
===Indigenous people===

Anthropologists recognize the &quot;Northeastern Woodlands&quot; as one of the cultural regions that existed in the Western Hemisphere at the time of European colonists in the 15th and later centuries. Most did not settle in North America until the 17th century. The cultural area, known as the &quot;Northeastern Woodlands&quot;, in addition to covering the entire Northeast U.S., also covered much of what is now Canada and others regions of what is now the eastern United States.

Among the many tribes inhabiting this area were those that made up the Iroquois nations and the numerous Algonquian peoples. In the United States of the 21st century, 18 federally recognized tribes reside in the Northeast. For the most part, the people of the Northeastern Woodlands, on whose lands European fishermen began camping to dry their codfish in the early 1600s, lived in villages, especially after being influenced by agricultural traditions of the Ohio and Mississippi valley societies.

===Colonial history===

All of the U.S. states making up the Northeastern region were among the original Thirteen Colonies, though Maine and Vermont were part of other colonies before the United States became independent in the American Revolution. The two cultural and geographic regions that form parts of the Northeastern region have distinct histories. The first European explorer known to have explored the Atlantic shoreline of the Northeast since the Norse was Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. His ship &quot;La Dauphine&quot; explored the coast from what is now known as Florida to New Brunswick.

The first Europeans to settle and colonize New England were Pilgrims from England, who landed in present-day Massachusetts in 1620. The Pilgrims arrived on the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; and founded Plymouth Colony so they could practice religion freely. Ten years later, a larger group of Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston to form Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1636, colonists established Connecticut Colony and Providence Plantations.

Providence was founded by Roger Williams, who was banished by Massachusetts for his beliefs in freedom of religion, and it was the first colony to guarantee all citizens freedom of worship. Anne Hutchinson, who was also banished by Massachusetts, formed the town of Portsmouth. Providence, Portsmouth and two other towns (Newport and Warwick) consolidated to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

Henry Hudson explored the area of present-day New York in 1609 and claimed it for the Netherlands. His journey stimulated Dutch interest, and the area became known as New Netherland. In 1625, the city of New Amsterdam (the location of present-day New York City) was designated the capital of the province. The Dutch New Netherland settlement along the Hudson River and, for a time, the New Sweden settlement along the Delaware River divided the English settlements in the north and the south. In 1664, Charles II of England formally annexed New Netherland and incorporated it into the English colonial empire. The territory became the colonies of New York and New Jersey. New Jersey was originally split into East Jersey and West Jersey until the two were united as a royal colony in 1702.

New England played a prominent role in early American education. Starting in the 17th century, the larger towns in New England opened grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school. The first public school in the English colonies was the Boston Latin School, founded in 1635. In 1636, the colonial legislature of Massachusetts founded Harvard College, the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.

In 1681, William Penn, who wanted to give Quakers a land of religious freedom, founded Pennsylvania and extended freedom of religion to all citizens.

Penn strongly desired access to the sea for the Province of Pennsylvania and leased what then came to be known as the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot; from the Duke. Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682.

By 1704, the province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle, Delaware. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738, both New York and New Jersey shared a governor. Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.

=== American Revolution ===
The beginnings of the American Revolutionary War would be in the Northeast, specifically in Massachusetts. The Battles of Lexington and Concord in northeast of Boston would be the first military engagements between the Revolutionaries and the British. Many of the major battles of the revolution would be fought in the Northeast. The British would evacuate Boston in early-1776 and would move to capture New York City.

The revolutionaries were pushed to the Delaware River before suddenly moving forward against the British in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton. A stalemate was reached in 1778, between the British and American Revolutionaries and continued until the end of the war in 1783. The war would move to southern states and eventually conclude with the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia.

==== Formation of the United States of America ====
The idea of an independent United States of America, with the designs of its government would be created primarily in the Northeast in a series of declarations, constitutions, and documents. The Continental Congresses would meet in Philadelphia, which would produce the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. Following the American Revolution, the capital of the newly formed United States would move around in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It was based in New York City from 1785 until 1790, when it was moved to Congress Hall in Philadelphia, where it remained for a decade, until 1800, when the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C. was completed.

The Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia, where the new United States Constitution was drafted in 1787. 6 of the first 13 states to ratify the new constitution would be in the Northeast, with the last of the original 13, Rhode Island, ratifying the constitution in 1790. Vermont would be admitted in 1791 as the 14th state. The first Congress would convene in Federal Hall in New York City in March 1789.

=== Early and mid-19th century ===

Following the revolution the Northeast would see small skirmishes like the Whiskey Rebellion in western parts of Pennsylvania. Many northeastern states would continue trading with the British and other European powers. Tensions between the United States and Europe (specifically Britain) would sour in the lead up to the War of 1812.

This caused certain trade merchants to meet in Hartford to propose succeeding from the United States. The War of 1812 would see less fighting in the Northeast and instead more fighting in western and southern areas. A failed invasion of Canada and the occupation of Maine would be some of the major conflicts during the war. The war would end in 1815 and most of the Northeast has not seen any major conflict since then.

The American Industrial Revolution was launched in Blackstone Valley in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where textile mills spread across New England, and in eastern Pennsylvania, where coal, steel, and industrialization launched the nation&#x27;s manufacturing sector.

After the end of the War of 1812, industry boomed in the Northeast in the early and middle parts of the 19th century. With the construction of railroad and canals crossing the northeast and the rise of western territories and resources from the south, the Northeast experienced the development of new industries and a fast-growing population. Many of the coastal cities, including Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia, served as ocean trade ports for American goods.

Cities, including Allentown, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Rochester, and Syracuse, were settled and emerged as major industrial centers.

By 1860, New York City, based on its present-day boundaries, was the first U.S. city to reach a population exceeding one million. Due to the settlement of the Midwest and Great Plains, agriculture would collapse in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, with many farms being abandoned by the end of the century, returning to rural forest.

Conflicts with the south over the spread of slavery would become a large factor in the start of the American Civil War, between the United States (western and Northeastern states) and the Confederacy (southeastern states). The admission of Maine as a free state in exchange for Missouri becoming a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise in 1820 would settle the final boundaries of the Northeastern states.

The Mason-Dixon line would be established as the border of slavery, following the border of Pennsylvania and Delaware/Maryland. Abolitionist movements would start in the Northeast and Midwest and would become prominent towards the mid-19th century, these groups advocated the shrinking or banning of slavery in the United States. Some Northeastern states still had small amounts of slaves into the 1850s, though some would ban it during the decade.

The election of 1860 led to the start of the Civil War; southern states seceded from the United States in late-1860 and early-1861. States like Maryland and Delaware would remain in the union, even with slavery still legal. For the first two years, the eastern theater of the war would remain in Virginia and Maryland, but in 1863 the war would reach its northeastern most extent in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg is considered a turning point in the Civil War, seeing the end of the Confederate push northwards.

While all Northeastern states would remain in the United States during the war, conflicts did arise, like the New York draft riots in 1863. The war would end in 1865 with the United States taking back control of Southern states.

=== Industrial Revolution and modern times ===
Following the Civil War, the Northeast would see a large economic boom and would become one of the most industrialized regions in the world. Many technological innovations would be made in the Northeast during this time. The Second Industrial Revolution would see the northeast grow massively, even more so than before the Civil War. Many cities in the Northeast would explode in population, with cities like Philadelphia and New York climbing over one million people, while other cities like Buffalo, Boston, and Pittsburgh would rise above half a million during this time.

New York City eventually grew to become one of the largest cities in the world by 1900. With the American involvement in both World Wars, the Northeast would become a large base of war production, with the Brooklyn Naval Yard producing many navy ships. Many worker strikes would occur in the states, including the Homestead strike in 1892. Many of these cities would see a peak population and industrial output in the aftermath of World War II in the 1950s.

Starting in the 1950s and continuing into the 21st century, a large industrial decline in the Northeast resulted in a depopulation of many Northeastern cities, many of which had not yet recovered from it into the 21st century. This led to the rise of programs of urban renewal and demolition of large parts of Northeastern cities during the mid and late 20th century. There has also been a large population shift to the Sun Belt states starting in the 1960s.

New York state lost its claim to being the most populated state after it was surpassed by California in the 1970s. Some Northeastern cities, including New York City, have recovered from its decline in the mid-20th century. Many new information and service industries have risen in the northeast, which has led to a boom in the 21st century in some cities in the Northeast like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Some other cities like Hartford, Syracuse, and Buffalo still are declining though in the 21st century. Hurricane Sandy would impact much of the northeast in 2012, severely damaging much of the coast and causing flooding inland. The hurricane would directly impact New Jersey and caused large amounts of flooding in New York City.

Although the first settlers of New England were motivated by religion, since the 21st century, New England had become one of the least religious parts of the United States. In a 2009 Gallup survey, less than half of residents in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont reported religion as an important part of their daily life. In a 2010 Gallup survey, less than 30% of residents in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts reported attending church weekly, giving them the lowest church attendance among U.S. states.

==Geography==

The vast area from central Virginia to northern Maine, and from western Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east, have all been loosely grouped into the Northeast at one time or another.
The U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s definition of the Northeast includes nine states: Maine, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.

The region is often subdivided into New England, the six states east of New York state and the Mid-Atlantic states of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. This definition has been essentially unchanged since 1880 and is widely used as a standard for data tabulation.

The U.S. Census Bureau has acknowledged the obvious limitations of this definition and the potential merits of a proposal created after the 1950 census, that would include changing regional boundaries to include Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. with the Mid-Atlantic states, but ultimately decided that &quot;the new system did not win enough overall acceptance among data users to warrant adoption as an official new set of general-purpose State groupings. The previous development of many series of statistics, arranged and issued over long periods of time on the basis of the existing State groupings, favored the retention of the summary units of the current regions and divisions.&quot; The U.S. Census Bureau confirmed in 1994 that it would continue to &quot;review the components of the regions and divisions to ensure that they continue to represent the most useful combinations of states and state equivalents.&quot;

Many organizations and reference works follow the Census Bureau&#x27;s definition for the region. In the history of the United States, the Mason–Dixon line between Pennsylvania (the North) and Maryland (the South) traditionally divided the regions, but in modern times, various entities define the Northeastern United States in somewhat different ways.

The Association of American Geographers divides the Northeast into two divisions: &quot;New England&quot;, which is the same as the Census Bureau; and it has the same &quot;Middle States&quot; but adds Delaware. Similarly, the Geological Society of America defines the Northeast as these same states but with the addition of Maryland and the District of Columbia.

The narrowest definitions include only the states of New England. Other more restrictive definitions include New England and New York as part of the Northeast United States, but exclude Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

States beyond the Census Bureau definition are included in Northeast Region by various other entities:

* Various organizations include Delaware, Maryland, and the national capital of Washington, D.C.
* The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration include in their Northeast Region Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia.
* The United States Fish and Wildlife Service includes in their Northeast Region: Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, West Virginia, and Virginia.
* The National Park Service includes in their Northeast Region: Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, though small parts are also in the National Capital Region.

=== Topography ===
While most of the Northeastern United States lie in the physiographic region of the Appalachian Highlands, some are also part of the Atlantic coastal plain, which extends south to the southern tip of Florida. The coastal plain areas include Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Long Island in New York, and most of New Jersey, and are generally low and flat with sandy soil and long tidal marsh waterways. The highlands, including the Piedmont and the Appalachian Mountains, are heavily forested, ranging from rolling hills to summits greater than , and pocked with many lakes. The highest peak in the Northeast is Mount Washington in New Hampshire at .

=== Land use ===
, forest-use covered approximately 60% of the Northeastern states, including Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., about twice the national average. About 11% was cropland and another 4% grassland pasture or range. There is also more urbanized land in the Northeast (12%) than any other region in the U.S.

Many parks on a state and national level cover the inland parts of the region. Large parks include the Adirondack Park in northeastern New York, Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont, White Mountain Forest in northern New Hampshire, Baxter State Park in northern Maine, Acadia National Park on the eastern coast of Maine, Allegheny National Forest in northwestern Pennsylvania, and Catskill Park in southern New York. There are also some parks closer to the shore, though these are usually smaller and squeezed in-between urbanized areas. These include the Palisades Park in New Jersey, Fire Island in Long Island, and the Cape Cod shoreline in Massachusetts. The Northeast has 72 National Wildlife Refuges, encompassing more than of habitat and designed to protect some of the 92 different threatened and endangered species living in the region.

=== Climate ===
The climate of the Northeastern United States varies from northernmost state of Maine to its southernmost state in Maryland. The region&#x27;s climate is influenced by its positional western to eastern flow of weather in the lower middle latitudes in the United States. In summer the subtropical high (Bermuda High) moves toward the East Coast, this pumps warm and sultry air toward the Northeast (less so in the far northern areas of northern New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). Summers are normally warm in northern areas to hot in southern areas. Frequent (but brief) thundershowers are common on hot summer days from Connecticut south to Maryland. 

In winter, the subtropical high retreats southeastward, and the polar jet stream moves south bringing colder air masses from up in Canada and more frequent storm systems to the region. Winter often brings both rain and snow as well as surges of both warm and cold air. In the southern part of the Northeast from coastal Rhode Island southwest to eastern Maryland, the Appalachians partially protect these locations from the extreme cold coming from the west and the interior of North America.

The basic climate of the Northeast can be divided into a colder and snowier interior, including western Maryland, most of Pennsylvania, most of North Jersey, Upstate New York, and most of New England, and a milder coastal plain region from Cape Cod and southern Rhode Island southward, including Long Island, Southern Connecticut, New York City, central and southern New Jersey, part of the Pennsylvania portion of the Delaware Valley including Philadelphia, Delaware, and most of Maryland. 

In the latter region the hardiness zone ranges from 7a to 8a. Annual mean temperatures range from the low-to-mid 50s F from Maryland to southern Connecticut, to the 40s F in most of New York State, New England, and northern Pennsylvania.

Most of the Northeast has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa/Dfb/occasional Dfc/Dc&quot;). The northernmost portion of the humid subtropical zone (&quot;Cfa/Do&quot;) begins at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and extreme SW Rhode Island and extends southwestward down the coastal plain to central and southern Maryland. The oceanic climate zone (&quot;Cfb/Do&quot;) only exists on Block Island and Nantucket. It is the only area of the Northeast where all months average between . Cape Cod borders this zone and warm-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfb/Dc&quot;).

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population of the region was 57,609,148, representing 17.38% of the nation&#x27;s total population. With an average of 345.5 people per square mile, the Northeast is 2.5 times as densely populated as the second-most dense region, the South. Since the last century, the U.S. population has been shifting away from the Northeast and Midwest toward the South and West.

The region&#x27;s racial composition as of 2020 was 64.42% white, 11.51% African American, 0.51% Native American, 7.25% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 8.17% from other races, and 8.10% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15.27% of the population. There were 22,418,883 households and 14,189,719 families in 2021. Of the 22,418,883 households, 27.7% included children under the age of 18.

In 2021, the region&#x27;s the population&#x27;s age distribution was 20.5% under age 18, 57.36% from 18 to 62, and 22.1% who were 62 years of age or older. The median age was 40.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males. For every 100 women ages 18 and over, there were 94.3 men.

The median income for a household in the region in 2021 was $77,142, and the median income for a family was $97,347. About 11.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.0% of those under age 18 and 10.4% of those age 65 or over.

The two U.S. Census Bureau divisions in the Northeast, New England and the Mid-Atlantic, rank second and first respectively among the 9 divisions in population density according to the 2013 population estimate. The South Atlantic region (233.1) was very close behind New England (233.2). Due to the faster growth of the South Atlantic region, it will take over the #2 division rank in population density in the next estimate, dropping New England to 3rd position. New England is projected to retain the number 3 rank for many, many years, as the only other lower-ranked division with even half the population density of New England is the East North Central division (192.1) and this region&#x27;s population is projected to grow slowly.


==Economy==

, the Northeast U.S. accounts for approximately 23% of the nation&#x27;s gross domestic product. Due to its vast population and diverse landscapes, the Northeast has a large and robust economy, ranging from financial services in Manhattan, to agriculture in Central Pennsylvania.

=== New York City ===
, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.1 trillion US dollars, ranking it first in the U.S. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have been the eighth-largest economy in the world. Manhattan is considered the world&#x27;s financial center, with many large banks based in Manhattan and some of the largest stock exchanges on Wall Street, like the New York Stock Exchange, it is so prominent that the term &quot;Wall Street&quot; is usually synonymous with finance. Many other companies are based in New York City area, either in Midtown Manhattan, downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City, or the various suburbs, like Stamford or White Plains. Some of the largest companies based in New York City area include, Verizon, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, MetLife, PepsiCo, IBM, Time Warner, Goldman Sachs, and Pfizer. Several technology companies have been founded in New York, or moved their headquarters to New York from other places.

New York City is the nation&#x27;s most populated city, and the New York metropolitan area including and surrounding it is the nation&#x27;s most populated metropolitan region, contributing to a sizable shopping economy, including many large shopping malls and department stores based in the area, such as Macy&#x27;s on 34th Street, Fifth Avenue, and American Dream in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Palisades Center in West Nyack, New York, and the SoNo Collection in Norwalk, Connecticut. The Port of New York and New Jersey, one of the nation&#x27;s largest ports, is located on New York Harbor.

===Philadelphia===
, the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a GMP of $479 billion US dollars, making it the 9th largest economy in the United States. Many large companies are based in Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city, including AmerisourceBergen, Comcast, and DuPont. The Philadelphia Mint is also located in the city.

===Boston===
The Boston metropolitan area is a major center for insurance, finance, and technology, serving as the global headquarters for General Electric, Liberty Mutual, and other large companies.

===Other regions===
Rural regions and states, including most of Upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, rely more on agriculture, logging, mining, and tourism to help boost their local and statewide economies. Many national and state parks in the region generate lots of tourism, especially during fall months. The logging industry is especially prominent in Maine, making up a large part of Northern Maine&#x27;s economy.

Many Northeastern states have very large economies and are highly developed. As of 2022, the per capita gross domestic products for these states are:

# New York, US$2.1 trillion, per capita $105,226
# Pennsylvania, US$931 billion, per capita $71,825
# New Jersey, US$753 billion, per capita $81,307
# Massachusetts, US$693 billion, per capita $99,274
# Connecticut, US$323 billion, per capita $89,301
# New Hampshire, US$106 billion, per capita $76,008
# Maine, US$85 billion, per capita $61,491
# Rhode Island, US$72 billion per capita $65,879
# Vermont, US$41 billion, per capita $63,275

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees 34 nuclear reactors, eight for research or testing and 26 for power production in the Northeastern United States.

==Transportation==
===Rail systems===

=== History ===

The Northeast has been a place for many firsts in transportation in the US, from the first commercial railroad in the US in Milton, Massachusetts (Granite Railway), first rapid transit system (MBTA Green Line), the first limited access road was the Bronx River Parkway, opened in 1922, New York is also where the first urban freeway was built in the late-1930s. (FDR Drive) The northeast would also be home to some of the first major freeway revolts in Greenwich Village, and would see the first major highway teardown (Miller Highway) in the 1970s.

Before European settlement, most of the Northeast was loosely connected by Native American trails, some of which would be incorporated into early-European settlement roads and turnpikes. One major early road was the Boston Post Road, connecting New York City and Boston along the Connecticut and Rhode Island coasts. Later these roads would be included in the King&#x27;s Highway, spanning most of the east coast. Smaller turnpikes would also connect cities across the northeast. These roads would prove essential to moving goods across the English colonies in the 18th century and would later play a large part in the American Revolution.

The region saw a boom in canal-building in the early-19th century, with a major canal being the Erie Canal, opened in 1825, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and Atlantic Ocean through Western New York. The first railroads would be built in the late-1820s and would explode in mileage in the mid to late 19th century. Places like Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Newark, and Pittsburgh would become large water and rail hubs during the Industrial Revolution and would see tremendous booms in population and use.

Many large rivers in the northeast like the Hudson and Delaware would be slowly crossed with bridges starting in the 1800s, with the first fixed crossing of the Hudson River south of Albany being the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge, opened in 1889. The Delair Bridge, which would connect Philadelphia with New Jersey was opened six years later in 1896. The first crossing of the Hudson River into New York City would be the series of Hudson River PATH tunnels, being opened in 1908 and 1909. The first major vehicle tunnel would be the Holland Tunnel, opened up in 1927.

The start of highway construction would be the Bronx River Parkway and Long Island Motor Parkway, both of which started construction in the early-1900s. The rise of Robert Moses in New York would see the construction of many major road bridges and highways crossing the city and metro area. East River Drive (eventually renamed FDR Drive), was built along the corresponding river in Manhattan. The mid-20th century would see the rise of urban and suburban freeways and the decline of passenger and freight rail, with many lesser used tracks being abandoned or torn up during this time. It would also see the original Pennsylvania Station demolished in Midtown Manhattan during the mid-1960s. The construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway in New York, Central Artery in Boston, and the Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia tore up many ethnic and minority neighborhoods in the name of urban renewal. Many other highways were proposed during this era, like the Lower Manhattan Expressway and the Inner Belt in Boston, which were not built due to fierce highway revolts and rising costs. After the major highway revolts and rise of environmental concerns, new highway and interstate projects were mostly cancelled or shortened in the Northeast by the 1990s.

Despite the lack of new major road projects in the Northeast, the region has still continued to grow in population, resulting in the rise of alternative forms of transport like HOV lanes or commuter rails. This has led to the Northeast having one of the highest transit usage percentages in North America, with the Long Island Railroad being the most used commuter rail in the continent. One exception was the Big Dig, a major road project that would tear down the former elevated Central Artery (I-93) and instead tunnel it (and widen). It would also construct a new Charles River bridge and the Ted Williams Tunnel (I-90). This would end up becoming one of the costliest construction projects in the world, costing $21 billion adjusted to 2020 inflation. The former highway&#x27;s path would become the Rose Kennedy Greenway, a large public park. The Sheridan Expressway (former I-895) was also rebuilt into a boulevard in the late-2010s. Rochester, New York has torn down the Inner Loop due to low traffic and to reunify neighborhoods in downtown and to create developable space.

== Culture ==

One geographer, Wilbur Zelinsky, asserts that the Northeast region lacks a unified cultural identity, but has served as a &quot;culture hearth&quot; for the rest of the nation. Several much smaller geographical regions within the Northeast have distinct cultural identities.

===Landmarks===
Almost half of the National Historic Landmarks maintained by the National Park Service are located in the Northeastern United States.

===Religion===
According to a 2009 Gallup poll, the Northeastern states differ from most of the rest of the U.S. in religious affiliation, generally reflecting the descendants of immigration patterns of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with many Catholics arriving from Ireland, Italy, French Canada - Quebec, Portugal and east-central Europe. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey are the only states in the nation where Catholics outnumber Protestants and other Christian denominations. More than 20% of respondents in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont declared no religious identity. Compared to other U.S. regions, the Northeast, along with the Pacific Northwest, has had the lowest regular religious service attendance and the fewest people for whom religion is an important part of their daily lives as of 2015.

===Sports===
The Northeast region is home to numerous professional sports franchises in the &quot;Big Four&quot; leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB), with more than 100 championships collectively among them. Professional sports leagues such as the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Soccer (MLS), and National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), have team franchises in following Northeastern cities:

* New York metropolitan area: Giants, Jets (NFL), Yankees, Mets (MLB), Knicks, Nets (NBA), Rangers, Islanders, Devils (NHL), City FC or Pigeons, Red Bulls (MLS), Liberty (WNBA), Gotham (NWSL)
* Philadelphia: Eagles (NFL), Phillies (MLB), 76ers (NBA), Flyers (NHL), Union (MLS)
* Boston: Patriots (NFL), Red Sox (MLB), Celtics (NBA), Bruins (NHL), Revolution (MLS)
* Pittsburgh: Steelers (NFL), Pirates (MLB), Penguins (NHL)
* Buffalo: Bills (NFL), Sabres (NHL)
* Uncasville: Sun (WNBA)

Notable golf tournaments in the Northeastern United States include The Northern Trust, Travelers Championship, and Atlantic City LPGA Classic. The US Open, held in New York, is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments.

Notable Northeastern motorsports tracks include Watkins Glen International, Pocono Raceway, New Hampshire Motor Speedway and Lime Rock Park, which have hosted Formula One, IndyCar, NASCAR and International Motor Sports Association races. Also, drag strips such as Englishtown, Epping and Reading have hosted NHRA national events. Belmont Park at New York hosts the Belmont Stakes horse races, which is part of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.

The region has also been noted for the prevalence of the traditionally Northeastern sports of ice hockey and lacrosse.

==Politics==

The Northeastern United States tended to vote Republican in federal elections through the first half of the 20th century, but the region has since the 1990s shifted to become the most Democratic region in the nation, along with the West Coast. Results from a 2008 Gallup poll indicated that eight of the top ten Democratic states were located in the region, with every Northeastern state having a Democratic Party affiliation advantage of at least ten points. The following table demonstrates Democratic support in the Northeast as compared to the remainder of the nation.

The following table of United States presidential election results since 1920 illustrates that over the past eight presidential elections, only three Northeastern states supported a Republican candidate. New Hampshire voted for George W. Bush in 2000; Pennsylvania and Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district voted for Donald Trump in 2016, Maine&#x27;s 2nd district voted for Trump again in 2020, and 2024 saw Trump take back Pennsylvania and again hold on to Maine&#x27;s 2nd district. 2004 is so far the only election in U.S. history in which the winner did not win any northeastern state. Bolded entries indicate that party&#x27;s candidate also won the general election.
The following table shows the breakdown of party affiliation of governors, attorneys general, state legislative houses and U.S. congressional delegation for the Northeastern states for the upcoming term beginning in January 2025. (Demographics reflect registration-by-party figures from that state&#x27;s registered voter statistics.)

<text>The Denmark Strait is the strait that separates Greenland from Iceland. The Norwegian island of Jan Mayen lies northeast of the strait.

==Geography==
The strait connects the Greenland Sea, an extension of the Arctic Ocean, to the Irminger Sea, a part of the Atlantic Ocean. It is long. The narrowest part of the strait is wide and lies between Straumnes, on Iceland&#x27;s Hornstrandir peninsula, and Cape Tupinier, on Greenland&#x27;s Blosseville Coast. According to the International Hydrographic Organization, the dividing line between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans runs from Straumnes to Cape Nansen, southwest of Cape Tunipier.

==Hydrography==
The narrow depth, where the Greenland–Iceland Rise runs along the bottom of the sea, is . The cold East Greenland Current passes through the strait and carries icebergs south into the North Atlantic. It hosts important fisheries.

The world&#x27;s largest known underwater waterfall, known as the Denmark Strait cataract, flows down the western side of the Denmark Strait.

==Battle of the Denmark Strait==

During World War II, the Battle of the Denmark Strait took place on 24 May 1941. The sank the British battlecruiser , which exploded with the loss of all but three of her 1,418 crew; the battleship was seriously damaged in the engagement. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was able to enter the Atlantic through the Strait, but damage sustained in the battle—combined with British aircraft search-and-destroy missions—led to her own sinking three days later.

<doc id="431685" wikidata="Q1844760" url="?curid=431685" title="Meeting People Is Easy">
<text>Meeting People Is Easy is a 1998 British documentary film by Grant Gee that follows the English rock band Radiohead on the world tour for their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. It received positive reviews and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Film at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. It sold more than half a million copies on VHS and DVD.

==Summary==
&quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; documents the promotion and tour for Radiohead&#x27;s third album, &quot;OK Computer,&quot; which began on 22 May 1997 in Barcelona, Spain. It comprises footage of Radiohead working on music, filming music videos and promotional material, giving interviews and performing. It includes footage of the filming of the &quot;No Surprises&quot; music video and the failed studio session for the song &quot;Man of War&quot;, and a performance of &quot;Karma Police&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

The documentary captures the band members&#x27; stress during the tour, which the bassist, Colin Greenwood, later said was the lowest point of Radiohead&#x27;s career. The journalist Alex Ross described the film as &quot;a kind of counterstrike against the music press, recording scores of pointless interviews with dead-tired members of the band&quot;.

Radiohead&#x27;s co-manager, Chris Hufford, said the film was &quot;psychologically honest&quot; and that he found it depressing to watch: &quot;Seeing that going on where there should have been pride and joy. I knew they were readdressing how they looked to themselves, each other and the outside world.&quot; The drummer, Philip Selway, said the film was the result of how Gee perceived the period, and that other times on the tour were &quot;much lighter&quot;.

In 2020, the singer, Thom Yorke, wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve never really watched this since it was completed. I couldn&#x27;t because it would send me back down a mental hole that would take me days to recover from. But now skimming through it looks kind of funny, sad and alarming at the same time. I still recognise us all. But would have had some strong words for myself at this point.&quot;

==Production==
According to the director, Grant Gee, Radiohead sat in hotel suites for days giving interviews. To record each interview, Gee &quot;[ran] around, leaving a microphone in one room, going and filming something in another&quot;. He placed surveillance cameras in the band&#x27;s dressing room, which he said foreshadowed the rise of reality television such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;: &quot;We were doing it in a slightly more &quot;arty&quot; way, but it&#x27;s the same ... &quot;Radiohead Big Brother&quot; is what I think of that film in a way.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; was released in the UK on VHS on 30 November 1998, and on DVD on 12 June 2000. It was released in both formats on 18 May 1999 in the United States. It was the first DVD released by Radiohead&#x27;s record label, EMI.

Several television channels broadcast &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; after its release. In the UK, Channel 4 broadcast the film on 6 May 1999. In the US, MTV broadcast a premiere of the film on 16 May 1999, and the Sundance Channel broadcast it nine times during May 2000. After Radiohead&#x27;s new record company, XL, purchased their back catalogue from EMI, Radiohead made &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; available to stream free on their website along with other archived material.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; were positive. It received an average rating of 6.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, giving it a 71% &quot;fresh&quot; rating. The reviewer Jessica Brandt of &quot;theshrubbery.com&quot; gave five out of five. The film critic Daniel Fletcher named &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; one of his ten favourite films. Troy Patterson, a critic for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave it B+, calling it &quot;an expressive mood piece creepy with cosmopolitan paranoia and bracingly somber bombast&quot;.

Bart Blasengame gave the film four out of five, writing: &quot;Instead of taking the usual tour documentary approach and dwelling on individual concerts or behind-the-scenes banter between the band, Gee&#x27;s film focuses on the absurdity of being an important rock band in the current musical landscape—the shallow marketing of the band, the endless stream of redundant interviews, the blinding photo shoots and awkward television appearances.&quot; Kevin Archibald of &quot;IGN&quot; gave it eight out of ten. In 2020, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it &quot;remains a cautionary tale&quot; and wrote that the footage of the &quot;Man of War&quot; recording sessions was a highlight.

&quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot; sold more than half a million copies on DVD and VHS. It was nominated for the &quot;Best Music Film&quot; category at the 2000 Grammy Awards.

<doc id="431695" wikidata="Q1751357" url="?curid=431695" title="Paranoid Android">
<text>&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead, released as the lead single from their third studio album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), on 26 May 1997. The lyrics were written by singer Thom Yorke following an unpleasant experience in a Los Angeles bar. The song is over six minutes long and contains four sections. The name is taken from Marvin the Paranoid Android from the science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy.&quot;

&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; charted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, Radiohead&#x27;s highest-charting position in the UK to date. It received acclaim, with critics claiming it to be the band&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, comparing it to the songs &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen. It has appeared regularly on lists of the best songs of all time, including &quot;NME&quot;″s and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s respective 500 Greatest Songs of All Time lists. Its animated music video, directed by Magnus Carlsson, was placed on heavy rotation on MTV, although the network censored portions containing nudity in the US. At the 1998 Brit Awards, the song was nominated for Best British Single. The track has been covered by artists in a variety of genres. It was included in the 2008 &quot;.&quot;

==Writing and recording==

As with many other &quot;OK Computer&quot; tracks, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; was recorded in St Catherine&#x27;s Court, a 15th-century mansion near the village of St Catherine, near Bath, Somerset. It was produced by Nigel Godrich.

Inspired by the through-composed structure of the Beatles&#x27; 1968 song &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot;, Radiohead fused parts from three different songs. Other inspirations included Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and the work of the Pixies. 

The first version was over 14 minutes long and included a long Hammond organ outro performed by Jonny Greenwood. The guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;We&#x27;d be pissing ourselves while we played. We&#x27;d bring out the glockenspiel and it would be really, really funny.&quot; The singer, Thom Yorke, sarcastically referred to this version as &quot;a Pink Floyd cover&quot;. Greenwood said later that the organ solo was &quot;hard to listen to without clutching the sofa for support&quot;. Godrich said: &quot;Nothing really happened with the outro. It just spun and spun and it got very Deep Purple and went off.&quot; An early extended version was included on the 2019 compilation &quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot;.

Influenced by the editing of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, Radiohead shortened the song to six and a half minutes, with the organ solo replaced with a shorter guitar outro. The bassist, Colin Greenwood, said the band &quot;felt like irresponsible schoolboys ... Nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot; For the ending, Yorke recorded himself shouting gibberish into a Dictaphone. Godrich edited the parts together with tape. He said: &quot;It’s a very hard thing to explain, but it’s all on 24-track and it runs through ... I was very pleased with myself. I sort of stood there and said, &#x27;You guys have &quot;no idea&quot; what I&#x27;ve just done.&#x27; It was pretty clever.&quot; 

The title is taken from Marvin the Paranoid Android from the science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Yorke said the title was a joke: &quot;It was like, &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;m so depressed.&#x27; And I just thought, that&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s how people would &quot;like&quot; me to be ... The rest of the song is not personal at all.&quot;

==Composition==

&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is described as alternative rock, art rock, progressive rock and neo-prog. It has four distinct sections, potentially defining the track as a &quot;rhapsody&quot;, each played in standard tuning, and a time signature, although several three-bar segments in the second section are played in timing. Yorke&#x27;s vocals span from G3 to C5.

The opening is played in the key of G minor with a tempo of 82 beats per minute (BPM), and begins with a mid-tempo acoustic guitar backed by shaken percussion before layered with electric guitar and Yorke&#x27;s vocals. The melody of the opening vocal lines spans an octave and a third.

The second section is written in the key of A minor and begins about two minutes into the song. Although the second section retains the tempo of the first, it differs rhythmically. Ending the second section is a distorted guitar solo by Jonny Greenwood, which lasts from 2:43 to 3:33.

The third section was written by Jonny Greenwood, and reduces the tempo to 62 BPM. The harmonies form a looped chord progression resembling a Baroque passacaglia, with the tonality split between C minor and D minor. This section uses multi-tracked, choral vocal arrangement and according to Dai Griffiths, a &quot;chord sequence [that ordinarily] would sound seedy, rather like something by the band Portishead&quot;.

The fourth and final section, which begins at 5:35, is a brief instrumental reprise of the second movement that serves as a coda. After a second solo, a brief guitar riff is introduced, which Jonny Greenwood says &quot;was something I had floating around for a while and the song needed a certain burn. It happened to be the right key and the right speed and it fit right in.&quot; Jonny Greenwood&#x27;s guitar tone during the solo is achieved by playing through a Mutator effect pedal. The song ends, as does the second section, with a short chromatically descending guitar motif.

The style of the song was likened to Queen by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Mark Kemp, while other critics, including David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jon Lusk of the BBC and Simon Williams of &quot;NME&quot; wrote about its similarity to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is categorised by three distinct moods written in what Yorke referred to as three different states of mind. The lyrics tie in with a number of themes common in &quot;OK Computer&quot;, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke&#x27;s lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers who were high on cocaine. Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. He characterised the woman as &quot;inhuman&quot;, and said &quot;There was a look in this woman&#x27;s eyes that I&#x27;d never seen before anywhere. ... Couldn&#x27;t sleep that night because of it.&quot; The woman inspired the line &quot;kicking squealing Gucci little piggy&quot; in the song&#x27;s second section. Yorke, referring to the line &quot;With your opinion, which is of no consequence at all&quot;, said that &quot;Again, that&#x27;s just a joke. It&#x27;s actually the other way around – it&#x27;s actually &quot;my&quot; opinion that is of no consequence at all.&quot;

==Music video==
Yorke said that many people suggested Radiohead make another &quot;moody and black and dark&quot; music video for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, similar to the video for their single &quot;Street Spirit&quot;. However, Radiohead wanted an entertaining and &quot;sick&quot; video instead. Yorke said: &quot;We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make you laugh.&quot; 

Radiohead commissioned the Swedish animator Magnus Carlsson to make the video. Radiohead were fans of his animated series &quot;Robin.&quot; Jonny Greenwood described Robin as &quot;affectionate&quot; and &quot;vulnerable&quot;, while Yorke said he found Robin &quot;quite the vulnerable character, but he&#x27;s also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again&quot;. At first, Carlsson sought to work on a video for &quot;No Surprises&quot; and was uncertain as to how to approach &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;. To conceive the video, he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, listen to the song on repeat and jot down visual ideas. According to Yorke, the band did not send Magnus the lyrics as they did not want the video to be too literal. The concept for the video was based entirely on the song&#x27;s sound. 

=== Summary ===
Like &quot;Robin&quot;, the &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; video is drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It features Robin and his friend Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids, and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. 

The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they drink while watching a man with a head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O&#x27;Brien said &quot;If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that&#x27;s Colin. It looks nothing like him.&quot; Colin Greenwood said &quot;there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap&quot; and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be &quot;twisted and colourful which is how the song is anyway&quot;. 

=== Reception ===
Yorke was pleased with the video, saying that it &quot;is really about the violence around [Robin], which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he&#x27;s just drinking himself into oblivion. He&#x27;s there, but he&#x27;s not there. That&#x27;s why it works. And that&#x27;s why it does my head in every time I see it.&quot;

While the single did not receive significant radio play in the US, MTV placed its video on high rotation. The version most often shown was edited to remove the mermaids&#x27; bare breasts. Colin Greenwood said, &quot;We would&#x27;ve understood if they had a problem with some guy chopping his arms and legs off, but I mean, a woman&#x27;s breasts! And mermaids as well! It&#x27;s fucked up.&quot; MTV Europe played the video uncut for two weeks because the channel&#x27;s official censor was ill and unable to work. After that time the channel ran the cut version of the video. A later US version of the video has the mermaids wearing bathing suits. 

Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described the video as &quot;bizarre yet fitting&quot;, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said it represented a stunning &quot;psycho-cartoon&quot;. Adrian Glover of &quot;Circus&quot; called the animation incredible and the video &quot;really cool&quot;. The MTV vice president of music Lewis Largent told &quot;Spin:&quot; &quot;You can watch &#x27;Paranoid Android&#x27; a hundred times and not figure it all out.&quot;

==Artwork==

Stanley Donwood worked with Yorke to design the artwork for most of the &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; releases, although both the images and design were ultimately credited to &quot;dumb computers&quot;. The cover illustration accompanying the single depicts a hand-drawn dome that contains the phrase &quot;God loves his children, yeah!&quot;, the last line of the song, written above on the uppermost plane. Images from the &quot;OK Computer&quot; artwork reappear, including a pig and two human figures shaking hands. Writer Tim Footman suggested that these images are borrowed from Pink Floyd, respectively corresponding to the Pink Floyd pigs and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; cover.

The two versions of the single have different messages on the reverse. Both the CD1 and Japanese releases state:

==Release==
While Colin Greenwood said the song was &quot;hardly the radio-friendly, breakthrough, buzz bin unit shifter [radio stations] have been expecting&quot;, Capitol supported Radiohead&#x27;s choice for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; as the lead single from &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Radiohead chose it to prepare listeners for the musical direction of the album. 

&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; was premiered on the BBC Radio 1 programme &quot;The Evening Session&quot; in April 1997, nearly a month before its release as a single. It was released on 26 May 1997. Despite an initial lack of radio play, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; charted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, giving Radiohead their highest singles chart position. As the song&#x27;s popularity grew, Radio 1 played it up to 12 times a day. Yorke described its appearance on Radio 1 as one of his proudest moments of the &quot;OK Computer&quot; era. It also spent two weeks on Australia&#x27;s ARIA Singles Chart, where it reached number 29.

Each release of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; included one or more B-sides. &quot;Polyethylene (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;, included on the CD1, 7-inch vinyl, and Japanese releases of the single, were a multi-section piece formatted much like &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; itself. The first part of the song consists of Yorke&#x27;s vocals over acoustic guitar; the second part contains distorted guitar and organ and uses complex time signature changes. &quot;Pearly*&quot;, featured on the CD1 and Japanese releases of the single, was described by Yorke as a &quot;dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things&quot;. &quot;A Reminder&quot;, which appears on the CD2 release, features fuzzed guitar, thumping drums, and electric piano. According to Yorke, this song was inspired by &quot;this idea of someone writing a song, sending it to someone, and saying: &#x27;If I ever lose it, you just pick up the phone and play this song back to remind me. &quot;Melatonin&quot;, also on the CD2 release, is a synthesiser-based song with lyrics similar to that of a lullaby, but with an undercurrent of menace in lines like &quot;Death to all who stand in your way&quot;. The &quot;OK Computer&quot; track &quot;Let Down&quot; is also included on the Japanese single.

The anime &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot; uses &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; as the main theme. The song is featured in the credits. When Radiohead were asked about it being featured as the theme, they originally declined, but after being shown a preview of the anime they obliged and allowed it to be used. 

== Reception ==
&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; received acclaim. &quot;NME&quot; chose it as its &quot;Single of the Week&quot;, and the journalist Simon Williams described how the song &quot;sprawls out like a plump man on a small sofa, featuring all manner of crypto-flamenco shufflings, medieval wailings, furiously wrenched guitars and ravishingly over-ambitious ideas. Possesses one of the most unorthodox &#x27;axe&#x27; solos known to mankind.&quot; Simon Williams of &quot;NME&quot; described the song as &quot;not unlike &#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27; being played backwards by a bunch of Vietnam vets high on Kings Cross-quality crack&quot;. Kemp praised the mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation to produce &quot;complex tempo changes, touches of dissonance, ancient choral music and a King Crimson-like melodic structure&quot;. Browne wrote of &quot;celestial call-and-response vocal passages, dynamically varied sections, and Thom Yorke&#x27;s high-voiced bleat&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the song unforgettable and an &quot;amazing epic single&quot;.

Several reviewers noted the song&#x27;s ambition. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the song&#x27;s lyrics as a &quot;multipart anti-yuppie anthem whose ambition is anything but ugly&quot;, and Andy Gill wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; could be the most ambitious single since Jimmy Webb&#x27;s &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. Craig McLean of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; as &quot;a titanic guitar opera in three movements and 6½ minutes&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Evan Sawdey called the song &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s &quot;sweeping, multi-tiered centerpiece&quot;, Peter and Jonathan Buckley wrote in &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; that it was the album&#x27;s &quot;breathtaking high point&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; &quot;complex, multi-segmented ... tight, melodic, and muscular&quot;, and said it displayed Radiohead at their most adventurous. Browne admitted that, partially because of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;OK Computer&quot; was significantly more expansive than &quot;The Bends&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the song at number 256 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included the song at number 4 on their &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;. In 2019, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked the song number three on their list of the 20 greatest Radiohead songs, and in 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 40 greatest Radiohead songs.

==Cover versions==
* Jazz pianist Brad Mehldau recorded a nine-minute cover of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; on his album &quot;Largo&quot; (2002), featuring percussionists Jim Keltner and Matt Chamberlain, as well as a horn section. Additionally, Mehldau performed a 19-minute version of the song on &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot; (2004).
* The University of Massachusetts Amherst&#x27;s Minuteman Marching Band covered the song live in a version featuring xylophones, chimes, snare drums, cymbals, bass drum and timpani.
* Numerous Radiohead tribute albums include a version of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, including &quot;Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions of Radiohead&quot; and &quot;Plastic Mutations: The Electronic Tribute to Radiohead&quot;.
* The reggae group Easy Star All-Stars covered &quot;OK Computer&quot; in its entirety for &quot;Radiodread&quot; (2006). Producer Michael G noted that &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; was particularly difficult to arrange for reggae, saying &quot;There are songs like &#x27;Paranoid Android&#x27;, which flips between 4/4 time and 7/8 time about 13 times, and I also had to think about other ways to reinterpret those parts with horns, melodica, organ ... it was a great challenge.&quot;
* Sia covered the song for the neo soul tribute &quot;Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads&quot; (2006), and this version later appeared on &quot;The O.C.&quot; episode &quot;The Chrismukk-huh?&quot;.
* Los Angeles string quartet the Section recorded the song for &quot;Strung Out on OK Computer: The String Quartet Tribute to Radiohead&quot; (2001); half of this quartet went on to form the Section Quartet, who performed &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and the rest of &quot;OK Computer&quot; during two concerts in October 2006.
* Weezer covered &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; in both a live studio version released as a YouTube video and in concerts during their 2011 summer tour. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Tom Breihan called the Weezer cover &quot;a &quot;fucking weird&quot; experience&quot;, and Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticised the song as &quot;mainly boring&quot; for not venturing far enough from Weezer&#x27;s traditional sound.
* The Montreal duo Stick&amp;Bow recorded a 6:14 cover of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; on their 2019 album Resonance, arranged for the cello and marimba.
* On 23 October 2020, Australian indie rock band Ball Park Music performed a cover of the song live for Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; segment, alongside a performance of their track &quot;Cherub&quot;. &quot;Music Feeds&quot; thought the cover &quot;play[ed] it fairly safe&quot;, additionally stating the cover had been &quot;execute[d] with such finesse&quot;, whilst &quot;Junkee&quot; felt it was &quot;performed with energy and enthusiasm, by a bunch of committed and attentive musicians&quot;.

<text>The University of the West of Scotland (), formerly the University of Paisley, is a public university with four campuses in south-western Scotland, in the towns of Paisley, Blantyre, Dumfries and Ayr, as well as a campus in London, England. The present institution dates from August 2007, following the merger of the University of Paisley with Bell College, Hamilton. It can trace its roots to the late 19th century, and has undergone numerous name changes and mergers over the last century, reflecting its gradual expansion throughout the west of Scotland region.

The university currently has students, with approximately 1300 staff, spread across four schools of learning. The Crichton Campus in Dumfries is maintained in partnership with a number of other institutions, including the University of Glasgow.

==History==
===Origins of the University of Paisley===

At the time of the Industrial Revolution, Paisley was renowned for thread weaving. The Coats mill was run by two brothers, Peter and Thomas Coats. These men, children of the Scottish Enlightenment, had liberal ideals and became noted philanthropists. As members of the Philosophical Institution, founded in 1808 the Coats donated a museum and library to the town, funded the building of the Coats observatory and promoted education throughout Paisley.

The Philosophical Institution, helped establish the School of Arts in 1836, which become a Government School of Design in 1846, one of twenty similar institutions established in UK manufacturing centres from 1837 to 1851. They were set up to improve the quality of the country&#x27;s product design through training in design for industry. Peter Coats was director of both Paisley Philosophical Institution and the Government School of Design. Later, the Design schools were renamed Schools of Art, and once again as Schools of Art and Science.

In 1897 Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll laid the foundation stone of a grand new building for the college. The design was the winner of an architectural competition and partially funded by local industrialists (Peter Brough and Thomas Coats both contributed).

By the start of the twentieth century, Paisley Technical College and School of Art, (as it was known from 1904) was a centre for teaching the University of London External Programme. Perhaps the most famous principal of the college was Lewis Fry Richardson, FRS principal from 1922 to 1940. A mathematician, physicist, meteorologist, psychologist and pacifist who pioneered modern mathematical techniques of weather forecasting, as well as the application of similar techniques to studying war. He also carried out ground breaking work on fractals.

Throughout the first half of the century the institution had a financial struggle. After the second world war Central Institution status provided a regular Government income but unfortunately also meant closing the school of Art, and ceding students to Glasgow School of Art. The new entity thus became Paisley College of Technology; a Government funded Central Institution in 1950. In the 1960s a large physical expansion took place alongside the Neo-Classical original building on the main 20 acre (81,000 m2) Paisley town centre site.

At the time Paisley, in common with other Central Institutions and the former Polytechnics, already offered a range of degrees under the Council for National Academic Awards. With the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the Paisley College of Technology was granted the title University of Paisley and was established as a university with a royal charter and degree awarding powers.

===Merger with Craigie College of Education===

The establishment of the University of Paisley prompted a merger with Craigie College of Education in Ayr in 1993, and led to the incorporation of nursing colleges in the town. The Ayr Campus was operated by the University of Paisley before the merger that established UWS. Set in of the old parkland of Craigie House bordering the River Ayr, the campus also houses the West of Scotland Management Centre, the business school&#x27;s management training and development facility.

===University of the West of Scotland ===

On 1 August 2007, the University of Paisley merged with Bell College, Hamilton. On 30 November 2007, the Privy Council approved the name University of the West of Scotland for the merged institution. The name change was resisted by many in Paisley, seeing it as a break with tradition and the connections binding the previous university to the town. The &#x27;Keep It Paisley&#x27; campaign attracted a number of supporters, amongst them local MP and then Secretary of State for Scotland, Douglas Alexander.

Today the University of the West of Scotland has over 15,000 students and remains one of Scotland&#x27;s largest &#x27;new universities&#x27;.

The university reported a cyber incident that happened in July 2023 which affected its&#x27; systems and staff data. It was reported that the attack affected staff laptops, half of the university&#x27;s systems, and student submissions. The hacking group Rhysida put the stolen information which reportedly contained staff&#x27;s personal details and internal university documents.

==Campuses==
===Paisley===

The Paisley campus of the University of the West of Scotland is situated in the centre of Paisley, Scotland&#x27;s largest town. The campus is home to roughly 10,000 students of the universities enrolment, offering a range of courses and research opportunities in areas such as business, computing, social sciences, engineering, science and health, nursing and midwifery. Student accommodation at the Paisley campus is provided in a recently opened £13.2 million student residence development. The Paisley campus of the university spans 20 acres and consists of four University of the West of Scotland academic schools. 

===Ayr===
In August 2011, a new campus for the university in Ayr opened on a riverside site adjacent to the previous campus. It is shared with the Scotland&#x27;s Rural College. The campus was constructed at a cost of £81 million, and provides the Ayrshire region of Scotland with &quot;one of the UK&#x27;s most modern, environmentally friendly and sustainable higher education learning facilities&quot;. The design of the campus building was taken from inspiration of the surrounding land and environment in Ayr, with the university claiming that the campus provides students with a &quot;stunning space for study&quot;.

The Ayr campus has its own student accommodation facilities on site, with student accommodation buildings located roughly three minutes away from the main campus. The accommodation has the capacity to house up to 200 students.

===Lanarkshire===
The Hamilton campus was previously based at Almada Street, Hamilton, South Lanarkshire previously known Bell College of Technology, before its merger with the University of Paisley.

Following extensive consultation with the local authority, stakeholders, students and staff about the future of the Hamilton campus, UWS announced plans to relocate to the new UWS Lanarkshire Campus at &quot;Hamilton International Technology Park&quot; (HITP), within the neighbouring town of Blantyre, off the A725 bypass road near to West Craigs. The Almada Street campus closed and the HITP campus opened in September 2018.

===Dumfries===

The university&#x27;s Dumfries campus is a small multi-institution facility located within the Crichton estate, a historic 85-acre parkland estate two miles from the centre of Dumfries. The campus has state-of-the-art learning facilities and currently operates across five historic buildings. A range of flexible full and part-time study opportunities are offered. The university claims that students benefit from &#x27;small class sizes, low staff: student ratios and a supportive study environment.&#x27;
The Crichton University Campus in Dumfries is the result of a joint project between the University of the West of Scotland, the University of Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway College and the Open University. The campus mainly offers business, computing and, since the merger with Bell College, nursing courses. Established in 1999 to provide a hub for higher education in the south-west of Scotland, the Crichton Campus has helped the regeneration of the Dumfries and Galloway economy.

===Student associations===

==== SAUWS ====

The Students&#x27; Association of the University of the West of Scotland is officially the recognised student organisation across the university. The organisation exists to campaign on students&#x27; issues, to improve learning and teaching at UWS, to offer advice and support to students, to organise events and activities, and to enable societies across all campuses.

The majority of the Student Groups and Societies are available to Scottish-based UWS campuses and are run by students for students. These include religious, political and social societies as well as course-based groups. There are also a collection of liberation groups and peer support groups, which exist to counter under-represented and oppressed sections of the student body.

SAUWS operates Union bars at their Paisley and Ayr locations, where they host various events and activities including quiz nights and karaoke.

In 2016 SAUWS won the NUS Scotland award &quot;Higher Education Student Association of the Year&quot;. This was awarded due to the organisations work and campaigns such as &quot;Keep UWS in Hamilton&quot;, the &quot;Summer Safety Net&quot; campaign, and its work developing services for students. SAUWS was awarded &quot;University Students&#x27; Association of the Year&quot; by NUS Scotland once again in 2020.

==== CUCSA ====
Crichton University Campus Student Association also serves students at the Dumfries Campus.

For students at Dumfries, CUCSA has a more limited range of sports and societies on offer and CUCSA is currently working with students to produce a new Netball club, both Boys and Girls Football clubs and an improved Riding Club.

=== Radio ===
The Ayr Campus is also home to the university&#x27;s student radio station UWS Radio. It broadcasts on DAB, 87.7FM to the campus and online. The station has interviewed greats such as Brian May from Queen and Jesse Rae.

===Sports===

Sporting affairs are regulated by TeamUWS, the Sports and Societies branch of the main Students Association headed by the Sports President. There are a large number of varied clubs, including Aikido, Basketball, Curling and Snowsports who regularly compete in BUCS and Scottish Student Sport competitions. Students who join one of the sports clubs affiliated with the university must also join the Sports Union. However, there are also regular classes and drop-in sessions for various sports which are non-competitive and available to all university gym members. The university operates two sports centres across the west of Scotland, Robertson Trust Sports Centre at Thornly Park Campus in Paisley and Hamilton Leisure Centre on site on Hamilton Campus.

The university, as the University of Paisley, has also had a number of previous clubs including Ice Hockey, Shinty, Gaelic Football and Ice Sports. There have been attempts in recent years to resurrect these teams, most notably the Paisley IcePanthers, the university&#x27;s former ice hockey team in 2008 by Finnish and German students, but due to lack of interest the club never happened. The most successful of all the resurrections was the American Football team. The Paisley College of Technology/University of Paisley Panthers American Football played between the 1989–90 British Collegiate American Football League and the 1996–97 British Collegiate American Football League seasons until the club rejoined as the University of Paisley Pyros at the start of the 2004–05 British Collegiate American Football League season.

TeamUWS competes in the East vs West varsity competition against Edinburgh Napier University in the sports of American Flag Football, Badminton, Basketball, Football, Hockey, Netball, Rugby and Volleyball which is at the moment the biggest sport club (2017). In the 2013/2014 competition the hockey games were cancelled due to location and weather difficulties.

According to the Scottish Daily Record, it is rumoured that South Ayrshire Council is considering giving the dated Dam Park Stadium, the venue for UWS-SRUC-Ayrshire College Varsity, to the university saving nearly £70,000. As part of the transfer, the facility will continue to be used by Ayr Seaforth AC and the local community.

<text>Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet (December 10, 1787 – September 10, 1851) was an American educator. Along with Laurent Clerc and Mason Cogswell, he co-founded the first permanent institution for the education of the deaf in North America, and he became its first principal. When opened on April 15, 1817, it was called the &quot;Connecticut Asylum (at Hartford) for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons,&quot; but it is now known as the American School for the Deaf.

==Biography==

He attended Yale University, earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1805, graduating at the age of seventeen, with highest honors, and then earned a master&#x27;s degree at Yale in 1808. He engaged in many things such as studying law, trade, and theology. In 1814, Gallaudet graduated from Andover Theological Seminary after a two-year course of study. However, he declined several offers of pastorates, due to ongoing concerns about his health.

== American School for the Deaf==

Thomas Gallaudet path in life was altered when he met Alice Cogswell, on May 25, 1814, the nine-year-old deaf daughter of a neighbor, Dr. Mason Cogswell. Gallaudet had returned to his parents&#x27; home in Hartford to recuperate from his seminary studies. On that day, as he observed Alice playing apart from other children, he wanted to teach her. Gallaudet started to teach Alice what different objects were called by writing their names and drawing pictures of them with a stick in the dirt. 

Dr. Cogswell was impressed and invited Gallaudet to continue teaching Alice through the summer. While many of his friends became pastors or found mission fields overseas, Gallaudet found his mission field at home. 

In 1815 Dr. Cogswell, with several businessmen and clergy, asked Gallaudet to travel to Europe to study methods for teaching deaf students, especially those of the Braidwood family in Scotland. Gallaudet found the Braidwoods unwilling to share knowledge of their oral communication method and himself financially limited. At the same time, he also was not satisfied that the oral method produced desirable results.

While still in Great Britain, he met Abbé Sicard, head of the Institution Nationale des Sourds-Muets à Paris, and two of its deaf faculty members, Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu. Sicard invited Gallaudet to Paris to study the school&#x27;s method of teaching the deaf using manual communication. Impressed with the manual method, Gallaudet studied teaching methodology under Sicard, learning sign language from Massieu and Clerc, who were both highly educated graduates of the school.

Having persuaded Clerc to accompany him, Gallaudet sailed back to America. The two men, with the help of Dr. Cogswell, toured New England and successfully raised private and public funds to fund a school for deaf students in Hartford, which later became known as the American School for the Deaf (ASD), in 1817. Young Alice was one of the first seven students at ASD.

In 1821, he married one of his former students, Sophia Fowler and they had 8 children together.

After resigning directorship of his school for the deaf in 1830, Gallaudet wrote educational and religious texts, became the chaplain to the Connecticut Retreat for the Insane in 1838, and taught in Hartford; the young Frederic Edwin Church was a notable pupil during this period.

Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet died in Hartford on September 10, 1851, aged 63, and was buried in Hartford&#x27;s Cedar Hill Cemetery.

==Family==
His youngest child Edward Miner Gallaudet (1837–1917) founded in 1864 the first college for the deaf, which, in 1986, became Gallaudet University. He was president for 46 years. The university also offers education for those in elementary, middle, and high school. The elementary school on the Gallaudet University Campus is named the Kendall Demonstration Elementary School (KDES); the middle and high school is the Model Secondary School for the Deaf (MSSD).

Gallaudet had another son, Thomas Gallaudet, who became an Episcopal priest and also worked for the deaf.

Gallaudet&#x27;s father, Peter Wallace Gallaudet, was a personal secretary to US President George Washington, when the office of the President was located in Philadelphia.

Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was the eldest of 13 children. His younger siblings&#x27; names were: Edgar (1789–90), Charles (1792–1830), (unnamed twins, 1793), Catherine (1793–1856), James (1796–1878), William Edgar (1797–1821), Ann Watts (1800–50), Jane (1801–35), Theodore (1805–85), Edward (1808–47), and Wallace (1811–16). William Edgar Gallaudet graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1815.

<text>Caherdavin () is a northern suburban district of Limerick city in the mid-west of Ireland. As of 2022, the population of Caherdavin is 7,364.

Local landmarks include the Moylish campus of TUS (formerly LIT), a third level college and research centre, the Jetland Shopping Centre which opened in 2005, Christ the King Church which opened in September 1985, with adjoining primary boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools (Christ the King N.S and Mary Queen of Ireland N.S respectively), alongside Thomond Community College (formerly St. Nessan&#x27;s Community College), a secondary school in Moylish Park. Both the Gaelic Grounds and Thomond Park are nearby.
==History==
Caherdavin was originally part of the &quot;Northern Liberties&quot; granted to Limerick Corporation in 1216 by King John. It remained part of Limerick City until 1840 when it became part of the new Limerick County Council; it returned to Limerick City in 2008. It was part of the parish of St. Munchin, which originally extended to Cratloe in County Clare, until Christ the King parish was formed after the 1960s housing boom in the area. 

The site of Caherdavin was developed for housing in the 1960s and has grown rapidly since then. Industry is confined to the Clondrinagh Industrial Estate which houses mainly traditional style workshop units. The other form of employment in the area, as of 2024, is the services industry (shops, doctor&#x27;s surgery, a Lidl supermarket etc). 

In 2005, the large Jetland Shopping Centre opened, providing new retail space and a Dunnes Stores supermarket, refurbished in 2021. Ivan&#x27;s shop was a longstanding cornerstone of Caherdavin Cross before finally closing in 2019. A Laya Healthcare clinic now occupies the former Ivan&#x27;s shop. A Bank of Ireland branch, previously located in Melvin Grove but moved to the Jetlands S.C, closed in 2019. A Limerick &amp; District Credit Union branch (formerly Caherdavin Credit Union) is located in Redgate. A Tesco supermarket and adjoining Certa service station are located in Coonagh Cross Shopping Centre in the neighbouring Coonagh area.

==Organisation==
The district includes the townlands of Ballygrennan, Clonmacken, Caherdavin, Clonconane, Clondrinagh, Coonagh, Knock and Shannabummy. As of 11 November 2016, this area is part of Limerick city. To the south and west is the River Shannon whilst to the east is the old Limerick city boundary Borough and to the north is the boundary with County Clare. 

An important feature of the area is that it is broken up into four sub-districts by the Clonmacken road, the Ennis road and the Cratloe road. There is Caherdavin Lawn, Caherdavin Park, and Caherdavin Heights. Caherdavin is approximately 1.5 miles north from Limerick city centre.

==Clubs==
The 23rd Limerick Scout Group has its hall beside the primary schools and has been active for over 30 years. The Community Centre houses a branch of Limerick City and County Council&#x27;s library service. The Irish Girl Guides are active in the area. The Na Piarsaigh GAA clubhouse and grounds is at Caherdavin Lawn, along with the Crowley School of Ballet and Tap Dancing.

The local church hosts three choirs - The Senior Choir, the Folk Choir, and the Taize Choir. The Caherdavin Youth Club, which is one of Limerick&#x27;s longest running youth clubs, operates from the Community Centre. 

The Caherdavin Massive Crew (CMC), made up of former local youth club members in their 20s who became clean-living, work in the area with an ethos to make the community a welcoming place for all who live in it.

There is a playing field in Caherdavin Park, near the Greenhills hotel, which is used by youth soccer teams such as Caherdavin Celtic FC and for other community sports.

==Transport==
Roads run over the three Shannon bridges from the city centre through Caherdavin in the direction of Shannon Airport, Ennis, and Galway, as well as for the Limerick Tunnel. Many of Caherdavin&#x27;s residents work in the local area or travel to other city suburbs such as Raheen, Dooradoyle and Castletroy. 

Bus Éireann operates Route 302 between Caherdavin and the city centre serving TUS (formerly LIT), Thomond Park, Thomondgate and Clancy&#x27;s Strand. Bus lanes were built on the Ennis Road (city direction) in 2007 to help alleviate congestion and prioritise buses for users to the city centre. Route 343 towards Shannon Airport and Ennis serves the nearby Jetlands S.C and Coonagh.

In 2010, the Limerick Tunnel, built underneath the River Shannon, opened nearby to Caherdavin, providing a cross-city connection avoiding the city centre and Condell Road bypass. Similar tunnels are built in Dublin and Cork.

The Coonagh Aerodrome, a few kilometres west of Caherdavin, provides access for small aircraft. Larger commercial aircraft use Shannon Airport, which lies 20km west in County Clare.

<text>Daytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States, about 50 mi (80 km) north of Orlando. Since opening in 1959, it has been the home of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in NASCAR as well as its season opening event. The venue also hosts the 24 Hours of Daytona, one of three races that make up the Triple Crown of endurance racing. In addition to NASCAR and IMSA, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, SCCA, and AMA Supercross. The track features multiple layouts including the primary 2.500 mi (4.023 km) high-speed tri-oval, a 3.560 mi (5.729 km) sports car course, a 2.950 mi (4.748 km) motorcycle course, and a 1,320 ft (400 m) karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track&#x27;s 180-acre (73 ha) infield includes the 29-acre (12 ha) Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing.

The track was built in 1959 by NASCAR founder William &quot;Bill&quot; France Sr. to host racing that was held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. The speedway is operated by NASCAR pursuant to a lease with the City of Daytona Beach on the property that runs until 2054. The venue describes itself as the &quot;World Center of Racing&quot;.

Lights were installed around the track in 1998, and today it is the third-largest single-lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated four times, with the infield renovated in 2004 and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010. On January 22, 2013, the fourth speedway renovation was unveiled. On July 5, 2013, ground was broken on &quot;Daytona Rising&quot; to remove backstretch seating and completely redevelop the frontstretch seating. The renovation was by design-builder Barton Malow Company in partnership with Rossetti Architects. The project was completed in January 2016, and cost US $400 million. It emphasized improved fan experience with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances (called &quot;injectors&quot;), as well as wider and more comfortable seats, and more restrooms and concession stands. After the renovations were complete, the track&#x27;s grandstands had 101,500 permanent seats with the ability to increase permanent seating to 125,000. The project was finished before the start of Speedweeks in 2016.

==Track history==

===Construction===
NASCAR founder William France Sr. began planning for the track in 1953 as a way to promote the series, which at the time was racing on the Daytona Beach Road Course. France met with Daytona Beach engineer Charles Moneypenny to discuss his plans for the speedway. He wanted the track to have the highest banking possible to allow the cars to reach high speeds and to give fans a better view of the cars on track. Moneypenny traveled to Detroit, Michigan to visit the Ford Proving Grounds which had a high-speed test track with banked corners. Ford shared their engineering design of the track with Moneypenny, providing the needed details of how to transition the pavement from a flat straightaway to a banked corner. France took the plans to the Daytona Beach city commission, who supported his idea and formed the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority.

The city commission agreed to lease the parcel of land adjacent to Daytona Beach Municipal Airport to France&#x27;s corporation for $10,000 a year over a 50-year period. France then began working on building funding for the project and found support from a Texas oil millionaire, Clint Murchison, Sr. Murchison lent France $600,000 along with the construction equipment necessary to build the track. France also secured funding from Pepsi-Cola, General Motors designer Harley Earl, a second mortgage on his home and selling 300,000 stock shares to local residents. Ground broke on construction of the speedway on November 25, 1957.

France obtained the funding from Pepsi-Cola after first contacting the Coca-Cola company for funds. Coca-Cola refused, saying that construction would never be complete in time for France&#x27;s desired date for the first race at the speedway. Pepsi-Cola gave him the funds immediately, and as a result, France refused to serve Coca-Cola as a concession at Daytona and all other NASCAR tracks he owned until Coca-Cola was named the &quot;Official Soft Drink of NASCAR&quot; in 1998. 

To build the high banking, crews had to excavate over a million square yards of soil from the track&#x27;s infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what is now known as Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph &quot;Sax&quot; Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake was stocked with 65,000 fish, and France arranged speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track&#x27;s binding base, over which asphalt was laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to come up with a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This allowed the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and relied on race ticket sales to complete construction. He also received a substantial sum of money from the Pepsi company after attempting to obtain the money to finish construction from the Coca-Cola Company and being turned down. For years from when the track opened to France&#x27;s death, France never allowed Coca-Cola to be sold as a concession at any of the tracks he owned as a result.
The first practice run on the new track was on February 6, 1959. On February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500. Its finish was as startling as the track itself: Lee Petty beat Johnny Beauchamp in a photo finish that took three days to adjudicate. When the track opened it was the fastest race track to host a stock car race, until Talladega Superspeedway opened 10 years later. On April 4, it hosted a Champ Car event which saw Jim Rathmann beat Dick Rathmann and Rodger Ward, at an average speed of , at the time the fastest motor race ever. It was the occasion of Daytona&#x27;s first fatality: George Amick, attempting to overtake for third late in the race, hit a wall and was killed. April 5, a scheduled sports car event (shortened to by darkness) was won by Roberto Mieres and Fritz d&#x27;Orey, who shared a Porsche RSK, which proved more durable than more potent competition.

Lights were installed around the track in 1998 to run NASCAR&#x27;s July race, the Coke Zero 400 at night. The track was the world&#x27;s largest single lighted outdoor sports facility until being surpassed by Losail International Circuit in 2008. Musco Lighting installed the lighting system, which took into account glare and visibility for aircraft arriving and departing nearby Daytona Beach International Airport, and costs about $240 per hour when in operation.

===Layouts===

====Tri-oval====

Daytona&#x27;s tri-oval is long with 31° banking in the turns and 18° banking at the start/finish line. The front straight is long and the back straight (or &quot;superstretch&quot;) is long. The tri-oval shape was revolutionary at the time as it greatly improved sight lines for fans. It is one of the three tracks on the NASCAR Cup Series circuit that are considered &quot;drafting tracks&quot;, the others being Talladega Superspeedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway.

On July 15, 2010, repaving of the track began. This came almost a year earlier than planned due to the track coming apart during the 2010 Daytona 500. The project used an estimated 50,000 tons of asphalt to repave including the racing surface, apron, skid pads and pit road. Because of good weather, the project was completed ahead of schedule.

On October 9, 2013, Colin Braun drove a Daytona Prototype car prepared by Michael Shank Racing to set a single-lap record on the tri-oval configuration of . During NASCAR events, it takes less than a minute for the cars to complete a lap around the tri-oval course.

====Road courses====

While the more famous 24 Hours of Le Mans is held near the summer solstice, Daytona&#x27;s endurance race is held in winter (meaning more of the race is run at night). The track&#x27;s lighting system is limited to 20% of its maximum output for the race to keep cars dependent on their headlights.

The road course was built in 1959 and first hosted a three-hour sports car race called the Daytona Continental in 1962. The race length became in 1964, and in 1966 was extended to a 24-hour endurance race known as the Rolex 24 at Daytona. It was shortened again to six hours in 1972 and the 1974 rendition of the race was cancelled entirely.

In 1973, a very sharp chicane was added at the end of the backstretch, approaching oval turn three.

In 1984 and 1985, the layout was modified, re-profiling road course turns 1 and 2, and moving what is now turn 3 (nicknamed the &quot;International Horseshoe&quot;) closer to its preceding turns. Also, the chicane on the backstretch was modified. A new entry leg was constructed approximately earlier, resulting in a longer, three-legged, &quot;bus stop&quot; shape. Cars would now enter in the first leg, bypass the second leg, and exit out of the existing third leg. Passing would now be possible inside the longer chicane. The construction resulted in a final length of for the complete road course.

In 2003, the backstretch chicane was modified once again. The middle leg was repaved and widened, and now cars would enter through the first leg, and exit out of the second leg. The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into oval turn three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was demolished and removed permanently.

In 2005, a second infield road course configuration was constructed, primarily for motorcycles. Due to fears of tire wear on the banked oval sections, oval turns 1 and 2 were bypassed giving the new course a length of . The Daytona SportBike that runs the Daytona 200 however, uses the main road course except for the motorcycle Pedro Rodríguez Hairpin (tighter than the one used for cars; the car version is used as an acceleration lane for motorcycles).

On September 26 and 27, 2006, the IndyCar Series held a compatibility test on the 10-turn, modified road course, and the 12-turn motorcycle road course with 5 drivers. The drivers who tested at the track were Vítor Meira, Sam Hornish Jr., Tony Kanaan, Scott Dixon and Dan Wheldon. This marked the first time since 1984 that open wheel cars have taken to the track at Daytona. On January 31 – February 1, 2007, IndyCar returned for a full test involving 17 cars.

On July 8, 2020, NASCAR announced that it would race the Daytona road course in all of its national series for the first time in mid-August (with the Cup Series racing the Go Bowling 235), due to current COVID-19 pandemic health restrictions in New York state (requiring 14 days self-isolation on arrival from other states) preventing the use of Watkins Glen International. On July 30, a modification of the course to add a chicane near the exit of Turn 12 (Oval Turn Four) was announced, lengthening the course to .

On January 21, 2024, Pipo Derani set the fastest ever recorded lap of the modern Daytona road course, with a 1:32.656 driving a Cadillac V-Series.R during qualifying for the 2024 24 Hours of Daytona. During the same session, every entrant in the IMSA GTP class broke the course lap record previously set by Oliver Jarvis in a Mazda RT24-P in 2019.

====Supercross====
During Daytona Beach Bike Week, a supercross track is built between the pit road and the tri-oval section of the track. Historically the track has used more sand than dirt, providing unique challenges to riders. The 2008–2013 track configurations were designed by former champion, Ricky Carmichael.

Daytona has hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round uninterruptedly since 1971.

====Flat track and infield kart track====
Popular dirt-track races in karting and flat-track motorcycle racing had been held at Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium but in 2009, the city announced the stadium was replacing its entire surface with FieldTurf, and thereby eliminating the flat-track racing at the stadium. To continue racing, speedway officials built the Daytona Flat Track, a new quarter-mile dirt track outside of turns 1 &amp; 2 of the main superspeedway. It seats 5,000 in temporary grandstands and opened in December 2009 for WKA KartWeek. From 2010 to 2016, it also hosted the AMA Grand National Championship, before it was moved in 2017 to the tri-oval section and became a TT course.

There is also a short paved kart/autocross track in the infield just inside of turn 3. The SCCA holds autocross on this track in addition to hosting sprint karting races during KartWeek.

====Paved short track====
In February 2012, it was announced that a paved short track would be constructed along the backstretch of the Speedway&#x27;s main course, for NASCAR&#x27;s lower-tier series to compete at during Speedweeks called the UNOH Battle at the Beach, which is similar to the Toyota All-Star Showdown, formerly held at Irwindale Speedway. The first races were held on that track in February 2013. The track was shortened to a oval in 2014 by shorter straightaways. The future of racing at the short track became uncertain after 2015 with the grandstands on the back straightaway being demolished as a part of the Daytona Rising project.

===Football===
In the fall of 1959, the track hosted several high school football games for the Father Lopez Green Wave in the first year of the school&#x27;s football program.

The track hosted four college football games featuring the Daytona-based Bethune–Cookman Wildcats in 1974 and 1975. In early 2014 track president Joie Chitwood expressed a desire to bring football back to the track.

===Soccer===
On July 2 and 3, 2022, the track hosted Daytona Soccer Fest, a 2 day event highlighted by a friendly match between heated Colombian rivals América de Cali and Deportivo Cali and a NWSL regular season match between the Orlando Pride and Racing Louisville FC.

==Video games==
In 1994, Sega released an arcade game called &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, using their Model 2 Arcade hardware. It was developed by their famed &quot;AM2&quot; development team. It featured a fully detailed 3D model based on the circuit for the very first time. The soundtrack for the game included vocals by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi. It is widely considered to be one of the most successful and influential racing games of all time. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; spawned many sequels, both in the arcades and on various home video game consoles. The latest version, &quot;Daytona Championship USA&quot;, was released to arcades in 2017.

iRacing.com have laser-scanned the facility twice. The first in 2008, and 2011 once the repave was completed. Both are available in official racing series. There has been no word to when and if it will be re-scanned now that the Daytona Rising project has now been completed.

Both the oval layout and Rolex 24 Hour layout are available in both PlayStation 3 video games &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;, and in the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 game &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot;. Daytona International Speedway is also featured in &quot;Forza Motorsport 6&quot; and &quot;Forza Motorsport 7&quot; for the Xbox One and Windows 10. The circuit returned to the Forza series in Forza Motorsport (2023) for Xbox Series X/S and Windows.

&quot;Real Racing 3&quot;″s second NASCAR update featured the Daytona International Speedway as a new circuit coming in three layouts. In addition to the oval and Rolex 24 Hour layouts in &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, there also exists a Daytona 200 layout in the game.

==Fatalities==

Forty-one people have been fatally injured in on-track incidents: 24 car drivers, twelve motorcyclists, three go-kart drivers, one powerboat racer, and one track worker. The most notorious death was that of Dale Earnhardt, who was killed on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 on February 18, 2001. Earnhardt is still Daytona International Speedway&#x27;s most successful driver, with a total of 34 career victories (12 Daytona 500 qualifying races, 7 NASCAR Xfinity Series races, 6 Busch Clash races, 6 IROC races, 2 Pepsi 400 July Races and the 1998 Daytona 500).

==Fan amenities==
===Hard Rock Bet Fanzone===
The Hard Rock Bet Fanzone is an access package similar to pit passes for fans to get closer to drivers and race teams. The fanzone was built in 2004 as part of a renovation of the track&#x27;s infield. Fans are able to walk on top of the garages, known as the &quot;fandeck&quot;, and view track and garage activity. Fans can also view race teams working in the garage, including NASCAR technical inspection, through windows. The garage windows also include slots for fans to hand merchandise to drivers for autographs. The fanzone also includes a live entertainment stage, additional food and drink areas and various other activities and displays.

The 2004 renovation of the infield, headed by design firm HNTB, was the first major renovation of the infield in the history of the track. In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1. The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America. Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway each built a similar infield fanzone. On December 9, 2016, the speedway announced that the University of Northwestern Ohio purchased entitlement rights to the fanzone, and that the area will be named &#x27;UNOH Fanzone&#x27;. On January 25, 2024, it announced the naming rights had been purchased by Hard Rock Cafe and named &#x27;Hard Rock Bet Fanzone&#x27; after their sports betting service.

===Budweiser Party Porch===
The Budweiser Party Porch was a porch located along the backstretch of the track. It was built on top of a portion of the backstretch grandstands and includes a , sign, the largest sign in motorsports. The porch featured tables, food and drinks, offering fans a &quot;fun-filled&quot; atmosphere that breaks fans away from the confines of grandstand seating without sacrificing the view. Below the porch was an interactive fan zone featuring amusement rides, a go-kart track, show cars and merchandise trailers. After the 2015 racing season, the Party Porch was torn down with the backstretch grandstands as part of the DAYTONA Rising project.

==Track records==

As of August 2024, track records on the tri-oval are followed as:

===Race lap records===

As of January 2025, the fastest official race lap records at the Daytona International Speedway are listed as:

==Weather and climate==

Daytona has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), which enables year-round use of the facility. Light frosts are in theory possible, but unlikely, during the 24-hour event&#x27;s nighttime under clear conditions, but general racing conditions are mild also during winter. With a dry season taking place during the winter months, the 500 generally has good odds of being run without rain delays. The summer event under the floodlights is more likely to undergo disturbances, due to the rainy tendencies of the hot, muggy, and humid summers. Due to the complete difference of seasons, the two NASCAR Cup races at Daytona see vastly different track conditions.

=== Lynyrd Skynyrd ===
Van Zant formed a band called My Backyard late in the summer of 1964 with friends and schoolmates Allen Collins (guitar), Gary Rossington (guitar), Larry Junstrom (bass), and Bob Burns (drums). The quintet went through several names before deciding on Lynyrd Skynyrd, as a mock tribute to their high school gym teacher Leonard Skinner at Robert E. Lee High School, which all band members had attended except Collins. Skinner&#x27;s strict enforcement against long hair inspired the members to name their band after him.

The band&#x27;s rise to prominence began in 1973 with the release of their debut album, &quot;(Pronounced &#x27;Lĕh-&#x27;nérd &#x27;Skin-&#x27;nérd)&quot;, which had a string of hits that included &quot;I Ain&#x27;t the One&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot;, &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;, &quot;Simple Man&quot;, and what became their signature song, &quot;Free Bird&quot;, later dedicated to the late Duane Allman of The Allman Brothers Band.

The band also gained exposure when they were selected as the opening act for the US portion of The Who&#x27;s Quadrophenia tour.

Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s biggest hit single was &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; from their follow-up album &quot;Second Helping&quot; (1974)&quot;,&quot; an answer to Neil Young&#x27;s songs &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Southern Man&quot;. Young&#x27;s song &quot;Powderfinger&quot; on the 1979 album &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; was reportedly written for Skynyrd, and Van Zant is pictured on the cover of &quot;Street Survivors&quot; wearing a T-shirt of Young&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; and in the 2 July 1977 Oakland Coliseum concert (excerpted in &quot;Freebird... The Movie&quot;). According to legend, Van Zant was buried in his Tonight&#x27;s the Night shirt.

== Death ==
On October 20, 1977, a plane carrying the band between shows from Greenville, South Carolina, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ran out of fuel outside Gillsburg, Mississippi. The passengers had been informed about potential problems with the Convair CV-240 and were told to brace for a crash. Van Zant died on impact from head injuries suffered after the aircraft struck a tree. Bandmates Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines, along with assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray, were also killed. The rest of the band were seriously injured. Van Zant was 29 years old.

According to former bandmate Artimus Pyle and family members, Van Zant frequently discussed his mortality. Pyle recalls a moment when Lynyrd Skynyrd was in Japan: &quot;Ronnie and I were in Tokyo, Japan, and Ronnie told me that he would never live to see thirty and that he would go out with his boots on, in other words, on the road. I said, &#x27;Ronnie, don&#x27;t talk like that,&#x27; but the man knew his destiny.&quot; Van Zant&#x27;s father, Lacy, said, &quot;He said to me many times, &#x27;Daddy, I&#x27;ll never be 30 years old.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Why are you talking this junk? You will never be 30 years old?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Daddy, that&#x27;s my limit.&#x27; &quot; Van Zant&#x27;s father later noted that, &quot;God was a jealous god. Taking him for reasons I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Ex-Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King also reported hearing Van Zant saying he would never live to be 30, saying Van Zant said it so often that he &quot;had gotten sick of hearing it&quot;. Lynyrd Skynyrd backup singer JoJo Billingsley recalled that Van Zant had begun referring to himself as &quot;The Mississippi Kid&quot; in the months before his death, despite having been born and raised in Florida. She noted that, eerily, Van Zant&#x27;s only connection to Mississippi was that he would ultimately die there.

Ronnie&#x27;s younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer when the band reunited in 1987, 10 years after the plane crash.

The aforementioned Ed King recalled the intense sadness of Van Zant&#x27;s funeral, noting that people in attendance were so overcome with grief that they were literally falling down. Van Zant was buried in Orange Park, Florida, in 1977. His body was relocated after vandals broke into his tomb and that of bandmate Steve Gaines on June 29, 2000. Van Zant&#x27;s casket was pulled out and dropped on the ground. The bag containing Gaines&#x27; remains was torn open and some scattered onto the grass. Their mausoleums at Orange Park remain as memorials for fans to visit.

Around 2012, the new location of their interment was accidentally revealed by a Craigslist ad. A family selling two plots they decided not to retain, ran a Craigslist ad and stated the plots were in the Jacksonville Memory Gardens Cemetery in Orange Park, Florida, adjacent to Ronnie Van Zant&#x27;s tomb.

In 2022, his widow announced that his body was moved to a new plot and that a new site was under construction.

== Personal life ==
Van Zant married Nadine Inscoe on January 2, 1967. Around this time, Van Zant also worked at his brother-in-law&#x27;s auto parts store, Morris Auto Parts in Jacksonville. It was said that Van Zant was a virtual catalog of automotive parts, and had a near photographic memory for them. The couple had a daughter, Tammy, before divorcing in 1969; Tammy would become a musician. Ronnie married Judy Seymour in 1972 after meeting her at The Comic Book Club through Gary Rossington in 1969. (The club closed in 1975 and is now a parking garage.) They had one daughter, Melody, born in 1976, and remained married until his death in 1977. Judy Van Zant-Jenness founded Freebird Live in 1999, a music venue located in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. It featured Lynyrd Skynyrd memorabilia and was co-owned by Melody Van Zant. Judy married Jim Jenness and founded and ran The Freebird Foundation until its dissolution in 2001.

Van Zant was an avid fisherman and enjoyed baseball; he was a fan of the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. In high school, he played American Legion baseball in the summer and aspired to play professionally, as he recalled in a 1975 interview.

Van Zant had several run-ins with the law, most notably in 1975, when he was arrested for hurling a table out of a second-story hotel room window.

== Legacy ==
The Ronnie Van Zant Memorial Park, funded by fans and family of the band, was built on Sandridge Road in Lake Asbury, Florida, nearby his hometown of Jacksonville.

Several members of his family have memorialized Ronnie in their music. His brothers Johnny and Donnie co-wrote the title track of John&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Brickyard Road&quot; with family friend and album producer Robert White Johnson. In the reformed Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s music video for the posthumously-released track &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name&quot; closes with a white hat similar to Ronnie&#x27;s sitting atop a microphone. Ronnie&#x27;s daughter Tammy, who was only 10 years old when he died, dedicated the album title track, &quot;Freebird Child&quot; as well as the music video to her father in 2009. Van Zant&#x27;s cousin Jimmie Van Zant recorded the tribute track &quot;Ronnie&#x27;s Song&quot; on the album &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (2000).

Alt country band Drive-By Truckers also paid tribute to Ronnie and members of the original band on their &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; album.

&quot;The All-Night Bus Ride&quot;, the 8th episode of season 1 of the Showtime series &quot;Roadies&quot;, was made in honor of Van Zant and the band.

In the 1978 song &quot;Reflections&quot; on the Charlie Daniels Band album &quot;Million Mile Reflections&quot;, the third verse refers to Van Zant, &quot;... and Ronnie, my buddy above all the rest, I miss you the most and loved you the best.&quot; A dedication on the back of the original record sleeve includes a poem, the last line of which is &quot;Fly on, proud bird, you&#x27;re free at last. Signed, Charlie Daniels, 1978.&quot;

<text>Peter Joseph Andrew Hammill (born 5 November 1948) is an English musician and recording artist. He was a founder member of the progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator. Best known as a singer-songwriter, he also plays guitar and piano and produces his own recordings and occasionally those of other artists. In 2012, he was recognised with the Visionary award at the first Progressive Music Awards.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Hammill was born in Ealing, West London, and moved with his family to Derby when he was 12. He attended Beaumont College and Manchester University, where he studied Liberal Studies in Science. Hammill has stated that his grandfather was originally from Pakistan.

===Early career===
Hammill&#x27;s solo career has coexisted with Van der Graaf Generator&#x27;s activities. The band was offered a contract by Mercury Records in 1968, that only Hammill signed. When Van der Graaf Generator broke up in 1969 he wanted to record his first solo album. In the summer of 1969 Hammill had a residency at The Lyceum and played weekly solo concerts there. Eventually the intended solo album was released under the Van der Graaf Generator banner as their first album (&quot;The Aerosol Grey Machine&quot;). Hammill&#x27;s first real solo album was &quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate&quot; (1971), containing songs from the early (1967/68) Van der Graaf Generator days.

===Van der Graaf Generator and after===
When Van der Graaf Generator broke up again in August 1972, Hammill resumed his solo career. Songs that were intended for Van der Graaf Generator now ended up on his solo albums, notably &quot;Black Room&quot; (on &quot;Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night&quot;) and &quot;A Louse Is Not a Home&quot; (on &quot;The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage&quot;). For the majority of both his solo songs and the band&#x27;s songs he is credited as the sole songwriter, and some of his solo albums feature all the members of Van der Graaf Generator. In general, Hammill&#x27;s solo work is thematically concerned with more personal matters, while the band&#x27;s songs deal with broader themes.

&quot;Nadir&#x27;s Big Chance&quot; (1975) was a major change from the preceding &quot;In Camera&quot;. Whilst &quot;In Camera&quot; is characterised by extremely intense and complex songs and even has some musique concrète on it, &quot;Nadir&#x27;s Big Chance&quot; contains anticipations of punk rock. In a 1977 radio interview, John Lydon of the Sex Pistols played two tracks from the album and expressed his admiration for Hammill in glowing terms: &quot;Peter Hammill&#x27;s great. A true original. I&#x27;ve just liked him for years. If you listen to him, his solo albums, I&#x27;m damn sure Bowie copied a lot out of that geezer. The credit he deserves, just has not been given to him. I love all his stuff&quot;.

&quot;Over&quot; (1977) contains very personal songs about the break-up of a long-term relationship.

Hammill&#x27;s first solo album after the 1978 break-up of Van der Graaf was &quot;The Future Now&quot;. He provided vocals on three tracks for Robert Fripp&#x27;s solo debut &quot;Exposure&quot;, released in June 1979.

With the next solo albums, &quot;pH7&quot; and &quot;A Black Box&quot;, the sound became more compact, more new wave. On those albums, Hammill played the drums himself. What followed was the K group. In later years Hammill would sometimes refer to the band as a &quot;beat group&quot;. The K group consisted of Hammill himself on guitars and piano, with John Ellis on lead guitar, and Van der Graaf Generator mainstays Nic Potter on bass, and Guy Evans on drums and percussion. This group recorded the albums &quot;Enter K&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;.

===Live performances===
Live concerts by Peter Hammill are characterised by a degree of unpredictability, in terms of the songs played, the arrangements and the players involved. Hammill generally does not undertake live tours to promote albums. Whenever he plays with a certain predominant line-up, almost always there will also be concerts interspersed with different permutations of musicians, so the word &quot;tour&quot; is not always very applicable.

From September 1981 until September 1985 Hammill played with the K group, playing raw, energetic, new-wave rock. A live recording of a number of these concerts was released as &quot;The Margin&quot;. In March and April 1983, Hammill with John Ellis was the support act for Marillion on their UK tour in support of their debut album &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;.

From February until October 1990 he played with Nic Potter on bass and Stuart Gordon on violin. A live recording of these shows was released as &quot;Room Temperature&quot;. From April 1993 until August 1996 they were joined by Manny Elias on drums. A live recording of these shows was released as &quot;There Goes The Daylight&quot;. From October 1994 until August 1996 Hammill played with David Jackson on flutes and saxophones, Stuart Gordon on violin and Manny Elias on drums (this line-up is sometimes informally referred to as the Peter Hammill Quartet&lt;ref name=&quot;8/March 1995&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;).

From January 1998 until November 2006 Hammill played with just Stuart Gordon on violin. Of these shows the live recording &quot;Veracious&quot; was released.

From 1969 on, Hammill has also performed solo concerts, with just guitar and keyboards.

===Fie! Records===
Hammill&#x27;s early records, like the Van der Graaf Generator albums, were released on Charisma Records. He parted company with them after &quot;pH7&quot; (1979), and then released albums on a number of small labels. &quot;A Black Box&quot; came out on S-Type, a label run by Hammill and his manager Gail Colson. &quot;Enter K&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot; appeared on Naive, &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;The Margin&quot; on Foundry and &quot;In A Foreign Town&quot;, &quot;Out of Water&quot; and &quot;Room Temperature&quot; on Enigma Records. In 1992 he formed his own label, Fie! Records, on which all his albums since &quot;Fireships&quot; have been released. The label&#x27;s logo is the Greek letter phi (Φ), a pun on PH-I. Ever since the 1970s he has also had his own home recording studio, called Sofa Sound. His website was later named after the studio.

In November 2023, Hammill wrote that he had &quot;passed over the curatorship of the Fie! catalogue to Cherry Red&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1991, Hammill released the long-awaited opera &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. He had written the music and Van der Graaf Generator co-founder Judge Smith the libretto, and the two of them had been working on it since 1973. In 1999 he released a reworked version, &quot;The Fall of the House Of Usher (Deconstructed &amp; Rebuilt)&quot;.

He was awarded the Italian Tenco Prize for songwriting at the end of 2004.

In 2005, Hammill announced the reformation of Van der Graaf Generator. In 2004 they had recorded a new album, &quot;Present&quot;, which was released in April 2005, and from May until November 2005 played a series of well received concerts. Between 2005 and 2007 Hammill oversaw the remastering of almost all of his pre-Fie! releases, and also carried out similar work on his more recent catalogue. The last of the Charisma remasters was released in September 2007.
Hammill&#x27;s solo career did not end because of the Van der Graaf Generator reunion. He released an album &quot;Singularity&quot; in December 2006. It was the first solo album he completed after his heart attack, and for a large part it deals with matters of life and (sudden) death. In 2007 several gigs by Van der Graaf Generator as a trio (minus David Jackson) took place in Britain and Europe; their new album &quot;Trisector&quot; was released in March 2008. In the summer and autumn of 2008, Hammill did a tour of solo dates in the U.S. and Canada which included a performance at the progressive rock festival NEARfest. He also played his only ever professional &quot;parlour gig&quot; at a private residence in Holland, Michigan.

In the summer of 2009 Van der Graaf Generator toured the U.S. and Canada, which occasioned Hammill&#x27;s triumphant return to NEARfest. &quot;Thin Air&quot; was released on 8 June 2009. This was followed in October 2011 by a live double CD &quot;Pno, Gtr, Vox&quot;, recorded at performances in Japan and the UK in 2010. An extended 7-CD box set, &quot;Pno, Gtr, Vox Box&quot; was released in a limited edition of 2000 in February 2012.

&quot;Consequences&quot;, a solo studio album was released in May 2012. Again Hammill played all the instruments. The lyrics deal with conflicted characters in various scenarios. &quot;Other World&quot;, a collaborative album with guitarist Gary Lucas, was released in February 2014. The album features Hammill&#x27;s vocals, Hammill and Lucas on guitars, and Hammill&#x27;s sound treatments, and is a mixture of conventional songs with extended avant-garde instrumentals. 

In 2019 &quot;In Amazonia&quot; was released, a collaboration album with progressive rock group Isildurs Bane. Hammill released a second album with Isildurs Bane in September of 2021, &quot;In Disequilibrium.&quot; Earlier that year in May, &quot;In Translation&quot; was released, Hammill&#x27;s first covers album. Written in light of Brexit, Hammill has called it &quot;a love letter to [Europe],&quot; and it features songs written by Astor Piazzolla, Leiber and Stoller, Gustav Mahler, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Gabriel Fauré among others.

==Music==
Musically, Hammill&#x27;s work ranges from short simple riff-based songs to highly complex lengthy pieces. His work with Van der Graaf Generator, and much of his solo work, is usually described as progressive rock, though Hammill himself does not identify with the label. He has received recognition as a visionary artist from the progressive music world.

Hammill&#x27;s output is prolific. Many different styles of music appear in his work, among them artful complexity (for instance &quot;Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night&quot;), avant garde electronic experiments (&quot;Loops and Reels&quot;, &quot;Unsung&quot;), opera (&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;), solo keyboard accompaniment (&quot;And Close As This&quot;), solo guitar accompaniment (&quot;Clutch&quot;), improvisation (&quot;Spur of the Moment&quot;), film music (&quot;Sonix&quot;), band recordings (&quot;Enter K&quot;), and slow, melancholic balladry (&quot;None of the Above&quot;).

Hammill exerted significant influences on punk rock and new wave music. Over the years he collaborated with musicians and song-writers such as Le Orme, Robert Fripp, Peter Gabriel, Alice, Ayuo, Herbert Grönemeyer, Judge Smith, The Stranglers, David Cross, Moondog, Premiata Forneria Marconi, Tim Bowness, Jakko Jakszyk and The Amorphous Androgynous.

==Voice==
Hammill&#x27;s voice is a very distinctive element of his music. He sings in an emotional, often even dramatic way. As a former Jesuit chorister, his delivery is usually Received Pronunciation British English – notable exceptions are his Afrikaner accent on &quot;A Motor-bike in Afrika&quot; and his Cockney accent on &quot;Polaroid&quot; — and ranges in tone from peacefully celestial to screaming rants (which are nevertheless highly controlled). Singing in registers from baritone to high falsetto, he growls, croons, shrieks and shouts in ways that have drawn comparison with the guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix.

==Lyrics==
Hammill&#x27;s lyrics are another distinctive feature of his work. He has visited a number of recurring themes including love and human relationships, ageing and death, human folly, self-awareness and introspection, politics, and religion. His lyrics often include scientific, literary or historical references. For example, the Norse names mentioned in the song &quot;Viking&quot; on &quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate&quot; (co-written with Judge Smith) are characters in the Icelandic Saga of Eric the Red.

The science fiction themes of Van der Graaf Generator&#x27;s lyrics are mostly absent in his later work, but there still are many science references, especially to physics (for instance in the song &quot;Patient&quot;). In 1974 Hammill published a book, &quot;Killers, Angels, Refugees&quot; (Charisma Books, London), a collection of lyrics, poems and short stories. This was later reissued by Hammill himself (Sofa Sound, Bath) and was followed by a sequel &quot;Mirrors, Dreams, Miracles&quot; (1982).

In 2000 Dagmar Klein published &quot;Shouting down the passage of time: The Spaces &amp; Times of Peter Hammill&quot;, an analysis and interpretation of Hammill&#x27;s lyrics along the lines of his dealings with &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Journeys&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hammill is fluent in Italian. He has been married since 1978 to Hilary, who is credited with taking the picture for the cover of &quot;In a Foreign Town&quot;. They have three daughters. Two of them, Holly and Beatrice Hammill sing soprano vocals on one track of &quot;Everyone You Hold&quot; and on two tracks of &quot;None of the Above&quot;. Holly wrote the song &quot;Eyebrows&quot; (on &quot;Unsung&quot;) and co-wrote &quot;Personality&quot; (on &quot;Everyone You Hold&quot;).

Hammill survived a heart attack in December 2003, less than 48 hours after having finished the recording of &quot;Incoherence&quot;. In May 2022, while on tour with Van der Graaf Generator, he had to undergo surgery in Germany. He stated on social media: &quot;No long term repercussions from my surgery in Fürth (where my treatment was outstanding). It also has to be said that it was a close-run thing&quot;.

<text>The Omni Group is an American software company that develops software for the macOS, iOS, and watchOS platforms. The Omni Group was informally founded as a NEXTSTEP consulting company in 1989 by Wil Shipley, who immediately brought on Ken Case and Tim Wood. The three incorporated together under the name Omni Development, Inc. in 1993, because the name &quot;Omni Group&quot; was taken by another Seattle firm. Omni initially produced custom database software for the NEXTSTEP platform for clients such as the William Morris Agency and McCaw Cellular Communications (then Cingular Wireless; now AT&amp;T Inc.). During this period they also ported a number of games to NEXTSTEP, then later to Mac OS X (after Apple acquired NeXT in 1997). Around 2000 the company decided to start focusing on their own consumer applications for the Mac, and as of 2004 the vast majority of their revenue came from their consumer products. 

In 2003, Ken Case took over as the chief officer of Omni, and in March 2004 Wil Shipley left with another Omni employee, interface designer Mike Matas, to form Delicious Monster. Matas later left for Apple.

The Omni Group also administers several mailing lists related to macOS and software development. They also provide several frameworks for Cocoa software development under an open source license.

OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner have won Macworld Editors&#x27; Choice Awards. At the Macintosh Worldwide Developers Conference in 2001, OmniWeb 4.0 won two Apple Design Awards: &quot;Best Mac OS X User Experience&quot; and &quot;Best New Mac OS X Product.&quot; 

In 2002, OmniGraffle 2.0 won two more Apple Design Awards.

<doc id="431727" wikidata="Q2723021" url="?curid=431727" title="Treasure of the Rudras">
<text>is a Japanese role-playing game released by Square in 1996, and the company&#x27;s last developed game for the Super Famicom.

The plot incorporates elements from Indian religions, centrally the concept of the wheel of time - every 4000 years the world is destroyed and recreated by a Rudra - the name taken from an aspect of the Hindu god of destruction, Shiva. With several races of beings already eradicated and replaced, the story takes place during the final 15 days before humans are scheduled to be wiped out as well; this forces the four main characters who were chosen by fate - Sion, Surlent, Riza, and Dune - to go on a quest to avert the scenario whilst uncovering the source of it all. 

While the gameplay alludes to many Square games like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and so on, one notable deviation from the games is that of custom magic system (aka mantra system), in which players can freely create their own spells either by using both prefixes and suffixes contained within the game or just by trial and error. This negates the need of leveling up characters to learn spells automatically rather than manually, but despite its creativity, the overall usefulness contained within each imputed spell varies.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay is divided into three main areas: the overworld map, the towns and dungeons, and battles. When in the overworld map, the player directs their characters to different locations in the game. Towns contain the prerequisite shops and villagers who offer information, while dungeons are mazelike affairs where random enemy encounters may occur. These battles may also strike on the overworld map and follow a typical RPG pattern: the player makes choices for their characters (such as whether to fight, cast a magic spell, or run away), and then the enemy takes a turn. This pattern repeats until the characters on one side all run out of hit points and die. There are 15 turns, accounting for each of the 15 days.

===Magic system===
The game features a magic system where the player can create magic spells by entering words up to six katakana characters. Whereas most console RPGs give the player access to a limited number of precreated spells, it allows the player nearly total creative freedom. The player can enter various magic words (called &quot;kotodama&quot; (言霊,ことだま) in the original) into their grimoire. Every one will have some effect, although most are not useful. There is an underlying framework to the system, however, which is based on the gameworld&#x27;s elements.

A complete mantra generally consists of a prefix, elemental core, and suffix, although the core alone is enough to produce an effect. There are eight elements (plus healing), and of these, six are arranged in mutually antagonistic pairings: &quot;fire&quot; vs. &quot;water&quot;, &quot;wind&quot; vs. &quot;electricity&quot;, and &quot;light&quot; vs &quot;dark&quot;. The remaining two offensive elements, &quot;earth&quot; and &quot;void&quot;, have no strengths or weaknesses. Since spells are formed from letters, there are specific patterns corresponding to each element. Certain spells that use the root word &quot;tou&quot; for example, will produce lightning-based attacks, while those containing &quot;aqu&quot; will create water-based effects.

Additionally, there are prefixes and suffixes that can be added onto the base elements to change their attributes. Most of these influence the base power and cost to use the spell, but others add abnormal status effects (for example, poisoning the target) or change the mantra&#x27;s range so that it only targets a single enemy instead of multiple ones or vice versa. Prefixes and suffixes with similar effects can be used in tandem to produce amplified effects.

Other mantras consist of unique words, many of them in English, that create certain effects and skip the naming system entirely. Many of these strange words are learned from in-game characters or by reading books. For example, &quot;geo&quot; is an earth-related mantra, and &quot;kingcoast&quot; is a water spell. Adding prefixes or suffixes to these usually makes something completely different (and often useless). This use of spelled-out mantras allows the player to learn magic from even their enemies. When an enemy uses magic, the player has but to write down the spells used and then to enter them into his or her own grimoire after the battle in order to have access to them. Some of these enemy spells are extremely powerful, although many are not as cost-efficient as the basic spells described above. Some are more space-efficient versions of regular spells.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
The story is divided into three major scenarios, each with a different main character: the soldier Sion, the priestess Riza, and the archaeologist Surlent. As the player enters new areas and accomplishes different tasks, the human race&#x27;s final 15 days slowly ebb away in a predetermined day/night cycle. The player is free to play the scenarios in any order, and may even leave one storyline to follow that of another character for a time. The actions of the characters in one location and time may have an effect on the others, as well, both in the general story and in gameplay. For example, if one group of characters leaves a sacred relic somewhere, another character may come and find it on a later day in their own part of the game. After successfully completing all three scenarios, players must take on a fourth, featuring the roving thief Dune and the heroes from the previous three chapters in their final confrontation with the game&#x27;s major villains.

===Story===
Before the events of the game, the Majestic Four created the world, the most powerful of them being Mitra who was also the creator of the Earth and the Moon. They then gave life to an entity known as a Rudra with power from the Guardian of Evolution, Gomorrah, who uses his Eternal Engine to facilitate new beings.

Every 4,000 years, a Rudra appears with a race of its own and the race that came before it is destroyed or driven to near extinction. Former Rudras have since become fossils that archaeologists refer to as Lago Stones. During the Great Cycle, the Danans were succeeded by the Merfolk, the Reptiles, the Giants and finally by the Humans.

At the start of the game, fifteen days remain before the coming of a new Rudra and the end of humanity begins. The characters Sion, Surlent, Riza and Dune each come into possession of a Jade, a treasure discovered in the Lago Stones. It is later revealed that Gomorrah requires the Jades in addition to other treasures to create a perfect Rudra, and that a weapon known as Sodom destroys every successive race from its lair on the Moon.

After both Gomorrah and Sodom have been thwarted by the Jadebearers, they unite and board a Danan flying vessel known as the Ark to travel to the Moon and confront Mitra. Upon defeating her, Mitra praises the Jadebearers for their strength and reveals that long ago the Majestic Four once fought a force known as the Destroyers who were a threat to the world. When the Majestic Four won, Mitra knew the Destroyers would one day return and resolved to defeat them by creating a perfect race through evolution while using the 4,000 year cycle to replace weak races with stronger ones. In an instant, Mitra passes on her knowledge of the Eternal Engine to Dune and also leaves the task of fighting the Destroyers to the human race.

During the ending, the party return home and experience a vision of a world brought to ruin by the Destroyers, which Dune interprets as a warning from Mitra. He considers using the Eternal Engine to evolve humanity, but the Jadebearers decide against it so they do not repeat Mitra&#x27;s actions, and instead choose to let the human race evolve naturally.

==Development and release==
&quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; was developed by Square, specifically its Osaka division. The company is best known for RPG franchises like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;SaGa&quot;. Many of the staff members for &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; had previously worked on &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; (&quot;SaGa 3&quot;) and &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot;, notably director Kouze Ide. Production began in 1993 and would last three years. Ide revealed that his team started by conceiving its magic system, basing the inclusion of &quot;kotodama&quot; on the cultural appreciation for word play in Japan. Battle planner Masahiro Kataoka proposed that gamers could exchange discovered words with their friends as a way to progress through the game.

Field planner Masato Yagi was hired in 1994 to create the game&#x27;s maps and claimed he was given freedom to make them as he pleased. Despite having simultaneous development with &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Yagi explained that his predecessors based &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; on technology from 1992&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; because Square&#x27;s divisions did not typically interact with one another. During the era it was in development, many games had already transitioned to utilizing 3D rendering or polygons, while &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; still used 2D pixel art. Lead monster graphic designer Yuichirou Kojima chose to animate the enemy sprites (which were typically still images in Square RPGs) in order to counter the increasing prominence of 3D graphics at the time. Similarly, programmer Shingo Tanaka gave the party members a lot of movement during combat and wished to make the game&#x27;s lengthy battles as stress-free as possible.

The character designer for the game was Keita Amemiya. He was originally set to design everything and magazines had advertised his involvement from the start, but Amemiya did not become officially attached to the project until a year and a half before its conclusion. A rough outline for the characters and world were already decided and he and his studio Crowd Inc. amended these illustrations. A member of Amemiya&#x27;s family whom he trusted with these types of revisions then helped to decide which designs would make the final cut for the game.

&quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; was released for the Super Famicom on April 5, 1996. It was one of the last Square-developed titles for the console alongside &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, and &quot;Treasure Hunter G&quot;, which were all released within four months of each other. &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; was never localized outside Japan, though an English fan translation was completed. The game&#x27;s unique magic system was considered to be a major obstacle for translators and required not only the text to be converted but the game&#x27;s coding to be altered. &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; was digitally re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 7, 2011 and the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on December 2, 2015 though it became unavailable on the services when they shut down on January 21, 2019 and March 28, 2023 respectively.

===Music===
Ryuji Sasai composed the game&#x27;s music. A 58-song soundtrack CD was released in Japan by NTT Publishing shortly after the game on April 25, 1996. A sheet music edition was released by Doremi on December 10, 1998 and features every track transcribed in simple arrangements for solo piano. The original version of the soundtrack was re-released digitally on August 8, 2008.

Songs from the game have made their way to various Square Enix compilation albums: the regular battle theme in 2007; the opening theme in 2021; and an arranged version of the Surlent scenario ending theme in 2012.

==Reception==

Upon its release, a quartet of writers for the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded &quot;Treasure of the Rudras&quot; an aggregate score of 31 out of 40 points, placing it in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Silver Hall of Fame&quot;. The reviewers commended Square for continuing its track record of excellent RPGs and for making complex mechanics like the mantra-based magic system easy to understand, though one member of the panel felt that instantly switching between the game&#x27;s three storylines could be disorienting to the player. Brazilian magazine &quot;VideoGame&quot; scored the game a 9.3 out of 10, commenting that it is an example of how the Super NES is the best console for role-playing games. They also applauded the graphics and gameplay as being as high quality as Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Rating the game 92%, the French magazine &quot;Consoles+&quot; was equally as complimentary of the game for upholding Square&#x27;s RPG pedigree of impressive presentations, storylines, and gameplay. The publication disliked the high number of battles, but admitted this was a valid criticism of many Japanese RPGs.

Retrospective evaluations of the game have been positive as well. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; praised its unique battle system of learning spells through words and combining them to make new ones, but noted that there were games from the mid-1990s that were more beatifically drawn and &quot;narratively ambitious&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; also complimented the magic system and its approach of having three branching stories that players could exit and enter at will, labeling the title a &quot;hidden gem&quot;. &quot;Destructoid&quot; compared the plot and its many shifting perspectives to &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, but noted that the game did not appear to have been made with the same large budget as contemporary titles, and noted the difficulty of using the linguistic magic system. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; enjoyed the title&#x27;s humorous cutscenes, but were critical of the game&#x27;s lack of polish. &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; called the title one of the best games ever released for the Super NES, praising the graphical detail and the innovative magic system.

<doc id="431728" wikidata="Q1331500" url="?curid=431728" title="Para Para">
<text>or Para-Para is a synchronized dance that originated in Japan. Unlike most types of club and rave dancing, Para Para features specific synchronized movements for each song, much like line dancing. Para Para has been around since the early 1980s, when European countries started selling Italo disco and Eurodisco and, in the mid-to late 1970s, new wave and synthpop music in Japan. However, the dance did not achieve much popularity outside Japan until the late 1990s.

Para Para is strongly associated with Eurobeat. Eurobeat artist Dave Rodgers has described Para Para as the only way to dance to Eurobeat, which is usually &quot;so fast.&quot;

== Description ==
Para Para dancing consists of mostly upper body movements in synchronization with a four-on-the-floor rhythm. Dancing involves choreographed motions with the arms and hands while stepping to the right and left, similar to the movements of traditional festival dances such as &quot;Bon Odori&quot; and cheering squads called &quot;Ōendan&quot;. Para Para dancing is generally done to Eurobeat and Eurodance music, with each track having its own dance routine. Para Para involves very little lower body movement, with the exception of moving one&#x27;s hips, stepping in place, and jumping or hopping. Some routines feature more complex leg movements. Routines are generally choreographed by groups affiliated with popular clubs in Japan (see below).

Fans of Para Para often refer to themselves as &quot;paralists&quot; and include official and unofficial teams of dancers in Japan, Chile, Brazil, Spain, the United States, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Finland, and several other countries. Some such dance teams are recognized by major Japanese music labels such as Avex and have been featured in Japanese media like the magazine &quot;Egg&quot;.

The history of Para Para is largely described by the community and historians in terms of &quot;booms&quot;, during which Para Para saw an increase in popularity. Times of decreased popularity are referred to as &quot;glacial&quot; periods. To date, there have been four distinct booms, each with a distinct cultural and historical context.

=== &quot;Official&quot; vs. &quot;maniac&quot; ===
The term &quot;official&quot; in the parapara world describes routines made by certain clubs/choreography groups in Japan. A non-exhaustive list of official club events are Starfire, SEF, 9LoveJ, and Twinstar. These routines are danced and learned by most people in the community.

In response to official routines, people in Japan have made their own routines, called &quot;maniac&quot; routines. This movement started in the late 1990s with clubs like Hibiya Radio City and Tottori Eleven choreographing their own routines. In addition to the club events mentioned, other famous maniac club events that existed were Medusa, Area, Joy, AXOS, Bless, and TMD. , club events in Japan have not choreographed many maniac routines, and the movement has basically stopped. However, some official club events like Starfire and SEF still continue. Some paralists prefer maniac to official routines, though, and continue to host small events like Ravenous that feature maniac routines.

=== Variants ===
Some variants of Para Para include TechPara (set to hyper techno instead of Eurobeat), and TraPara or ToraPara (set to trance).

=== OriPara and refilms ===
In what is called OriPara (for &quot;original Para Para&quot;), some may make their own parapara routines to their favorite Eurobeat songs. The term OriPara is typically reserved for routines that are not made by famous choreographers or taught at club events.

A refilm is a home-made, usually non-profit video in which dancers film themselves dancing parapara routines. The routines usually come from commercial or club videos, but some have been known to film their own routines, which is a phenomenon called &quot;oripara.&quot; These videos have not played a big part in the Japanese parapara community, possibly for copyright reasons, but they are very big part of the international parapara community since there are no large parapara events outside Japan. The two general purposes of a refilm are to highlight a rare routine or to show the public ones&#x27; skills. With the advent of YouTube, refilms have become more visible internationally to even non-paralists.

==Etymology==
It is thought that the term &quot;Para Para&quot; is derived from the onomatopoeic expression of one&#x27;s hand movements along with the music, where the beat of the music was described similarly to &quot;Pa-pa pa-pa-ra ra-ra&quot;, similar to phrases such as &quot;boop-boop-bee-doop&quot; in English.

==Origin==
There are several theories about the origin of Para Para. One theory is that it started in the early 1980s when men working in VIP rooms in clubs would choreograph dances to impress female clientele, while another is that it developed from the Takenoko-zoku subculture that would gather in the pedestrian plaza of Yoyogi Park in Harajuku to dance choreographed routines to popular music and disco.

== History ==

=== 1st boom (1987–1992) ===
ParaPara is thought to have started in the late 1980s at high-class discos during Japan&#x27;s bubble era. Men dressed in black suits would teach routines at clubs such as Aoyama King &amp; Queen and Maharaja Azabu-Jūban. It is difficult to learn some of the dances due to the fact that no recordings exist of the routines. It is also largely unknown which clubs made specific routines during this era because of this.

==== Wangan ====
The term mainly describes the particular choreography from clubs around Tokyo Bay circa 1993, including Eden Roc and the aforementioned Maharaja Azabu-jūban. Like with the 1st boom, such choreography is difficult to find, albeit slightly easier due to the availability of recording devices at the time. Routines of songs from the latter half of the &quot;Eurobeat Fantasy&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Eurobeat&quot;, &quot;Super Eurobeat&quot; volumes 1 through 49, and &quot;Maharaja Night Hi-NRG Revolution&quot; volumes 1 through 9 music series are usually categorized as &quot;wangan&quot;. Some &quot;wangan&quot; Para Para videos include the Venus Cafe&#x27;s Special and Kyoto Gingerman One Gun. Unfortunately, many &quot;wangan&quot; dancers have since retired from the Para Para scene, and there are currently very few club events in Japan that play &quot;wangan&quot; songs.

=== 2nd boom (1993–1995) ===
Many Para Para routines originate from this era. Clubs like Xenon, Twinstar, King &amp; Queen, and Maharaja were very popular during this period. It was also during this period when Avex Trax, the music label in Japan behind the &quot;Super Eurobeat&quot; compilation series, released one of the first officially licensed Para Para videos to clubs on March 21, 1994, entitled . The video features 40 songs from the 2nd Boom era, and most of the featured routines are still used today. The beginning of this boom can be marked by the release of &quot;Super Eurobeat&quot; volume 40, and it lasted until as late as &quot;Super Eurobeat&quot; volume 80. During the latter half of this boom, some clubs created &quot;unofficial&quot; or &quot;maniac&quot; routines, which were featured in Hibiya Radio City, Yokohama Maharaja, and Tottori Eleven.

=== 3rd boom (1999–2001) ===
The cause of this boom has largely been credited to the appearance of Takuya Kimura on television program &quot;SMAP×SMAP&quot;, dancing to Niko&#x27;s &quot;Night of Fire&quot; and Domino&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse March (Eurobeat Version)&quot;. During this period, with Xenon having closed its doors, Twinstar continued to make routines. 9LoveJ and Velfarre started making their own routines. The popularity of this period early on was amplified by gyaru culture as well. In commercial videos, Avex and competitors like Victor and Digibeat began releasing regular commercial Para Para videos that featured routines for songs from their respective Eurobeat CDs. Some of these series include &quot;Para Para Paradise&quot;, &quot;Para Para Panic!&quot;, and &quot;Euroパラパラ How&quot;. &quot;ParaPara Paradise&quot; was the most popular series in sales, and featured an idol group called ParaPara Allstars (PPA). The group originally consisted of Richie, Maki, Miho, Satoko, Tomomi, and Ryoko. At the time, Richie had been in many Twinstar videos and Satoko was featured in many 9LoveJ videos. During this period, &quot;maniac&quot; dances also were choreographed. Some of the more popular clubs featuring &quot;maniac&quot; events were Medusa and Joy.

=== 4th boom (2005–2010) ===
Although it is widely disputed that there was a 4th boom, even among Japanese historians, there was a noticeable change in the Para Para scene in 2005. Avex became aggressive in selling Para Para DVDs like &quot;Gazen ParaPara!!&quot; and &quot;We Love TechPara&quot; in 2005, which began in this boom. The height of the 4th boom could be considered to have occurred in 2007 when Farm Records released Para Para DVDs, or circa 2009 when &quot;Ani-Para&quot; reached its peak of popularity. Circa 2008, many Para Para routines were being choreographed to eurobeat remixes of anime songs, mainly by 9LoveJ.

When the Ani-Para boom ended in 2010, Avex stopped releasing videos, and 9LoveJ removed Para Para from their schedule altogether. As of 2014, there had been no major commercially released ParaPara videos since. As for &quot;maniac&quot; events, Joy and TMD choreographed until around 2008, when they stopped altogether.

=== 4th boom glacial period (2010–) ===
With Avex Trax halting all commercial ParaPara videos, the associated marketing dwindled as well, resulting in a noticeable decline in newer paralists. This decline has deeply affected the Para Para scene and has in turn resulted in a decline of club event attendance. As a response to the attendance decline, many events such as StarFire, Ravenous, and others have moved to smaller venues to save costs rather than stopping outright.

The Internet has also changed the ParaPara scene, with many lessons (including those posted by clubs) being found on platforms like YouTube. In addition, the only official club events that are active are SEF and Starfire. 9LoveJ stopped playing Eurobeat and hyper techno around the end of 2010.

== Choreographer groups ==
There are a few choreographer groups that have stood out in the history of ParaPara.

 is a long-running group of choreographers that has had many members. It is unclear when the group first began, but it is assumed to be in the early 1990s. The team had the most impact in Twinstar, where they choreographed most of the club&#x27;s Para Para routines. There were many members in the 1990s, but the most famous members were (real name Keita Fukaya), (real name Takashi Arai), (real name Taisuke Hotta), (real name Haruki Takahashi,) and (real name unknown). All five of these members have appeared in Twinstar videos at least once. , however, the only members of are (real name Yoshihiro Yamada), (real name Ryohei Yamaoka), and (real name Katsuyoshi Inomata), who are all currently choreographers of StarFire.

T-RREX is also a long-running official choreographer group. The initials stand for Twinstar, Rie, Richie, and Xenon, which refers to who started T-RREX. The most famous and long-running members are Ryōhei, Inocchi, and . They mainly choreograph for StarFire following Twinstar&#x27;s closure in 2003. Shintaro ceased activity in the community in 2010, and it is unclear if he is still in T-RREX.

Team SEF is another long-running official choreographer group. They strictly choreograph for the club event SEF. The name &quot;Team SEF&quot; wasn&#x27;t popular until the SEF Gold Club videos were first released around 2004. The members around that time were Ichi, Omami, Rena, Yano, Shingo, Kahori, and possibly Satoko. After Velfarre closed in 2006, almost all of the members were replaced when the event changed names to SEF Deluxe. The members as of 2015 are Manami, Rumine, Kaihei, Kei, Mai, Shiori and Sakiko.

== Club events ==
In any given week, there are multiple Para Para events in Japan. A typical Para Para club event begins the first 30 minutes by playing Italo disco or other such genres besides Eurobeat. Usually there are not many people during the first 30 minutes, so Eurobeat is reserved for periods of higher activity. After the first 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the number of people in the club, more danceable music is played.

Depending on the event, the first danceable songs played are different. For example, if one was at an event where the DJs played only Eurobeat songs from the 1990s, then the first songs would be from 1990 to 1991. If one were at a more official or modern event like SEF or StarFire, the songs would probably start around 1998–1999, when the 3rd ParaPara boom began. In most events, the songs have some sort of progression by year released, continuing until the end of the club event. The eras chosen vary by venue; some events may start playing songs from 2006, for example. There are some events that play techno as well as Eurobeat. In these events, there are rarely people who dance both Para Para and TechPara. Most people opt out of one segment or the other, depending on what routines they are familiar with.

At most club events, there is a lesson where new Para Para routines are taught. This is a very important part of a club event, because lessons serve to continue Para Para routines. A lesson is usually taught in 15 or 20 minutes. During a lesson, the new routine is danced first with music. After that, with spoken instructions and assistance, the dancer slowly dances each part of the routine to help attendees learn it without music. After this is done, the routine is danced for a final time with music. After the lesson, there are two or three more sets of songs played until the event ends.

== Club videos ==
Club videos are an important part of Para Para, but their importance has changed over the years. The first-known Para Para club video to be released was Avex&#x27;s &quot;ParaPara Kyōten 0&quot; on VHS. After that, many club videos were released as people were not able to film lessons by themselves in the 1990s. They became highly desirable commodities to some, as lessons were almost impossible to find before 2004–2005.

These videos are no longer sold commercially and are generally only distributed at only one event, which makes them extremely rare and essentially impossible for foreigners to see. Because of these reasons, random people began to sell club videos, mainly DVD copies, online on auction websites like Yahoo! Auctions Japan and Mobaku.jp. A full series of SEF Gold videos, for example, would usually sell for about 5,000 yen, while a much longer series like Xenon would sell for 9,000 yen or more.

In 2010, with the decline of Para Para, online sales of physical copies basically ceased. However, a project that began on March 9, 2013, on YouTube called Para Para Open Source Project has attempted to solve the problem of the rarity of club videos by uploading them to the public. Club videos released since 2009 have become less and less important, as some people have begun to upload lessons mainly to video-sharing websites like YouTube. Because of this, club events like StarFire have at least one routine on a club video that has never been taught as a lesson. In the 2010s, physical copies of club videos are not released as much anymore, with new DVDs only being distributed by StarFire and SEF every 5–6 months. This is a stark difference from the 2nd boom, when there were over 100 club videos released across Japan in the span of two years.

== Outside Japan ==
The United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Finland, France, Taiwan, Spain, Chile, Scandinavia, Brazil, Argentina and other countries outside Japan have an active fanbase doing refilms on the Internet. These dancers have circles and groups that host panels at anime conventions, where they teach Para Para routines.

The only western Para Para team ever to have been paid to perform Para Para in Japan is American Dream, which performed a special performance at Avex Rave 2005.

In the United States, Geneon Entertainment released the &quot;Para Para MAX US Mix&quot; series of CDs, which contain remixes of anime theme music from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, and many other anime productions. Volumes 1, 2, and 3 were released in 2005. Geneon held contests to promote the CD and its anime series. 2005&#x27;s contest was held at Otakon on August 20, 2005. Geneon&#x27;s efforts failed to expand the reach of Para Para in the United States. Regardless of this, Geneon released a Para Para instructional DVD called &quot;ParaPara MAX: The Moves 101&quot;, featuring several United States paralists. The DVD did not sell well due to an exclusive sales agreement with Media Play, Sam Goody and Suncoast Motion Picture Company, which soon went out of business. After the Anime Fusion Tour&#x27;s conclusion in the summer of 2006, Yoko Ishida&#x27;s management changed, which led to the end of Geneon&#x27;s promotion of Para Para in the United States.

Between the years of 2006 and 2007, Para Para briefly went mainstream in Germany and Austria due to the group Shanadoo, who performed Para Para dances in some of their music video clips.

Elsewhere in Asia, some editions of the &quot;Para Para Paradise&quot; series were released in Hong Kong.

<doc id="431729" wikidata="Q1856030" url="?curid=431729" title="The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant">
<text>The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy novels written by American author Stephen R. Donaldson. The series began as a trilogy, entitled &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot;. This was followed by another trilogy, &quot;The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;, and finally a tetralogy, &quot;The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;.

The main character of the stories is Thomas Covenant, an embittered and cynical writer, afflicted with leprosy and shunned by society but fated to become the heroic savior of the Land, an alternate world. In ten novels, published between 1977 and 2013, he struggles against Lord Foul, &quot;the Despiser&quot;, who intends to escape the bondage of the physical universe and wreak revenge upon his arch-enemy, &quot;the Creator&quot;.

== &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot; ==
# &quot;Lord Foul&#x27;s Bane&quot; (1977)
# &quot;The Illearth War&quot; (1978; &quot;Gilden-Fire&quot;—first published 1981)
# &quot;The Power that Preserves&quot; (1979)

The story &quot;Gilden-Fire&quot; first appeared as an independent novella (illustrated by Peter Goodfellow), but is now most widely available as a part of most versions of the Donaldson short story collection &quot;Daughter of Regals&quot; (1985). It was set during the action of &quot;The Illearth War&quot;, and covers an episode from the doomed mission to contact the Giants. &quot;Gilden-Fire&quot; is told from the point of view of Korik, the senior Bloodguard on the mission. It describes Korik&#x27;s selection of the mission&#x27;s Bloodguard, then narrates the mission&#x27;s passage through Grimmerdhore forest, where they defeat an ambush of ur-viles and kresh (wolves). The narrative ends as the mission leaves the forest.

According to the author&#x27;s foreword, &quot;Gilden-Fire&quot; was originally part of a larger, planned section of &quot;The Illearth War&quot; that followed the mission to the Giants in &quot;real time&quot;, but was cut due to space restrictions as well as point-of-view inconsistency with the rest of the &quot;Chronicles&quot;. The events during the trek through Grimmerdhore are not mentioned in the published narrative of &quot;The Illearth War&quot;, and some information shared here on the origin and motivation of the Bloodguard does appear in other contexts in the published &quot;Chronicles&quot;. The rest of the mission after the Grimmerdhore passage was included in the &quot;Chronicles&quot;, via the narrative device of Bloodguard messengers.

== Peoples and creatures of the Land ==

Cavewights are dimly intelligent subterranean creatures skilled in metal working and mining. They are weak-willed, and are easily intimidated by Lord Foul into serving him (though they once traded openly with the humans of the Land). They are described as having &quot;long, scrawny limbs, hands as huge and heavy as shovels,&quot; plus &quot;a thin, hunched torso, and a head shaped like a battering ram.&quot; Drool Rockworm is a cavewight.

The Creator is the mysterious being who created the Land and the universe in which it exists. This universe is referred to as &quot;the Land&quot; but is clearly a different reality than Covenant&#x27;s world. The fundamental structure of the universe, the Arch of Time, prevents the Creator from intervening directly in events in the world of his creation, and he never appears in physical form within that world. He can, however, manifest himself in the &quot;real&quot; world—he appears to Covenant and Linden as an old man in an ochre robe—and guides those who attempt to make contact between the universes.

The Demondim are a now-extinct race spawned by the Viles. They had a semi-corporeal nature, and could only achieve physical presence by animating dead bodies. They were not originally wholly evil, but their inherent self-loathing was used by Lord Foul to gain their allegiance. They spawned two other races, the Waynhim and the ur-viles.

The Elohim are a &quot;faerie&quot; people with god-like powers. They appear (to mortal perceptions) as beautiful men and women and are capable of dazzling physical transformations. They inhabit a remote region of the Earth called Elmesnedene, accessible only by ship via a narrow fjord called &quot;The Raw&quot;. Although other people are welcome to visit and even stay in Elmesnedene, time flows quickly there and even the long-lived Giants grow rapidly old and die. In their own perspective the &quot;Elohim&quot; constitute the animating principle of the Earth and the history of the Land is the manifestation of events in their own consciousness. As they regard their own domain as the only &quot;real&quot; place in the Earth, they rarely dabble in outside events. However, if they perceive a grave threat to the Earth, one of their number is &quot;Appointed&quot; to attempt to avert the threat – and to bear the cost of failing.

Forestals are beings who serve the forests of the Land, the remnants of the One Forest, the great sentient wood which once covered the Land. They are human in appearance, but according to the &quot;Elohim&quot; they were created by the One Forest itself using knowledge from another &quot;Elohim&quot; imprisoned within the Colossus. The Forestals actively protected the remaining forest from destruction by encroaching mortals. They were more numerous in the distant past but few survived into the era of the New Lords. By the time of the Second Chronicles, when the remnants of the ancient forest (with the exception of Giant Woods in the Lower Land) were long dead, the last remaining Forestal lived in Andelain. His name was Caer-Caveral, though he was originally Hile Troy, a man from Covenant&#x27;s world who had once been Warmark (commander-in-chief) of the Lords&#x27; army. As described in &quot;The Illearth War&quot;, a mortal may in a desperate situation ask for the Forestals&#x27; help by singing the Forestals&#x27; own song (&quot;I am the forest...&quot;) - but anyone who does that must pay by becoming a Forestal oneself. Hile Troy was willing to pay that price, to save the army under his command from defeat and destruction. 

The Giants are a race of extremely long-lived (but nevertheless mortal) humanoids of unusual height and strength. Giants are known for their stone lore (similar to but not identical with that of the Stonedownors), their skill at seamanship, their good humour and their love of story-telling. A common Giantish interjection is, &quot;Stone and Sea!&quot; Giants are resistant to cold and cannot be harmed by ordinary fire. Fire does, however, cause them intense pain, which they use to cure themselves of grief in a ritual known as &quot;caamora&quot;. In return for a favor performed for the mysterious &quot;Elohim&quot; long ago, the entire race of Giants are endowed with an innate ability to speak and understand all languages. The Giants&#x27; own language is very florid and verbose, and they find human speech to be rather curt and inexpressive. The Giants of the Land are sometimes called the Unhomed since they were separated from their homeland long ago. Although the Giants love children, they are becoming infertile, and their numbers are dwindling. Kevin Landwaster entrusted them with the first of his Seven Wards before the Ritual of Desecration. They sometimes address (and are addressed by) humans as &quot;Rockbrother&quot; or &quot;Rocksister&quot;, in honor of the ancient alliance they made with High Lord Damelon Giantfriend. Saltheart Foamfollower is a Giant.

The Griffins are winged lions. They are sometimes ridden by ur-viles.

The Haruchai are a hardy race of warriors living in the Westron Mountains, west of the Land. The Haruchai shun the use of weapons or magic, taking pride in their own physical prowess and the purity of their service, which is never given lightly. They have the ability to communicate amongst themselves via telepathy, and each can access the combined memories of their entire race. Outwardly stoic, even seemingly emotionless, they could also be considered arrogant in their beliefs. It is revealed on several occasions that the Haruchai are a deeply passionate race, capable of swearing a lifetime&#x27;s worth of service if sufficiently moved.

The Insequent are a mysterious race of people who dwell to the west of the Land. Each Insequent has a unique and very focused skill that can seem magical or superhuman. These skills range from invisibility, virtual invulnerability or even time travel. They have an almost dismissive disdain for the Haruchai and a bitter and long-standing rivalry with &quot;The Elohim&quot;, which has not yet been fully explained. They rarely reveal their true names, but prefer to be identified by their titles. So far only four Insequent have appeared in the stories: The Mahdoubt, the Harrow, the Theomach and the Ardent. A fifth, the Vizard, is referenced by several other characters, and a sixth—the Auriference—is mentioned briefly by the Ardent, although both the Vizard and the Auriference are believed to be deceased.

The Lords are the leaders and stewards of the Land, also known as Earthfriends. The standards for Lordship are high, so they are generally few in number. In order to become a Lord, a person must master the martial arts and the theory and application of magic. These skills are called the Sword and the Staff respectively, and together form the First Ward of Kevin&#x27;s Lore, an ancient repository of knowledge. A student who masters both parts of the Lore – and does not opt to become &quot;Unfettered&quot; in order to pursue a private vision – is invited to join the Council of Lords at Revelstone, also known as Lord&#x27;s Keep. The Lords carry special staffs that allow them to channel their power, and are easily identified by their sky blue robes.

 is the most commonly used name for the ancient enemy of the Land, given to him by the Council of Lords. He is also called &#x27;The Despiser&#x27;, the &#x27;Gray Slayer&#x27; (his name in The Plains), &#x27;Fangthane the Render&#x27; by the Ramen and &#x27;a-Jeroth of the Seven Hells&#x27; by The Clave. According to Roger Covenant, he also called himself &#x27;a-Jeroth&#x27; during the time he served on Kevin&#x27;s council. He is described as &quot;the wicked son or brother of the Creator&#x27;s heart&quot; and is the source of all evil in the Land. He is a being of pure spirit, although capable of taking on human form, and is apparently immortal: he cannot be killed, but his power can be reduced to near insignificance. On occasions when this has happened he has always been able to restore and regenerate his power. His desire to bring suffering to the earth and the Land in particular is manifested by his extremely well orchestrated and even cautious long-term plans throughout the chronicles.

The Ramen tend to the needs of the Ranyhyn (see below). The Ramen&#x27;s life-work is to serve the Ranyhyn, whom they hold in very high esteem. Traditionally they do not ride or otherwise subjugate the great horses, and can grow resentful of those who do. The fact that the Lords of Revelstone and the Bloodguard often ride the great horses is a major point of contention, but the Ramen tolerate this in deference to the Ranyhyn, who choose to give their service. When defending the Ranyhyn from Kresh (large wolves in service to the Despiser) or other predators, the Ramen frequently use ropes as garottes to break the attackers&#x27; necks. Ramen are organised into three &quot;ranks&quot;: &quot;Manethralls&quot; who are the leaders, &quot;Cords&quot; who assist the Manethralls while training to become Manethralls themselves, and &quot;Winhomes&quot; who perform domestic supporting duties. Two other ranks are mentioned in &quot;The Runes of the Earth&quot;, Keepers and Curriers, but their placement within the Ramen hierarchy is not known.

The Ranyhyn are the great horses of the Land. In the early books these horses live on the Plains of Ra, though in the age of the Sunbane they leave the Land altogether. They are protected by their human servants the Ramen. The Ranyhyn are akin to normal horses, but are larger, always have a star and are in some indefinable sense enhanced by the Earthpower of the Land, so that their speed, endurance and intelligence outstrip those of a standard horse. The Ranyhyn can be ridden by individuals they deem worthy, but a person who seeks such a mount must travel to the Plains of Ra and offer himself to the horses for consideration. If a Ranyhyn accepts a rider, it is loyal to that rider until death. All of the Bloodguard (apparently) are accepted by the Ranyhyn, but not all Lords have been deemed worthy. The Ranyhyn also have a limited ability to perceive the future; these horses can &quot;hear&quot; when their rider will need them, hearing their calling days or weeks before the rider makes the call. Thus, when the rider summons his Ranyhyn, it appears shortly thereafter, regardless of the distance between them.
Ravers are bodiless evil spirits with the ability to possess and control some lesser creatures, and most humans as well. Giants and Bloodguard are typically immune to this power, and there are no known instances of a Raver possessing a Ranyhyn. There are only three Ravers, ancient brothers who each have many names but are commonly called Turiya Herem, Samadhi Sheol, and Moksha Jehannum. Their greatest hatred is reserved for the trees of the One Forest of old, and their loathing of the Earthpower and all good things has led them to become Lord Foul&#x27;s willing servants. The Despiser is somehow able to enhance their abilities when he pleases, but can prevent them from possessing individuals he deems too powerful (They were not allowed to possess Thomas Covenant, for instance, because his ring would make them too powerful for Lord Foul to control). This possession can be, and in some cases needs to be, facilitated by some external power. In the &#x27;Illearth War&#x27; the Ravers were only able to possess their giant &#x27;hosts&#x27; when they worked in harmony with the power of the Illearth Stone. They often serve as leaders in Lord Foul&#x27;s armies, or as spies among his enemies.

Stonedownors are humans descended from the Land&#x27;s original inhabitants. They are known for their knowledge of stone lore and live in stone huts. A master of stone lore is called a &quot;Gravelingas&quot;, or a &quot;Rhadhamaerl&quot; which also refers to the craft of stone lore. Stonedownors are typically dark-skinned, squat and muscular, though this is not always the case. Trell and Triock are both unusually tall for Stonedownors. During the Second Chronicles, their leaders are known as Gravellers, and sacrifice members of their village to use the blood to call forth the power of the Sunbane. Sunder, the Graveller of Mithil Stonedown, manages to use the power of Loric&#x27;s Krill to summon forth the power of the Sunbane without shedding blood, and learns to manipulate the Sunbane for his own purposes.

Ur-viles are blind yet highly magical creatures of jet black color and are constructs of an extinct race named the Demondim. One of their most distinctive abilities is that when assembled in a wedge formation, the leader (or &quot;loremaster&quot;) at the apex wields the combined power of the entire group, without weakening any of their kin in the rest of the wedge. The ur-viles initially served Lord Foul, but later turned against him by creating the creature Vain (from which the new Staff of Law was created). In &quot;The Runes of the Earth&quot;, the ur-viles have actively joined the side of &quot;good&quot;, though their motivation remains unclear. Because they were made rather than born, the ur-viles loathe their own bodies and often redirect this rage towards other targets. They also do not die, except when killed, or reproduce naturally, although they do retain the lore required to construct more of their own kind and the Waynhim—however, their motivations for doing so are unlike those of natural creatures.

Viles are an extinct race who spawned the Demondim. They were non-corporeal, but nonetheless very powerful. Initially a proud and gifted race, they were led into self-hatred and despair by the Ravers. They were eventually destroyed by the Council of Lords, under High Lord Loric &quot;Vilesilencer&quot;.

The Waynhim are another race of creatures spawned by the Demondim that closely resemble the Ur-viles, though smaller and lighter in color. Like the Ur-viles (who are their long-standing nemeses), the Waynhim were made rather than born. However, they do not share their cousins&#x27; self-hatred, and have dedicated themselves to serving the Land and the Earthpower according to their own peculiar ethical system, the &quot;Weird&quot; of the Waynhim. Like the Ur-viles, they fight in a wedge formation with a loremaster at the apex.

The Woodhelvennin are humans descended from the Land&#x27;s original inhabitants. They are known for their use of wood lore and living in tree-top villages called &quot;woodhelvens&quot;. The village elders are called &quot;Heers&quot;. A master of wood lore is called a &quot;Hirebrand,&quot; or a &quot;lillianrill&quot; (&quot;Lillianrill&quot; usually refers to the craft of wood lore). They are typically fair-skinned, tall and slender. During the age of the Sunbane, in the absence of permanent trees, woodhelvens became villages of wooden huts.

== Main concepts ==
In Donaldson&#x27;s fiction, Andelain is a focal region of the Land, where the Earthpower is especially strong. In the Second Chronicles it is the one place immune from the Sunbane, as it is protected by the Forestal Caer Caveral.

Languages: Human inhabitants of the Land (together with Giants, Cavewights, and the human inhabitants of other regions of the Earth) all appear to speak modern English, though their style of speech is usually rather formal and archaic. The strange commonality of language between Covenant and the Land&#x27;s inhabitants is never addressed in the books. There are, however, other languages extant: for example, in &quot;Lord Foul&#x27;s Bane&quot;, Atiaran tells Thomas Covenant that a different language was spoken in the age of the Old Lords. (However, this appears to be contradicted in &quot;Fatal Revenant&quot;, when Linden Avery and Berek Halfhand converse together in English.) Non-humans also have their own languages, for example the barking speech of ur-viles and Waynhim, the Giants&#x27; florid and ornate language, and the native tongue of the &quot;Haruchai&quot;. In the Second Chronicles it is explained that the Giants received &quot;the gift of tongues&quot; from the &quot;Elohim&quot; as a reward for the telling of a simple tale, and the &quot;Bhrathair&quot;, a people who live on the edge of the Great Desert, also speak their own language, which is described only as sounding &quot;brackish&quot;.

Worm/Word/Weird. In the cosmology of the Land, the Earth&#x27;s core consists of a coiled-up serpent called the &quot;Worm of the World&#x27;s End&quot;. When Covenant attempts to sever a branch of the One Tree by using the power of the white gold, he risks rousing the Worm (which is not fully asleep, but merely resting) and thus destroying the Earth. The Waynhim and Ur-viles believe in a principle of ethics or destiny called the &quot;Weird&quot;. The Elohim have a concept which appears to do duty for both these beliefs: it is impossible to determine whether the sound used for this is &quot;Worm&quot;, &quot;Word&quot; or &quot;Weird&quot;, as it comes out in a blurred form sounding something like &quot;Würd&quot;.

== Terminology ==
In the Thomas Covenant stories, Donaldson takes several terms from Sanskrit that are significant in Hinduism and Buddhism and reassigns them meanings in the Land. For example, the term &quot;moksha&quot;, which in Sanskrit refers to liberation from the cycle of sorrow, is given as the original name for a creature of depravity and evil called a Raver. Another Raver, Satansfist, is called &quot;samādhi&quot;, which in Sanskrit refers to a state of mind in which one achieves oneness with the object of one&#x27;s concentration. The third Raver, Kinslaughterer, is called &quot;turiya&quot;, Sanskrit for a state of pure consciousness. Donaldson has commented on his website that moksha, samadhi, and turiya are ways the Ravers describe themselves, while their other names are given by others.

== Critical response ==
The first volume in the series was included in David Pringle&#x27;s book &quot;Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels&quot;.

Conversely, in 1986, David Langford published an essay by Nick Lowe, in which Lowe suggested &quot;a way to derive pleasure from Stephen Donaldson books. (Needless to say, it doesn&#x27;t involve reading them.)&quot; This proposal involved a game he called &quot;Clench Racing&quot;, wherein players each open a volume of the &quot;Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot; to a random page; the winner is the first to find the word &quot;clench&quot;. Lowe describes it as a &quot;fast&quot; game – &quot;sixty seconds is unusually drawn out&quot;.

In 1995, scholar W. A. Senior published a full-length study published by Kent State University Press entitled &quot;Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s Chronicles of Thomas Covenant: Variations on the Fantasy of Tradition&quot;. It situates the Chronicles in the context of the fantasy tradition and argues that &quot;Donaldson has created an important contribution to the canon because of his serious intent and adult concerns, his powerful mythopoesis, and his manipulation of the conventions of epic fantasy.&quot;

In 2009, James Nicoll said that Thomas Covenant would win a &quot;special lifetime achievement award&quot; for the &quot;most unlikeable supposedly sympathetic protagonist&quot;.

In 2013, Tom Shippey, writing in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, declared that, &quot;in time &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot; will be seen as one of the self-defining works of the third millennium, our equivalent in scope and ambition of earlier epics and fantasies, from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; to Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Arthurian Idylls&quot; and Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot;

<text>West Midlands County Council (WMCC) was, from 1974 to 1986, the upper-tier administrative body for the West Midlands county, a metropolitan county in England.

==History==
The WMCC existed for a total of twelve years. It was established on 1 April 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972 and was abolished on 31 March 1986. It was abolished along with five other metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council by the government of Margaret Thatcher under the Local Government Act 1985.

The WMCC was a strategic authority running regional services such as transport, emergency services, and strategic planning. Elections were held to the council in 1973, 1977 and 1981. Elections were due to be held in 1985 but were cancelled due to the council&#x27;s impending abolition. The Labour Party controlled the council from 1974 to 1977, with the Conservatives controlling it 1977–81. It reverted to Labour control for the last term 1981–86.

==Premises==

The first meeting of the shadow authority was held on 30 April 1973 at Council House, Birmingham. Meetings were held at Council House throughout the county council&#x27;s existence. The county council established its main administrative offices at County Hall, 1 Lancaster Circus, in central Birmingham. After the county council&#x27;s abolition in 1986, County Hall was occupied, but not as its headquarters, by Birmingham City Council, until it was sold in 2022 to private investors.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1986 was held by the following parties:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council were:

===Council elections===
Elections were held to the West Midlands County Council three times, in 1973, 1977, and 1981.
Elections were due to be held in 1985 but these were cancelled due to the council&#x27;s impending abolition. Those councillors elected in 1981 had their terms of office extended until the council&#x27;s abolition on 31 March 1986.

<text>Syndicate is a series of science fiction video games created by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts. There are two main titles: &quot;Syndicate&quot; (1993) and &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; (1996), both of which are isometric real-time tactics games. An additional first-person shooter &quot;Syndicate&quot; title was released in 2012, and a spiritual successor to the series (returning to the real-time tactics format), entitled &quot;Satellite Reign&quot;, was released in 2015.

==Games==

=== &quot;Syndicate&quot; (1993) ===

&quot;Syndicate&quot;, the first game in the series, was first released for PC and Amiga in June 1993, with later releases on other platforms including Sega Genesis, SNES, Atari Jaguar, and PlayStation Portable. In 2015, the game was made available for free on Electronic Arts&#x27; Origin platform, however it now costs £4.25 (As of 20JUN19).

An expansion pack, titled &quot;&quot;, was also released for PC and Amiga in 1993.

Special edition, titled &quot;Syndicate Plus&quot;, include original game, American Revolt expansion pack and support for current versions of Sound Blaster released for PC in 1994.

=== &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; ===

The second game in the series, &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;, was released for PC in October 1996 and PlayStation in July 1997. &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; utilized a more demanding graphics engine, including a 3-dimensional environment, compared with the 2-dimensional layout of &quot;Syndicate&quot;).

In 2008, a digital distribution version of the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network.

=== &quot;Syndicate&quot; (2012) ===

Reports of a new &quot;Syndicate&quot; game, developed for EA by Starbreeze Studios, first surfaced in March 2009 and were officially confirmed in September 2011. The game, also entitled &quot;Syndicate&quot;, was released on 21 February 2012; however, it used a first-person shooter format, which differed significantly from the isometric real-time tactics format of the series&#x27; original games.

=== Future and cancelled games ===
According to a former Bullfrog Productions employee, a follow-up &quot;Syndicate&quot; title for PC began development shortly after the release of &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; in 1999; however, this development effort was never completed. This was followed by several further development efforts which did not progress.

The same employee states that a &quot;Syndicate&quot; title on PlayStation 2 was under development for approximately one year; however, this title was also never released. It was intended to feature a &quot;free-roaming, multi-tiered city&quot; and two new factions, known as the &quot;Freemen&quot; and the &quot;Hybrid&quot;. Several pieces of concept art from this project were released by another former Bullfrog employee, Mike Man.

In a 2006 interview at the Leipzig Games Convention for GameSpot, Peter Molyneux (co-founder of Bullfrog Productions) said that he would like to revisit some of his old efforts, but adds that it is very unlikely that will happen; however, Molyneux made one possible exception:&quot;Aside from the licensing complications, some sort of next-gen online version of &quot;Syndicate&quot; would certainly be popular with gamers.&quot;

==== &quot;Creation&quot; ====

A Bullfrog project named &quot;Creation&quot; was intended to take place on an alien world set in the &quot;Syndicate&quot; universe. The game&#x27;s plot was to have EuroCorp as the antagonists, while the player, representing a third-party biologist, utilized semi-sentient dolphins to fight them.

Following development for MS-DOS, Amiga CD32, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn, the game was cancelled in 1997.

=== Related games ===

==== &quot;Satellite Reign&quot; ====

On 15 May 2013, Mike Diskett (who was the producer and lead programmer for &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;) posted a video on YouTube that revealed an imminent Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a new spiritual successor to &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;, called &quot;Satellite Reign&quot;, which returned to the series&#x27; original real-time tactics format. When it closed on 28 July 2013, the campaign had raised £461,333 ($720,832), compared to its £350,000 ($546,875) goal. &quot;Satellite Reign&quot; was subsequently released on August 28, 2015.

==Plot==

=== &quot;Syndicate&quot; (1993) and &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; ===

The original &quot;Syndicate&quot; is set in the year 2096. As outlined in the game&#x27;s instruction manual, multinational megacorporations have replaced nation-state governments, and one such corporation, EuroCorp, has manufactured the &quot;CHIP&quot;: a device implanted in a person&#x27;s neck that alters their perception (&quot;numbing their senses to the misery and squalor around them&quot;) and allows them to be easily manipulated. The megacorporations have subsequently been infiltrated and overtaken by corrupt crime syndicates vying for global control.

The player is placed in charge one such corporation, for which they choose a name and logo. During the course of the game, as missions for the player&#x27;s corporation are completed by teams of cyborg enforcers known as &quot;agents,&quot; it gains global dominance over its competitors.

&quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; is set 95 years after the original game (in the year 2191), when EuroCorp holds full global control, using CHIP technology to influence the population. The release of a virus into the global communications network leads to widespread CHIP failures, resulting in the emergence of armed insurrectionists referred to as &quot;unguided citizens.&quot; The group responsible for the biological attack is a militant religious organisation called the Church of the New Epoch.

The game&#x27;s instruction manual specifically addresses the player as a newly hired EuroCorp executive; however, they can choose to control agents from either EuroCorp (to suppress uprisings resulting from the virus outbreak) or the Church of the New Epoch (to seize power from EuroCorp).

The game ends with a battle for control of ionosphere calibration equipment on the moon, which the Church&#x27;s leaders intend to use in eliminating life on Earth; however (regardless of which faction the player chooses to play as), the leaders are eliminated before this plan can be executed.

=== &quot;Syndicate&quot; (2012) ===
The plot of the later &quot;Syndicate&quot; game renames the CHIP technology to the &quot;DART chip&quot;, and introduces the concept of the &quot;unchipped&quot;, a proportion of the world&#x27;s population who declined the use of this technology. The game is set in the year 2069 (prior to the original games), at which point, &quot;EuroCorp&quot; is already an established global megacorporation.

The main story focuses on a specific agent, named Miles Kilo. Kilo uncovers a plot from a rival corporation, &quot;Aspari&quot;, to begin a war against &quot;EuroCorp&quot;, before discovering that &quot;EuroCorp&quot; killed his family, abducted him as a baby and modified his memory. The game ends with the apparent downfall of &quot;EuroCorp&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay for the original &quot;Syndicate&quot; games involved ordering a team of four cyborg agents around gritty cyberpunk-themed cities, in pursuit of mission goals, such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, &quot;persuading&quot; civilians and scientists to join the corporation/church, demolishing buildings, or killing enemy agents. Unlike some games, which either punish the player for civilian deaths or reward them for violent actions committed, &quot;Syndicate&quot; remains indifferent. The player must collect funds to finance the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades, such as by taxing conquered territories (in the original game) or robbing banks (in &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;).

Notable features of both original games are the use of context-sensitive background music, which changes to suit the mood of the on-screen action, and a high degree of interactivity: many objects in the first game, and nearly every object in the second game, can be destroyed. The visual aesthetic of these games borrows heavily from films such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

The gameplay of the 2012 &quot;Syndicate&quot; game did not include the same real-time tactics and strategy elements as the previous games, instead following a typical first-person shooter format.

<text>Amphipoda () is an order of malacostracan crustaceans with no carapace and generally with laterally compressed bodies. Amphipods () range in size from and are mostly detritivores or scavengers. There are more than 9,900 amphipod species so far described. They are mostly marine animals, but are found in almost all aquatic environments. Some 1,900 species live in fresh water, and the order also includes the terrestrial sandhoppers such as &quot;Talitrus saltator&quot; and &quot;Arcitalitrus sylvaticus&quot;.

==Etymology and names==
The name &quot;Amphipoda&quot; comes, via Neo-Latin &quot;&quot;, from the Greek roots &#x27;on both/all sides&#x27; and &#x27;foot&#x27;. This contrasts with the related Isopoda, which have a single kind of thoracic leg. Particularly among anglers, amphipods are known as &quot;freshwater shrimp&quot;, &quot;scuds&quot;, or &quot;sideswimmers&quot;.

==Description==

===Anatomy===

The body of an amphipod is divided into 13 segments, which can be grouped into a head, a thorax and an abdomen.

The head is fused to the thorax, and bears two pairs of antennae and one pair of sessile compound eyes. It also carries the mouthparts, but these are mostly concealed.

The thorax and abdomen are usually quite distinct and bear different kinds of legs; they are typically laterally compressed, and there is no carapace. The thorax bears eight pairs of uniramous appendages, the first of which are used as accessory mouthparts; the next four pairs are directed forwards, and the last three pairs are directed backwards. Gills are present on the thoracic segments, and there is an open circulatory system with a heart, using haemocyanin to carry oxygen in the haemolymph to the tissues. The uptake and excretion of salts is controlled by special glands on the antennae.

The abdomen is divided into two parts: the pleosome which bears swimming legs; and the urosome, which comprises a telson and three pairs of uropods which do not form a tail fan as they do in animals such as true shrimp.

===Size===
Amphipods are typically less than long, but the largest recorded living amphipods were long, and were photographed at a depth of in the Pacific Ocean. Samples retrieved from the stomach of a black-footed albatross had a reconstructed length of ; it was assigned to the same species, &quot;Alicella gigantea&quot;. A study of the Kermadec Trench observed more specimens of &quot;A. gigantea&quot;, the largest of which was estimated at 34.9 cm long, and collected some for examination, the largest of which was measured at 27.8 cm long. The smallest known amphipods are less than long. The size of amphipods is limited by the availability of dissolved oxygen, such that the amphipods in Lake Titicaca at an altitude of can only grow up to , compared to lengths of in Lake Baikal at .

Some amphipods exhibit sexual dimorphism. In dimorphic species, males are usually larger than females, although this is reversed in the genus Crangonyx.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Amphipods engage in amplexus, a precopulatory guarding behavior in which males will grasp a female with their gnathopods (enlarged appendages used for feeding) and carry the female held against their ventral surface. Amplexus can last from two to over fifteen days, depending on water temperature, and ends when the female molts, at which point her eggs are ready for fertilisation.

Mature females bear a &quot;marsupium&quot;, or brood pouch, which holds her eggs while they are fertilised, and until the young are ready to hatch. As a female ages, she produces more eggs in each brood. Mortality is around 25–50% for the eggs. There are no larval stages; the eggs hatch directly into a juvenile form, and sexual maturity is generally reached after 6 moults. Some species have been known to eat their own exuviae after moulting

==Diversity and classification==


Over 10,500 species of amphipods are currently recognised. Traditionally they were placed in the four suborders Gammaridea, Caprellidea, Hyperiidea, and Ingolfiellidea. 
Suborder Gammaridea contained the majority of taxa, including all the freshwater and terrestrial species. In contrast, the small suborder Ingolfiellidea only had 40 species.

Gammaridea had been recognised as a problematic group in need of taxonomic revision. It had no synapomorphies and became the repository for family-level taxa that didn&#x27;t have synapomorphies for one of the other suborders. A new classification that breaks up and replaces Gammaridea has been developed in the work of J. K. Lowry and A. A. Myers using cladistic analysis of morphological characters. In 2003, suborder Corophiidea was reestablished for parts of Gammaridea and for the Caprellidea, which was found to be a derived part of the corophiidean clade and became infraorder Caprellida. Then in 2013, new large suborder Senticaudata was split off from the Gammaridea. The Senticaudata, which comprised over half of the known amphipod species., was divided into six infraorders, one of which was the former Corophiidea (including the former Caprellidea as a parvorder). The dismemberment of Gammaridea was completed in 2017 with the establishment of four new suborders in a six suborder classification: Pseudingolfiellidea,
Hyperiidea, Colomastigidea, Hyperiopsidea, Senticaudata and Amphilochidea. At the same time, Ingolfiellidea was split from Amphipoda and reclassified as order Ingolfiellida. The more recent work of Copilaş-Ciocianu et al. (2020) using analysis of molecular data (including 18S and 28S rRNA sequences and the protein coding COI and H3 sequences) found general support for three major groups corresponding to suborders Amphilochidea, Hyperiidea and Senticaudata, but suggests some groups need to move between Amphilochidea and Senticaudata in a taxonomic revision.

The classification listed immediately below, from the rank of suborder down to superfamily, represents the traditional division as given in Martin &amp; Davis (2001), except that superfamilies are recognised here within the Gammaridea. The new classification of Lowry and Meyers (2017) is shown in the cladogram.

===Fossil record===
Amphipods are thought to have originated in the Lower Carboniferous. Despite the group&#x27;s age, however, the fossil record of the order Amphipoda is meagre, comprising specimens of one species from the Lower Cretaceous (Hauterivian) Weald Clay (United Kingdom) and 12 species dating back only as far as the Upper Eocene, where they have been found in Baltic amber.

==Ecology==

Amphipods are found in almost all aquatic environments, from fresh water to water with twice the salinity of sea water and even in the Challenger Deep, the deepest known point in the ocean. They are almost always an important component of aquatic ecosystems, often acting as mesograzers. Most species in the suborder Gammaridea are epibenthic, although they are often collected in plankton samples. Members of the Hyperiidea are all planktonic and marine. Many are symbionts of gelatinous animals, including salps, medusae, siphonophores, colonial radiolarians and ctenophores, and most hyperiids are associated with gelatinous animals during some part of their life cycle. Some 1,900 species, or 20% of the total amphipod diversity, live in fresh water or other non-marine waters. Notably rich endemic amphipod faunas are found in the ancient Lake Baikal and waters of the Caspian Sea basin.

The landhoppers of the family Talitridae (which also includes semi-terrestrial and marine animals) are terrestrial, living in damp environments such as leaf litter. Landhoppers have a wide distribution in areas that were formerly part of Gondwana, but have colonised parts of Europe and North America in recent times.

Around 750 species in 160 genera and 30 families are troglobitic, and are found in almost all suitable habitats, but with their centres of diversity in the Mediterranean Basin, southeastern North America and the Caribbean.

In populations found in Benthic ecosystems, amphipods play an essential role in controlling brown algae growth. The mesograzer behaviour of amphipods greatly contributes to the suppression of brown algal dominance in the absence of amphipod predators. Amphipods display a strong preference for brown algae in Benthic ecosystems, but due to removal of mesograzers by predators such as fish, brown algae is able to dominate these communities over green and red algae species.

===Morphology===
Compared to other crustacean groups, such as the Isopoda, Rhizocephala or Copepoda, relatively few amphipods are parasitic on other animals. The most notable example of parasitic amphipods are the whale lice (family Cyamidae). Unlike other amphipods, these are dorso-ventrally flattened, and have large, strong claws, with which they attach themselves to baleen whales. They are the only parasitic crustaceans which cannot swim during any part of their life cycle.

===Foraging behaviour===
Most amphipods are detritivores or scavengers, with some being grazers of algae, omnivores or predators of small insects and crustaceans. Food is grasped with the front two pairs of legs, which are armed with large claws. More immobile species of amphipods eat higher quantities of less nutritious food rather than actively seeking more nutritious food. This is a type of compensatory feeding. This behaviour may have evolved to minimise predation risk when searching for other foods. &quot;Ampithoe longimana&quot;, for example, is more sedentary than other species and have been observed to remain on host plants longer. In fact, when presented with both high- and low-nutrition food options, the sedentary species &quot;Ampithoe longimana&quot; does not distinguish between the two options. Other amphipod species, such as &quot;Gammarus mucronatus&quot; and &quot;Elasmopus levis&quot;, which have superior predator avoidance and are more mobile, are better able to pursue different food sources. In species without the compensatory feeding ability, survivorship, fertility, and growth can be strongly negatively affected in the absence of high-quality food. Compensatory feeding may also explain the year-round presence of &quot;A. longimana&quot; in certain waters. Because algal presence changes throughout the year in certain communities, the evolution of flexible feeding techniques such as compensatory feeding may have been beneficial to survival.

&quot;Ampithoe longimana&quot; has been observed to avoid certain compounds when foraging for food. In response to this avoidance, species of seaweed such as &quot;Dictyopteris membranacea&quot; or &quot;Dictyopteris hoytii&quot; have evolved to produce C11 sulfur compounds and C-9 oxo-acids in their bodies as defense mechanisms that specifically deter amphipods instead of deterrence to consumption by other predators.

The incidence of cannibalism and intraguild predation is relatively high in some species, although adults may decrease cannibalistic behaviour directed at juveniles when they are likely to encounter their own offspring. In addition to age, sex may affect cannibalistic behaviour as males cannibalised newly moulted females less than males.

They have, rarely, been identified as feeding on humans; in Melbourne in 2017 a boy who stood in the sea for about half an hour had severe bleeding from wounds on his legs that did not coagulate easily. This was found to have been caused by &quot;sea fleas&quot; identified as &quot;lysianassid amphipods&quot;, possibly in a feeding group. Their bites are not venomous and do not cause lasting damage.

<text>Jassa falcata, commonly known as scud, is a tube-dwelling amphipod.

==Ecology==
&quot;Jassa falcata&quot; constructs tubes of debris. It is a fouling organism, growing on the bottoms of ships and slowing them down. &quot;J. falcata&quot; forms dense mats or nests. The male and the female live in different tubes. &quot;J. falcata&quot; feeds generally on hydroid growth on the bottom of rafts and ships. It is generally a suspension feeder normally found on sediment areas.

==Description==
Amphipods have two pairs of antennae. In &quot;J. falcata&quot; the first antennae have two-segmented flagella and are shorter and more slender than the second antennae. Males are 7–13 mm long and females are 6–12 mm. Colours vary but are usually yellow-grey with brown, red or black patches depending on the colour of the habitat.

==Distribution==
&quot;Jassa falcata&quot; is found on all British coasts. It has also been reported in several sites around the coast of Ireland.

<doc id="431754" wikidata="Q5149700" url="?curid=431754" title="Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School">
<text>Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School (&quot;Columbia Grammar&quot;, &quot;Columbia Prep&quot;, &quot;CGPS&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot;) is a school at 5 West 93rd Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. The oldest nonsectarian independent school in the city, it serves students from pre-kindergarten through the twelfth grade and offers a college preparatory curriculum.

It was founded in 1764 by what is now Columbia University to teach future freshmen English, Greek, and Latin grammar. The school was originally called The Grammar School of King&#x27;s College, after the original name of Columbia University. When the college changed its name during the American Revolution, so did the school, to Columbia Grammar School.

The school dissolved its formal ties with Columbia in 1865. The word &quot;preparatory&quot; was added in 1969.

The school has existed in several locations. In 1907, the school moved to its current location on 93rd Street, off Central Park West. Originally consisting of one building, it added five brownstones through its 1956 merger with the adjacent Leonard School for Girls. A building across the street was built in 1984, followed by two more in 1997 and 2001. An administration building was added to the school in 2009.

==History==

The school was founded in 1764 by the 10-year-old King&#x27;s College as a preparatory school. It ran for 100 years under the direct auspices of the college.

One of the most illustrious headmasters during that period was Charles Anthon, one of America&#x27;s earliest and most distinguished classical scholars. During his tenure, the Grammar School provided over half the students to Columbia College&#x27;s freshman class.

In 1864, when Anthon retired as headmaster, the trustees of Columbia College ended their relationship with the Grammar School and the school became a proprietary institution. It would gain nonprofit status in 1941.

In 1937, the Leonard School for Girls was founded, using several interconnected brownstones on West 94th Street (now part of the lower school). The school joined with the Grammar School in 1956 to become a coed institution.

Richard J. Soghoian, who became the school&#x27;s 13th headmaster in 1981, guided the physical expansion of the school from its 1906 home at 5 West 93rd Street to the present complex, which totals with 14 buildings between 92nd and 94th streets. Soghoian retired in 2017.

In 2017, William Donohue was headmaster, Sarah McLean was the Grammar School director (a predecessor, Stanley Seidman, retired in 2010), Paul Baly was the Middle School director, and Joanie Dean was the Prep School director.

==Accreditation==
Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School is a fully independent, non-sectarian school governed by a board of trustees composed of alumni and parents. The school is accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and the New York State Board of Regents.

The school is a member of the Independent School Admissions Association of Greater New York (ISAAGNY).

==Campus==

In 1984, the school built a new Preparatory School at 4 West 93rd, containing a full-sized gymnasium, three science labs, state-of-the art computer lab, library, three music studios, and nine classrooms.

Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School greatly expanded its physical plant after 1985. Three new buildings and a fully renovated brownstone have, together with the existing buildings, added academic facilities as well as two new theaters, several computer labs, a variety of art studios and space for a growing music program. The Grammar School is located in a series of five interconnecting brownstones on 94th Street just off Central Park, and the 1905 Columbia Grammar School building at 5 West 93rd Street. In addition to classrooms, these house two libraries, two art studios, a gymnasium, swimming pool, two music studios, a science lab, a computer lab, and the Grammar School cafeteria.

In 1996, 36 West 93rd Street was completed, adding of space to the physical plant. This building, which goes through from 93rd to 92nd Street, has two computer labs, five art studios, library, science labs, and classrooms for grades 5 and 6, a fully equipped theater, and a large cafeteria.

In September 2001, the school added five classrooms, another full-sized gym, a state-of-the-art theater, and three floors of classrooms and science labs.

Since then, many brownstones have been added, one entirely for offices, and one building dedicated to the arts. A walkway has been built behind the multiple brownstones to make them easier to navigate. In 2009, CGPS purchased several new brownstones, one entirely for the kindergarten, another for a science building, and one for administrative offices. The Prep School also added a new level to its library.

The new CGPS Middle School opened its doors to students in grades 5, 6 and 7 on Thursday, September 8, 2016. Two floors were added to the existing 36 West 93rd Street building to create a 6th and 7th floor solely for these grades, while the remainder of the building has been renovated. The ground floor now features an expansive yoga and dance studio; the existing Prep School cafeteria has been renovated and a second floor cafeteria was added specifically for Middle School students. New art studios as well as a new library, three science labs, a rooftop play yard and twelve classrooms have been added to the building. The HVAC system has been updated and the building is fully handicap-accessible.

<text>As of 2017, there were at least 305 breeds of the domestic rabbit in 70 countries around the world raised for in the agricultural practice of breeding and raising domestic rabbits as livestock for their value in meat, fur, wool, education, scientific research, entertainment and companionship in cuniculture. A rabbit breed is a distinct strain created through selective breeding (or occasionally natural selection) for specific characteristics, including size, fur, body type, color, feed conversion ratio, et cetera. Organizations such as the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) and the British Rabbit Council (BRC) have standards for the desired qualities of their respective recognized breeds. Each rabbit breed is considered to benefit when a reputable breeder strives to emulate the perfect example for the breed, defined by the individual breed standard by which it may be judged. The global diversity of breeds reflects the breadth of the rabbit&#x27;s unique qualities. Listed below are 191 of the world&#x27;s modern-day rabbit breeds.

== Modern-day rabbit breeds ==

* indicates &quot;Rabbits in COUNTRY or TERRITORY&quot; links.

== Scope ==
The table of modern-day rabbit breeds includes those that are:

* recognized as a distinct breed by ARBA, the BRC, or another country&#x27;s established organization for the national promotion of rabbit breeds,
* recognized as &quot;in development&quot; for potential formal recognition (as judged by multiple authoritative sources), or
* recognized as a distinct breed that resulted from natural selection (as judged by pertinent authoritative sources).

==Terminology==

Confusion sometimes arises regarding the name of a rabbit breed versus the name of a rabbit&#x27;s color/pattern (or fur type). For example, &quot;Harlequin&quot; is the name of a breed whose color/pattern is known as &quot;harlequin.&quot; (This arose from the traditional Harlequin character, who, like this rabbit, always wears a motley-colored check-patterned coat and is also native to France.) The harlequin color/pattern is found now in a different breed of rabbit: the Tri-Colour Dutch, also known as the &quot;Harlequin Dutch&quot;. Such evolutions in terminology pertain also to some fur types, where (for example) the &quot;Rex&quot; breed has &quot;rex&quot; fur. There are now other rabbit breeds that also have rex fur. For example, the unusually &quot;rexed&quot; Astrex rabbit breed.

It is sometimes difficult to ascertain which came first, the breed name or the color/pattern name (or fur-type name). What is certain is that, in such situations, the two at some point were synonymous but subsequent developments in other breeds (likely hinging on similar genetic changes) have caused the terms to diverge.

The definition of a distinct breed relies on clusters of complex individual gene-sets—clusters that may include the gene-set for a body type, the gene-set for an ear type, the gene-set for a color/pattern, and/or the gene-set for a fur type. The determination of when a group of rabbits is considered to have become a new breed (as a result of overarching genetic distinction) is left, in the following table, to the authority of ARBA, the BRC, or other reputable source.

== Extinct rabbit breeds ==
Many rabbit breeds that are now extinct contributed to the development of a modern-day breed or breeds. An example of this was the Blue Imperial which contributed to the American and Lilac. Many rabbit breeds went extinct following the collapse of the American fur industry, though some breeds mainly raised for fur were preserved. In some cases, little is known of these nearly forgotten breeds. For some, the only records are descriptions in old breed books. At least sixty rabbit breeds have gone extinct.

<text>Bob Cobbing (30 July 1920 – 29 September 2002) was a British sound, visual, concrete and performance poet who was a central figure in the British Poetry Revival.

==Early life==
Cobbing was born in Enfield. He attended Enfield Grammar School and then trained as an accountant. He later went to Bognor Training College to become a teacher. During the Second World War, he was a conscientious objector.

==Early involvement with poetry and performance==
His involvement with performance began with the Hendon Experimental Art Club and the Hendon-based magazine &quot;And&quot; in 1951. This led to his setting up Writers Forum, which began publishing in 1963. In 1964 he published &quot;ABC in Sound&quot;, a book that combined his interest in sound and concrete poetry in an exploration of the visual and auditory possibilities of the English alphabet.

==Better Books==
He left teaching around this time and managed Better Books on Charing Cross Road, London. Better Books was more than a mere bookshop. Once described as a ‘mini Arts Lab’ it served as stage, cinema and gallery. Its cross-disciplinary approach welcomed new art forms like assemblage, performance art, and radical poetry. Together with other alternative galleries such as 26 Kingly Street and Indica Bookshop, Better Books was one of the hot spots of the London underground scene.

This shop was the venue for a number of events and happenings associated with what Cobbing&#x27;s friend Jeff Nuttall termed the &quot;Bomb Culture&quot;, the British version of the 1960s counterculture. As an evolution of the earlier Hendon Film Society he began avant-garde film screenings under the title Cinema 65 which led to the formation of the London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op

==1970s==
During the first half of the 1970s, Cobbing was able to use the facilities of the Poetry Society to produce Writers Forum books. In all, the press published over 1,000 titles between 1963 and 2002. As well as fostering the younger poets of the British Poetry Revival, Writers Forum also published works by John Cage, Allen Ginsberg and Ian Hamilton Finlay. Writers Forum also ran a regular Saturday afternoon writers&#x27; workshop at which poets read and discussed each other&#x27;s work.

In the early 1970s the Poetry Society did not have any printing facilities. Cobbing had his own equipment elsewhere throughout the 40 years of his (largely solo) operation of Writers Forum. In the mid-1970s, against tremendous opposition of the rump of the old guard on the Poetry Society General Council, Cobbing and others opened a public print shop on the society&#x27;s premises. Cobbing brought in his own equipment and allowed it to be used by anyone wishing to print their own book of poetry. Later the society provided a desktop litho, plate-maker and golfball typewriter with a diversion of the funds allocated to Poetry Review which was henceforth, for some years, printed in house.

Cobbing also explored his interest in performance works for multiple voices and musical instruments in groups like abAna (a trio with Paul Burwell and David Toop, and sextet with the addition of Lyn Conetta, Herman Hauge and Christopher Small), Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle, which included poets Paula Claire and Bill Griffiths and musician Michael Chant. He was also co-founder of the Association of Little Presses, an organisation that promoted the work of small publishers in Britain and Ireland.

==Later life and work==
In 1980 he appeared as a duo with Henri Chopin on the album &#x27;Miniatures - a sequence of fifty-one tiny masterpieces&#x27; (51 one-minute tracks by contemporary artists and musicians) produced by Morgan Fisher.
Cobbing was a prolific writer and performer and continued to work right up to his death. In 2000, he performed with Lawrence Upton and Derek Shiel at The Klinker, Islington, London.

He also used his teacher training to work on performances with schoolchildren. Much of his later work consists of visual texts, artist&#x27;s books and markings that were used as notations or, more strictly speaking, jumping off points for performance. He also worked on more directly collaborative works with other poets, such as the &quot;Domestic Ambient Noise&quot; project, a series of 300 booklets created with his friend and fellow Writers Forum editor Lawrence Upton. Since Cobbing&#x27;s death, Upton has carried on the work of running Writers Forum.

Cobbing created seventeen pamphlets/sheets entitled &quot;Processual&quot; from 1982 to 1985, deploying his photocopier as a poetic tool; he also composed the &quot;Third ABC in Sound&quot; in 2000, aged 80.

== Legacy ==
In 2005, the British Library acquired The Papers of Bob Cobbing consisting of personal material, correspondence, his works, and papers relating to Writers Forum, to the Association of Little Presses (ALP), and to the New River Project.

==Publication==
&quot;Boooook: The Life and Work of Bob Cobbing&quot; (published by Occasional Papers, 2015) is the first comprehensive overview of the life and work of Cobbing. It addresses all aspects of Cobbing&#x27;s rich career, with new essays detailing his key roles in London Film-makers’ Co-op, Better Books, abAna, as well as his involvement in the Destruction in Art Symposium, Fylkingen, and his publishing imprint Writers Forum.

<doc id="431767" wikidata="Q7721490" url="?curid=431767" title="The Case for Israel">
<text>The Case for Israel is a 2003 book by Alan Dershowitz, a law professor at Harvard University. The work is a response to common criticisms of Israel. &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. It also led to the public controversy known as the Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair.
==Summary==
The book is divided into several chapters, each of which addresses what Dershowitz identifies as being particularly strong accusations and myths about Israel, such as &quot;Israel is the &#x27;prime&#x27; human rights violator in the world&quot; and &quot;Israel is the cause of the Arab–Israeli conflict.&quot; Each chapter is divided into several sections. &quot;The Accusation&quot; states a common criticism of Israel, &quot;The Accusers&quot; lists several quotations from critics supporting the accusation, &quot;The Reality&quot; contains a short statement contradicting the accusation, and &quot;The Proof&quot; contains Dershowitz&#x27;s explanation of his viewpoint. Edward Said and Noam Chomsky are among the critics that he quotes the most heavily. The research assistants mentioned in the book&#x27;s acknowledgements include Natalie Hershlag, the birthname of Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman.

Dershowitz has released a sequel in 2005 championing the two-state solution. The book, &quot;The Case for Peace&quot;, explains what he believes is needed to be done in order to achieve peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Critical Reception==
In a New York Times review, Ethan Bronner called the book a polemic that argues &quot;vehemently––and fairly convincingly––that contemporary European and Arab discourse on the Middle East is indefensibly unbalanced against Israel&quot; without dismissing the scholarship of the New Historians. He notes that &quot;Dershowitz is especially effective at pointing to the hypocrisy of many of Israel&#x27;s critics.&quot; 

The political scientist Norman Finkelstein claimed the book was a &quot;hoax&quot; and that some of its citations are plagiarized from &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot;, a 1984 book by Joan Peters. After a heated exchange between the two on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, in which Finkelstein repeatedly accused Dershowitz of plagiarism and questioned his credentials to teach at Harvard University, Finkelstein released a book, &quot;Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History&quot;, whose second part is about &quot;The Case for Israel&quot;. The book lists many examples of text that Finkelstein claims Dershowitz to have lifted from Peters. A Harvard Law School investigation led by former Harvard president Derek Bok found the plagiarism charges to be without merit. Finkelstein later agreed to delete all references to &quot;plagiarism&quot; from his book, instead writing that Dershowitz &quot;lifted&quot; or &quot;appropriated&quot; text from Peters, but said he only did it to avoid a lawsuit.

<doc id="431769" wikidata="Q2084035" url="?curid=431769" title="Nail disease">
<text>A nail disease or onychosis is a disease or deformity of the nail. Although the nail is a structure produced by the skin and is a skin appendage, nail diseases have a distinct classification as they have their own signs and symptoms which may relate to other medical conditions. Some nail conditions that show signs of infection or inflammation may require medical assistance.

==Diseases==
*&quot;Onychia&quot; is an inflammation of the nail folds (surrounding tissue of the nail plate) of the nail with formation of pus and shedding of the nail. Onychia results from the introduction of microscopic pathogens through small wounds.
*&quot;Onychocryptosis&quot;, commonly known as &quot;ingrown nails&quot; (&quot;unguis incarnatus&quot;), can affect either the fingers or the toes. In this condition, the nail cuts into one or both sides of the nail bed, resulting in inflammation and possibly infection. The relative rarity of this condition in the fingers suggests that pressure from the ground or shoe against the toe is a prime factor. The movements involved in walking or other physical disturbances can contribute to the problem. Mild onychocryptosis, particularly in the absence of infection, can be treated by trimming and rounding the nail. More advanced cases, which usually include infection, are treated by surgically excising the ingrowing portion of the nail down to its bony origin and thermally or chemically cauterizing the matrix, or &#x27;root&#x27;, to prevent recurrence. This surgery is called matrixectomy. The best results are achieved by cauterizing the matrix with phenol. The Vandenbos Procedure is a highly effective method that focuses on excision of excessive nail fold tissue without affecting the healthy nail and nail matrix. The Vandenbos Procedure is showing high success rates in eliminating onychocryptosis without altering the normal nail. Another, much less effective, treatment is excision of the matrix, sometimes called a &#x27;cold steel procedure&#x27;.

*&quot;Onychodystrophy&quot; is a deformation of the nails that can result from cancer chemotherapy which includes bleomycin, hydroxyurea, or 5-fluorouracil. It can include discoloration of the nail, or dyschromia.
*&quot;Onychogryposis&quot;, also called &quot;ram&#x27;s-horn nail&quot;, is a thickening and increase in curvature of the nail. It is usually the result of injury to the matrix. It may be partially hereditary and can also occur as a result of long-term neglect. It is most commonly seen in the great toe but may be seen in other toes as well as the fingernails. An affected nail has many grooves and ridges, is brownish in color, and grows more quickly on one side than on the other. The thick curved nail is difficult to cut, and often remains untrimmed, exacerbating the problem.
*&quot;Onycholysis&quot; is a loosening of the exposed portion of the nail from the nail bed, usually beginning at the free edge and continuing to the lunula. It is frequently associated with an internal disorder, trauma, infection, nail fungi, allergy to nail enhancement products, or side effects of drugs.
*&quot;Onychomadesis&quot; is the separation and falling off of a nail from the nail bed. Common causes include localized infection, minor injury to the matrix bed, or severe systemic illness. It is sometimes a side effect of chemotherapy or x-ray treatments for cancer. A new nail plate will form once the cause of the disease is removed.
*&quot;Onychomycosis&quot;, also known as &quot;tinea unguium&quot;, is a contagious infection of the nail caused by the same fungal organisms which cause ringworm of the skin (&quot;Trichophyton rubrum&quot; or &quot;T. mentagrophytes&quot;, rarely other trichophyton species or &quot;Epidermophyton floccosum&quot; ). It can result in discoloration, thickening, chalkiness, or crumbling of the nails and is often treated by powerful oral medications which, rarely, can cause severe side effects including liver failure. Mild onychomycosis sometimes responds to a combination of topical antifungal medication, sometimes applied as special medicinal nail lacquer, and periodic filing of the nail surface. For advanced onychomycosis, especially if more than one nail is infected, systemic medication (pills) is preferred. Home remedies are often used, although their effectiveness is disputed.

*&quot;Onychophosis&quot; is a growth of horny epithelium in the nail.
*&quot;Onychoptosis&quot; is the periodic shedding of one or more nails, in whole or part. This condition may follow certain diseases such as syphilis, or can result from fever, trauma, systemic upsets or adverse reaction to drugs.
*&quot;Onychorrhexis&quot; also known as brittle nails, is brittleness with breakage of fingernails or toenails.
*&quot;Paronychia&quot; is a bacterial or fungal infection where the nail and skin meet.
*&quot;Koilonychia&quot; is when the nail curves upwards (becomes spoon-shaped) due to an iron deficiency. The normal process of change is: brittle nails, straight nails, spoon-shaped nails.
*&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot; occurs when trauma to the nail results in a collection of blood, or hematoma, under the nail. It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor trauma such as running in undersized shoes. Acute subungual hematomas are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the blood by creating a small hole in the nail. Drilling and thermal cautery are common methods for creating the hole. Thermal cautery is not used on acrylic nails because they are flammable.
*&quot;Onychomatricoma&quot;, a tumor of the nail matrix.
*&quot;Nail pemphigus&quot;, an auto-immune disease.
*&quot;Erythronychia&quot;, red bands in the nail from some inflammatory conditions.
*&quot;Melanonychia&quot;, a black, brown or grey discoloration of the nail, with numerous causes.

==Nail changes and conditions associated with them==
Nail inspection can give hints to the internal condition of the body as well. 
Nail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine. A nail technician may be the first to note a subtle change in nail health.

===Pliability===
*Brittleness is associated with iron deficiency, thyroid problems, and impaired kidney function.
*Splitting and fraying are associated with psoriasis and deficiencies of folic acid, protein, and Vitamin C.
*Unusual thickness is associated with circulation problems.

===Shape and texture===
*Nail clubbing - nails that curve down around the fingertips with nailbeds that bulge is associated with oxygen deprivation and lung, heart, or liver disease.
*Koilonychia - spooning, or nails that grow upwards. Associated with iron-deficiency anaemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.
*Pitting of the nails is associated with psoriasis.
*Beau&#x27;s lines are horizontal ridges in the nail.
*Habit-tic deformity is a condition similar to Beau&#x27;s Lines caused by long-term skin picking.

===Discoloration of entire nail bed===
*Yellowing of the nail bed is associated with chronic bronchitis, lymphatic problems, diabetes, and liver disorders.
*Brown or copper nail beds are associated with arsenic or copper poisoning, and local fungal infection.
*Redness is associated with heart conditions.

===Other color changes and markings===
*Melanonychia (longitudinal streaking that darkens or does not grow out), especially on the thumb or big toe, may indicate subungual melanoma.
*White lines across the nail (leukonychia striata, or transverse leukonychia) may be Mees&#x27; lines or Muehrcke&#x27;s lines.
*Small white patches are known as leukonychia punctata.
*Dark nails are associated with B12 deficiency.
*Stains of the nail plate (not the nail bed) are associated with smoking and henna use.
*Splinter hemorrhages (or haemorrhages) are tiny blood clots that tend to run vertically under the nails.
*Drug-induced nail changes are caused by drug usage which may result in various abnormalities.

==Treatment==
In approximately half of suspected nail fungus cases there is actually no fungal infection, but only some nail dystrophy. Before beginning oral antifungal therapy the health care provider should confirm a fungal infection. Administration of treatment to persons without an infection is unnecessary health care and causes needless exposure to side effects.
