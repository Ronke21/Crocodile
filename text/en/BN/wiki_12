<text>Floyd Bostwick Odlum (March 30, 1892 – June 17, 1976) was an American lawyer and industrialist. He has been described as &quot;possibly the only man in the United States who made a great fortune out of the Depression&quot;.

==Life and career==
After struggling as a corporate attorney in Salt Lake City, Odlum received an offer of a job at a New York firm, and in 1921 became vice-president of his primary client, Electric Bond and Share Company. In 1923, Odlum, a friend, and their wives pooled a total of $39,600 and formed the United States Company to speculate in purchases of utilities and general securities. Within two years, the company&#x27;s net assets had increased 17 fold to nearly $700,000. In 1928, Odlum incorporated Atlas Utilities Company to take over the common stock of his other company.

During the summer of 1929, Odlum was one of the few industrial moguls to believe that the boom on Wall Street could not continue much longer, and he sold one half of Atlas&#x27;s holdings, as well as $9 million in new securities to investors. He had $14 million in cash and short term notes when the stock market crashed. During the next few years, Atlas Utilities bought up stock in less fortunate investment companies at Depression-reduced prices. After Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated President of the United States, Odlum shifted gears, selling off utilities before stronger regulation set in, and switching to large-scale financing. By 1933, Odlum was one of the 10 wealthiest men in the United States. Besides Atlas Corporation, he had a major stake in RKO Studios, Convair, Northeast Airlines, and Bonwit Teller, among other businesses, and was associated in the aviation business with financier George Newell Armsby. Odlum&#x27;s association with Armsby provided a link to Armsby and John Cheever Cowdin&#x27;s enterprise Transcontinental Air Transport, Inc.

In 1948, Odlum sold RKO to Howard Hughes. Odlum was an investor in the 1954 production of the Broadway show &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;—during which actress Shirley MacLaine was discovered by Paramount Pictures producer Hal Wallis—and convinced Goldman Sachs&#x27;s head Sidney Weinberg to invest as well.

Odlum was first married, in 1915, to Hortense McQuarrie, first female department store head (at Bonwit Teller); they were divorced in 1935. His second wife, whom he married in 1936, was aviator Jackie Cochran. Odlum and Cochran were close friends of Amelia Earhart and her husband George P. Putnam, and the Odlums were financial backers of Earhart&#x27;s flying activities. They developed the Cochran-Odlum (C-O) Ranch in Indio, California where they lived after the 1950s.

Odlum along with business associate L. Boyd Hatch also purchased and developed Hatch&#x27;s Camp, also known as St. Ann&#x27;s Retreat, or Pine Glenn Cove, a mountainous retreat in Logan Canyon, Utah. In 2006, Pine Glenn Cove was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1964, Odlum received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was presented alongside his wife, fellow honoree Jackie Cochran.

Odlum died in 1976 at the age of 84. His wife Jackie Cochran died four years later on August 9, 1980.

<text>The edge of chaos is a transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.

Even though the idea of the edge of chaos is an abstract one, it has many applications in such fields as ecology, business management, psychology, political science, and other domains of the social sciences. Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback. 

== History ==
The phrase &quot;edge of chaos&quot; was coined in the late 1980s by chaos theory physicist Norman Packard. In the next decade, Packard and mathematician Doyne Farmer co-authored many papers on understanding how self-organization and order emerges at the edge of chaos. One of the original catalysts that led to the idea of the edge of chaos were the experiments with cellular automata done by computer scientist Christopher Langton where a transition phenomenon was discovered. The phrase refers to an area in the range of a variable, λ (lambda), which was varied while examining the behaviour of a cellular automaton (CA). As λ varied, the behaviour of the CA went through a phase transition of behaviours. Langton found a small area conducive to produce CAs capable of universal computation. At around the same time physicist James P. Crutchfield and others used the phrase &quot;onset of chaos&quot; to describe more or less the same concept.

In the sciences in general, the phrase has come to refer to a metaphor that some physical, biological, economic and social systems operate in a region between order and either complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal. 
The generality and significance of the idea, however, has since been called into question by Melanie Mitchell and others. The phrase has also been borrowed by the business community and is sometimes used inappropriately and in contexts that are far from the original scope of the meaning of the term. 

Stuart Kauffman has studied mathematical models of evolving systems in which the rate of evolution is maximized near the edge of chaos.

==Adaptation==
Adaptation plays a vital role for all living organisms and systems. All of them are constantly changing their inner properties to better fit in the current environment. The most important instruments for the adaptation are the self-adjusting parameters inherent for many natural systems. The prominent feature of systems with self-adjusting parameters is an ability to avoid chaos. The name for this phenomenon is &quot;Adaptation to the edge of chaos&quot;.

Adaptation to the edge of chaos refers to the idea that many complex adaptive systems (CASs) seem to intuitively evolve toward a regime near the boundary between chaos and order. Physics has shown that edge of chaos is the optimal settings for control of a system. It is also an optional setting that can influence the ability of a physical system to perform primitive functions for computation. In CAS, coevolution generally occurs near the edge of chaos, and a balance should be maintained between flexibility and stability to avoid structural failure. As a response to coping with turbulent environments, CAS bring out flexibility, creativity, agility, anti-fragility, and innovation near the edge of chaos, provided these systems are sufficiently decentralized and non-hierarchical.

Because of the importance of adaptation in many natural systems, adaptation to the edge of the chaos takes a prominent position in many scientific researches. Physicists demonstrated that adaptation to state at the boundary of chaos and order occurs in population of cellular automata rules which optimize the performance evolving with a genetic algorithm. Another example of this phenomenon is the self-organized criticality in avalanche and earthquake models.

The simplest model for chaotic dynamics is the logistic map. Self-adjusting logistic map dynamics exhibit adaptation to the edge of chaos. Theoretical analysis allowed prediction of the location of the narrow parameter regime near the boundary to which the system evolves.

<text>The University of New England (UNE) is a private research university in Portland and Biddeford, Maine, United States. It traces it historical origins to 1831 when Westbrook Seminary opened on what is now the UNE Portland Campus.

UNE is the largest private university in the state of Maine and the largest educator of healthcare professionals for Maine. It is organized into five colleges that combine to offer more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, online, and professional degrees. The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot;

== History ==
In 1939, a boys-only high school and junior college called the College Séraphique was founded in Biddeford by Father Decary and the Franciscan friar of St. Andre&#x27;s parish.

In 1952, the school changed its name to St. Francis College and began granting bachelor&#x27;s degrees with state approval in 1953. The high school program was phased out by 1961, and the college was first accredited in 1966.

The school became co-educational for the first time in 1967, and the Franciscans withdrew from the administration of the college in 1974.

To survive dropping enrollment, St. Francis College entered into an agreement with the New England Foundation for Osteopathic Medicine in 1978 to establish the New England College of Osteopathic Medicine on the same campus, and in 1979 the two together became the University of New England (the merger would not be fully complete until a 1987 vote by the College of Osteopathic Medicine corporation).

In 1996, Westbrook College merged with the University of New England. The merger took place under the terms of the original 1831 Westbrook charter, and the combined institutions became Westbrook College before changing the name back to the University of New England. 

In October 2020, the University of New England received a gift of $30 million from the Harold Alfond Foundation as part of a major investment in eight Maine institutions for the purpose of growing the state’s workforce and economy and supporting quality health care. The grant will support the construction of a new facility for the relocation of the University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine from the Biddeford Campus to the Portland Campus, the establishment of a new Institute for Interprofessional Education and Practice, and the acceleration of high-growth undergraduate and graduate programs on the Biddeford Campus to meet student demand and workforce needs, such as aquaculture, entrepreneurship, criminal justice, sports media communication, and others.

James D. Herbert serves as UNE&#x27;s sixth president. His tenure began on July 1, 2017, immediately following the 11-year tenure of Danielle N. Ripich.

== Campuses ==
UNE offers three campuses that provide students with a range of learning environments. The university&#x27;s two campuses in coastal Maine, USA, house undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, while its Tangier Campus provides a semester-abroad opportunity in Morocco.

===Biddeford Campus===
The Biddeford Campus covers , with of ocean frontage where the Saco River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The 26 buildings on the campus include the Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences, the Pickus Center for Biomedical Research, and the Marine Science Center.

The Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences houses Maine&#x27;s only medical school: The University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine.

UNE&#x27;s Biddeford Campus is also home to the George and Barbara Bush Center, which houses material chronicling the Bush legacy in Maine, including memorabilia on loan from the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A &amp; M University. The Center includes a replica of the Oval Office during Bush&#x27;s term in the White House and a statue of the former president. Each year, UNE hosts an annual lecture at its Biddeford Campus that is often attended by the former president and his family. In September 2017, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell visited UNE&#x27;s Biddeford Campus to deliver the Bush Lecture.

The UNE Biddeford Campus also includes the Harold Alfond Forum, which offers 105,000 square-feet (9,800 m2) of athletic and learning space, including: an NHL-size ice hockey rink with 900 seats, a basketball court with 1,200 seats, classrooms, a fitness center, and multi-purpose indoor practice courts that are also used for performances and lectures. A $10 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation facilitated the building&#x27;s construction and the development of associated programming.

UNE also owns Ram Island, off the coast of the Biddeford Campus, which serves as a field station for student and faculty researchers.

===Portland Campus===

The UNE Portland Campus, located on Stevens Avenue, houses the university&#x27;s Westbrook College of Health Professions and the College of Dental Medicine. The College of Dental Medicine, which is housed in the $14.5 million Oral Health Center, graduated its first class in 2017. It is Maine&#x27;s only dental college.

Other features of the UNE Portland Campus include the Art Gallery, the Maine Women Writers Collection, Alumni Hall, and the Center for Global Humanities. Alumni Hall is the oldest building on campus, dating to an original opening in 1834; its most recent renovation was completed in 2016. The Center for Global Humanities hosts scholars from around the globe for public lectures. Past lectures have featured Noam Chomsky, Sherwin Nuland, and Bill McKibben as speakers.

===Tangier Campus===
In January 2014, UNE opened a campus in Tangier, Morocco, within the campus of the American School of Tangier. The UNE campus consists of two buildings—one for academic programming and the other for student and staff housing. It also includes an outdoor court colored UNE blue. 
While studying in Morocco, UNE students take excursions to Casablanca, Fez, Marrakesh, and a UNE satellite program in Seville, Spain.

The UNE Tangier Campus also hosts the Tangier Global Forum, a public lecture series designed to facilitate discussion of issues facing the global community. On May 12, 2017, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell visited the UNE Tangier Campus to present a lecture titled &quot;Is Peace Possible in the Middle East?&quot;

==Academics==
UNE offers more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs. The university also has Maine&#x27;s only medical school and Maine&#x27;s only dental school.

===Westbrook College of Health Professions===
The UNE Westbrook College of Health Professions prepares students for careers in the healthcare fields. Students participate in clinical simulations, inter-professional learning experiences, service learning, and other experiences that enable them to transition smoothly into the workforce upon graduation. Programs included are Pharmacy, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapy, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, and Nurse Anesthesia. The Westbrook College of Health Professions confers undergraduate degrees including a B.S. in Applied Exercise Science, B.S. in Dental Hygiene, and B.S. in Nursing; as well as graduate and doctorate degrees such as Master of Science in Athletic Training (M.S.A.T.), Master of Science in Occupational Therapy (M.S.O.T.), Master of Science in Physician Assistant (M.S.P.A.), Master of Science in Social Work (M.S.W.), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), and Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.).

===College of Osteopathic Medicine===
The University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine is the only medical school in the state of Maine. Its graduates constitute 25 percent of primary care physicians practicing in rural parts of Maine, and 10 percent of practicing physicians in the state. Founded in 1978, it is accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) and the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

===College of Dental Medicine===
The UNE College of Dental Medicine is the only dental school in northern New England.

===College of Graduate and Professional Studies: Online Learning===
The UNE College of Graduate and Professional Studies is 100% online, offering graduate degrees and certificate programs. In 2015, the college enrolled students from all 50 U.S. states and 27 countries.

<text>Earl of Huntingdon is a title which has been created several times in the Peerage of England. The medieval title (1065 creation) was associated with the ruling house of Scotland (David of Scotland).

The seventh and most recent creation dates to 1529. In this lineage, the current holder of the title is William Hastings-Bass, 17th Earl of Huntingdon (b. 1948).

In English folklore, the title has been associated with Robin Hood, whose true name is often given as &quot;Robert of Huntingdon&quot;, though alternatively Robin is said to be from Locksley or Loxley.

==Early history==

Huntingdonshire was part of the Kingdom of East Anglia, inhabited by a group known as the Gyrwas from about the 6th century. It fell to the Danes in the 9th century, but was re-conquered under Edward the Elder in 915. An earldom of Huntingdon was established shortly after, and it was one of the seven earldoms of Saxon England during the reign of king Edward the Confessor.

It was created for Beorn Estrithson, cousin to Harold Godwinson (later King Harold).
The earldom at that time carried extensive powers and covered a wide area of the East Midlands, covering the counties of Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire as well as Huntingdonshire.

==First creation (1065)==
In 1065 the earldom passed to Waltheof, son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Waltheof kept his title following the Conquest in 1066, and even after his rebellion in 1067, and married Judith, King William&#x27;s niece. However, after the second rebellion in 1076, he was executed and the earldom was reduced in size and power.

The earldom was inherited by Waltheof&#x27;s daughter Maud, countess of Huntingdon, and passed to her husbands in turn, first Simon de Senlis and then David King of Scotland.

Following her death, and during the reigns of Matilda and Stephen and the anarchy that ensued, the earldom was the subject of dispute between Maud&#x27;s sons Simon II and Henry the prince, and was held by both at various times. In the reign of Henry II, following the death of Simon II, it was settled on the Scottish house, and the sons of Prince Henry: first Malcolm, then William, then David. With the death of David&#x27;s childless son John in 1237, the title was not passed on and became extinct.

==Sixth creation (1479)==

==Seventh creation (1529)==
The title was re-created for George Hastings, 3rd Baron Hastings, 5th Baron Hungerford, 6th Baron Botreaux and 3rd Baron de Moleyns. He fought in the French Wars of Henry VIII, and was part of the royalist suppression of the rebellion known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. In 1529 the King created him Earl of Huntingdon in the Peerage of England. His eldest son, the second Earl, was a lieutenant-general and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Lord Huntingdon married Catherine, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, son of Sir Richard Pole and Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, daughter and sole heiress of George, Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He was a possible heir presumptive to the crown through his mother, though Elizabeth I never acknowledged his claim officially. Lord Huntingdon was one of the custodians of Mary, Queen of Scots, and also served as President of the Council of the North. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He represented Derbyshire and Leicestershire in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland and Leicestershire.

When he died the titles passed to his grandson, the fifth Earl. He was the son of Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings (d. 1595). Lord Huntingdon was also Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire and Rutland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire. His son, the seventh Earl, and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire and Derbyshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He carried the Sceptre at the Coronation of Queen Anne but died at an early age. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the ninth Earl. He carried the Sword of State at the Coronation of King George II. His son, the tenth Earl, was a courtier and notably served as Master of the Horse. He had no legitimate male issue and on his death in 1789 the earldom became dormant. He was succeeded in the baronies of Hastings, Hungerford, de Moleyns and Botreaux by his sister Lady Elizabeth, wife of The 1st Earl of Moira.

The earldom was assumed by the tenth Earl&#x27;s distant relative (his fifth cousin once removed) Reverend Theophilus Henry Hastings. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Sir Edward Hastings (d. 1603), younger son of the second Earl. He is by some sources considered as the &quot;de jure&quot; eleventh Earl while some sources do not include him in the numbering of the Earls. On his death, the claim passed to his nephew Hans Francis Hastings, son of George Hastings. He was allowed to take his seat in the House of Lords as the Earl of Huntingdon in 1819. Depending on the sources he is numbered as the eleventh or twelfth Earl. Lord Huntingdon served as Governor of Jamaica from 1822 to 1824.

Hans&#x27; great-great-grandson, the sixteenth (or fifteenth Earl), was an artist, academic and Labour politician. He died without male issue in 1990 and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the seventeenth (or sixteenth) and () present holder of the title. He is the uncle of television presenter Clare Balding and eldest son of Captain Peter Robin Hood Hastings Bass (1920–1964) (who assumed the additional surname of Bass, which was that of his uncle by marriage, Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet, by deed poll in 1954), son of Aubrey Craven Theophilus Robin Hood Hastings (1878–1929), younger son of the fourteenth Earl.

Several other members of the Hastings family may be mentioned. The Hon. Edward Hastings, third son of the first Earl, was created Baron Hastings of Loughborough in 1558. Richard Hastings, a grandson of Sir Edward Hastings, younger son of the second Earl, was created a baronet in 1667 (see Hastings baronets). The Hon. Henry Hastings, second son of the fifth Earl, was created Baron Loughborough in 1643. Lucy Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, wife of the sixth Earl, was a poet. Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, wife of the ninth Earl, was a Methodist leader and the founder of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion. Charles Hastings, illegitimate son of the tenth Earl, was a distinguished soldier and was created a baronet in 1806 (see Abney-Hastings baronets). The Hon. George Fowler Hastings, second son of the twelfth (or eleventh) Earl, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. Alexander Plantagenet Hastings (1843–1928), son of Captain the Hon. Edward Plantagenet Robin Hood Hastings (1818–1857), third son of the twelfth (or eleventh) Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. His son Edward George Godolphin Hastings (1887–1973) was a captain in the Royal Navy.

The Earl possesses no subsidiary titles, but his eldest son uses the invented courtesy title of &quot;Viscount Hastings&quot; to avoid confusion, there already being a Baron Hastings.

The family seat of the present line is at Hodcott House, near West Ilsley, in Berkshire.

<text>&quot;&quot; () was written as the national anthem of Syria, with lyrics written by Khalil Mardam Bey and the music by Mohammed Flayfel, who also composed the national anthem of Iraq as well as many other Arab folk songs.

==History==
It was adopted in 1938 after a national competition was held by Hashim al-Atassi&#x27;s nationalist Syrian government to choose a state anthem for the new republic two years after the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence was signed which gave Syria limited autonomy and future independence. The anthem was initially set to lose the competition, but it later won the competition after it gained rapid popularity amongst the Syrian population which put pressure on the competition&#x27;s committee to reconsider its decisions, and eventually the anthem won and was adopted by the government as Syria&#x27;s national anthem.

===Post-Assad regime===

On 18 January 2025, the Syrian Football Association announced to FIFA that it would make a series of changes when appearing in football matches. Among these changes, this included a new anthem, &quot;Fī Sabīli al-Majd&quot; (&#x27;In Pursuit of Glory&#x27;) by the poet Omar Abu Risha, serving as a temporary national anthem of the side until a solution for the previous anthem be solved.

<doc id="428937" wikidata="Q677371" url="?curid=428937" title="Geode">
<text>A geode (; ) is a geological secondary formation within sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Geodes are hollow, vaguely spherical rocks, in which masses of mineral matter (which may include crystals) are secluded. The crystals are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and subvolcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids; or by the dissolution of syn-genetic concretions and partial filling by the same or other minerals precipitated from water, groundwater, or hydrothermal fluids.

== Formation ==
Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks. They can form in gas bubbles in igneous rocks, such as vesicles in basaltic lava; or, as in the American Midwest, in rounded cavities in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolved silicates and/or carbonates are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow feed of mineral constituents from groundwater or hydrothermal solutions allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing geodes eventually weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of resistant material such as quartz.

== Coloration ==

Geodes and geode slices are sometimes dyed with artificial colors.

== Occurrence ==
Geodes are found where the geology is suitable with many of the commercially available ones coming from Brazil, Uruguay, Namibia, and Mexico. Large, amethyst-lined geodes are a feature of the basalts of the Paraná and Etendeka traps found in Brazil and Uruguay. Geodes are common in some formations in the United States (mainly in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, western Illinois, Kentucky, and Utah). Geodes are also abundant in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, England, where they are known locally as &quot;potato stones&quot;. The term geode generally describes hollow formations. If the rock is completely solid inside, this would be classified as a nodule or thunderegg.

== Crystal caves==

&#x27;Crystal cave&#x27; is both an informal term for any large crystal-lined geode and also used for specific geoheritage locations such as the Crystal Cave (Ohio), discovered in 1887 at the Heineman Winery on Put-In-Bay, Ohio, the Cave of the Crystals (Mexico), and the Pulpi Geode, discovered in 1999 in Spain. In 1999, a mineralogist group discovered a cave filled with giant selenite (gypsum) crystals in an abandoned silver mine, Mina Rica, near Pulpi, Province of Almeria, Spain. The cavity, which measured , was, at the time, the largest crystal cave ever found. Following its discovery, the entrance to the cave was blocked by five tons of rock, with an additional police presence to prevent looters. In the summer of 2019 the cave, a significant geotourism resource and now named the &#x27;Geoda de Pulpi&#x27;, Pulpi Geode, was opened as a tourist attraction, allowing small groups (max. 12 people) to visit the caves with a tour guide.

<doc id="428942" wikidata="Q832991" url="?curid=428942" title="Sóller">
<text>Sóller () is a town and municipality near the north west coast of the Balearic Island of Mallorca, Spain, 3 km inland from Port de Sóller, in a large, bowl-shaped valley that also includes the village of Fornalutx and the hamlets of Biniaraix and Binibassi. The population is around 14,000. The &quot;Tranvía de Sóller&quot; tram links Sóller to Port de Sóller.

==Overview==
Sóller is linked by the historic railway, the Ferrocarril de Sóller, and by a highway with a tunnel, to the Majorcan capital of Palma. The Ferrocaril was built on the profits from the orange and lemon trade and completed in 1911. The Andratx-Pollença highway also runs through the valley. The present-day economy is based mainly on tourism and the expenditure of foreign residents, complementary to the agricultural economy based around citrus and olive groves. Soller is unique compared to towns on the rest of the island due to its geographical isolation, being surrounded by the Serra de Tramuntana. This isolation from all other major towns on the island, made it easier to trade with French merchants arriving by sea.

==Main sights==

The focus of the town is the &quot;Plaça Constitució&quot; which is surrounded by cafés and has plane trees and a fountain in its centre. The tram passes through the Plaça on its way to and from the main station which has been restored to incorporate a museum of Picasso and Joan Miró. The church of Sant Bartomeu (Saint Bartholomew) facing the east side of the Plaça is flanked by the &quot;ajuntament&quot; (town hall) and the Banco de Sóller, a remarkable 1912 &quot;Modernista&quot; building with defining ironwork, by the Catalan architect Joan Rubió i Bellver, a follower of Antoni Gaudí. The bank&#x27;s organisation was founded in 1889 with the money of emigrants who returned prosperous to Sóller. On the other hand, the church can clearly be seen standing out from the canopy of the town from other parts of the Vall de Sóller (the surrounding valley). The original building dates from some time before 1236. The current main interior structure is now largely baroque (1688–1733).

The &quot;campanar&quot; (belltower) blends in well with its neo-Gothic design. The remarkable façade is a 1904 construction, also by Joan Rubió. The old street plan is of Islamic origin and lined with historic houses of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The town has a covered market and is bisected by a fast flowing river with a number of bridges. Sóller is also notable for the houses built in the early twentieth century by emigrants who returned wealthy to the town, particularly those on the &quot;Gran Via&quot; which reflect the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; Art Nouveau styles of France.

The renowned &quot;Jardí Botanic&quot; (botanical garden) is on the outskirts of the town and is laid out with the plants of the Balearics and the Mediterranean islands. The Modernista mansion in the garden houses &quot;El Museu Balear de Ciències Naturals&quot; (The Museum of Balearic Natural Sciences).

==Events==
* &quot;Firó&quot; is Sóller&#x27;s most important and well-known festival, commemorating its sacking by Moorish pirates on the 11 May 1561. As part of the festivities, 4 battles are reenacted (2 in the Port, 1 in La Huerta and 1 in the town square). Locals dress up as turbaned pirates or in traditional dress and stage mock battles to repel the invaders with fireworks.
* Since 1980, Sóller has hosted the &quot;Sa Mostra&quot; week-long international folklore festival between May and July. It was started by the traditional dance group &quot;Aires Sollerics&quot;.
* August sees the celebration in honour of the patron saint of Sóller, St. Bartholomew, which features bonfires and devilish masquerades in a spectacle called the &quot;correfoc&quot; (&quot;fire-run&quot;). Local groups such as the &quot;Escladabutzes&quot; invade the town square in an allegory of hellfire, before being driven back by the &quot;correaigua&quot; (&quot;water-run&quot;), where the local fire department refreshes the crowds.
* Each January, Epiphany is celebrated as the Day of the Three Wise Kings, and processions of the Magi proceed from the Port to the town square, throwing sweets to crowds of eager children. Traditionally, it is more popular than the western Christmas on 25 December.

== Museums ==
* Museo de la Mar, a maritime museum. Located in the Oratorio de Santa Caterina d&#x27;Alexandria (13th century). (Puerto de Sóller)

<doc id="428952" wikidata="Q727068" url="?curid=428952" title="Newport Tower (Rhode Island)">
<text>The Newport Tower, also known as the Old Stone Mill, is a round stone tower located in Touro Park in Newport, Rhode Island, the remains of a windmill built in the mid-17th century. It has received attention due to speculation that it is actually several centuries older and would thus represent evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Carbon dating shows this belief to be incorrect. 

Other names given to the tower include Round Tower, Touro Tower, Viking Tower, and Newport Stone Tower.

== Description ==
The Newport Tower is located in Touro Park at the top of Mill Street, surrounded by a historical residential neighborhood on the hill above the waterfront tourist district. Eighteenth-century paintings show that the hill itself once furnished a view of the harbor and would have been visible to passing mariners in Narragansett Bay, but recent tree growth now obscures the view.

The Newport Tower is not exactly circular. From southeast to northwest, the diameter reportedly measures but, when measured from east to west, the diameter lengthens to . However, the 19th-century measurements of the interior gave an east–west dimension of , which was slightly shorter than the north–south measurement of , suggesting that the discrepancies may be due to the unevenness of the rubble masonry. The tower has a height of and an exterior width of . At one time, the interior of the tower was coated with smooth white plaster, the remnants of which may be seen on the interior faces of several pillars. It is supported by eight cylindrical columns that form stone arches, two of which are slightly broader than the other six. Above the arches and inside the tower is evidence of a floor that once supported an interior chamber. The walls are approximately thick, and the diameter of the inner chamber is approximately . The chamber has four windows on what used to be the main floor, and three very small ones at the upper level. Almost directly opposite the west window is a fireplace backed with grey stone and flanked by nooks.

A representation of the tower is featured prominently on the seal and unit patch of the former US Navy vessel USS &quot;Newport&quot;.
The tower is described in a document of 1741 as &quot;the old stone mill.&quot; It was used as a haymow in 1760, while it was described in 1767 as being used as a powder store &quot;some time past&quot;. De Barres&#x27; plan of Newport published in 1776 marks it as &quot;Stone Wind Mill.&quot; During the American Revolution, the tower was used by the Americans as a lookout and by the British to store munitions. 

== Construction ==
The tower is located at the upper end of the plot behind the now-demolished mansion built by Benedict Arnold, the first colonial governor of Rhode Island, who moved from Pawtuxet to Newport in 1651. In 1677, Arnold mentions &quot;my stone built Wind Mill&quot; in his will; the site for his burying ground is between this mill and his mansion and still exists today. The phrase has therefore generally been accepted as referring to the Newport Tower, and is evidence that the tower was once used as a windmill. Still, others have contested that locals remembered the tower was previously a functioning corn mill, and that since it had a ground-level fireplace, it couldn&#x27;t have been built as a windmill.

An illustration from the British &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; published in 1836 (shown at right) reveals that the tower is of a similar type to Chesterton Windmill, a 17th-century mill near Chesterton, Warwickshire, England. There is a mistaken notion that Arnold was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, only a short distance from Chesterton; the family lived near Limington in Somerset, about away. However, Chesterton windmill stands on a ridge within half a mile of one of the main southwest–northeast roads of early modern Britain, which also runs past Leamington, and it is entirely plausible that Arnold would have seen it, or perhaps another colonist in a position to influence the design of his &quot;stone built windmill&quot;.
Various authors have suggested that comparable mediaeval buildings can be found in Europe, particularly the Orphir Round Church on Orkney built in Scotland around 1115, and the round churches on the Danish island of Bornholm, such as Østerlars Church dating from around 1160.

== Scientific investigations ==

=== 1848 mortar comparison ===
In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Jackson of Newport collected samples of mortar from the mill and some of the oldest known structures in the town, including the very early Bull house (c. 1640), the Easton house (1642–1643), other houses, and the tombs of Governor Arnold and his wife. Under detailed examination, all proved to be of very similar composition, &quot;composed of shell lime, sand, and gravel&quot;.

=== 1948 excavation ===

The city of Newport gave permission for a scientific investigation of the site by the Society for American Archaeology in 1948. The investigation was directed by Hugh Henken of Harvard University, with the field work headed by William S. Godfrey. As part of the investigation, a one-meter-wide trench was dug from the tower&#x27;s exterior through the interior. The results were published in Godfrey&#x27;s 1951 Ph.D. dissertation and concluded that all the artifacts discovered were from the 17th century. Godfrey&#x27;s dissertation identifies Benedict Arnold as the builder of the tower, stating that Arnold &quot;purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the stone mill, the year before he moved... At some period before 1677 Arnold built the Old Stone Mill.&quot;

There is no evidence for Godfrey&#x27;s assertion that Arnold &quot;built his house&quot; in Newport. From Godfrey&#x27;s thesis: &quot;It is strongly suggested by the records that he purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the Stone Mill, the year before he moved. (Thompkins, 1919, quoting Roger Williams, 1650) The original owner had been Jeremy Clarke, but there is no indication that Clarke ever built on the property.&quot;

Thompkins wrote: “It will be noticed as an evidence of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s prominence that his name is mentioned first in the order, rather than his father, and as an indication of his increasing wealth at the assessment of taxes in Providence in 1650, Benedict Arnold&#x27;s amount was put at £5, the largest sum assessed against any one individual. In June of this same year Roger Williams, in writing to Gov. Winthrop of Connecticut says, &quot;Benedict Arnold having now bought house and land at Newport, proposing thither to remove.&quot;

Godfrey initially dismissed the Chesterton Mill theory, claiming that &quot;on the other hand, there is very little probability that Benedict built his Tower as a mill... the tower mill form, as contrasted to the smock, post and composite forms, was not common in England until the beginning of the 18th century.&quot; Godfrey posited the hypothesis that &quot;the tower was built as a comfortable retreat and lookout for a very rich and very autocratic old man.&quot; However, he later retreated from this position, noting in 1954 that &quot;Rex Wailes, noted English expert on windmills... has supported the contention that both structures were built as mills.&quot; It has since been shown that tower mills were known in England from the late 13th century and that they became increasingly common from the late 16th century onwards. Subsequent research has determined that Chesterton was, in fact, built as a windmill in 1632–33, as the original building accounts have been traced since Wailes&#x27; death in 1986, including payments for sailcloths.
There are also several surviving 17th-century unarched stone tower mills in North America, which are similar in appearance to European examples of the same period (e.g., Moulin de Grondines, Quebec (1674) and Moulin de Vincelotte, Quebec (1690)).

=== 1993 carbon-14 dating ===
In 1993, radiocarbon dating tests of the tower&#x27;s mortar were undertaken by a team of researchers from Denmark and Finland. The results suggest a probable date of production of the mortar between 1635 and 1698. The tested mortar may date from the tower&#x27;s initial construction or from repointing, which may have been performed long after initial construction. The researchers drilled &quot;deep so as to get past any recent mortar that might have been applied during tuck pointing.&quot; In a 2003 report on this and related work, Hale, et al. put the date of the mortar, and thus the tower, at about 1680.

== Alternative hypotheses ==

===Norse===

In 1837, Danish archaeologist Carl Christian Rafn proposed a Viking origin for the tower in his book &quot;Antiquitates Americanæ&quot;, partly based on his research of the inscriptions on the Dighton Rock near the mouth of the Taunton River. This hypothesis is predicated on the uncertainty of the southward extent of the early Norse explorations of North America, particularly in regard to the actual location of Vinland.
Rafn&#x27;s popularization of the theory led to a flurry of interest and &quot;proofs&quot; of Norse settlement in the area. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow incorporated the Norse-origin view of the tower into his poem &quot;The Skeleton in Armor&quot;. Philip Ainsworth Means, an archaeologist whose specialty was Andean civilizations, attempted to compile all known evidence surrounding the tower in his 1942 book &quot;Newport Tower&quot;. As a supporter of the Norse hypothesis, Means dismissed the idea that Arnold built the tower &quot;from the ground up.&quot; He claimed that the Tower was a church built between the 11th and 14th centuries, citing many architectural features obsolete by the 17th century.

Since then, much of Means&#x27; evidence has been shown to be mistaken. His assertion is incorrect that a windmill would not have fireplaces because of the fire risk. Several have fireplaces aligned with windows, and it is not unusual to find a double flue exiting the wall, generally with the exits aligned parallel to the prevailing wind to improve the updraft on a relatively short flue. A conventional chimney could not be used, as it would foul the turning cap and sails of the windmill.

Examples include the later-built (ca. 1750s) Upholland Windmill, Lancashire, where the fireplace is at second floor level (first floor in British English), as well as Much Wenlock windmill, Shropshire, which has double flues of uncertain purpose rising from the middle floor level, which was constructed in the 18th century. Both of the above cited examples post-date the earliest surviving mention of the Stone Mill in a 28 February 1677 deed.

===Observatory hypothesis===
Four of the eight supporting pillars of the tower face the main points of the compass. In the 1990s, William Penhallow, a Professor of Physics and astronomer at the University of Rhode Island, studied the windows in the tower and said that he found a number of astronomical alignments. At the summer solstice the setting sun should shine through the &quot;west&quot; window (actually just south of true west) onto a niche in the inner wall, next to the &quot;south&quot; window. (This no longer happens due to urban development and park trees.) Similarly, the angle from the &quot;east&quot; window through the &quot;west&quot; window is about 18 degrees south of west, which is the southern extreme of moonsets during what is known as the &quot;lunar minor standstill&quot;. The smaller windows also form alignments, on significant stars. These alignments could be accidental, but if they were deliberate it would explain why the pattern of windows seems, according to Penhallow, &quot;so odd&quot;.

===Chinese===
Author Gavin Menzies argues in his pseudohistorical book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered America&quot; that the tower was built by a colony of Chinese sailors and concubines from the junks of Zheng He&#x27;s voyages either as a lighthouse or as an observatory to determine the longitude of the colony, based on Penhallow&#x27;s findings. Menzies claimed that the tower closely matches designs used in Chinese observatories and lighthouses elsewhere. However, these claims have been debunked.

===Portuguese===

During the early 20th century, Edmund B. Delabarre associated the Dighton Rock with the lost Portuguese navigators Miguel Corte-Real and his brother Gaspar. This Portuguese hypothesis has been supported more recently by Manuel Luciano DaSilva, who suggests that one of the Corte-Real brothers built the Newport Tower as a watchtower. The idea of Portuguese construction of the tower was also supported by former U.S. Ambassador Herbert Pell, who in 1948 argued that the tower resembles elements of the Convent of Tomar in Portugal.
===Medieval Templars===

British writer Andrew Sinclair has put forth the hypothesis that the Newport Tower was built by medieval Scottish Templars led by Scottish earl Henry Sinclair as part of an alleged voyage to New England about a hundred years before Columbus, but such a voyage has been vigorously disputed.

<text>Les Troyens (; in English: &quot;The Trojans&quot;) is a French grand opera in five acts, running for about five hours, by Hector Berlioz. The libretto was written by Berlioz himself from Virgil&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Aeneid&quot;; the score was composed between 1856 and 1858. &quot;Les Troyens&quot; is Berlioz&#x27;s most ambitious work, the summation of his entire artistic career, but he did not live to see it performed in its entirety. Under the title &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot;, the last three acts were premièred with many cuts by Léon Carvalho&#x27;s company, the Théâtre Lyrique, at their theatre (now the Théâtre de la Ville) on the Place du Châtelet in Paris on 4 November 1863, with 21 repeat performances. The reduced versions run for about three hours. After decades of neglect, today the opera is considered by some music critics as one of the finest ever written.

==Composition history==
Berlioz began the libretto on 5 May 1856 and completed it toward the end of June 1856. He finished the full score on 12 April 1858. Berlioz had a keen affection for literature, and he had admired Virgil since his childhood. The Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein was a prime motivator to Berlioz to compose this opera.

On 3 May 1861, Berlioz wrote in a letter: &quot;I am sure that I have written a great work, greater and nobler than anything done hitherto.&quot; Elsewhere he wrote: &quot;The principal merit of the work is, in my view, the truthfulness of the expression.&quot; For Berlioz, truthful representation of passion was the highest goal of a dramatic composer, and in this respect he felt he had equalled the achievements of Gluck and Mozart.

==Early performance history==

===Premiere of the second part===

In his memoirs, Berlioz described in excruciating detail the intense frustrations he experienced in seeing the work performed. For five years (from 1858 to 1863), the Paris Opéra – the only suitable stage in Paris – vacillated. Finally, tired of waiting, he agreed to let Léon Carvalho, director of the smaller Théâtre Lyrique, mount a production of the second half of the opera with the title &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot;. It consisted of Acts 3 to 5, redivided by Berlioz into five acts, to which he added an orchestral introduction (&quot;Lamento&quot;) and a prologue. As Berlioz noted bitterly, he agreed to let Carvalho do it &quot;despite the manifest impossibility of his doing it properly. He had just obtained an annual subsidy of a hundred thousand francs from the government. Nonetheless the enterprise was beyond him. His theater was not large enough, his singers were not good enough, his chorus and orchestra were small and weak.&quot;

Even with this truncated version of the opera, many compromises and cuts were made, some during rehearsals, and some during the run. The new second act was the &quot;Chasse Royale et Orage&quot; (&quot;Royal Hunt and Storm&quot;) [no. 29], an elaborate pantomime ballet with nymphs, sylvans and fauns, along with a chorus. Since the set change for this scene took nearly an hour, it was cut, despite the fact its staging had been greatly simplified with a painted waterfall backdrop rather than one with real water. Carvalho had originally planned to divert water from the nearby Seine, but during the rehearsals, a faulty switch nearly caused a disaster. The entries of the builders, sailors, and farm-workers , were omitted because Carvalho found them dull; likewise, the scene for Anna and Narbal and the second ballet [no. 33b]. The sentries&#x27; duet [no. 40] was omitted, because Carvalho had found its &quot;homely style... out of place in an epic work&quot;. Iopas&#x27;s stanzas [no. 25] disappeared with Berlioz&#x27;s approval, the singer De Quercy &quot;charged with the part being incapable of singing them well.&quot; The duet between Didon and Énée [no. 44] was cut because, as Berlioz himself realized, &quot;Madame Charton&#x27;s voice was unequal to the vehemence of this scene, which took so much out of her that she would not have had the strength left to deliver the tremendous recitative Dieux immortels! il part! [no. 46], the final aria [Adieu, fière cité, no. 48], and the scene on the pyre .&quot; The &quot;Song of Hylas&quot; [no. 38], which was &quot;greatly liked at the early performances and was well sung&quot;, was cut while Berlioz was at home sick with bronchitis. The singer of the part, Edmond Cabel, was also performing in a revival of Félicien David&#x27;s &quot;La perle du Brésil&quot;, and since his contract only required him to sing fifteen times per month, he would have to be paid an extra two hundred francs for each additional performance. Berlioz lamented: &quot;If I am able to put on an adequate performance of a work of this scale and character I must be in absolute control of the theatre, as I am of the orchestra when I rehearse a symphony.&quot;

Even in its less than ideal form, the work made a profound impression. For example, Giacomo Meyerbeer attended 12 performances. Berlioz&#x27;s son Louis attended every performance. A friend tried to console Berlioz for having endured so much in the mutilation of his magnum opus and pointed out that after the first night audiences were increasing. &quot;See,&quot; he said encouragingly to Berlioz, &quot;they are coming.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Berlioz, feeling old and worn out, &quot;they are coming, but I am going.&quot; Berlioz never saw the first two acts, later given the name &quot;La prise de Troie&quot; (&quot;The Capture of Troy&quot;).

===Early concert performances of portions of the opera===

After the premiere of the second part at the Théâtre Lyrique, portions of the opera were next presented in concert form. Two performances of &quot;La prise de Troie&quot; were given in Paris on the same day, 7 December 1879: one by the Concerts Pasdeloup at the Cirque d&#x27;Hiver with Anne Charton-Demeur as Cassandre, Stéphani as Énée, conducted by Ernest Reyer; and another by the Concerts Colonne at the Théâtre du Châtelet with Leslino as Cassandre, Piroia as Énée, conducted by Edouard Colonne. These were followed by two concerts in New York: the first, Act 2 of &quot;La prise de Troie&quot;, was performed in English on 6 May 1882 by Thomas&#x27;s May Festival at the 7th Regiment Armory with Amalie Materna as Cassandre, Italo Campanini as Énée, conducted by Theodore Thomas; the second, &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot; (with cuts), was given in English on 26 February 1887 at Chickering Hall with Marie Gramm as Didon, Max Alvary as Énée, and possibly conducted by Frank Van der Stucken.

===First performance of both parts===
The first staged performance of the whole opera only took place in 1890, 21 years after Berlioz&#x27;s death. The first and second parts, in Berlioz&#x27;s revised versions of three and five acts, were sung on two successive evenings, 6 and 7 December, in German at Großherzoglichen Hoftheater in Karlsruhe (see Roles). This production was frequently revived over the succeeding eleven years and was sometimes given on a single day. The conductor, Felix Mottl, took his production to Mannheim in 1899 and conducted another production in Munich in 1908, which was revived in 1909. He rearranged some of the music for the Munich production, placing the &quot;Royal Hunt and Storm&quot; after the love duet, a change that &quot;was to prove sadly influential.&quot; A production of both parts, with substantial cuts in the second part, was mounted in Nice in 1891.

In subsequent years, according to Berlioz biographer David Cairns, the work was thought of as &quot;a noble white elephant – something with beautiful things in it, but too long and supposedly full of dead wood. The kind of maltreatment it received in Paris as recently as last winter in a new production will, I&#x27;m sure, be a thing of the past.&quot;

==Publication of the score==
At the time of the 1863 production of &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot;, Berlioz permitted the Parisian music editors Choudens et Cie to publish the vocal score as two separate operas. Only 15 copies of the first edition were printed, at the composer&#x27;s expense. In this published score, he introduced a number of optional cuts which have often been adopted in subsequent productions. Berlioz complained bitterly of the cuts that he was more or less forced to allow at the 1863 Théâtre Lyrique premiere production, and his letters and memoirs are filled with the indignation that it caused him to &quot;mutilate&quot; his score.

In his July 1867 will Berlioz lamented that Choudens had failed to meet their contractual obligation to engrave the full score and asked his executors to ensure the opera &quot;be published without cuts, without modifications, without the least suppression of the text in sum exactly as it stands.&quot; In the late 1880s, after a lawsuit, the firm printed the full scores of &quot;La prise de Troie&quot; and &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot;, orchestral parts, and an improved vocal score, but only the vocal score was sold. The remaining material was only made available for short-term hire.

In the early 20th century, the lack of accurate parts led musicologists W. J. Turner and Cecil Gray to plan a raid on the publisher&#x27;s Paris office, even approaching the Parisian underworld for help.

In 1969, Bärenreiter Verlag of Kassel, Germany, first published the full score of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in a critical edition containing all the compositional material left by Berlioz. The preparation of this critical edition was the work of Hugh Macdonald, whose Cambridge University doctoral dissertation this was. With its publication, as well as the release in 1970 of the first complete recording (based on Covent Garden performances conducted by Colin Davis), &quot;it was finally possible to study and produce the whole work, and to judge it on its own merits.&quot;

In early 2016 the Bibliothèque nationale de France bought the 1859 autograph vocal score, which included scenes cut for the orchestral autograph score; the manuscript also includes annotations by Pauline Viardot.

==Later performance history==
On 9 June 1892 the Paris Opéra-Comique staged &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot; (in the same theatre as its premiere) and witnessed a triumphant debut for the 17-year-old Marie Delna as Didon, with Stéphane Lafarge as Énée, conducted by Jules Danbé; these staged performances of Part 2 continued into the next year.

In December 1906 the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels commenced a run of performances with the two halves on successive nights.
On 6 February 1920, the Théâtre des Arts in Rouen staged what was probably the first French performance of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; on one night, with only a few cuts, which had been sanctioned by the author. The Opéra in Paris had presented a production of &quot;La prise de Troie&quot; in 1899, and in 1919 mounted a production of &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot; in Nîmes. Both parts were staged at the Opéra in one evening on 10 June 1921, with mise-en-scène by Merle-Forest, sets by René Piot and costumes by Dethomas. The cast included Marguerite Gonzategui (Didon), Lucy Isnardon (Cassandre), Jeanne Laval (Anna), Paul Franz (Énée), Édouard Rouard (Chorèbe), and Armand Narçon (Narbal), with Philippe Gaubert conducting. Marisa Ferrer (who later sang the part under Sir Thomas Beecham in London) sang Didon in the 1929 revival, with Germaine Lubin as Cassandre and Franz again as Énée. Georges Thill sang Énée in 1930. Lucienne Anduran was Didon in 1939, with Ferrer as Cassandre this time, José de Trévi as Énée, and Martial Singher as Chorèbe. Gaubert conducted all performances in Paris before the Second World War.

In the UK, concert performances of &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot; took place in 1897 and 1928, then in 1935 a complete &quot;Les Troyens&quot; was performed by Glasgow Grand Opera Society, directed by Scottish composer Erik Chisholm.

&quot;Les Troyens&quot; was performed for the first time in London in a concert performance conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham and broadcast at the BBC in 1947. His cast included Ferrer as both Didon and Cassandre, Jean Giraudeau as Énée and Charles Cambon as both Chorèbe (a role he had sung in Paris in 1929) and Narbal. An aircheck of this performance has been issued on CD. However, the 1957 production at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden conducted by Rafael Kubelík and directed by John Gielgud, has been described as &quot;the first full staging in a single evening that even approximated the composer&#x27;s original intentions&quot;. It was sung in English.

=== 1960s ===
The Paris Opéra gave a new production of a condensed version of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; on March 17, 1961, directed by Margherita Wallmann, with sets and costumes by Piero Zuffi. Pierre Dervaux was the conductor, with Régine Crespin as Didon, Geneviève Serrès as Cassandre, Jacqueline Broudeur as Anna, Guy Chauvet as Énée, Robert Massard as Chorèbe and Georges Vaillant as Narbal; performances by this cast were broadcast on French radio. Several of these artists, in particular Crespin and Chauvet, participated in a set of extended highlights commercially recorded by EMI in 1965, Georges Prêtre conducting.

The performance of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; used at various productions at the Paris Opéra and by Beecham and by Kubelík in London were the orchestral and choral parts from Choudens et Cie of Paris, the only edition then available.

The first American stage performance of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (an abbreviated version, sung in English) was given by Boris Goldovsky with the New England Opera Theater on 27 March 1955, in Boston. The San Francisco Opera staged a heavily cut version of the opera (reducing it to about three hours), billed as the &quot;American professional stage premiere&quot;, in 1966, with Crespin as both Cassandre and Didon and Canadian tenor Jon Vickers as Énée, and again in 1968 with Crespin and Chauvet; Jean Périsson conducted all performances.

On 5 May 1964 at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Crespin (as Cassandre and Didon) and Chauvet were the leads for the South American premiere, conducted by Georges Sébastian.

=== Performances using the critical edition ===
The critical edition score from Bärenreiter published in 1969 was first used in May that year by the Scottish Opera under Alexander Gibson, in performances sung in English. Colin Davis conducted a Covent Garden production sung in French in September and a parallel Philips recording was made. Tim Ashley of the &quot;Gramophone&quot; writes, the Philips recording &quot;brought an entire generation of listeners to the work, and as [Berlioz&#x27;s biographer David] Cairns puts it, it finally &#x27;blew to smithereens the idea that the opera was a dead duck the fruit of an old, worn-out composer.&#x27;&quot; Ashley also asserts: &quot;Understanding of [Berlioz&#x27;s] achievement [as a composer] was also notably incomplete owing to the absence from the repertory of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in any form in which we now recognise it. Its discovery [in 1969] was to bring in its wake a reappraisal of Berlioz&#x27;s entire output which would decisively re-establish his position, even in France.&quot;

The first complete American production of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (with Crespin as Didon) was given in February 1972 by Sarah Caldwell with her Opera Company of Boston, at the Aquarius Theater. On 17 March 1972, John Nelson conducted New Jersey&#x27;s Pro Arte Chorale and Festival Orchestra in a concert performance of the complete opera at Carnegie Hall in New York. In 1973, Rafael Kubelík conducted the first Metropolitan Opera performances of &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, in the opera&#x27;s first staging in New York City and the third staging in the United States. The performances included cuts (Nos. 20-22 and Nos. 45–46, half of Dido&#x27;s final scene). Shirley Verrett was both Cassandre and Didon at the Metropolitan Opera House premiere, with Jon Vickers as Énée. Christa Ludwig had been cast as Didon but was ill at the time of the premiere; she sang the role in the ten subsequent performances. &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, with all the music restored, opened the Metropolitan&#x27;s centenary season in 1983 under James Levine with Plácido Domingo, Jessye Norman as Cassandre and Tatiana Troyanos as Didon.

Six complete performances were given at Zurich Opera, all 5 acts on one night as Berlioz had intended in September 1990, directed by Tony Palmer. &quot;Les Troyens&quot; was staged again in 1990 for the opening of the new Opéra Bastille in Paris. It was a partial success, because the new theatre was not quite ready on opening night, which caused much trouble during rehearsals. The performance had several cuts, authorised by Berlioz, including some dances in the third act. A full staged version conducted by Charles Dutoit and produced by Francesca Zambello took place at the Los Angeles Opera on September 14, 1991 with Carol Neblett, Nadine Secunde and Gary Lakes. In 1993, Charles Dutoit conducted the Canadian premiere of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in a full concert version with the Montreal Symphony and Deborah Voigt, Françoise Pollet and Gary Lakes which was subsequently recorded by Decca.

To mark the 200th anniversary of Berlioz&#x27;s birth in 2003, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; was revived in productions at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris (conducted by John Eliot Gardiner), De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (conducted by Edo de Waart), and at the Metropolitan in New York (with Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Didon, conducted by Levine). The Met&#x27;s production, by Francesca Zambello, was revived in the 2012–13 season with Susan Graham as Didon, Deborah Voigt as Cassandre, and Marcello Giordani and Bryan Hymel as Énée, conducted by Fabio Luisi. During June and July 2015 the San Francisco Opera presented the opera in a new production directed by Sir David McVicar that originated at the Royal Opera House in London. It featured Susan Graham as Didon, Anna Caterina Antonacci as Cassandre, and Bryan Hymel as Énée, conducted by Donald Runnicles.

==Critical evaluation==
Knowing the work only from a piano reduction, the British critic W. J. Turner declared in his 1934 book on Berlioz that &quot;Les Troyens&quot; was &quot;the greatest opera ever written.&quot; American critic B. H. Haggin heard in the work Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;arrestingly individual musical mind operating in, and commanding attention with, the use of the [Berlioz] idiom with assured mastery and complete adequacy to the text&#x27;s every demand.&quot; David Cairns described the work as &quot;an opera of visionary beauty and splendor, compelling in its epic sweep, fascinating in the variety of its musical invention... it recaptures the tragic spirit and climate of the ancient world.&quot; Hugh Macdonald said of it:

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
:&quot;At the abandoned Greek camp outside the walls of Troy&quot;

The Trojans are celebrating apparent deliverance from ten years of siege by the Greeks (also named the Achaeans in the opera). They see the large wooden horse left by the Greeks, which they presume to be an offering to Pallas Athene. Unlike all the other Trojans, however, Cassandre is mistrustful of the situation. She foresees that she will not live to marry her fiancé, Chorèbe. Chorèbe appears and urges Cassandre to forget her misgivings. But her prophetic vision clarifies, and she foresees the utter destruction of Troy. When Andromaque silently walks in holding her son Astyanax by the hand, the celebration halts.

A captive, Sinon, is brought in. He lies to King Priam and the crowd that he has deserted the Greeks, and that the giant wooden horse they have left behind was intended as a gift to the gods to ensure their safe voyage home. He says the horse was made so big that the Trojans would not be able to move it into their city, because if they did they would be invincible. This only makes the Trojans want the horse inside their city all the more.

Énée then rushes on to tell of the devouring of the priest Laocoön by a sea serpent, after Laocoön had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée interprets this as a sign of the goddess Athene&#x27;s anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre&#x27;s futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is suddenly a sound of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, and for a brief moment the procession and celebrations stop, but then the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen and continue pulling the horse into the city. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.

===Act 2===
Before the act proper has started, the Greek soldiers hidden in the wooden horse have come out and begun to destroy Troy and its citizens.

:&quot;Scene 1: Palace of Énée&quot;

With fighting going on in the background, the ghost of Hector visits Énée and warns him to flee Troy for Italy, where he will build a new Troy. After Hector fades, the priest Panthée conveys the news about the Greeks hidden in the horse. Ascagne appears with news of further destruction. At the head of a band of soldiers, Chorèbe urges Énée to take up arms for battle. All resolve to defend Troy to the death.

:&quot;Scene 2: Palace of Priam&quot;

Several of the Trojan women are praying at the altar of Vesta/Cybele for their soldiers to receive divine aid. Cassandre reports that Énée and other Trojan warriors have rescued Priam&#x27;s palace treasure and relieved people at the citadel. She prophesies that Énée and the survivors will found a new Troy in Italy. But she also says that Chorèbe is dead, and resolves to die herself. The other women acknowledge the accuracy of Cassandre&#x27;s prophecies and their own error in dismissing her. Cassandre then calls upon the Trojan women to join her in death, to prevent being defiled by the invading Greeks. One group of women admits to fear of death, and Cassandre dismisses them from her sight. The remaining women unite with Cassandre in their determination to die. A Greek captain observes the women during this scene with admiration for their courage. Greek soldiers then come on the scene, demanding the Trojan treasure from the women. Cassandre defiantly mocks the soldiers, then suddenly stabs herself. Polyxène takes the same dagger and does likewise. The remaining women scorn the Greeks as being too late to find the treasure, and commit mass suicide, to the soldiers&#x27; horror. Cassandre summons one last cry of &quot;Italie!&quot; before collapsing, dead.

===Act 3===

:&quot;Didon&#x27;s throne-room at Carthage&quot;

The Carthaginians and their queen, Didon, are celebrating the prosperity that they have achieved in the past seven years since fleeing from Tyre to found a new city. Didon, however, is concerned about Iarbas, the Numidian king, not least because he has proposed a political marriage with her. The Carthaginians swear their defence of Didon, and the builders, sailors and farmers offer tribute to Didon.

In private after these ceremonies, Didon and her sister Anna then discuss love. Anna urges Didon to remarry, but Didon insists on honoring the memory of her late husband Sichée. The bard Iopas then enters to tell of an unknown fleet that has arrived in port. Recalling her own wanderings on the seas, Didon bids that these strangers be made welcome. Ascagne enters, presents the saved treasure of Troy, and relates the Trojans&#x27; story. Didon acknowledges that she knows of this situation. Panthée then tells of the ultimate destiny of the Trojans to found a new city in Italy. During this scene, Énée is disguised as an ordinary sailor.

Didon&#x27;s minister Narbal then comes to tell her that Iarbas and his Numidian army are attacking the fields surrounding Carthage and are marching on the city. But Carthage does not have enough weapons to defend itself. Énée then reveals his true identity and offers the services of his people to help Carthage. Didon accepts the offer, and Énée entrusts his son Ascagne to Didon&#x27;s care, but he suddenly dries his tears and joins the Carthaginians and Trojans in preparing for battle against the Numidians.

===Act 4===
:&quot;Scene 1: Royal Hunt and Storm&quot; (mainly instrumental)

This scene is a pantomime with primarily instrumental accompaniment, set in a forest with a cave in the background. A small stream flows from a crag and merges with a natural basin bordered with rushes and reeds. Two naiads appear and disappear, but return to bathe in the basin. Hunting horns are heard in the distance, and huntsmen with dogs pass by as the naiads hide in the reeds. Ascagne gallops across the stage on horseback. Didon and Énée have been separated from the rest of the hunting party. As a storm breaks, the two take shelter in the cave. At the climax of the storm, nymphs with dishevelled hair run to-and-fro over the rocks, gesticulating wildly. They break out in wild cries of &quot;a-o&quot; (sopranos and contraltos) and are joined by fauns, s, and satyrs. The stream becomes a torrent, and waterfalls pour forth from the boulders, as the chorus intones &quot;&quot;Italie! Italie! Italie!&quot;. A tree is hit by lightning, explodes and catches fire, as it falls to the ground. The satyrs, fauns, and sylvans pick up the flaming branches and dance with them in their hands, then disappear with the nymphs into the depths of the forest. The scene is slowly obscured by thick clouds, but as the storm subsides, the clouds lift and dissipate.
:&quot;Scene 2: The gardens of Didon by the shore&quot;

The Numidians have been beaten back, and both Narbal and Anna are relieved at this. However, Narbal worries that Didon has been neglecting the management of the state, distracted by her love for Énée. Anna dismisses such concerns and says that this indicates that Énée would be an excellent king for Carthage. Narbal reminds Anna, however, that the gods have called Énée&#x27;s final destiny to be in Italy. Anna replies that there is no stronger god than love.

After Didon&#x27;s entry, and dances from the Egyptian dancing girls, the slaves, and the Nubian slave girls, Iopas sings his song of the fields, at the queen&#x27;s request.
She then asks Énée for more tales of Troy. Énée reveals that after some persuading, Andromaque eventually married Pyrrhus, the son of Achille, who killed Hector, Andromaque&#x27;s earlier husband. Hearing about Andromaque remarrying, Didon then feels resolved regarding her lingering feelings of faithfulness to her late husband. Alone, Didon and Énée then sing a love duet. At the end of the act, as Didon and Énée slowly walk together towards the back of the stage in an embrace, the god Mercury appears and strikes Énée&#x27;s shield, which the hero has cast away, calling out three times, &quot;Italie!&quot;

===Act 5===
:&quot;Scene 1: The harbor of Carthage&quot;

A young Phrygian sailor, Hylas, sings his song of longing for home, alone. Two sentries mockingly comment that he will never see his homeland again. Panthée and the Trojan chieftains discuss the gods&#x27; angry signs at their delay in sailing for Italy. Ghostly voices are heard calling &quot;Italie! Italie! Italie!&quot;. The sentries, however, remark that they have good lives in Carthage and do not want to leave.

Énée then comes on stage, singing of his despair at the gods&#x27; portents and warnings to set sail for Italy, and also of unhappiness at his betrayal of Didon with this news. The ghosts of Priam, Chorèbe, Hector and Cassandre appear and relentlessly urge Énée to proceed on to Italy. Énée gives in and realizes that he must obey the gods&#x27; commands, but also realizes his cruelty and ingratitude to Didon as a result. He then orders his comrades to prepare to sail that very morning, before sunrise.

Didon then appears, appalled at Énée&#x27;s attempt to leave in secret, but still in love with him. Énée pleads the messages from the gods to move on, but Didon will have none of this. She pronounces a curse on him as she leaves. The Trojans shout &quot;Italie!&quot;&quot;.
:&quot;Scene 2: Didon&#x27;s apartment at dawn&quot;

Didon asks Anna to plead with Énée one last time to stay. Anna acknowledges blame for encouraging the love between her sister and Énée. Didon angrily counters that if Énée truly loved her, he would defy the gods, but then asks her to plead with him for a few days&#x27; additional stay.

The crowd has seen the Trojans set sail. Iopas conveys the news to Didon. In a rage, she demands that the Carthaginians give chase and destroy the Trojans&#x27; fleet, and wishes that she had destroyed the Trojans upon their arrival. She then decides to offer sacrifice, including destroying the Trojans&#x27; gifts to her and hers to them. Narbal is worried about Didon and tells Anna to stay with her sister, but the queen orders Anna to leave.

Alone, she resolves to die, and after expressing her love for Énée one final time, prepares to bid her city and her people farewell.

:&quot;Scene 3: The palace gardens&quot;
A sacrificial pyre with Énée&#x27;s relics has been built. Priests enter in a procession. Narbal and Anna expound curses on Énée to suffer a humiliating death in battle. Didon says it is time to finish the sacrifice and that she feels peace enter her heart (this happens in a ghostly descending chromatic line recalling the appearance of Hector&#x27;s ghost in Act II). She then ascends the pyre. She removes her veil and throws it on Énée&#x27;s toga. She has a vision of a future African warrior, Hannibal, who will rise and attack Rome to avenge her.

Didon then stabs herself with Énée&#x27;s sword, to the horror of her people. But at the moment of her death, she has one last vision: Carthage will be destroyed, and Rome will be &quot;immortal&quot;. The Carthaginians then utter one final curse on Énée and his people to the music of the Trojan march, vowing vengeance for his abandonment of Didon, as the opera ends.

<text>A keystone (or capstone) is the wedge-shaped stone at the apex of a masonry arch or typically round-shaped one at the apex of a vault. In both cases it is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position, allowing the arch or vault to bear weight. In arches and vaults (such as quasi-domes) keystones are often enlarged beyond the structural requirements and decorated. A variant in domes and crowning vaults is a lantern. A portion of the arch surrounding the keystone is called a crown.

Keystones or their suggested form are sometimes placed for decorative effect in the centre of the flat top of doors, recesses and windows, so as to form an upward projection of a lintel, as a hallmark of strength or good architecture.

Although a masonry arch or vault cannot be self-supporting until the keystone is placed, the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs, due to its position at the apex. Old keystones can decay due to weathering and vibration, a condition known as bald arch.

==Architecture==
In a rib-vaulted ceiling, keystones commonly mark the intersections of any two or more arched ribs. For aesthetics, keystones are often larger than ribs in vaults and many of the voussoirs (arch stones) in arches, or embellished with a boss. 

A &quot;dropped keystone&quot; is one where the keystone projects lower than the other voussoirs. Following Giulio Romano, Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones, as in the &quot;church house&quot; entrance portal at Colditz Castle. Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio, a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect.

==Metaphor==
Keystone is often used metaphorically for an essential part on which the whole depends or as an acme of the whole.

The U.S. state of Pennsylvania calls itself the &quot;Keystone State&quot;, because during early American history, it held a crucial central position among the Thirteen Colonies geographically, economically, and politically, like the keystone in an arch. A keystone is a symbol of Pennsylvania, being used in the logos of many Pennsylvania government departments, in Pennsylvania state route signs, and on Pennsylvania car license plates, and the Shoulder Sleeve Insignia of the Pennsylvania National Guard&#x27;s 28th Infantry Division (United States), a Red Keystone, first adopted during World War I in October 1918.

In Christianity, Psalms 118:22, translated in the Authorized Version as &quot;The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner&quot;, is taken to refer to Jesus.

Referring to the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith said that it &quot;was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.&quot; Ezra Taft Benson, the 13th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said it &quot;is my prayer that the Book of Mormon may become the keystone of our lives.&quot;

<doc id="428958" wikidata="Q3485613" url="?curid=428958" title="Bagatelles, Op. 126 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Bagatelles, Op. 126 are six pieces for solo piano composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. They were composed in 1824 and published the next year in his career, in 1825. Beethoven dedicated them to his brother Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven (1776–1848), and wrote to his publisher, Schott Music, that the Opus 126 Bagatelles &quot;are probably the best I&#x27;ve written&quot;.
==Form==

A bagatelle, in Beethoven&#x27;s usage, is a kind of brief character piece.
The set comprises six short works, as follows:

#Andante con moto, Cantabile e compiacevole, G major, 
#Allegro, G minor, 
#Andante, Cantabile e grazioso, E major, 
#Presto, B minor, 
#Quasi allegretto, G major, 
#Presto, cut time then Andante amabile e con moto, E major, 

In prefatory remarks to his edition of the works, Otto von Irmer notes that Beethoven intended the six bagatelles be played in order as a single work, at least insofar as this can be inferred from a marginal annotation Beethoven made in the manuscript: &quot;Ciclus von Kleinigkeiten&quot; (cycle of little pieces). Lewis Lockwood suggests another reason to regard the work as a unity rather than a collection: starting with the second Bagatelle, the keys of the pieces fall in a regular succession of descending major thirds, a pattern Lockwood also notices in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 55 &quot;Eroica&quot; and the String Quartet No. 12, Op. 127.

==Analysis==

Maurice J. E. Brown, writing in the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot;, says of the Bagatelles that they &quot;are thoroughly typical of their composer and show affinities with the greater instrumental works written at the same time.&quot; Some possible such affinities are as follows: No. 1 shares the terse, elliptical expression of the first movement of the Piano Sonata, Op. 101; No. 3 shares the style of elaborate, high-register elaboration of a slow melody in triple time, seen in the slow movement of the &quot;Hammerklavier Sonata&quot;; and the final Bagatelle opens with a chaotic passage reminiscent of the opening of the finale of the Ninth Symphony.

<text>The Keystone Service is a 195 mile (314 km) regional passenger train service from Amtrak, that operates between the Harrisburg Transportation Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, running along the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line (known as the Keystone Corridor). Most trains then continue along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) to Penn Station in New York City.

Trips between Harrisburg and New York take approximately hours, including hours between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. There are also several express services that can cut the journey times of both by approximately 15 minutes.

The line is considered higher-speed rail with trains operating at up to over parts of the Northeast Corridor and up to over parts of the Keystone Corridor.

 it is Amtrak&#x27;s fifth-busiest route nationally, and the third-busiest among services in the greater Northeast Corridor; in fiscal year 2016, the service carried 1.47 million passengers, an increase of 7.9% over FY2015. Total revenue in FY2016 was $41,123,787, an increase of 7.5% over FY2015. The route is primarily funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).

== History ==
=== Takeover from Penn Central ===
The Keystone Service is the successor to numerous services running along the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line dating back to 1857, when the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) bought the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, enabling service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg.

By the time the PRR merged with Penn Central in 1968, it operated three types of service on the Main Line: commuter service between the suburb of and Suburban Station via 30th Street Station, regional service (trains numbered in the 600s) between Harrisburg and Suburban Station via 30th Street Station, and express intercity service like the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and &quot;Duquesne&quot;, which skipped 30th Street Station entirely and used North Philadelphia station as their only Philadelphia stop.

When the Metroliner high-speed program had begun two years earlier, the state had attempted to capitalize on the opportunity to purchase upgraded rolling stock for the 600-series trains. On August 30, 1966, Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania announced plans to purchase 11 Metroliners capable of service to replace the Silverliners then used. The cars were ordered through Philadelphia commuter agency SEPTA, as the state was not permitted to contract directly with the PRR. The state, SEPTA, and PRR reached an agreement on November 3; the state and SEPTA would each pay $2 million, funded mostly by mass transit grants from the newly formed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the PRR would receive a free 15-year lease of the cars. The PRR soon withdrew after complaints from competing Red Arrow Lines and Capitol Trailways, and the HUD grants were later found to be inapplicable to intercity service.

In June 1968, an agreement was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. On February 25, 1970, the cars intended for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central refused to accept the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had slower acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York–Washington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July 1970, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade existing Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.

When Amtrak was created to take over intercity passenger rail service in 1971, there was substantial debate about whether some trains constituted intercity services (to be either taken over by Amtrak or discontinued, relieving private companies like Penn Central of the financial burden) or commuter services (to be retained by the private companies unless discontinuance was approved by the ICC). Penn Central alleged that several of its regional services – the 600-series trains, connecting Lancaster–York buses, &quot;Clockers&quot;, and New York–Chatham service – were intercity services that could be discontinued since they were not included in Amtrak&#x27;s initial system.

On March 31, 1971, Penn Central filed with ICC to discontinue the 600-series trains at the conclusion of their contract with SEPTA on June 30. The state filed suit against Penn Central on April 7 to stop the discontinuance. On April 23, Penn Central filed in District Court to discontinue the regional services. Five days later, the state and the UTU filed an opposing suit, calling the trains a commuter service. On April 30, Judge John P. Fullam ordered Penn Central to continue operating the trains and ultimately referred the case to the ICC.

When Amtrak took over intercity service on May 1, 1971, the 600-series trains continued to be operated by Penn Central, though they were listed in Amtrak schedules. The city of Philadelphia and the state both preferred to have Penn Central rather than Amtrak operate the service, as Amtrak was exempt from state control. On June 21, the ICC ruled that the service was not intercity rail, as sought by the state and not by Penn Central. On August 3, Fullam ordered Penn Central to continue operating the regional services.

On October 29, 1972, after further negotiations with Penn Central, Amtrak took over operation of the 600-series trains as &quot;Silverliner Service&quot;, named for the Silverliner cars used to run the trains. Amtrak assumed formal responsibility for the &quot;Silverliner Service&quot; and &quot;Clockers&quot; around April 1974. Penn Central (and later Conrail and finally SEPTA Regional Rail) continued to operate Paoli–Philadelphia commuter service. Amtrak took over ticketing for the &quot;Silverliner Service&quot; and &quot;Clockers&quot; from Penn Central on July 1, 1975. On October 26, 1975, SEPTA funded an increase from 9 to 11 daily round trips. Amtrak began including a listing of connecting trains to/from New York City in the November 1975 timetable.

=== Declining service ===

In the late 1970s, NJDOT&#x27;s new Arrow III railcars arrived several years ahead of the completion of electrification projects to allow their use in New Jersey commuter service. By this time, Amtrak was desperate for electric propulsion, as the aging GG1 locomotives were nearing the end of their usefulness, replacement E60 locomotives were proving unreliable, and new EMD AEM-7 locomotives were only just beginning to arrive. In April 1978, Amtrak leased 70 of NJDOT&#x27;s Arrow II cars for use on the &quot;Clockers&quot;, &quot;Keystone Service&quot;, and the new &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. By January 1979, the Arrows were rotated between the &quot;Clockers&quot; and &quot;Silverliner Service&quot;. The Arrows had bathrooms and water fountains, making them more suitable for regional service than the Silverliners. In late 1980, under pressure from NJDOT, Amtrak returned all but 32 of the Arrows, which quickly created the need to find other rolling stock for the &quot;Silverliner Service&quot;. Despite being pronounced unsuitable for Harrisburg service a decade before, the Metroliners were the only easily available rolling stock, as they were being slowly retired from the eponymous service. A test run with Metroliners was made on January 20, 1981, and Metroliners were used in revenue service for two weeks in February. Metroliners were used on the New York – Harrisburg &quot;Valley Forge&quot; for a week in August, and a maintenance facility at Harrisburg opened on October 13, 1981.

As the new AEM-7 locomotives continued to arrive, Amtrak assigned them to haul crack &quot;Metroliner&quot; trains with Amfleet consists, and reassigned the less-reliable Metroliners for the secondary Philadelphia–Harrisburg service, dubbing them Capitoliners. On October 25, 1981, the service was rebranded as &quot;Keystone Service&quot;. All service was then operated by the Metroliners, which lacked the quick acceleration of the Silverliners or Arrows, making them unsuitable for the service. After a single Metroliner set was withdrawn from &quot;Clocker&quot; service in March 1982, the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; was the only remaining use of the Metroliners. On April 24, 1983, a pair of weekday trains – the 9:54am arrival and 3:55pm departure from Suburban Station – were renamed &quot;Keystone Executive&quot;. Intended to attract riders from the western end of the corridor, the trains made intermediate stops only at Lancaster, Downingtown, and 30th Street, with a 99-minute schedule.

The first westbound train of the morning made numerous local stops for commuters to Harrisburg, including some at stations not served by any other Amtrak train. This was first shown in the April 29, 1973, schedule. These one-off stops were gradually dropped: Merion in 1979; 52nd Street and Berwyn in 1980; Radnor and Narberth in 1982; and Bryn Mawr, Overbrook, and Wayne in 1987. Amtrak and SEPTA opened a station in on November 2, 1981, to serve fast-growing suburban areas.
The &quot;Silverliner Service&quot; carried over one million passengers in 1980, but ridership was in steep decline due to a variety of factors. On October 30, 1983, Amtrak reduced the service from 11 to 9 weekday round trips, prompting an 8% drop in ridership. A decrease to 6 weekday round trips on January 12, 1986, and 5 round trips on April 27, cut ridership by an additional 45%. The cuts included the termination of the &quot;Keystone Executive&quot;. Despite the loss of service, fares doubled from 1980 to 1987. The single SEPTA round trip past Paoli to was cut in 1983, but two round trips were restored in March 1985, with additional midday and weekend service added in 1988. Service was further extended to in 1990, with lower fares than Amtrak. By 1990, SEPTA carried 595,000 passengers west of Paoli, twice that of Amtrak&#x27;s ridership on the entire &quot;Keystone Service&quot;.

The Metroliner cars, worn out from nearly two decades of heavy use, began to fail frequently. In April 1985, Amtrak began studying the possibility of removing electrification west of Paoli. On-time performance decreased from around 85% in 1985 to below 60% in early 1988. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing the Metroliner cars with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the &quot;Night Owl&quot; four days later took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The change was listed as &quot;temporary&quot; on timetables starting on May 15, 1988, and lasting into 1990. After dieselization and the lengthening of schedules, on-time performance began to consistently exceed 90%.

=== Through service ===

At its inception on May 1, 1971, Amtrak ran two through services on the line: the combined New York–Chicago &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and New York–St. Louis &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (soon renamed &quot;National Limited&quot;), and the Pittsburgh–New York &quot;Duquesne&quot; (soon renamed &quot;Keystone&quot;). The former train stopped only at Lancaster and Paoli between Harrisburg and North Philadelphia; it was intended for long-distance travelers between the East Coast and the Midwest rather than local passengers. The &quot;Duquesne&quot;/&quot;Keystone&quot; had one additional stop at Coatesville and was intended for medium-distance intercity travel.

Amtrak discontinued the &quot;Keystone&quot; on April 30, 1972, leaving the 600-series trains as the only local service along their route. The &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and &quot;National Limited&quot; were split; they added local stops west of Harrisburg, but passengers from between Harrisburg and Philadelphia had to change trains at Harrisburg, Lancaster, Paoli, or Philadelphia to reach stops west of Harrisburg or north of Philadelphia. On October 28, 1973, Amtrak changed the weekday-only Valley Forge from a Philadelphia–New Haven local train to a Harrisburg–New York City train. It only made the same intermediate stops as the &quot;Keystone&quot;, including no direct service to 30th Street Station. However, its introduction meant that through passengers no longer had to change at Philadelphia or rely on the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot;, whose on-time performance had plunged to just 6.8% in 1973.

Additional local stops in Pennsylvania were later added. On May 19, 1974, Amtrak added weekend service on the &quot;Valley Forge&quot;: a Saturday train from Harrisburg to Boston, and a Sunday train from Boston to Harrisburg. The weekend service ended on October 26, 1975. On October 28, 1979, Amtrak and SEPTA began the &quot;Ardmore Connection&quot;: the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; began stopping at , where a close connection could be made with a SEPTA Paoli–Philadelphia local train. On December 17, 1979, the westbound &quot;Valley Forge&quot; began stopping at 30th Street rather than bypassing it using the Pittsburgh Subway; however, it retained the Ardmore stop.

The Washington sections of the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; and &quot;National Limited&quot; originally split at Harrisburg and reached the Northeast Corridor via the Port Road Branch. The Washington section of the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; was rerouted through Philadelphia on October 26, 1975; the &quot;National Limited&quot; followed suit on October 29, 1978. The &quot;National Limited&quot; was discontinued entirely on October 1, 1979; the state began funding the Pittsburgh–Philadelphia &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; as a replacement on April 27, 1980.
At the same time, a pair of &quot;Clockers&quot;, the westbound &quot;Keystone&quot; and eastbound &quot;Big Apple&quot;, were extended to Harrisburg on weekends. They ran within an hour of the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; weekday schedule; however, they ran to 30th Street and Suburban stations rather than only serving North Philadelphia. The &quot;Keystone&quot; was renamed &quot;Susquehanna&quot; on October 25, 1981. The &quot;Big Apple&quot; and &quot;Susquehanna&quot; dropped the Suburban Station stop a year later, but continued to serve 30th Street. On October 30, 1983, the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia (although it continued to stop at 30th Street). On January 12, 1986, the eastbound &quot;Valley Forge&quot; began serving 30th Street (as the westbound had for six years); this allowed it to effectively replace a canceled &quot;Keystone Service&quot; train (#600, the first morning eastbound) to serve commuters.

Amtrak began operating the Atlantic City–Philadelphia &quot;Atlantic City Express&quot; in 1989, and later extended it along several busy corridors in hopes of increasing ridership. On April 4, 1991, one daily &quot;Keystone Service&quot; round trip was extended to Atlantic City under the &quot;Atlantic City Express&quot; brand. Only a weekend round trip continued to be through-routed. The &quot;Atlantic City Express&quot; was discontinued on April 2, 1995; New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line trains continue to serve 30th Street Station.

=== Modern improvements ===

In November 1996, as part of a general cutback of Regional Rail service, SEPTA cut service back to Downingtown, leaving Parkesburg and as Amtrak-only stations. Amtrak added the stations to several existing round trips as a result. Amtrak discontinued its stops at and (both served only by a single round trip) on April 5, 1998, reducing the number of suburban stations shared by SEPTA and &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains to four.

Beginning in 2000, Amtrak and PennDOT spent $166 million to rehabilitate the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. This included the restoration of fully electrified service, as well as track improvements for a top speed of . When the project was completed and electric service began in October 2006, travel times between Harrisburg and Philadelphia were reduced from 120 minutes to 95 minutes, with further time savings for through trains by eliminating the need for an engine change at Philadelphia. Service was also increased from 11 to 14 daily round trips. By FY 2010, ridership was up 91% since FY 2000 and 58% since FY 2006.

Later improvements aimed to develop a sealed corridor without public at-grade crossings, which would allow future speed increases to west of Philadelphia. The last two such at-grade crossings on the line, located just east of Mount Joy, were closed on September 24, 2014. They were replaced with a bridge connecting to a nearby street. However, private crossings continued to be used on the line. One private crossing east of Mount Joy was closed soon after a train collided with a tractor using the crossing. Today, only one private crossing remains on the line, west of Lancaster on a private roadway leading to a substation.

On March 18, 2020, Amtrak temporarily suspended all &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains due to declining demand because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg resumed on June 1, 2020, with all-reserved seating. On July 6, 2020, Amtrak restored one &quot;Keystone Service&quot; train in each direction running the full route between New York City and Harrisburg. Amtrak restored full service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg on September 8, 2020. On January 4, 2021, Amtrak reduced service levels along the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; due to decreased ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the reduction in service, the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; had seven roundtrips on weekdays and six roundtrips on weekends between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, with three daily roundtrips running the full route between New York City and Harrisburg. Most pre-pandemic service was restored on April 25, 2022, with eleven weekday Philadelphia–Harrisburg round trips.

From March to November 2021, midday &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains were replaced with buses west of Lancaster to allow for track work.

=== Proposed expansion ===
Proposals for an infill station in Paradise Township have been under considerations since the 1990s. The stop would be about halfway between Lancaster and Parkesburg, serving the local Plain community and allowing tourists to transfer to the Strasburg Rail Road. A July 2004 plan was rejected by the Federal Railroad Administration over concerns that the curved track would preclude ADA-compliant boarding platforms.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

Most &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains consist of five cars – four Amfleet I coaches plus a Metroliner cab car – paired with a Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive. The service has a single class of service, coach class, configured with 2x2 seating.
Trains are unreserved between Harrisburg and Philadelphia and reserved coaches between Philadelphia and New York. Unlike most Amtrak routes, no food service is available on &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains.

In the late 2020s and early 2030s, all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2x2 coach class and 2x1 business class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will be a specialized &quot;Auxiliary Power Vehicle&quot; which will include a pantograph to collect power from overhead lines and traction motors in the car and the locomotive.

Before the signal, track, and catenary upgrades that were completed in October 2006, &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains used GE Genesis diesel locomotives between Harrisburg and Philadelphia.

The &quot;Keystone Service&quot; operates entirely over Amtrak-owned trackage:
*Amtrak Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line, Harrisburg–Philadelphia
*Amtrak Northeast Corridor, Philadelphia–New York
Trains operate at speeds up to over the Northeast Corridor and up to over the Main Line.

=== Ridership ===
Ridership data was taken from Amtrak fiscal year reports. 

=== Service ===
On weekdays there are thirteen &quot;Keystone&quot; trains and one &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; train in each direction. All trains run between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, with nine &quot;Keystone&quot; trains plus the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; continuing on to New York. There are eight round-trip trains on both Saturdays and Sundays. All but one, including the &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;, make the full trip between Harrisburg and New York. On the majority of the trains, the journey between Harrisburg and New York takes approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, including 1 hour and 45 minutes to travel between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. There are also several express trains which cut both journey times by approximately 15 minutes each.

<text>Lloyd James Waner (March 16, 1906 – July 22, 1982), nicknamed &quot;Little Poison&quot;, was a Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder. His small stature at and 132 lb (60 kg) made him one of the smallest players of his era. Along with his brother, Paul Waner, he anchored the Pittsburgh Pirates outfield throughout the 1920s and 1930s. After brief stints with four other teams late in his career, Waner retired as a Pirate.

Waner finished with a batting average over .300 in ten seasons. He earned a selection to the MLB All-Star Game in 1938. Lloyd and Paul Waner set the record for career hits by brothers in MLB. He was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1967. He worked as a scout for the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles after retiring as a player.

==Early life==
Waner was born on March 16, 1906, in Harrah, Oklahoma, and grew up on a farm with his older brother, Paul. The two worked from dawn to dusk every day, and baseball was their only form of entertainment. Influenced by their father, who was a minor league player in Oklahoma City, Paul and Lloyd&#x27;s love and natural talent for the game developed over the years. The Waners learned to hit against corncobs and cut down saplings in the woods to use as bats. Lloyd graduated from McLoud High School and attended three semesters at East Central State Normal School (now East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma before going into professional baseball.

Waner started his professional baseball career in 1925 with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, but he hit poorly. He was offered a tryout for the Pirates at the urging of his brother, who had been discovered in Ada by Pirates scout Joe Devine. In 1926, he batted .345 in the Class B South Atlantic League. He also won the league&#x27;s most valuable player award.

==MLB career==

===Early career===
Waner broke into the major leagues with the Pirates in 1927 and quickly built his reputation as a slap hitter with an astute sense of plate discipline. In his rookie campaign, he batted .355 with 223 hits while only striking out 23 times (the highest strikeout total of his career). As the leadoff hitter of the powerful Pittsburgh offense, he led the National League (NL) with 133 runs scored while only having 27 RBIs. The runs scored mark set an MLB rookie record. Al López said that infielders of the era played deep at their positions, but Waner made them play closer to compensate for his speed as a runner.

The Pirates won the 1927 NL pennant; Waner then batted .400 in his only World Series, but the New York Yankees won in four games. He continued to bat well early in his career. He earned a record-setting 678 hits over his first three seasons (1927–1929). (From 2001 to 2003, Ichiro Suzuki came close to the mark with 662 hits in his first three years.) Waner finished in the top ten in MVP voting 1927 and 1929.

Coming off a .353 season in 1929, he missed most of the next year due to appendicitis. He had surgery for the condition in the winter. Waner had difficulty recovering from the surgery and re-entered the hospital in May. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; reported the fear that he might have to retire.

===Middle career===
He returned in 1931 and led the NL with 214 hits and 681 at-bats while hitting .314. Waner hit .333 the next year and finished 13th in MVP voting, but his average dropped to .276 in 1933. Waner&#x27;s average increased to .283 and then .309 over the next two years, though he did not lead the league in any offensive categories or place in the MVP voting during those seasons. In January 1936, Waner became ill with pneumonia and his condition was initially said to be critical. He recovered and was back on the field by late April. Waner hit between .313 and .330 between 1936 and 1938, earning an MLB All-Star Game selection in 1938.

===Later career===
After splitting time in the early 1940s with the Boston Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Brooklyn Dodgers, Waner returned to Pittsburgh, where he finished his career. In September 1945, he asked team president William Benswanger for his release, saying, &quot;The old legs just won&#x27;t hold up anymore and I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;m through.&quot; He compiled a career .316 batting average, batting .300 or higher in ten seasons. He compiled 1 six-hit game, 2 five-hit games and 41 four-hit games in his major league career. Waner was also an accomplished center fielder. He led the league in putouts four times, using his excellent speed to cover the spacious Forbes Field outfield. He recorded a career .983 fielding percentage at that position.

He (2,459) and his older brother Paul (3,152) hold the career record for hits by brothers (5,611), outpacing the three Alou brothers and the three DiMaggio brothers, among others. For most of the period from 1927 to 1940, Paul patrolled right field at Forbes Field while Lloyd covered the ground next to him in center. On September 15, 1938, the brothers hit back-to-back home runs against Cliff Melton of the New York Giants.

Paul was known as &quot;Big Poison&quot; and Lloyd as &quot;Little Poison&quot;. They got their nicknames from a Brooklyn Dodgers fan&#x27;s pronunciation of &quot;Big Person&quot; and &quot;Little Person&quot;, which was then picked up by a sportswriter in the stands. In 1927, the season the brothers accumulated 460 hits, the fan is said to have remarked, &quot;Them Waners! It&#x27;s always the little poison on thoid (third) and the big poison on foist (first)!&quot;

==Later life==

After retiring as a player, Waner was a scout for Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1949. He filled the same role with the Baltimore Orioles in 1955. He worked for the city of Oklahoma City between 1950 and 1967. Lloyd and Paul Waner both struggled with alcohol abuse. Lloyd Waner Jr. said that while Paul &quot;drank like a fish when he was playing ball&quot;, Lloyd&#x27;s drinking intensified after his playing career was over. Lloyd Jr. said that the brothers would have been better known and would have enjoyed their later lives more were it not for alcohol.

In 1950, Lloyd and Paul Waner lost their older brother, Ralph Waner, when he was fatally shot by his ex-wife Marie. Ralph had been eating a steak dinner with his girlfriend when Marie came into the restaurant. Ralph and Marie both became angry. As they started to walk outside, Marie pulled out a gun. Ralph was shot twice, then struggled for the weapon. It went off one more time, injuring Marie. Ralph died a short time later. Ralph had held numerous roles in organized baseball in Pennsylvania.

Waner was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967. Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Waner as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor. Possible reasons for his selection include his brother being a fellow inductee and the inflated batting averages of his era, which helped many players from the 1920s and 1930s in the eyes of the Veterans Committee.

Late in Waner&#x27;s life, writer Donald Honig asked him about a previous quote in which Waner said that he would have played baseball for free. &quot;I think I would have asked for expenses&quot;, Waner reflected. Lloyd gave up drinking in the last four or five years of his life and Lloyd Jr. said that &quot;it was like having a real father around... I&#x27;ll always treasure that period.&quot; In 1982, Waner died of complications related to emphysema. He was survived by his wife Frances and his two children.

<text>A Doctor of Medicine (abbreviated M.D., from the Latin ) is a medical degree, the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In the United States, and some other countries, the &quot;M.D.&quot; denotes a professional degree of physician. This generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland, which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) was used: in the 19th century, it became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate, honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree (Bachelor&#x27;s/Master&#x27;s/Doctoral) in medicine. In those countries, the equivalent professional degree to the North American, and some others&#x27; usage of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery.

==History==
The first medical degrees were awarded by the Schola Medica Salernitana around the year 1000, including to women such as Trota of Salerno. The degrees received legal sanction in 1137 by Roger II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Federico II, in the Constitution of Melfi. In the titles XLIV-LXXXIX of the third book of the Constitutions of 1231, it was established that the activity of a physician (&quot;medicus&quot;) could only be carried out by physicians holding a medical degree, the &quot;Licentia Medendi&quot; (license to practice medicine), by the Schola Medica Salernitana (the only school in the kingdom authorized to award degrees in medicine). This degree was awarded after a curriculum composed of three years of study of logic, five years of medical studies, an examination of a commission composed of the professors of the university, a one-year apprenticeship with an expert doctor, and a final examination before the commissioners of the Royal Curia and the Provincial Curias.

In 1703, the University of Glasgow&#x27;s first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine.

University medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the M.D., until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began granting the M.D. title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York (which at the time was referred to as King&#x27;s College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree instead of the MB.

Early medical schools in North America that granted the Doctor of Medicine degrees were Columbia, Penn, Harvard, Maryland, and McGill. These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland.

In most countries having a Doctor of Medicine degree does not mean that the individual will be allowed to practice medicine. Typically a physician must go through a year of general medical education in a hospital as an intern and then a residency for at least three years in a specific field of medicine and then take some form of licensing examination in their jurisdiction.

A feminine form, &quot;Doctress of Medicine&quot; or &quot;Medicinae Doctrix&quot;, was also used by the New England Female Medical College in Boston in the 1860s.

==By country==

===Professional degrees===
==== Afghanistan ====
In Afghanistan, medical education begins after high school. No pre-medicine courses or bachelor&#x27;s degree is required. Eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam held every year throughout the country. Entry to medical school is competitive, and only students with the highest ranks are accepted into medical programs. The primary medical degree is completed in 7 years. According to the new medical curriculum (from 2016), during the 12th semester, medical students must complete research on a medical topic and provide a thesis as part of their training. Students have also a one-year compulsory internship which has to be completed in a teaching hospital. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, regarded as &quot;MD&quot; and validated by the &quot;Ministry of Higher Education of Afghanistan&quot;. All physicians are to obtain licensing and a medical council registration number from the &quot;Ministry of Public Health&quot; before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. After graduation, students may complete residency.

The MD specification:
Before the civil wars in Afghanistan, medical education used to be taught by foreign professors or Afghan professors who studied medical education abroad. The Kabul medical institute certified the students as &quot;Master of Medicine&quot;. After the civil wars, medical education changed extensively, and the MD certification has been reduced to &quot;Medicine Bachelor&quot;.

====Argentina====
In Argentina, the First Degree of Physician or Physician Diplomate () is equivalent to the North American MD Degree with six years of intensive studies followed by usually three or four years of residency as a major specialty in a particular empiric field, consisting of internships, social services and sporadic research. Only by holding a Medical Title can the postgraduate student apply for the Doctor degree through a doctorate in medicine program approved by the .

====Australia====

Historically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their higher or honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorized as Level 7 Bachelor&#x27;s degrees together with other undergraduate programs.

The latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master&#x27;s (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term &#x27;Doctor&#x27; in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master&#x27;s level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).

Australian National University offers a Doctor of Medicine and Surgery (MChD, abbreviated from Medicinae ac Chirurgiae Doctoranda) which is also a 4-year extended master&#x27;s degree that qualifies graduates to be medical practitioners or work as surgeons.

====Austria====
In Austria, medical studies (medicine or dentistry) take six years full-time. In medicine, the first two years comprise basic fields of medicine such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, etc., the next three years consist of all medical fields in the narrower sense with frequent bedside training and medical traineeships while the sixth and last year is dedicated solely to working in a clinic. After this, a specific six-year training (e.g. in internal medicine, paediatrics, ENT, pathology) or four year (GP) can be started; without this training, working with patients is forbidden. There is no central placement test for said specialist training, only a board-registered spot as a resident/registrar is needed. As with all other studies in Austria, there is no tuition but compulsory students&#x27; insurance (approx €38 per year). A specific entrance exam (MedAT, Medizin-Aufnahmetest, medicine acceptance test) has to be taken but is open only once a year in summer; a fee of €110 has to be paid. In 2019, 16443 persons registered for the MedAT and 12960 took the test. 1.680 university places for both medicine and dentistry are offered each year with 95% of all places for EU citizens and 75% for applicants with an Austrian higher education entrance qualification/GCE A-levels. Many Germans who are denied studying in their home country try to study medicine in Austria; hence this quota was introduced and approved by the EU as most of them leave upon graduation.

The title of &quot;Doktor&quot; is granted to physicians (Dr. med. univ., Doctor medicinae universae, Dr. der gesamten Heilkunde = Dr. &quot;of the entire art of healing&quot;) and dentists (Dr. med. dent., Doctor medicinae dentinae), who do not possess doctorate degrees, but Master&#x27;s level 6 year-training, similar to the American MD or DDS. although they have to write a diploma thesis of approx. 50–100 pages. In former days the same title was connected to an official doctorate degree in connection with an older study regulation. The law has been changed in 2002. Some of which are published in peer-reviewed journals while others are not. A post-graduate research doctorate (Dr. scient. med., Dr. scientiae medicinae, or PhD) can be obtained after a three years post-graduate study at a medical university.

All doctors may be addressed as &quot;Doktor ______&quot;, and the title is usually contracted to &quot;Dr. ______&quot;. In many everyday-day settings in Austria, also outside the clinic, it is common to address medical doctors solely as &quot;Herr/Frau Doktor&quot; (Mr./Ms./Mrs. doctor) without any specific family name (especially in rural areas and small villages, and by older people), and they are often viewed as the &quot;real doctors&quot;. Among themselves, MDs do not use &quot;doctor&quot; as an appellation but just &quot;Herr Kollege/Frau Kollegin&quot; (Mr./Ms/Mrs. = &quot;dear&quot; colleague). Consistent use of &quot;Doktor&quot; when addressing another medical doctor is seen as confrontative and mockery.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, the medical degree awarded after six years of study is called &quot;Docteur en Médecine&quot; in the French-speaking part of the country and &quot;Master in de geneeskunde&quot; in Flanders. Physicians would then have to register with the Ordre des Médecins to practice medicine in the country. Physicians would then either have to do a three-year internship to become a general practitioner or up to 6 years to specialize.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the title of &quot;doktor medicine&quot; (abbreviated &quot;dr. med.&quot;) is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a Faculty of Medicine (&quot;medicinski fakultet&quot;) immediately after high school.

====Botswana====
In Botswana, the seven-year medical studies only begin after the completion of senior secondary education and obtaining enough points to qualify for admittance to the University of Botswana. Students pursuing science based or STEM careers i.e. medicine are admitted to a two-year Bsc course where they&#x27;ll be taught chemistry, Physics and Biology. Students who obtained extremely good grades at the end of this course are cherry picked to further their studies at the School of Medicine (A faculty of the university) if they wish to pursue a medical career. Standards are very high and admittance is strict with only about 50 students out of three to five thousand being able to qualify for medical studies.

Here, the students specialise, and choose which medical careers they&#x27;re going for. After doing so, students are placed in their respective classes; learning, studying and practicing their choice of medicine. Furthermore, it is in this school that they pursue an MBBS degree (Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery) for five years.

In these five years, the first two follow an integrated problem based learning approach. The last three years are clinically structured, providing an opportunity to practice in medical institutions and communities. An equivalent to residencies and internships in the medical western world.

After completion of their internships. They graduate and are honoured with an MBBS degree and a medical practitioner license. Those that wish to further their studies can do so in order to pursue PhDs and master&#x27;s degrees in medicine.

====Bulgaria====
At the end of the six-year medical programs from Bulgarian medical schools, medical students are awarded the academic degree Master/Magister in Medicine and the professional title Physician – Doctor of Medicine (MD / MA ).

====Cambodia====
After six years of general medical education (a foundation year plus five years), all students will graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc, ), equivalent to Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). This degree does not allow graduates to work independently as a physician, but it is possible for those who wish to continue to master&#x27;s degrees in other fields relating to medical sciences such as public health, epidemiology, biomedical science, and nutrition.

Medical graduates, who wish to be fully qualified as physicians or specialists must follow the process as below:

*General Practitioner&#x27;s (GP) course of nine years (BMedSc plus a two-year internship). Clinical rotation during the internship is modulated within four main disciplines (general medicine, surgery, gynecology, and pediatrics). The medical certification awarded is Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, ) – equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree [?].
*After graduating with BMedSc; any students who wish to enter a &#x27;Residency Training Program&#x27;, are required to sit for an Residency Entrance Exam. The duration of the programs takes four years after either BMedSc or MD (BMedSc or MD plus four years of specialization). Once the graduates have successfully defended their practical thesis, they are awarded the Diploma of Specialized Doctor (MD with specialization, ).

All medical graduates must complete a &#x27;Thesis Defense&#x27; and pass the National Exit Exam () to become either GPs or medical or surgical specialists. Last but importantly, those GPs or MDs have to register their name in the Cambodian Medical Committee (CMC) to receive the license to see patients, and pay for the registration every year.

====Canada====

In Canada, the M.D. is the degree required to practise medicine. Similar to the United States, students in Canada from English-speaking provinces must complete four years of a bachelor&#x27;s degree, then write the MCAT at which point they move into the typical four year medical school curriculum. As a practical matter, nearly all successful applicants have completed one or more degrees before admission to a Canadian medical school, although despite this it is, along with other first professional degrees, the Canadian M.D. is considered to be a bachelor&#x27;s degree-level qualification.

The notable exception is the French-speaking province of Quebec, where their special CEGEP post-secondary institutions do not grant a bachelor&#x27;s degree, but instead College Education Diplomas (DECs). Students typically enroll in a Science Program such as Health Science, Pure &amp; Applied, or Environmental (latter exclusive to CEGEP Dawson College) which lead into the Med-P qualifying year at Mcgill University or l&#x27;Université de Montréal, after which students complete the four-year curriculum similar to other provinces. Other Quebec universities such as the Université Laval and Université de Sherbrooke admit students possessing a DEC directly into the four-year program. This in total means the path to graduation from medical school is one to two years shorter for Quebec students (six or seven as opposed to eight).

Another exception is the availability of a 3-year medical school curriculum, offered at two medical schools in Canada, the McMaster University Medical School and the University of Calgary.

McGill University Faculty of Medicine is the only medical school in Canada that continues to award the M.D., C.M. degrees (abbreviated M.D.C.M.). M.D.C.M. is from the Latin &quot;Medicinae Doctorem et Chirurgiae Magistrum&quot; meaning &quot;Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery&quot;.

Upon graduation, students enter into a residency phase of training. Prior to obtaining an independent practicing license from a provincial regulatory body, students must complete the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination to obtain the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) qualification. and complete the specialty certifying exam from their respective college, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada for specialists and the College of Family Physicians of Canada for family physicians.

====Chile====
In Chile, medical education begins after graduating high-school, in public or private universities, which select candidates based on a national entrance exams (former University Selection Test, now in transition to a new selection test). Public universities and private universities cost around US$8,000–12,000 a year. In almost every university the career lasts for 7 years, the first two being basic sciences, then three years of preclinical studies, and ending with two years of supervised clinical practice (internship, or &quot;internado&quot;) both at hospitals and ambulatory centers. Upon graduation, students obtain the professional title &quot;Médico Cirujano&quot;, equivalent to Doctor of Medicine (MD). After graduation, in order to practise medicine in public establishments of primary or hospital care, every new physician must take the (National Exam of Medical Knowledge). The title enables the graduate to practice as a General Practitioner, and many of them may follow specialization studies in clinical or non-clinical fields. There is a national program of accreditation, mandatory to every Medicine School. In Chile, physicians receive the courtesy denomination of Doctor followed by their family name, even though in an academic environment the medical title is not accepted as an equivalent to PhDs; regardless, at community and family level, and in day-to-day activities, they are often viewed as &quot;real doctors&quot;.

====China====
In China, research universities offer the eight-year Doctor of Medicine program. In the meantime, the majority of primary medical training comes in the form of a 5-year Bachelor of Medicine degree, which includes 4 years of basic science, biomedical science and clinical science training (with short-term clerkship) and 1 years of full-time clerkship training. Graduates from such programs are eligible to sit for Medical Doctor License Examination in China providing they are working as resident physicians or surgeons in a hospital. Many of the young doctors do seek further training by entering a three-year Master of Medicine (clinical track) program or five-year Doctor of Medicine (clinical track). Some take a job/promotion after the three-year program and work for a number of years and then take on another three years of training to get the ultimate Doctor of Medicine degree.

====Croatia====
In Croatia, the title of &quot;doktor medicine&quot; (abbreviated &quot;dr. med.&quot;) is awarded to candidates who successfully completed six years of study in medicine and defended their graduate thesis (student&#x27;s original research in clinical / preclinical medicine or life sciences). The title is legally awarded only upon the successful thesis exam (thesis defence) in the presence of a board of senior researchers and candidate&#x27;s research mentor. It is not equivalent to &quot;doktor znanosti&quot; degree (&quot;doctor scientiae&quot;, abbreviated &quot;dr.sc.&quot;), which is equivalent to PhD.

====Cuba====
In Cuba, the title of &quot;Doctor en Medicina&quot; (Doctor of Medicine) is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a University of Medical Sciences after high school. Medicine was one of the four foundational careers of the first Cuban university named Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Jeronimo de La Habana (current University of Havana) founded in 1728.

====Czech Republic====
In the Czech Republic, students are awarded the title MUDr. (medicinae universae doctor in Latin) upon successfully passing set of State Examinations after six years of medical school composed of theoretical and clinical training.

====Dominican Republic====
In the Dominican Republic, it is known as &quot;Doctor en Medicina&quot; (Doctor in Medicine). In 1511 the Spanish Catholic church founded the first university of the Americas in Santo Domingo present capital of modern-day Dominican Republic and name it Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino (today Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo). In 1630 this university graduated the first medical doctors of the Americas and amongst the graduates some Native Americans included.

====Ecuador====
In Ecuador, medical school begins after graduating high-school. There are two options; applying to public or private universities. Both private and public university select their candidates based on entrance exams. Public universities are free while private universities cost around US$6,000–12,000 a year. In most universities, the career lasts for six years. After graduating, students obtain a degree of &quot;médico&quot; or &quot;médico cirujano&quot;, depending which one is offered by each university. Both degrees are equivalent to doctor of medicine (MD).

====Egypt====
In Egypt, the primary medical degree is Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBCh.), which is obtained after completion of six years of medical education and one year National Compulsory Internship Program. The Degree Doctor of Medicine (MD) is the highest academic medical degree in Egypt. It is a research degree obtained after the primary medical qualification (MBBCh.) and a master&#x27;s degree in a certain specialty in medicine. It usually requires coursework, clinical training and a thesis. The degree Doctor of Medicine allows for promotion to the level of &quot;Consultant Physician&quot; in a specific medical specialty.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, there is only one university, The University of Tartu, with programs in medicine and dentistry. The program in medicine lasts for six years, including a one-year clinical internship, and students are awarded &quot;Doctor of Medicine (MD)&quot; upon graduation. The degree is academically equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. After that, one can work either as a general practitioner or enter a residency program to become a specialized doctor. Residency usually lasts, depending on the field, three to five years, with surgical residencies usually being the longest (5 years).

====France====

After graduating from high school with a Baccalaureat, any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). Until 2018, at the end of the first year, an internal ranking examination took place at each of these universities in order to implement the &quot;numerus clausus&quot;. This ranking examination and the &quot;numerus clausus&quot; has since been abolished. First year consists primarily of theoretical classes such as biophysics and biochemistry, anatomy, ethics or histology. Passing first year is generally considered very challenging, requiring hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, prior to its 2019 merger with Paris Diderot University, the Université René Descartes welcomed about 2,000 students in the first year and only 300 after &quot;numerus clausus&quot;.

The second and third year are usually quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g., internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).

During their fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called &quot;externe&quot; (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the &quot;externe&quot; status is given beginning in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between three and four months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off a year.

At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The first student gets to choose first, then the second, etcetera. Usually, students work hard during the fifth and sixth years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During these years, actual practice at the hospital and in conjunction with some theoretical courses are meant to balance the training. Such externs&#x27; average wage stands between 100 and 300 euros a month.

After taking those ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid.

Towards the end of the medical program, French medical students are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis; however, unlike a PhD thesis, no original research is actually necessary to write an MD thesis. At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, ). Every new doctor must then proceed to a Diploma of Specialised Studies (DES, ) to mark their specialty. Some students may also receive a Diploma of Complementary Specialized Studies (DESC, ).

====Georgia====
In Georgia, medical universities in Georgia offer a six-year curriculum leading to award &quot;Doctor of Medicine (MD)&quot; &quot;Physician&quot; &quot;Medical Doctor (MD), a European medical degree which is valid throughout the world. Some of the reputed medical universities include Batumi State University, Tbilisi State Medical University, Akaki Tsereteli State University, Ilia State University and University of Georgia

====Germany====

After at least six years of medical school, the students graduate with a final federal medical exam &#x27;. Graduates receive their license to practice medicine and the professional title of physician (&#x27;). About 60% of them additionally obtain the academic degree Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.). The European Research Council ruled in 2010 that a medical doctorate alone is not considered equivalent to a PhD research degree for the purpose of selection for ERC Starting Grants, requiring additional evidence (e.g., proof of an appointment that requires doctoral equivalency, such as a post-doctoral fellowship) for the overall training to be considered equivalent to a PhD.

====Guyana====
In Guyana, Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree is awarded after the completion of four years or five years of study. Texila American University, Green Heart University, American International School of Medicine, Alexander American University, Lincoln American University provides medicine programs.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, after six years of medical school, which includes a sixth-year internship, students are awarded the degree of &#x27;okleveles orvosdoktor&#x27; (Doctor of Medicine) degrees.

====India====
In India, students join medical school directly after high school, and after 5.5 years i.e. 4.5 years of medical school plus 1 year of compulsory rotatory internship, students are awarded the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) degree. 
Admission to MBBS course is based on having a minimum qualifying score and the rank in the common entrance test NEET(UG) and reservation of seats for admission is based on caste, economically weaker section and other quotas. 
Admission to various specialties or Post-graduate courses require an M.B.B.S from an MCI-recognized institute and is based on common entrance tests i.e. INI-CET(PG) and NEET(PG). They are awarded corresponding degrees of MD or MS (Doctor of Medicine or Master of Surgery). In India MD or MS is equivalent to post graduation in medicine or surgery, those doctors are known as specialists. 
Further clinical and theoretical training leads to the Doctorate of Medicine (DM) or MCh (Master of Chirurgae), which is considered a PhD. equivalent, and those doctors are known as superspecialists, the exam involves preparing a thesis and defending it.
Basically, MD is needed for entrance to DM courses, it is a non-surgical branch.
For MCh, the requirement is MS, it is a surgical branch.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, the title of &quot;dokter&quot; (dr.) is awarded after 3.5–4 years of pre-clinical study (bachelor&#x27;s of medicine) and 1.5–2 years of clinical study in a university hospital (medical doctor profession program). After a medical student finishes at least five years of the programs, they need to take the &quot;Students&#x27; Proficiency Test in the Professional Medical Program&quot; (&quot;Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter&quot; or UKMPPD). If they pass the test, they can take the Hippocratic Oath and at then entitled to use &quot;Dokter&quot; (dr.) before their name. Note that &quot;dr.&quot; is used for medical graduates, while Dr. (or incorrectly DR. i.e. &quot;Doktor&quot;) is used for PhD holders. Then they need to take a year-long internship course in primary health care clinics (also known as Puskesmas) or primary hospitals to practice as a general practitioner under supervision of senior doctors.

Those who wished to further their study in a specialization can take a graduate course and will be entitled to use &quot;Specialist of ...&quot; after their name (e.g.: Sp.A for &quot;Spesialis Anak&quot; = Pediatrician). A graduate course of medicine is equal to a residency program. It requires candidates to study for four years followed by an internship in a hospital.

====Iran====
In Iran, Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or BSc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is competitive and only students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7–7.5 years. On the final years (last 1–2 years) medical students need to do a research on a medical topic and provide thesis as part of their trainings. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called &quot;Professional Doctorate in Medicine&quot; validated by the &quot;Ministry of Health and Medical Education&quot; of Iran. All physicians will obtain license and medical council registration number from the &quot;Medical Council of Iran&quot; before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications.

====Israel====
There are six university medical schools in Israel, including the Technion in Haifa, Ben Gurion University in Be&#x27;er Sheva, Tel Aviv University, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the medical school of the Bar-Ilan University in Safed, and Ariel University. They all follow the European 6-year model except Bar-Ilan University and Ariel University, which has a four-year program similar to the US system. However, as of 2009, Tel Aviv University has introduced a four-year program similar to the US system for students with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements of the various schools of medicine are very strict. Israeli students require a high school Baccalaureate average above 100 and psychometric examination grade over 740, which corresponds to the 99th percentile. Candidates achieving these demanding cognitive requirements are then selected according to their ranking in the Mor and Mirkam MMI personality tests. Approximately 30% of applicants pass the Mor and Mirkam tests and are accepted into medical school. The demand for medical education is strong and growing, and there is a lack of doctors in Israel. In the past, the Technion Medical School, Ben Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University Sackler Faculty of Medicine offered 4-year MD programs for American students who have American college degrees and have taken the MCAT interested in completing rigorous medical education in Israel before returning to the US or Canada, but have discontinued those programs to free up resources to train more Israeli doctors.

Following graduation from the 6-year or 4-year program, all graduates are required to do a 1-year internship to be licensed by the Ministry of Health and practice medicine professionally. Residency takes 4 (Internal Medicine, Family Medicine) to 7 (Neurosurgery) years.

====Italy====
In Italy, before the Bologna process, the degree of &quot;Dottore in Medicina e Chirurgia&quot; (literally &quot;Doctor in Medicine and Surgery&quot;, from the Latin Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae) is awarded after completion of at least six years of study and clinical training in a university and after the submission of a thesis, that consists of original research.

However, spurred by the Bologna process, a major reform instituted in 1999 to align University programmes with the more universal system of undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s degree) and postgraduate studies (master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees) and as such the degree of &#x27;Dottore in Medicina e Chirurgia&#x27; is no longer offered and was replaced with the &#x27;Laurea Magistrale in Medicina e Chirurgia&#x27; (Master of Medicine and Surgery). In this context, the new Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico in Medicina e Chirurgia is a six-year second cycle degree, equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree (360 ECTS credits) which can be earned in a six-year programme and requires a scientific research thesis. Consequently, the new medical degrees in Italy is considered to be equivalent to a Medical Doctor or Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) Master&#x27;s degree academically and legally.

====Latvia====
In Latvia, the duration of basic medical education is six years and leads to the Doctor of Medicine degree (ārsta grāds or M.D.). This degree is done full time and earns you 240 credits or 360 ECTS. The level acquired by this degree at the Latvian Qualifications Framework is similar to (EQF) level which is at is Level 7 and at the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) level is also Level 7. These levels indicate this qualification to be Masters level which is contrary to what North American M.D. is since it is considered a higher standing Bachelor or 1st Professional degree.

==== Lithuania ====
In Lithuania, the duration of basic medical education is six years and leads to the Doctor of Medicine degree (Aukštojo mokslo diplomas,
nurodantis suteiktą gydytojo kvalifikaciją or M.D.). This degree is considered a Masters of Health Science degree.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, there are two types of MDs, one being for a basic medical degree while the other being a doctoral degree, depending on the awarding universities. The basic medical degree MDs (Similar to the MBBS awarded by other local universities) are awarded by both private and public universities, mostly are trained as an undergraduate 5-year course, however, with the establishment of Perdana University, it became the first university in Malaysia to provide a 4-year graduate entry course.

Examples of universities in Malaysia offering the M.D degree are:
*University Sains Malaysia
*National University of Malaysia
*University Putra Malaysia
*Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman
*UCSI University

MDs are being awarded as a doctoral degree in public universities such as University of Malaya.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, the MD is a first professional degree in medicine. To be accepted in Philippine medical schools, one must have finished a college degree before one can proceed to have a medical education. It is attained by either completing a 4-year degree or a 5-year degree (with internship included) from an accredited institution private and public Medical School by the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges and the Commission on Higher Education. The MD degree does not permit the practice of medicine but qualifies the degree-holder to apply for registration to the Professional Regulatory Commission. Registration to the commission through completion of internship and examinations will grant the privilege of practicing medicine in the Philippines. Moreover, the licensed Physician has the option to proceed for medical specialization and the taking of diplomate board examinations conducted by the respective board of medical specialists in a particular field.

====Poland====
In Poland the title/professional degree of &quot;lekarz&quot; (abbreviated &quot;lek.&quot;), also the name of the profession (physician), is granted after completing a six-year medical program, study (students apply to it directly after graduating high school with matura) and is equivalent to magister, magister inżynier or magister sztuki (master). Many medical higher schools in Poland also offer medicine programs in English, which award the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. In contrast, a higher, doctoral academic research degree in medicine resembling a PhD is named &quot;doktor nauk medycznych&quot; (abbreviated &quot;dr n. med.&quot;) (Doctor of Medical Sciences), or even higher scientific degree after habilitation, &quot;doktor habilitowany nauk medycznych&quot; (dr hab. n. med.) (can be treated as doctor of science). Specialization is valued similarly to a specialization in the English system. It is not a pre-requisite for a &quot;dr n. med.&quot; or &quot;dr hab. n. med.&quot; which are an academic/scientific, not a professional titles in Poland.

====Romania====
Romanian medical programs last for six years (including clinical practice), which is the long-cycle first professional degree and concludes with a final licensing examination (licența), based on the dissertation of the student&#x27;s original research. The degree awarded is &#x27;Doctor-Medic&#x27; and graduates are entitled to use the title &quot;Dr.&quot;

====Russia====

Medical universities in Russia offer a six-year curriculum leading to award a professional graduate degree, called of &quot;specialist&quot; (Diploma of Specialist; in medicine, Diploma of Physician).

The title of Doctor of Medical Sciences (, &quot;doktor medicinskikh nauk&quot; abbreviated д. м. н.) is a higher research doctoral degree, which may be earned after the Candidate of Medical Sciences (the latter is informally regarded in Russia as equivalent to the Ph.D.).

====Serbia====
In Serbia, MD degree is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a School of Medicine immediately after high school, after which a six-month residency followed a national exam has to be completed in order to complete the degree.

====Singapore====
The American Duke University has a medical school based in Singapore (Duke-NUS Medical School), and follows the North-American model of styling its first professional degree &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; (&quot;MD&quot;), consid. By contrast, the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore confers &quot;MB BS&quot; as the first professional degree.

====Slovakia====
Slovakia&#x27;s medical education is offered at four medical schools in the country. Two of them are faculties of the Comenius UniversityJessenius School of Medicine in Martin,and there is a second medical school in Bratislava Slovak Medical University in Bratislava (SZU) while the fourth one is the Pavol Josef Šafarik University in Košice. Both the Jessenius School of Medicine and the Faculty of Medicine in Košice have several international students. The Jessenius School of Medicine has almost a thousand international students, most from Norway.

Admission to the medical schools is based on entrance examination that can be undergone once a year. The program is a six-year program in general medicine with a strictly preclinical and clinical division. The preclinical years are the two first, and are purely theoretical. They consist of subjects such as cell biology, genetics, biophysics, medical chemistry, anatomy, biochemistry, histology, embryology and so on. From the third year onwards, the study is integrated with practical learning at the faculty&#x27;s associated teaching hospital, including major multi-year subjects such internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, etc. In the sixth and final year, the student must pass four final state examinations and defend a self-composed thesis in order to graduate with a professional doctorate granting them the title of MUDr. for practicing in Slovakia or the Czech Republic or MD when practicing outside of Slovakia.

====Slovenia====
In Slovenia, the title of &quot;doktor medicine&quot; (abbreviated &quot;dr. med.&quot;) is awarded upon completion of six years of study at one of the two Slovenian Faculties of Medicine (&quot;medicinska fakulteta&quot;) in Ljubljana or Maribor. Studying at these faculties is only possible if the student has finished a gymnasium/grammar school (&quot;gimnazija&quot;) with a general diploma called &quot;splošna matura&quot;.

====South Africa====
Medical faculties attached to South African universities award the MBChB degree, except the University of the Witwatersrand, which stylises the degree as MBBCh. Excluding the University of the Free State (5 year program), medical school is 6 years in duration. Doctors are required to complete a 2-year internship program and one year of compulsory community service after medical school to register with the Health Professions Council of South Africa as an independent medical practitioner.

====South Korea====
In South Korea, there is a Medical Doctor (MD) license.

The medical educations in South Korea (Republic of Korea) are six or four years in duration, six-year courses starting right after high schools, and four-year course starting after four-year&#x27;s university education (to start the four-year course, the student needs a bachelor&#x27;s degree). The first two years in the six-year system is composed of basic sciences and liberal art courses.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, the MD is a first awarded professional degree that goes up and beyond the limits of upper education.

====Tanzania====

In Tanzania, MD is the first awarded degree and takes five years of medical school, plus a sixth-year internship, Students are awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD). The famous medical school in the country includes the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), the University of Dar es Salaam, Mbeya College of Health and Allied Sciences (UDSM - MCHAS), The University of Dodoma- School of Medicine and Dentistry (UDOM) and Catholic University of health and allied sciences (CUHAS)

After undergraduate studies, the students pursue residency termed Master of Medicine for 3, 4, or 5 years, depending on the specialty they are interested in. After that, the students are awarded a Master of Medicine degree, after which they can further go on to do superspecialities for two more years and after that do a fellowship.

====Thailand====
The Thai medical education follows the six-year European system, consisting of one year in basic-science, two years in pre-clinical training, and three years for clinical training. Upon graduation, all medical students must pass national medical licensing examinations and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, newly graduated doctors are under contract to spend a year of internship and two years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for any other residency positions or specialized training. The students will receive Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. However, the degree is equivalent to master&#x27;s degree in Thailand. Specialty training after the MD degree requires at least four–six years residency program in the training university hospitals and must pass the board examination. Board-certified specialized degree is equivalent to doctorate degree.

====Tunisia====

In Tunisia, education is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical school is a faculty of the University of Tunis. There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse and Monastir. Admission is bound to the success and score in the baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of six years. The first two years are medical theory (PCEM), containing all basic sciences related to medicine, and the last four years (DCEM) consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties. During these last four years, the student gets the status of &quot;Externe&quot;. The student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student&#x27;s knowledge in that particular specialty. After those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he has to write a doctoral thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of &quot;Docteur d&#x27;état en Medecine (MD)&quot;.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, the title of &quot;Tıp Doktoru&quot; (literally &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot;) is awarded upon completion of six years continuous study started with five years university education including three years basic sciences, two years clinical courses followed by one year of internship in university hospitals. The internal structure and methodology of training vary among universities; however vertical integration between basic and clinical sciences and horizontal integration between disciplines have become more prevalent approaches as well as student oriented practices. Regardless of the university, the whole program is equivalent to a combined degree of bachelors and masters, thus every students graduates with a master&#x27;s degree. The graduates, becoming Doctors of Medicine, are eligible to practice general medicine through state assigned slots, start residency training through a state exam called &quot;TUS&quot;(short for &quot;Tıpta Uzmanlık Sınavı&quot;), or apply for a PhD program in a relevant field.

====Ukraine====

In Ukraine, by 2018, graduates of the school with completed secondary education that have coped with the relevant exams (in the disciplines designated by these universities) in the nationwide system for assessing graduates&#x27; knowledge – EIT (, External independent testing) based on the rating – may be admitted to the Medical Universities.

Ukrainian medical universities offer a six-year curriculum, which should end with the passing of the State Complex Examination. The graduate receives the Diploma of the State Standard with the title &quot;Specialist Diploma&quot;, which specifies a specialty and qualification (for example, &quot;Physician&quot;), or &quot;Magister&#x27;s Diploma&quot; also of a state standard. After that, the graduate according to the rating division (at the university) is required to undergo a practical internship course (working as a doctor under the supervision of an experienced doctor) with a duration of two to three years, in the corresponding specialty. Successful completion of internship implies that an intern passes an examination on a specialty, including testing and receives a certificate of a specialist physician of the Ministry of Health, which is a formal permission for practical activity.

Thus, the American &quot;MD&quot; and the Ukrainian &quot;Physician&quot; have identical titles. On the other hand, the colloquial (not official terminology) Doctor of Medicine means that a Physician with a higher education successfully defended his thesis, after a two-year postgraduate course and corresponding term of research (Candidate of Medical Sciences before 2015, or Ph.D. after 2015 – until 2020), which is closer to the English system of degrees.

====United States====
In the United States, the M.D. awarded by medical schools is a professional doctorate and is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), an independent body sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American Medical Association (AMA). (as opposed to the Doctor of Philosophy degree which requires completion of novel research, a written dissertation of that research which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer reviewed journal, and an examination or defense of that dissertation). Although MDs are eligible to compete for and attain federal research grants in the United States and perform research it is contested that MD&#x27;s are qualified to do research due to their lack of training and experience in that field. 

In addition to the M.D., the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) is an equivalent professional doctoral degree for physicians and surgeons offered by medical schools in the United States. According to Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine, &quot;the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of M.D. physicians, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and certification.&quot;

Admission to medical school in the United States is highly competitive, and in the United States there were 21,869 matriculants to medical school out of 53,371 applicants (≈41%) in 2019. While some medical school admission policies do not require students to complete a four-year undergraduate degree (see admission criteria at Yale University, Emory University, Cornell University, University of Chicago, and others), the overwhelming majority of incoming medical students in the United States have completed a four-year undergraduate degree. They must also take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Before graduating from a medical school and being awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree, students are required to take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and the clinical knowledge Step 2 exam. As of 2020, the requirement of the Clinical Skills portion of the Step 2 exam was removed. The MD degree is typically earned in four years and is a professional doctoral degree. Following the awarding of the MD, physicians who wish to practice in the United States are required to complete at least one internship year (PGY-1) and pass the USMLE Step 3.

In order to receive board eligible or board accredited status in a specialty of medicine such as general surgery or internal medicine, physicians undergo additional specialized training in the form of a residency. Those who wish to further specialize in areas such as cardiology or infectious diseases then complete a fellowship. Depending upon the physician&#x27;s chosen field, residencies and fellowships involve an additional three to eight years of training after obtaining the MD. This can be lengthened with additional research years, which can last one, two, or more years.

Even though the M.D. is a professional degree and not a research doctorate (i.e., a Ph.D.), many holders of the M.D. degree conduct research and publish in journals during training and after graduation. Combined medical and research training is offered through programs granting an MD-PhD. The grade Doctor of Medical Research for physicians specialized in &quot;research&quot; work has become quite rare since the 1980s with the highly respected Ph.D. being more attractive nationally and globally. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through its Medical Scientist Training Program, funds M.D.-Ph.D. training programs at many universities. Some M.D.s choose a quasi-research career and receive funding from the NIH as well as other sources such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation do not include the M.D. or other professional doctorates among the degrees that are equivalent to research doctorates.

====Venezuela====
After graduating from high school in Venezuela students can apply for federal appointment to a six-year medical program within a university. Only Public Universities offer this degree in Venezuela. Any student can apply for federal appointment by Ministry of Higher Education. So that, the student is allowed to register at university and follow a medical program. This a six-year program divided within three cycles. First cycle: Theory and lectures (1–2), second cycle: pre-clinical training (3–4) and third cycle: clinical training (5–6).

First year consists mainly of theoretical classes. however there are practical experiences since first day in laboratories and institutes, such as biochemistry, anatomy which includes lectures and teaching sessions with cadavers in dissection tables, molecular biology, histology, embryology and many others general subjects.

The second year is mainly theoretical, although most teaching sessions take place in laboratories. After completing these years the student knows how the human body is and how it works. There is also a Medical Exercise demonstration which includes a guided visit to primary care centers during a complete semester or year-round depending on the university.

During the third year medical students start studying pharmacology, pathology, and physical examination. Passing successfully first, second, and the third year is commonly considered a filter, almost half of previously admitted students leave voluntarily.

The fourth-year medical students enter the field starting to visit hospitals and healthcare services. This is called Pre-Clinical Cycle were they acquire deep knowledge about clinical examination visiting specialized units such as Internal Medicine, Trauma and orthopedics, surgery, and gynecology and obstetrics. They start to be members of a medical team. Every morning at the hospital, plus one night shift per week, and lectures in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between four and six months and takes place in a different department.

The fifth and sixth years are very similar but this time they applied their previously earned clinical knowledge and skills starting to follow patients independently. At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a highly supervised medical practice examination in an unserved outpatient center or specialized hospital in order to earn the degree. During these years, there is training at the hospital almost exclusively. Very few theoretical courses are meant to balance the training. Once completed they earn a university degree and a title granted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as &quot;Medical Surgeon&quot; this is considered equivalent to a M.D degree.

There is also a five years program the &quot;Médico Integral Comunitario&quot; title and degree granted by newly created universities and headed by Cuban nationals from the Cuba – Venezuela cooperation agreements. This program has been subject of controversy in the country over the legitimacy of the Cuban doctors&#x27; licensure for teaching and practice medicine.

After graduation, recently graduated doctors acquire the right to use Dr. before their names but still must follow a one-year exercise in the countryside or a two years training in a specialized hospital. So that, They can be enabled to practice medicine with a full license in Venezuela and the right to work as a medical doctor, generally as a general practitioner (Artículo 8). That is the point from which they also start getting paid.

They can follow specialized studies which usually last between three or five years depending on specialization and furthermore a Doctorate degree for relevant research and a thesis, which usually take three or more years.

===Postgraduate clinical degrees===

====Bhutan====

In Bhutan, a medical doctor who completes four to five years of medical school is awarded with MBBS or Dr.title by their respective universities ( usually from universities in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and Bangladesh). Upon recognition by Bhutan Health and Medical council, they work as medical doctor in country. M.D title is usually given to those who completes three to four years of residency for specialised course like surgery, medicine pediatrics, etc.

====India====

The MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) degree represents the first (undergraduate) level of training required to be licensed as a physician (other degrees in alternative medicine are present like BAMS, BHMS, BSMS etc.) 
The MS or MD degree is a postgraduate degree, representative of speciality training. The equivalent training in the US or Canada would be the completion of a medical (post-graduate) degree. Eligibility for the MS or MD course is restricted to medical graduates holding the MBBS degree.

The MBBS course is for years, and training imparted is as follows:

# Pre-clinical (Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry)
# Para-clinical (Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine)
# Clinical (Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, General Medicine, General Surgery, Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology; with speciality rotations such as Orthopaedics, Radiology, Pulmonary Medicine, Psychiatry, Dermatology, Anesthesiology and Dentistry)

After years of study and the successful completion of an examination, the candidate receives a Bachelor of Medicine &amp; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree.
A further 3-year course which includes both theoretical and practical elements, in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a non-surgical nature such as Physiology, Pharmacology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pathology, Psychiatry, Microbiology, results in the award of the MD (Doctor of Medicine) degree. 
Whereas in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a surgical nature (e.g. Anatomy, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Ophthalmology), the candidate gets a MS (Master of Surgery) degree, these are specialist or Post Graduate doctors.

The Doctor of Medicine awarded by Medical Universities in India and regulated by Medical Council of India are doctorate level qualification incorporating high level specialist clinical training, research and teaching. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in medical subjects is a research doctorate level qualification and could be done under supervision of a guide who is DM qualified from India (rather than PhD) and usually does not involve direct clinical work or teaching of scholars of that specialty. Scope for PhD in medical subjects is very limited in India as all faculty appointments mostly (except for some pre-clinical subjects) require a person to hold MD/MS in their respective specialties rather than a PhD.

A second alternate qualification termed DNB (Diplomate of National Board), is considered equivalent to the MD and MS degrees. However, the DNB is not awarded by Medical Universities and thus is not a doctorate level qualification. It can be obtained by passing the exam conducted by the National Board of Examinations after completing three years of post-MBBS residency training in teaching hospitals recognised by the board but not necessarily by the Medical Council. 
The College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons of Mumbai (established in 1912) also awards higher postgraduate qualifications in clinical and pre-clinical specialities, called FCPS (Fellowship of CPS); it involves three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, and a research thesis and a viva. The FCPS is representative of speciality clinical training, and equivalent to MD/MS/DNB/PhD Medical in Medical Doctorate in other parts of the world. Until 2007, the Government of India and the Medical Council of India recognised the FCPS qualification – since then, this is being done by State Medical Councils.

After obtaining the first postgraduate degree, that is MD/MS/FCPS/DNB/PhD Medical, one can go for further specialisation in medical or surgical fields. This involves a highly competitive entrance examination. This course has three years of additional training and requires the submission of a dissertation (thesis). 
This is also considered a clinical doctorate as the focus is on preparing a super-specialist with adequate clinical as well as research training. After the dissertation is approved and the exit examination (theory and practical) is cleared, the degree awarded is DM (Doctor of Medicine), (PhD Medical). 
Based on the specific field of training, the degree awarded is DM in Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiology, Neurology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Neuroradiology, Critical Care, Pulmonology, Hematology, Medical Oncology, Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology, Neonatology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Neuroanaesthesia, etc. 
For surgical superspecialities the degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae), like MCh in Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery etc. 
DM and MCh are the clinical equivalent of a doctorate degree.

A third alternate qualification is DNB (superspecialties), offered by National Board of Examinations, like DNB in Cardiology, Neurology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosurgery.

Following DM or MCh, one can also go for postdoctoral fellowship programs of one-year duration in specific subspecialties like Cardiac Electrophysiology, Invasive cardiology, Pediatric cardiology, Epilepsy, stroke, electroencephalography, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular surgery, skull base surgery, neurocritical care, pediatric cardiac surgery etc. offered by prestigious government institutes and abroad.

The National Board of Examinations also awards the DNB degree for six year integrated surgical courses in specialties of Neurosurgery, Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Pediatric Surgery and Plastic surgery. The residency period lasts six years post MBBS and thus alleviates the need to undergo a three-year residency in General Surgery.

====Pakistan====

In Pakistan MBBS is the undergraduate degree. The MD is a higher doctorate, awarded by medical universities based on successful completion of a residency program of four to six years&#x27; duration in a university hospital. Many universities are offering MD. Parallel to MD, MS is a higher doctorate awarded on successful completion of four to six years&#x27; duration of a residency program in surgical field.

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, the MD degree is a higher postgraduate degree that is awarded by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after completion of a postgraduate course, examinations and speciality training. The MD degree in Sri Lanka is representative of specialty training in clinical, para clinical, and preventive medicine (e.g., general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, oncology, para clinical such as microbiology, haematology and preventive such as community medicine). Entry for the MD course is open only for medical graduates holding the MBBS degree (with a duration of years), and training is obtained in medical disciplines that are non-surgical in nature (e.g., internal medicine, radiology, pathology, etc.) After three or four years of study and the successful completion of an examination with written as well as cases and via examinations, the MD degree in the respective field of study is awarded. In community medicine and medical administration, part I examination consists of a theoretical exam while the degree is conferred after completion of a thesis as a PhD. This thesis has to be completed within a period of five years. After successfully defending the academic thesis, the MD degree is conferred to the candidate. The MD degree holder is certified as a board certified specialist by the respective board of study of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after he or she undergoes two–four years of local and foreign training depending on the specialty/subspecialty selected.

===Research degrees===
====United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries====
The entry-level first professional degree in these countries for the practice of medicine is that of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, MB, MB BCh BAO, BMBS, MBBChir, or MBChB). This degree typically requires between four and six years of study and clinical training, and is equivalent to the North American MD degree. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, &quot;Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery&quot; and are abbreviated to MBChB, MBBS or BMBS.

In the UK, Ireland and many Commonwealth countries, as well as Hong Kong which continues to follow Commonwealth practices, the MD is a postgraduate research degree in medicine. At most universities, this takes the form of a first doctorate, analogous to the Ph.D., awarded upon submission of a thesis and a successful &quot;viva voce&quot;. The thesis may consist of new research undertaken on a full- or part-time basis, with much less supervision (in the UK) than for a Ph.D., or a portfolio of previously published work.

In order to be eligible to apply for an MD degree from a UK or Commonwealth University one must hold either a &quot;Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery&quot; (MBBS, MBChB, BMBS for example) degree, or an equivalent U.S.-MD degree and must usually have at least five years of postgraduate experience. Therefore, graduates from the MBBS/MBChB/BMBS degrees do not hold doctorates; however, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as &quot;doctor&quot; as they are fully licensed as medical practitioners. In some commonwealth nations, these interns are designated as &quot;house officers&quot;.

Traditionally, the MD in the UK and Commonwealth was a higher doctorate (similar to a DSc) awarded upon submission of a portfolio of published work representing a substantial contribution to medical research. Many universities have now changed its status, but this has happened only recently: for example, the University of Cambridge in 2012 introduced a new higher degree of MedScD (more akin to the ScD degree) awarded on the basis of a career&#x27;s contribution to the science or art of medicine, while redesignating the MD as an initial research doctorate awarded on the basis of a thesis. Oxford, which had changed the regulations for the MD degree to bring it more in line with initial doctorates in 2002, removed its status as a higher doctorate after a review in 2016. Some Commonwealth institutions retain the MD as a higher degree, such as the relatively new James Cook University.

In the case where the MD is awarded (either as a first or higher doctorate) for previously published research, the candidate is usually required to be either a graduate or a full-time member of staff, of several years&#x27; standing of the university in question.

===Equivalent degrees in other countries===
*In Belgian medical education, in the first three years, which are theoretical in nature and lead to a university bachelor&#x27;s degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the &quot;numerus clausus&quot;. After the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the &#x27;master in medicine&#x27; courses, which consist of three years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first two master years are theoretical and teach the students human pathology, diseases and pharmacology. The third year consists of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of &#x27;pre-specialization&#x27; year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school.
*In Bangladesh, the basic medical degree is the MBBS. After completing the intermediate level of education (12 years) the candidate must undergo 5 years of medical training in any medical college to achieve the MBBS degree. After obtaining the degree, the candidate needs to undergo one year of internship to obtain BMDC (Bangladesh medical and dental council) accreditation in order to practice in the country.
*In mainland China, some medical schools award MBBS to foreign students while all medical schools award Bachelor of Medicine to nationals. Some MD degrees are higher academic research degrees.
*In Colombia, the medicine faculties of the universities awards the title of &quot;Medico Cirujano&quot; after taking 12 semesters of studies on &quot;all clinic and surgery discipline a two semester on internship. After receiving the degree there is a mandatory year &quot;obliged social work&quot; were the doctors practice as GP in the countryside. Residency programs last between three–four years depends on the specialty.
*The Czech and Slovak title MUDr. (Medicinae Universae doctor or &quot;doktor medicíny&quot;) is a professional doctorate granted upon completion of six years pregraduate Master&#x27;s study at medical schools. The postgraduate academic research degree in medicine is a PhD degree.
*The Danish and Norwegian Candidatus medicinae or Candidata medicinae degrees (cand. med.) is awarded after completing a six-year medical programme, to which students apply directly upon finishing secondary school. The programme usually includes a small thesis. However, the cand. med. degree must not be confused with the previous Danish and Norwegian Dr. Med. degree, which is a separate degree from the Ph.D. and represents a higher degree of medical research experience. It typically consists of at least 5–6 original publications.
*In Finland, the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine.
*In Greece, after a six-year study, a medical student acquires his medical degree and the right to use &quot;Δρ.&quot;, (Dr.) before his name. This is considered equivalent to the MD title.
*In Kosovo, there are medical high schools. Students from elementary school can choose to attend the medical high school, which lasts three years. When they finish the three years of medical high school, they practice for 4 months. After that, they can be a nurse or they can go to medical facilities in Pristina, with the education there taking around six years, including practice, to become a doctor.
*In Mexico and Peru, schools of medicine award the &quot;Título de Médico Cirujano&quot; degree after completing either six or seven years of study. This curriculum includes a rotating internship year and a year of social service providing care to an underserved community.
*In Nepal, a MBBS degree is awarded. This is an undergraduate level degree, which is awarded after completion of years of medical school followed by one year of clinical internship. Most medical schools also offer postgraduate M.D and M.S. degrees, which requires three years of further training. Post-doctorate D.M. and M.Ch. terminal degrees are awarded by a few elite institutions after three more years of super-speciality training.
*In the Netherlands, medical students receive six years of university education prior to their graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance. Medical students receive three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training (&quot;co-assistentschappen&quot;, or &quot;co-schappen&quot;) in hospitals. At one medical faculty (Utrecht University), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After six years, students graduate as &quot;basisartsen&quot; (non-specialized physicians). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BSc) after successfully concluding three years of medical university curriculum, and a master&#x27;s degree (MSc) upon graduation. After graduation, physicians may choose to apply for and complete a research doctorate, earning them a PhD in Medicine. In international communication, Dutch medical graduates may identify themselves as MD. Whilst this title is neither officially awarded nor regulated in the Netherlands, its use is legally permitted.
*In Portugal, to practice medicine, a master&#x27;s degree in medicine (awarded after a six-year Integrated master&#x27;s program in medicine) is mandatory. Before the 2007 Bologna Process, the same course was only a Licentiate Degree. After the six-year program, students must go through the National Seriation Exam (&quot;Prova Nacional de Seriação&quot;), and then a year of General Medical Internship (&quot;Ano Comum&quot;). When the internship ends, the students are placed in their choice of Medical Specialty, according to their ranking in the aforementioned Exam and the vacancies available for each medical specialty. Only when each student finishes the Medical Internship, will they be allowed to practice medicine without supervision. Entry to the Integrated Masters Program in Medicine is done directly after high school, based on the student&#x27;s grade – each year there are about 1800 new Medical Students in Portugal, in eight different Medical Schools.
*In Sudan the awarded degree in most of the medical schools is, Bachelor of Medicine and Basic Surgery (MBBS). In schools that are based on the English system of medical teaching, the degree is granted after six years of studying. As for the schools that are adopting the American system, they grant their students the degree of MBBS in only five years.
*In Sweden, medical education begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program including the successful completion of examinations, which includes both theoretical and practical elements. Depending upon university, a research thesis must also be completed during this time. This leads to the degree &quot;Master of Science in Medicine&quot; (). Following this, the National Board of Health and Welfare requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship () before granting a medical license () to be fully qualified as the Swedish equivalent to Medical Doctor (MD). This internship consists of surgery (3–6 months), internal medicine (3–6 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognised medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training () has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.

===Other postgraduate clinical degrees===
There is also a similar advanced professional degree to the postgraduate MD: the Master of Surgery (usually ChM or MS, but MCh in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and at Oxford and MChir at Cambridge). The equivalence of these degrees, but their differing names, prevents the need for surgeons (addressed as Mr. in the UK) having to revert to the title Dr., which they once held as new MBBS graduates.

In Ireland, where the basic medical qualification includes a degree in obstetrics, there is a similar higher degree of Master of the Art of Obstetrics (MAO). A Master of Midwifery was formerly examined by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London (hence MMSA) but fell into abeyance in the 1960s; in this case, the term Master referred not to a university degree but rather a professional rank that is common among craft guilds.

In East Africa, the medical schools in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda award the degree of Master of Medicine (MMed) degree in both surgical and medical specialty disciplines following a three to six-year period of instruction. In Ethiopia students first finish high school then take a university entrance exam then based on their result (it is highly competitive) then start medical school. Recently, there is a further requirement to take another one year in university studying a common course and then take another exam to join medicine. After that the students begins studying preclinical medicine for three years studying anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, embryology, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and other minor courses of public health then at 4th year students join the clinical rotation ranging from physical examination and history taking to different specialities like internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics, and obstetrics and gynaecology for two years, and other minor specialities like psychiatry, ophthalmology, dermatology, ENT. After finishing these courses students take a qualification exam and become intern doctors for one year, before graduating as a general practitioner and serving two or more years in primary hospitals. They can then take a national residency exam, and pending good results, join their speciality.

In West Africa, the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons award the Fellowship of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP) and the Fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons (FWACS) in medical and surgical disciplines respectively after a minimum of four-year residency training period.

The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine or DO degree allows the same practice rights in the United States and Canada to the MD degree and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are fully licensed physicians. Holders of the MD degree must pass MD level board exams while DO holders can pass either the DO (COMLEX) exam or MD exam (USMLE). Similarly, MDs must attend MD rated residency and fellowship programs while DOs can attend either MD programs or Osteopathic (DO) programs. As a result of this, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) are currently transitioning to a single accreditation system for medical residencies in the U.S. The American MD degree is also recognized by most countries in the world, while DO physicians are only licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in approximately 50 countries, as of 2012, with partial rights in a number of other nations.

<text>Susan Avis Bailey Johanson (; July 29, 1930 – June 28, 2023) was a Canadian registered nurse and sex educator. She operated a birth control clinic in Toronto and hosted a series of radio and television programmes on birth control, safer sex and sexual health. She also published several books and wrote a newspaper column promoting sexual health.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Johanson was born Susan Avis Bailey Powell in Toronto, Ontario, in 1930 to Wilfrid Powell, a decorated British war hero, and an affluent Ontario-born Irish Protestant mother, Ethel Bell. Her mother died when Johanson was ten. Johanson attended nursing school in St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, graduating as a registered nurse. Soon after, she married a Swedish-Canadian electrician named Ejnor Johanson in 1953. They had three children: Carol, Eric, and Jane. The family moved to North York, where Johanson kept house and raised her children.

In 1970, Johanson opened a birth control clinic in Don Mills CI high school, the first of its kind in Canada. She worked there as a coordinator for 18 years. She continued her education at the Toronto Institute of Human Relations (a postgraduate course in counselling and communication), the University of Toronto (family planning), and the University of Michigan (human sexuality), graduating as a counsellor and sex educator.

===Radio and television programs===
Johanson first achieved popularity as a sex educator and therapist hosting her own show on rock radio station Q107 during the 1980s. The show, entitled &quot;Sunday Night Sex Show&quot;, transitioned into a TV talk show of the same name on the community television Rogers TV in 1985. In 1996, it became a national show on the Women&#x27;s Television Network (WTN) which ended in 2005.

In January 2002, reruns of the show began to be replayed to American audiences on Oxygen Media. The recorded program was very popular, but American viewers missed the opportunity to call in and ask their own questions. The U.S. version of &quot;Sunday Night Sex Show&quot;, called &quot;Talk Sex with Sue Johanson&quot;, produced especially for American audiences, debuted in November 2002 on Oxygen. 

On May 7, 2008, it was announced that the next Sunday night&#x27;s episode of the show would be its last, ending the show&#x27;s run after six seasons.

Johanson made appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

===Acting===
Johanson appeared in two episodes of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and two episodes of &quot;&quot;. She played Dr. Sally, a radio host and sex educator who served as an in-universe version of Johanson.

===Documentary===
A full-length documentary about Johanson was released in 2022. Entitled &quot;Sex with Sue&quot;, the documentary chronicles Johanson&#x27;s life story, directed by Canadian documentary filmmaker Lisa Rideout.

===Death===
Johanson died in Thornhill, Ontario, on June 28, 2023.

==Books==
Johanson was the author of three books: &quot;Talk Sex&quot; (), &quot;Sex Is Perfectly Natural but Not Naturally Perfect&quot; (), and &quot;Sex, Sex, and More Sex&quot; (). 

Johanson was also the author of a weekly column published in the Health section of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper.

==Awards and honours==
Johanson&#x27;s work educating and informing the public about birth control and sexual health earned her Canada&#x27;s second highest civilian honour after the Order of Merit, appointment to the Order of Canada as Member (CM) in 2001. In 2010, Johanson was presented with the Bonham Centre Award from the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies for her contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.

<doc id="428977" wikidata="Q146730" url="?curid=428977" title="Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 29 in B major, Op. 106 (known as the &quot;Große Sonate für das Hammerklavier&quot;, or more simply as the Hammerklavier) by Ludwig van Beethoven was composed in 1817 and published in 1818. The sonata is widely viewed as one of the most important works of the composer&#x27;s third period, a pivotal work between his third and late period, and among the greatest piano sonatas of all time. It is also considered to be Beethoven&#x27;s most technically challenging piano composition and one of the most demanding solo works in the classical piano repertoire. The first documented public performance was in 1836 by Franz Liszt in the Salle Érard in Paris to an enthusiastic review by Hector Berlioz.

==Background==
Prior to the creation of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata, the years between 1807 and 1812 were considered one of Beethoven&#x27;s most productive period. During that time, he composed four symphonies (Nos. 5 through 8), three piano sonatas (opp. 78–81a), the Piano Concerto No. 5, &quot;Emperor&quot;, the Mass in C major, and various chamber works. After this period, Beethoven&#x27;s output reduced drastically, although scholars disagree on when exactly this period of decreased activity began, with the date ranging from 1812 to 1816.
The earliest sketches for the sonata likely date from December 1817, although the original manuscript is now lost. Amongst the sketches for the first movement is an idea for an abandoned cantata for Archduke Rudolph, using the text &#x27;Vivat Rudolphus&#x27; and a melody resembling that of the &#x27;Hammerklavier&#x27; sonata. The sonata was planned from the beginning to be a tribute to Archduke Rudolph. This intention was confirmed in a letter dated 3 March 1819, in which Beethoven wrote that the sonata had long been &#x27;wholly intended in my heart&#x27; for the archduke. The process of its creation was considered the longest of any of his piano works, and it ushered in a period during which Beethoven composed several large-scale works including the Missa Solemnis, the Ninth Symphony, and the Diabelli Variations. Musicologist William Kinderman attributed this to his preoccupation with his nephew Karl van Beethoven, his health problems, and an increasing focus on each of his major new compositions, usually large-scale works.

The sonata was originally planned to be published in 1819 in Vienna and London with the support of Ferdinand Ries, Beethoven&#x27;s former pupil and friend who had arranged for a London edition to be published simultaneously as the planned Viennese edition by Artaria. The Vienna edition was published in October 1819, while the London edition appeared in December of the same year, with a dedication to Antonie Brentano instead of Archduke Rudolph of the Vienna edition. The London edition of the sonata was published in two parts: the first part has the first three movements with the second and third movement in reversed order, and the second part is the fourth movement. The reason for this rearrangement was purely economical, as Charles Rosen believed Beethoven&#x27;s sole concern for publishing the sonata in London was to obtain additional financial benefit.

The nickname &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;, which is German for the pianoforte, originated with Beethoven&#x27;s desire to use German terms to replace Italian terms in a &quot;burst of patriotic enthusiasm&quot;. In a letter to Sigmund Anton Steiner on 23 January 1817, Beethoven wrote: &quot;henceforth on all our works...instead of pianoforte Hammerklavier is used&quot;. Only the Sonata No. 28 in A major, Op. 101, and the Sonata No. 29 is published as &quot;für das Hammerklavier&quot; (&quot;for the piano&quot;), and over time the nickname has become associated with the latter.

== Structure ==

The piece contains four movements, a structure used by Beethoven in his earlier piano sonatas. However, the order of the inner movements are reversed, with the &quot;Scherzo&quot; placed before the &quot;Adagio sostenuto&quot;.

In addition to the thematic connections within the movements and the use of traditional Classical formal structures, Charles Rosen has described how much of the piece is organised around the motif of a descending third (major or minor). (Carl Reinecke had first remarked on this in 1897). This descending third is quite ubiquitous throughout the work but most clearly recognizable in the following sections: the opening fanfare of the Allegro; in the scherzo&#x27;s imitation of the aforementioned fanfare, as well as in its trio theme; in bar two of the adagio; and in the fugue in both its introductory bass octave-patterns and in the main subject, as the seven-note runs which end up on notes descended by thirds.

The &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; also set a precedent for the length of solo compositions (performances typically take about 40 to 45 minutes). While orchestral works such as symphonies and concerti had often contained movements of 15 or even 20 minutes for many years, few single movements in solo literature had a span such as the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;&#x27;s third movement.

=== Tempo ===
The sonata is the only sonata for which Beethoven provided metronome marks, given that the metronome had been patented by Johann Maelzel in 1815, and Beethoven was among the first composers to use the device. The metronome mark was given at the beginning of a letter to Ferdinand Ries, dated 16 April 1819, that states the tempo of 138 BPM on the half note for the first movement. This is considered so fast that it is routinely dismissed by performers based on theories that it was caused by a mistake from the composer, a faulty metronome, or Beethoven&#x27;s deafness. Suggestions for revisions have come from Felix Weingartner, Ignaz Moscheles and Paul Badura-Skoda.

=== I. Allegro ===
The first movement in B-major, marked Allegro, opens with a series of &quot;fortissimo&quot; B-major chords, which form much of the basis of the first subject. After the first subject is spun out for a while, the opening set of &quot;fortissimo&quot; chords are stated again, this time followed by a similar rhythm on the unexpected chord of D major. This ushers in the more lyrical second subject in the submediant (that is, a minor third below the tonic), G major. A third and final musical subject follows, which exemplifies the fundamental opposition of B and B in this movement through its chromatic alterations of the third scale degree. The exposition ends with a largely stepwise figure in the treble clef in a high register, while the left hand moves in an octave-outlining accompaniment in eighth notes.

The development section opens with a statement of this final figure, except with alterations from the major subdominant to the minor, which fluidly modulates to a fugue in E major. The fugato ends with a section featuring non-fugal imitation between registers, eventually resounding in repeated D-major chords. The final section of the development begins with a chromatic alteration of D to D. The music progresses to the alien key of B major, in which the third and first subjects of the exposition are played. The retransition is brought about by a sequence of rising intervals that get progressively higher, until the first theme is stated again in the home key of B, signalling the beginning of the recapitulation.

There is debate whether A or A should be played in measures 224-26, which is at the end of the development.

In keeping with Beethoven&#x27;s exploration of the potentials of sonata form, the recapitulation avoids a full harmonic return to B major until long after the return to the first theme. The coda repetitively cites motives from the opening statement over a shimmering pedal point and disappears into &quot;pianississimo&quot; until two &quot;fortissimo&quot; B major chords conclude the movement.

=== II. Scherzo: Assai vivace ===
The brief second movement includes a great variety of harmonic and thematic material. The scherzo&#x27;s theme – which Rosen calls a humorous form of the first movement&#x27;s first subject – is at once playful, lively, and pleasant. The scherzo, in B major, maintains the standard ternary form by repeating the sections an octave higher in the treble clef.

The trio in B minor, marked &quot;semplice&quot;, is in binary form. It borrows the opening theme from the composer&#x27;s Eroica symphony and places it in a minor key. Following this dark interlude, Beethoven inserts a more intense &quot;presto&quot; section in meter, still in B minor, which eventually segues back to the scherzo, marked &quot;dolce&quot;. After a varied reprise of the scherzo&#x27;s first section, a coda with a meter change to cut time follows. This coda plays with the semitonal relationship between B and B, and briefly returns to the first theme before dying away.

=== III. Adagio sostenuto ===
The slow movement is centred on F minor, which is a third interval down from the B major key of the first two movements. It is Beethoven&#x27;s longest slow movements (e.g. Wilhelm Kempff played for approximately 16 minutes and Christoph Eschenbach 25 minutes). The movement has been called, among other things, a &quot;mausoleum of collective sorrow&quot;, Paul Bekker called the movement &quot;the apotheosis of pain, of that deep sorrow for which there is no remedy, and which finds expression not in passionate outpourings, but in the immeasurable stillness of utter woe&quot;. Wilhelm Kempff described it as &quot;the most magnificent monologue Beethoven ever wrote&quot;.

Structurally, it follows traditional Classical-era sonata form, but the recapitulation of the main theme is varied to include extensive figurations in the right hand that anticipate some of the techniques of Romantic piano music. NPR&#x27;s Ted Libbey writes, &quot;An entire line of development in Romantic music—passing through Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, and even Liszt—springs from this music.&quot;

=== IV. Introduzione: Largo... Allegro – Fuga: Allegro risoluto ===
The movement begins with a slow introduction that serves to transition from the third movement. The transition is achieved by modulating from D major/B minor to G major/E minor to B major/G minor to A major, which modulates to B major for the fugue. Dominated by falling thirds in the bass line, the music three times pauses on a pedal and engages in speculative contrapuntal experimentation, in a manner foreshadowing the quotations from the first three movements of the Ninth Symphony in the opening of the fourth movement of that work.

After a final modulation to B major, the main substance of the movement appears: a three-voice fugue in meter. The subject of the fugue can be divided itself into three parts: a tenth leap followed by a trill to the tonic; a 7-note scale figure repeated descending by a third; and a tail semiquaver passage marked by many chromatic passing tones, whose development becomes the main source for the movement&#x27;s unique dissonance. Marked &quot;con alcune licenze&quot; (&quot;with some licenses&quot;), the fugue, one of Beethoven&#x27;s greatest contrapuntal achievements, as well as making tremendous demands on the performer, moves through a number of contrasting sections and includes a number of &quot;learned&quot; contrapuntal devices, often, and significantly, wielded with a dramatic fury and dissonance inimical to their conservative and academic associations. Some examples: augmentation of the fugue theme and countersubject in a &quot;sforzando&quot; &quot;marcato&quot; at bars 96–117, the massive stretto of the tenth leap and trill which follows, a contemplative episode beginning at bar 152 featuring the subject in retrograde, leading to an exploration of the theme in inversion at bar 209.

== Influence ==
The work was perceived as almost unplayable but was nevertheless seen as the summit of piano literature since its very first publication. Completed in 1818, it is often considered to be Beethoven&#x27;s most technically challenging piano composition and one of the most demanding solo works in the classical piano repertoire.

The Piano Sonata No. 1 in C, Op. 1 by Johannes Brahms opens with a fanfare similar to the fanfare heard at the start of the Hammerklavier sonata.

Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Piano Sonata in B major, Op. 106, is thought to have been influenced by the Hammerklavier sonata, although the shared Opus number is coincidental. Mendelssohn&#x27;s sonata has a similar opening fanfare in B major, with a secondary theme in G major. The sonata&#x27;s second movement is also a scherzo in , and its third movement contains a transition into the fourth.

=== Orchestration ===
The composer Felix Weingartner produced an orchestration of the sonata in 1930. In 1878, Friedrich Nietzsche had suggested such an orchestration:
In the lives of great artists, there are unfortunate contingencies which, for example, force the painter to sketch his most significant picture as only a fleeting thought, or which forced Beethoven to leave us only the unsatisfying piano reduction of a symphony in certain great piano sonatas (the great B-flat major). In such cases, the artist coming after should try to correct the great men&#x27;s lives after the fact; for example, a master of all orchestral effects would do so by restoring to life the symphony that had suffered an apparent pianistic death.

However, Charles Rosen considered attempts to orchestrate the work &quot;nonsensical&quot;.

<text>Michael Dwayne Vick (born June 26, 1980) is an American college football coach and former player who is the head football coach at Norfolk State University. He played quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, where he became the league&#x27;s first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and was the all-time leader in quarterback rushing yards at the time of his retirement. Vick played college football at Virginia Tech, where he won the Archie Griffin Award as a freshman, and was selected first overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL draft. During his six years with the Falcons, he was named to three Pro Bowls and led the team to two playoff runs, one division title, and an NFC Championship Game appearance.

Vick&#x27;s NFL career came to a halt in 2007 after he pleaded guilty for his involvement in a dog fighting ring and spent 21 months in federal prison. His arrest and subsequent conviction garnered Vick notoriety with the general public, which lasted throughout the rest of his career. He was released by the Falcons shortly before leaving prison.

After serving his sentence, Vick signed with the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2009 season. As a member of the Eagles for five years, he had his greatest statistical season and led the team to a division title in 2010, earning him Comeback Player of the Year and a fourth Pro Bowl selection. In his final two seasons, Vick played for the New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers, primarily as a backup. He officially retired in 2017 after spending the 2016 season as a free agent. After retiring as a player, Vick pursued a coaching career. He served as the offensive coordinator and advisor of the Atlanta Legends of Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019. Near the end of the 2024 season, Vick was named the head football coach at Norfolk State.

==Early life==
Vick was born in Newport News, Virginia, as the third of four children to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers. His mother worked two jobs, obtained public financial assistance and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter. They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their &quot;Vick&quot; surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city. Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; noted that &quot;not much [had] changed&quot; nearly a decade after Vick left. One resident said that there was drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many. In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News &quot;Daily Press&quot; that when he was 10 or 11, &quot;I would go fishing even if the fish weren&#x27;t biting, just to get away from the violence and stress of daily life in the projects.&quot;

Boddie&#x27;s employment required a great deal of travel, but he taught football skills to his two sons at an early age. Vick was only three years old when his father, nicknamed &quot;Bullet&quot; for his speed during his own playing days, began teaching him the fundamentals. Michael subsequently taught the game to his younger brother, Marcus Vick.

As he grew up, Vick went by the nickname &quot;Ookie&quot;, and learned about football from Aaron Brooks, a second cousin who was four years older. Vick and Brooks spent a lot of time at the local Boys and Girls Club.
&quot;Sports kept me off the streets,&quot; Vick told &quot;Sporting News&quot; magazine in an interview published April 9, 2001. &quot;It kept me from getting into what was going on, the bad stuff. Lots of guys I knew have had bad problems.&quot;

===High school career===
Vick first came to prominence while at Homer L. Ferguson High School in Newport News. As a freshman, he impressed many with his athletic ability; he threw for over 400 yards in a game that year. Ferguson High School was closed in 1996 as part of a Newport News Public Schools building modernization program. Vick, as a sophomore, and coach Tommy Reamon both moved to Warwick High School.

Vick was a three-year starter for the Warwick Raiders. Under Reamon&#x27;s coaching, he passed for 4,846 yards with 43 touchdowns. He added 1,048 yards and 18 scores on the ground. As a senior, he passed for 1,668 yards, accounting for 10 passing and as many rushing touchdowns. During one game, he ran for six touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns.

Reamon, who had helped guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Vick with his SATs and helped him and his family choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better guidance was available under Frank Beamer, who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school&#x27;s proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.

==College career==

===1999 season===
In his first collegiate game for Virginia Tech as a redshirt freshman, against James Madison in 1999, Vick scored three rushing touchdowns in just over one quarter of play. He performed a flip to score his last touchdown but landed awkwardly on his ankle, forcing him to miss the remainder of the game and all of the following game. During the season, Vick led a last-minute game-winning drive against West Virginia in the annual Black Diamond Trophy game. He led the Hokies to an 11–0 undefeated season and to the Bowl Championship Series national title game in the Nokia Sugar Bowl against Florida State. Although Virginia Tech lost 46–29, Vick brought the team back from a 21-point deficit to take a brief lead. During the season, Vick appeared on the cover of an &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; issue.

Vick led the NCAA in passing efficiency in 1999, a record for a freshman (180.4) and the third-highest all-time mark. Vick won both an ESPY Award as the nation&#x27;s top college player and the first-ever Archie Griffin Award as college football&#x27;s most valuable player. He won the Big East Offensive Player of the Year. He was invited to the 1999 Heisman Trophy presentation and finished third in the voting behind Ron Dayne and Joe Hamilton. Vick&#x27;s third-place finish matched the highest finish ever by a freshman up to that point, first set by Herschel Walker in 1980. 

===2000 season===
One highlight of Vick&#x27;s 2000 season was his career high rushing total of 210 yards against Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Against West Virginia University in the Black Diamond Trophy game, Vick accounted for 288 total yards of offense and two touchdowns in a 48–20 win. The following week, Vick led the Hokies back from a 14–0 deficit to beat Syracuse at the Carrier Dome, where the Hokies had not won since 1986. Vick put the game away with a 55-yard run with 1:34 left.

In the following game, against Pittsburgh, Vick was injured and had to miss the rest of the game. He also missed the game against Central Florida, and was unable to start against the Miami Hurricanes, who handed Virginia Tech their only loss of the season. Vick&#x27;s final game while playing for Virginia Tech was against the Clemson Tigers in the Toyota Gator Bowl; Virginia Tech won and Vick was named the game&#x27;s MVP. His football accomplishments in two seasons led to his induction in to the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 2017.

Vick finished sixth in Heisman Trophy voting for the 2000 season. Vick left Virginia Tech after his redshirt sophomore season. Aware that the rest of his family was still living in their three-bedroom apartment in the Ridley Circle Homes, Vick stated that he was going to buy his mother &quot;a home and a car.&quot; ESPN later reported that Vick used some of his NFL and endorsement earnings to buy his mother a brand-new house in an upscale section of Suffolk, Virginia.

Vick was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2025.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Atlanta Falcons===

At his Pro Day workout, Vick ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds; his time has been clocked as low as 4.25, the fastest-ever for an NFL quarterback. Vick was selected first in the 2001 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first African-American quarterback to be taken with the top pick. The San Diego Chargers had the number-one selection, but traded it to the Atlanta Falcons the day before the draft for the Falcons&#x27; first- and third-round picks in 2001. Vick was selected in the 30th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, despite not playing baseball since the eighth grade.

He signed a six-year $62 million contract.

====2001 season====
Vick made his NFL debut against the San Francisco 49ers on September 9, 2001, and saw limited action. He completed his first NFL pass to wide receiver Tony Martin in the second quarter against the Carolina Panthers on September 23 and scored his first NFL touchdown on a two-yard rush in the fourth quarter to help the Falcons to a 24–16 victory. Vick made his first start against the Dallas Cowboys on November 11 and threw his first touchdown pass to tight end Alge Crumpler in a 20–13 victory. He accounted for 234 of Atlanta&#x27;s 255 yards in the season finale against the St. Louis Rams on January 6, 2002. In two starts and eight total games played that season, Vick completed 50 of 113 passes for 785 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. He rushed 31 times for 289 yards (9.3 avg.) and one touchdown.

====2002 season====
Vick made 15 starts in 2002, missing one game against the New York Giants on October 13 with a sprained shoulder. He completed 231 of 421 passes for 2,936 yards and 16 touchdowns. He had 113 carries for 777 yards and eight rushing touchdowns. Vick set numerous single-game career highs during the season, including in passes completed, pass attempts, and passing yards. Vick also set a then-NFL record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game with 173 against the Minnesota Vikings on December 1, broken by Colin Kaepernick (181) in 2013. He tied for third in team history for the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in a season. He had a streak of 177 passes without an interception as the Falcons finished with a 9–6–1 win-loss-tie record and reached the playoffs. On January 4, 2003, Vick led the Falcons to an upset victory over the heavily favored Green Bay Packers 27–7 in the NFC Wild Card Round. The Falcons lost 20–6 to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Round the following week. Vick was named to his first Pro Bowl after the season.

====2003 season====
Vick suffered a fractured right fibula during a preseason game before the 2003 season against the Baltimore Ravens. He missed the first 11 games of the regular season, making his debut in week 13. Vick substituted for quarterback Doug Johnson during the third quarter in a game against the Houston Texans on November 30, completing 8 of 11 passes for 60 yards and rushing for 16 yards on three carries. He started his first game of the season against the Carolina Panthers on December 7 and amassed the third-highest rushing total by a quarterback in NFL history with 141 yards on 14 carries and one touchdown. The Falcons won the game 20–14 in overtime. Vick ended the season with a 21–14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 28 in which he completed 12 of 22 passes for 180 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.

====2004 season====
Vick returned to form in 2004, passing for 2,313 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He also added 902 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Falcons finished with an 11–5 record. On October 31, 2004, in a game against the Denver Broncos, he became the first quarterback to throw for more than 250 yards and rush for over 100 yards in the same game. Vick set an NFL postseason record for a quarterback with 119 rushing yards in the first round of the 2004 NFL playoffs; Atlanta beat the St. Louis Rams 47–17 in the Divisional Round, but lost the following week 27–10 to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship. Vick, whose single-season rushing total was the third-highest for a quarterback in NFL history, was named to his second Pro Bowl after leading Atlanta to their third division title at the end of the season. He signed a nine-year $130 million extension on December 23. Vick finished second in the NFL MVP voting earning one first place vote, preventing Peyton Manning to be a unanimous choice.

====2005 season====
Vick made his third Pro Bowl after the 2005 season, during which he passed for 2,412 yards and 16 touchdowns while rushing for 597 rushing yards and six touchdowns. The Falcons, however, finished with an 8–8 record and missed the playoffs.

====2006 season====

In 2006, Vick became the first quarterback to ever rush for over 1,000 yards in a single season. He also set a record by rushing for 8.4 yards per carry. Vick and teammate Warrick Dunn became the first quarterback-running back duo to each surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a single season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn/Vick 1,000 yards&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Vick&#x27;s record-setting season, the Falcons finished with a 7–9 record and again missed the playoffs.

===Suspension===
In August 2007, hours after Vick pleaded guilty to federal charges in the Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation, the NFL suspended him indefinitely without pay for violating its player conduct policy. In a letter to Vick, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the quarterback had admitted to conduct that was &quot;not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible.&quot; While Vick was technically a first-time offender under the league&#x27;s personal conduct policy, Goodell handed down a harsher suspension because Vick admitted he provided most of the money for the gambling side of the dog fighting operation. Goodell left open the possibility of reinstating Vick depending on how he cooperated with federal and state authorities. Goodell had barred Vick from reporting to training camp while the league conducted its own investigation into the matter. At his July 26 arraignment, the terms of his bail barred him from leaving Virginia before the November trial– effectively ending any realistic chance of Vick playing a down in 2007.

On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank said at a press conference that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick&#x27;s signing bonus. He said the team had no immediate plans to cut Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick&#x27;s involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons&#x27; contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.

In February 2009, the Falcons revealed that they were considering trading Vick to another NFL team. Atlanta general manager Thomas Dimitroff said NFL rules allowed teams to trade the contractual rights to suspended players. The Falcons released Vick in early June, however, making him an unrestricted free agent.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

After his release from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The prospect of his return to professional football was the subject of much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN&#x27;s John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking a chance on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa. He did think, however, that Vick would be &quot;unstoppable&quot; if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.

====2009 season====
Vick signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on August 13, 2009. The contract was worth $1.6 million, with no money guaranteed. It contained a team option for the 2010 season worth $5 million. Vick was allowed to participate in all team practices and meetings as well as the Eagles&#x27; last two preseason games. He was eligible to play in the third week of the regular season. Starting quarterback Donovan McNabb told reporters he gave coach Andy Reid the idea to sign Vick.

Vick was activated to the 53-man roster in mid-September and played sparingly for the rest of the season as McNabb&#x27;s backup. In week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons, Vick both threw and ran for a touchdown, his first scores since December 2006. Vick was voted by teammates as the winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in December. The award honors players who &quot;exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage&quot;. &quot;It means a great deal to me,&quot; Vick said at the time. &quot;I was voted unanimously by my teammates. They know what I&#x27;ve been through. I&#x27;ve been through a lot. It&#x27;s been great to come back and have an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys. I&#x27;m just ecstatic about that and I enjoy every day.&quot; The Eagles finished the season with an 11–5 record, making the playoffs. In the team&#x27;s NFC Wild Card Round game against the Dallas Cowboys on January 9, 2010, Vick threw the longest touchdown pass of his career to rookie Jeremy Maclin for a 76-yard touchdown. The Eagles lost the game 34–14.

====2010 season====
Reid named Donovan McNabb the Eagles&#x27; starter for the 2010 season, but McNabb was traded to the Washington Redskins and Kevin Kolb was named the starter. While relegated to a second-string role, Vick said he knew he could still play at a high level. Asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract, he said, &quot;I hope so...I feel like I&#x27;m probably better than I ever was in my career, as far as the mental aspect of the game.&quot; The Eagles exercised his option for 2010 in March and Vick received a $1.5 million roster bonus.

Reid named Vick the Eagles&#x27; starting quarterback on September 21 after Kolb suffered a concussion, and Vick performed well in his stead. In his second game as an Eagles starter versus the Jacksonville Jaguars, Vick led the Eagles to a 28–3 win, throwing for 291 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for another touchdown. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in a week 4 game against Washington, and was replaced by Kolb. Vick had passed for 49 yards with three carries for 17 yards in the game prior to the injury.

In a Week 10 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; matchup against the Washington Redskins on November 14, Vick passed for 333 yards and four touchdowns, while rushing for 80 yards and another two touchdowns. Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson on the first play from scrimmage in the game, and went on to help lead the Eagles to a 59–28 victory. Vick was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame asked for his game jersey to display after he became the first player to pass for three touchdowns and rush for two touchdowns in the first half of a game. In a game later in the season against the New York Giants, Vick led a fourth-quarter rally to erase a 21-point deficit. He accounted for three touchdowns to tie the game with under two minutes left. DeSean Jackson returned the Giants&#x27; last punt of the game for a touchdown to win the game for the Eagles as time expired. Vick earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Giants. Vick finished the season with 3,018 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and six interceptions with a passer rating of 100.2. He had 100 carries for 676 yards and nine touchdowns. Philadelphia finished with a 10–6 record in 2010 and made the playoffs, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers 21–16 in the Wild Card Round.

Vick made his fourth Pro Bowl after the season and was named the Eagles&#x27; starting quarterback. The &quot;Associated Press&quot; and &quot;Sporting News&quot; named him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He also won the Bert Bell Award on March 4, 2011. Vick finished second in the NFL Offensive Player of the Year with 11 first place votes and NFL MVP both awarded to Tom Brady who won MVP unanimously. In early 2011, the Eagles placed their franchise tag on Vick. He signed the one-year tender on March 2. On August 29, however, Vick and the Eagles announced they had agreed on a 6-year, $100 million contract with almost $40 million in guaranteed money. Vick was ranked 20th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.
====2011 season====
In Week 4, against the San Francisco 49ers, Vick had 416 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and one interception to go along with eight carries for 75 rushing yards. The final game of the season was a 34–10 victory on January 1, 2012, at home against Washington. Vick completed 24 of 39 passes for 335 yards and three touchdowns. In the 2011 season, Vick appeared in and started 13 games. He finished with 3,303 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, and 14 interceptions to go along with 76 carries for 589 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. Led by Vick, Philadelphia finished the 2011 season with an 8–8 record. The team began with a 4–8 record before winning four games in a row to finish the season.

====2012 season====
Vick came into week one of the 2012 season as the starter, despite a solid showing from rookie Nick Foles in the preseason. Vick led the Eagles to a 17–16 victory in week one against the Cleveland Browns despite throwing four interceptions. The Eagles won the following game against the Baltimore Ravens, but lost 27–6 in the third week of the season to the Arizona Cardinals. Facing former teammate Kevin Kolb, Vick completed only 17 of 37 passes with no touchdowns and two lost fumbles. The Eagles went on to beat the New York Giants, but then lost three straight games. After the third loss against the Atlanta Falcons on October 28, calls for coach Andy Reid to replace Vick with Foles intensified. Reid refused to make the move.

The Eagles lost another game against the New Orleans Saints, and Vick remained the starting quarterback for a week 10 game against the Dallas Cowboys. Vick was injured in that game, which the Eagles lost, and was replaced by Foles. On December 3, after Vick had already been sidelined for three weeks, Reid officially named Foles the starter for the remainder of the season. After a Foles injury in week 16, Vick was named the starter for the season finale against the Giants in New York. Vick went 19 of 35 for 197 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, and also ran five times for 25 yards. The Eagles, however, lost the game 42–7, to end the season with a 1–5 division record and 4–12 overall record.

====2013 season====
On February 11, 2013, the Eagles and Vick agreed on a one-year restructured contract worth up to $10 million. New head coach Chip Kelly announced that Vick, Foles, and rookie Matt Barkley would compete for the starting job. After a stellar preseason, Vick was able to reclaim his starting job from Foles, who was named Vick&#x27;s backup.

Vick started out well, winning his first game against Washington and throwing his first career 400-yard game in a close loss to the San Diego Chargers, with four passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns, and no interceptions in the two-game stretch. After that, Vick suffered losses against the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos, where he threw for one touchdown and three interceptions in that stretch (all three were thrown against Kansas City). In a game against the New York Giants, Vick was 6 of 14 for 105 yards, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Nick Foles played stellar in his place, going 8–2 as starter, while throwing 27 touchdowns and only two interceptions with a 119.0 passer rating. Vick saw his only playing time in a 15–7 loss to the Giants, where he was 6 of 9 for 30 yards and an interception, but he again suffered an injury, this time to his quadriceps, and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley, who played even worse. Foles returned the following week, and Vick spent the rest of the season as the backup, making only one more appearance in a blowout win over the Chicago Bears.

===New York Jets===
Vick signed a one-year $5 million contract with the New York Jets on March 21, 2014, the same day the Jets released Mark Sanchez. The Eagles signed Sanchez one week later.

Vick chose to wear #8 as a tribute to Steve Young, although several days later he decided to change it to No. 1, as #7 was already taken by Geno Smith. Vick became the first quarterback in franchise history to wear the number. During Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers, Vick came in relief of a struggling Geno Smith following halftime and finished the game with 47 passing yards as the Jets were shut out by the Chargers, 31–0. After seven consecutive losses, Rex Ryan named Vick the starter over Smith for the Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Vick became the first quarterback to reach 6,000 rushing yards during Week 10 in a 20–13 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was one of three games that Vick started for the season.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
On August 25, 2015, Vick signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers worth $970,000.

His signing by the Steelers caused a social media backlash by many fans, with some saying that they would never support the team again. Those who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Ben Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn&#x27;t proven himself following his release from prison.

In Week 3, Vick was brought into action against the St. Louis Rams after Roethlisberger sustained a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. In five weeks, Vick went 40 for 66 with two touchdowns and one interception, also rushing for 99 yards on 20 attempts. Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals and was replaced by Landry Jones. Vick would miss six games, and Roethlisberger eventually returned to his starting role. Vick would be inactive the remainder of the season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick&#x27;s playing career may be over.

===Retirement===
In 2016, Vick announced he would play one more season in the NFL. However, after not signing with a team all season, he officially announced his retirement from professional football on February 3, 2017. On June 12, 2017, Vick retired as an Atlanta Falcon.

===Post-NFL career===
On June 28, 2017, Vick began participating in the newly formed American Flag Football League, serving as captain of Team Vick. The following year, he captained the Roadrunners, who ultimately lost to Chad Johnson&#x27;s team in the AFFL semifinal 26–13.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Coaching career==
===Early career===
During their 2017 training camp, Vick joined his former coach Andy Reid as a coaching intern with the Kansas City Chiefs after stating his previous interest in coaching. After the Chiefs concluded their 2017 training camp, he became an NFL analyst on &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot; on FS1.

===Atlanta Legends===
On April 25, 2018, Vick was hired as offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Legends of the Alliance of American Football. Vick said, regarding becoming a coach, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I ever wanted to coach but talking about the game at Fox, I get excited like I&#x27;m out there playing again. But, it&#x27;s still not touching individuals. When the opportunity came about, I felt like I could really make a difference and give back to the game. …Once I found out it was in Atlanta, I thought it was a home run.&quot; Shortly before the season began, head coach Kevin Coyle announced Vick would no longer serve as offensive coordinator, but would still remain with the team as a consultant.

===Norfolk State===
On December 20, 2024, Vick was named the 19th head football coach at Norfolk State University.

==Head coaching record==


==Legal issues==
===Early controversies===
Between his selection by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL Draft and early 2007, Vick was allegedly involved in several incidents:
* In early 2004, two men were arrested in Virginia for distributing marijuana. The truck they were driving was registered to Vick. Falcons coach Dan Reeves said he lectured Vick at that time on the importance of reputation, choosing the right friends, and staying out of trouble for the good of his team.
* On October 10, 2004, Vick and other members of his entourage, including employee Quanis Phillips, were at Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield International Airport on their way to board an AirTran flight. While they were passing through a security checkpoint, a security camera caught Phillips and Todd Harris picking up an expensive-appearing watch which belonged to Alvin Spencer, a security screener. After watching the theft on a videotape, Spencer filed a police report. He claimed that Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson, known as the Falcons&#x27; &quot;fixer&quot;, interfered with the investigation. Although Vick&#x27;s representatives declined to make him available for an Atlanta police inquiry, Spencer got the watch back six days later.
* In March 2005, Sonya Elliott filed a civil lawsuit against Vick alleging she contracted genital herpes from him in the autumn of 2002 and that he failed to inform her that he had the disease. Elliot further alleged that Vick had visited clinics under the alias &quot;Ron Mexico&quot; to get treatments and thus knew of his condition. On April 24, 2006, Vick&#x27;s attorney, Lawrence Woodward, revealed that the lawsuit had been settled out of court under undisclosed terms. Many fans bought custom jerseys from NFL.com with Vick&#x27;s #7 and the name &quot;MEXICO&quot; on the back. The NFL later banned customizing jerseys with the name Mexico.
* After a loss to the New Orleans Saints on November 26, 2006, in the Georgia Dome, Vick made an obscene gesture at fans in an apparent reaction to booing, holding up both hands with the middle finger extended. He was fined $10,000 by the NFL and agreed to donate another $10,000 to charity.
* Vick surrendered a water bottle that had a hidden compartment to security personnel at Miami International Airport on January 17, 2007. &quot;The compartment was hidden by the bottle&#x27;s label so that it appeared to be a full bottle of water when held upright,&quot; police said. Test results indicated there were no illegal substances in the water bottle and Vick was cleared of any wrongdoing. Vick announced that the water bottle was a jewelry stash box, and that the substance in question had been jewelry.
* On April 24, 2007, Vick was scheduled to lobby on Capitol Hill, hoping to persuade lawmakers to increase funding for after-school programs. Vick missed a connecting flight in Atlanta on Monday to Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. He failed to show up for another seat booked for him later that evening. On Tuesday morning, he did not attend his scheduled appearance at a congressional breakfast where he was to be honored for his foundation&#x27;s work with after-school projects in Georgia and Virginia. Vick&#x27;s mother, Brenda, accepted the award from the Afterschool Alliance. These events occurred the day before the search warrant on Vick&#x27;s property which led to Vick&#x27;s eventual prosecution for dogfighting activities.
* In 2007, Vick&#x27;s father, Michael Boddie, made statements about possible dogfighting activities in 2001. Boddie told the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that around 2001, Vick was staging dogfights in the garage of the family&#x27;s home in Newport News and kept fighting dogs in the family&#x27;s backyard, including injured ones that the father nursed back to health. Boddie said his son had been urged to not engage in the activity, but continued. &quot;This is Mike&#x27;s thing,&quot; he said. &quot;And he knows it.&quot; Within days, Vick&#x27;s mother, Brenda Vick Boddie, told the &quot;Newport News Daily Press&quot; that &quot;There was no dogfighting. There were no cages.&quot;

===Dog fighting===
A search warrant executed on April 25, 2007, as part of a drug investigation of Vick&#x27;s cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.

===Federal prosecution and conviction===

In July 2007, Vick and three other men were indicted on federal felony charges of operating an unlawful interstate dog fighting venture known as &quot;Bad Newz Kennels&quot;. Vick was accused of financing the operation, directly participating in dog fights and executions, and personally handling thousands of dollars in related gambling activities. Federal prosecutors indicated they intended to proceed under the provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization.

By August 20, Vick and the other three co-defendants agreed to separate plea bargains for the federal charges. They were expected to each receive federal prison sentences of between one and five years. Four days later, Vick filed plea documents with the federal court. He pleaded guilty to &quot;Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture&quot;. Vick admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation, and to participating directly in several dog fights in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina. He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights. He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well. Vick also admitted to taking part in the killings of 6–8 dogs, by hanging, beating, and drowning. The &quot;victimization and killing of pit bulls&quot; was considered an aggravating circumstance, allowing prosecutors to exceed the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge. Vick denied placing any side bets on the dogfights. On August 27, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson accepted Vick&#x27;s guilty plea, but reminded Vick that he (Hudson) was under no obligation to accept the prosecution&#x27;s recommendation of a reduced sentence.

While free on bail, Vick tested positive for marijuana in a random drug test. This was a violation of the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing in federal court. Vick&#x27;s positive urine sample was submitted on September 13, 2007, according to a document filed by a federal probation officer on September 26. As a result, Hudson ordered Vick confined to his Hampton, Virginia home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring until his court hearing date in December. He was ordered to submit to random drug testing.

In November, Vick turned himself in early to begin accruing time-served credit against his likely federal prison sentence. He was held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions. On December 10, Vick appeared in U.S. District Court in Richmond for sentencing. Judge Hudson said he was &quot;convinced that it was not a momentary lack of judgment&quot; on Vick&#x27;s part, and that Vick was a &quot;full partner&quot; in the dog fighting ring, and he was sentenced to serve 23 months in federal prison. Hudson noted that despite Vick&#x27;s claim to have accepted responsibility for his actions, his failure to cooperate fully with federal officials, coupled with a failed drug test and a failed polygraph, showed that he had not taken full responsibility for &quot;promoting, funding and facilitating this cruel and inhumane sporting activity&quot;. Vick was assigned to Federal Correctional Institution, Leavenworth, to serve his sentence.

At the request of federal authorities before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, most of which were being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. Experts said some of the animals would require special care for the rest of their lives. During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.

===State prosecution and sentencing===
Separate Virginia charges against all four defendants in the dog-fighting case were brought following indictments by the Surry County grand jury when it met on September 25, 2007. The principal evidence considered was sworn statements of the defendants during their plea agreement process before the federal court. Vick was charged with two class-6 felonies, which each carried a maximum penalty of five years&#x27; imprisonment.

Citing the high costs and transportation logistics of proceeding while Vick was still in federal prison, state prosecutor Gerald Poindexter decided to postpone Vick&#x27;s trial in Surry County Circuit Court until after Vick&#x27;s release from federal custody. Vick&#x27;s attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner. On October 14, 2008, Vick&#x27;s attorney Lawrence Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts. Vick planned to plead guilty to state charges in an effort to get early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house. The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied, but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses.

Vick was transported to Virginia in November 2008 to face the state charges. He appeared before the Surry County Circuit Court on November 25 at a session held in neighboring Sussex County because the Surry court building was undergoing renovation. He submitted a guilty plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dog fighting, receiving a 3-year prison sentence suspended on condition of good behavior, and a $2,500 fine. In return for the plea agreement, the other charge was dropped. Michael Dwayne Vick, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) ID# 33765-183, was released on July 20, 2009.

===Political activity===
In 2011, Vick lobbied for H.R. 2492, the Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act, which would have established federal misdemeanor penalties for spectators of illegal animal fighting and made it a felony for adults to bring children to fights.

===Financial troubles===
At the end of 2006, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine estimated Vick&#x27;s annual income between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR&#x27;s Dale Earnhardt Jr. in a listing of highest-earning athletes. Vick&#x27;s finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003 to 2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith&#x27;s plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $18.97 million in debt.

In 2006, a $45 million lawsuit was pending in a dispute with Vick&#x27;s original sports agents. Several lucrative endorsement deals soured.

After the dog fighting indictments were announced in July 2007, financial claims against Vick escalated. His financial affairs strained, Vick was unable to meet scheduled payments and other obligations. Within several months, he had been named in numerous lawsuits by banks and creditors for defaulting on loans, some of them related to business investments. The dog fighting property near Smithfield, Virginia, had been liquidated earlier, and in November 2007, Vick attempted to sell another of his homes.

In June 2008, when Vick&#x27;s brother, Marcus, was arrested and jailed in Norfolk after a police chase, he listed his residence as a $1.39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in Suffolk, Virginia. Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk. His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $30,000 a month to support seven friends and relatives, including his mother and brother, three children, and their mothers.

===Bankruptcy===
On July 7, 2008, Vick sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newport News after failing to &quot;work out consensual resolutions with each of his creditors,&quot; according to court papers. The initial filing, which was incomplete, listed assets of less than $50 million and debts of between $10 million and $50 million. The seven largest creditors without collateral backing their claims were owed a total of $12.8 million. The three biggest unsecured creditors were Joel Enterprises Inc., owed $4.5 million for breach of contract; Atlanta Falcons, owed $3.75 million for a pro-rated signing bonus; and Royal Bank of Canada, owed $2.5 million in loans.

====Major financial obligations====
Joel Enterprises of Richmond was listed as one of Vick&#x27;s larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a contract with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick&#x27;s name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel&#x27;s cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick&#x27;s NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.

The Atlanta Falcons sought to recover a portion of Vick&#x27;s $37 million 2004 signing bonus. A reduced amount of $20 million was awarded to the Falcons in binding legal arbitration, which Vick disputed. The sides agreed to reduce the amount to between $6.5 and $7.5 million. The bankruptcy court was advised of this Vick-Falcons settlement agreement on April 3, 2009.

On September 20, 2007, the Royal Bank of Canada filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Newport News against Vick for more than $2.3 million over a loan tied to real estate. The suit claimed Vick failed to meet a September 10 deadline to repay. On May 7, 2008, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Vick for default and breach of a promissory note and ordered him to pay the bank more than $2.5 million.

On September 26, 2007, 1st Source Bank, based in South Bend, Indiana, claimed damages of at least $2 million in a federal lawsuit, alleging Vick and Divine Seven LLC of Atlanta refused to pay for at least 130 vehicles acquired to be used as rental cars. The bank&#x27;s Specialty Financing Group provided financing for rental car fleets.

Wachovia Bank also filed a federal suit in October 2007 in Atlanta seeking about $940,000 from Vick and Gerald Frank Jenkins, a business partner. The bank claimed the two men and their business, Atlantic Wine &amp; Package LLC, defaulted on a May 2006 loan of $1.3 million to set up a wine shop and restaurant. Jenkins, a retired surgeon who owned Atlantic Wine since 2004, brought Vick in as an investor. In May 2008, the U.S. District Court in Atlanta granted a summary judgment in favor of Wachovia. The judgment of $1.11 million included the initial principal balance, interest accrued, fees, overdrawn accounts, and legal fees. The order provided that further interest could be accrued.

The United States Department of Labor filed another lawsuit in federal district court in Newport News on March 25, 2009, alleging Vick and others violated federal employee benefits laws by withdrawing $1.35 million from a retirement plan sponsored by MV7, one of Vick&#x27;s companies. The money was held in trust under pension laws to fund retirement plans for nine MV7 employees. The Labor Department simultaneously filed a complaint in federal bankruptcy court to prevent Vick from discharging his alleged debt to the MV7 pension plan. The complaint alleged that some of the funds were used to pay restitution ordered in his dogfighting case.

====Early proceedings====
In August 2008, trustee W. Clarkson McDow Jr. was appointed to manage Vick&#x27;s bankruptcy. The trustee noted in court documents that Vick &quot;has limited ability to arrange his finances and limited ability to participate in the bankruptcy case on an in-person basis.&quot; McDow wrote in court documents that it appeared Vick had &quot;routinely relied upon others to make financial decisions for him, giving them discretionary control over large sums of money&quot;. McDow named Mary Wong and David A. Talbot as people who had obtained broad written authority to act as his attorney-in-fact over all of his financial affairs.

Vick had hired Wong, a business manager in Omaha, Nebraska, in the fall of 2007 on the recommendation of Falcons teammate Demorrio Williams. Wong helped cash in some of Vick&#x27;s investments to provide restitution funds required by the federal court in his criminal case. According to a document filed by one of Vick&#x27;s attorneys, she used a power of attorney from Vick to &quot;wrongfully remove&quot; at least another $900,000 from his various accounts. Court papers also alleged Wong &quot;caused certain business entities owned by [Vick] to be transferred to her.&quot; Vick learned later that Wong had been permanently barred from working with any firm that traded on the New York Stock Exchange as the result of taking more than $150,000 from two elderly widows she met while working at Wells Fargo.

Vick next turned to Talbot, a medical school graduate from Hackensack, New Jersey who claimed to have expertise in financial management. Vick later told the court he met Talbot in April 2008 through his brother, Marcus. Talbot was to be paid $15,000 per month and took possession of one of Vick&#x27;s cars, an $85,000 Mercedes-Benz. Vick later discovered that Talbot&#x27;s résumé contained numerous false statements. Talbot had been accused of defrauding church members in New Jersey. The New Jersey Attorney General started legal action against Talbot for securities fraud over an alleged scheme to defraud investors of more than $500,000 by offering them &quot;asset enhancement contracts&quot; to be used to build a new church. U.S. bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro ordered that the Mercedes-Benz Vick gave Talbot be repossessed and sold, and that Talbot appear at a hearing on September 5.

Paul K. Campsen, one of Vick&#x27;s lawyers, told the court that Vick &quot;has supported his mother, brother, fiancée and his two children&quot; over the years. He said Vick&#x27;s financial problems included average monthly expenses of $12,225 for several large homes his family and friends were living in and a monthly income of just $277.69.

====Reorganization plan====
Vick&#x27;s attorneys filed a first plan of reorganization through bankruptcy on November 12, 2008. Under the plan, Vick was to sell three of his six homes. Vick&#x27;s expenses, meanwhile, included support payments of approximately $30,000 a month. They included $14,531 a month to his mother, $12,363 a month to his fiancée and two daughters, and $3,500 a month to his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor, with whom he had a child. Creditors challenged Vick&#x27;s spending plan given his loss of salary and suspension from the NFL. Vick&#x27;s attorneys told the judge on November 13 that Vick &quot;has every reason to believe that upon his release, he will be reinstated into the NFL, resume his career and be able to earn a substantial living.&quot;

After creditors objected to the initial reorganization plan, Vick appeared in person before Santoro at a hearing in Newport News on April 2, 2009. Santoro had decided not to allow testimony by video in March, saying he needed Vick in the courtroom to assess his demeanor and credibility. Vick testified that he intended to live a better life after prison. He said his crime was &quot;heinous&quot; and felt &quot;true remorse&quot;. Near the end of the hearing, Santoro rejected the plan as unsound, saying that it was too strongly predicated on Vick&#x27;s return to the NFL and the substantial projected income it would bring, neither of which was assured.

The judge commended Vick for trying to work out his financial mess after years of poor choices, but told Vick the numbers did not add up. Santoro adjourned the case and told Vick to work with his advisers to create a new plan, suggesting Vick begin by liquidating one or both of his Virginia homes, as well as three of the cars he intended to keep, and &quot;buy a house more within his means.&quot; Vick had testified that he felt obligated to provide for friends and family because of &quot;where he had come from.&quot; Santoro told Vick that while that was commendable, &quot;You cannot be everything to everybody. If you do, you&#x27;re going to be nothing to anybody.&quot;

On April 28, attorneys met with Santoro and said they made substantial progress on a revised plan. They reported having settled all disputes with Vick&#x27;s creditors, including Joel. On August 27, Santoro approved the revised reorganization plan. It was supported by all of Vick&#x27;s creditors but one who was owed $13,000. Every creditor was to be paid back in six years on the condition that an estimated $9 million in assets be liquidated. Vick was allowed annual living expenses of $300,000 under the plan. He could spend up to $3,500 a month for rent in Philadelphia and $750 for &quot;utilities and miscellaneous&quot;. He was to pay $3,712 a month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton, Virginia, where his fiancée and two children lived, and could pay up to $1,355 per month in private school tuition for his children. Vick was also given up to $472 a month in car-related expenses. His mother was allowed $2,500 per month, and his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor was allotted $3,000 per month to support their son, Mitez. Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles. Vick paid his agent, Joel Segal, $32,500 in 2010, $104,000 in 2011, and would pay him $160,000 each year from 2012 to 2015 for a total of $776,500. He paid bankruptcy lawyers $748,750 in 2010, $1 million in 2011, and a total of $2.6 million.

==Endorsements==
During his career with the Falcons, Vick became a spokesperson for many companies. He had endorsement contracts with companies including Nike, EA Sports, Coca-Cola, Powerade, Kraft, Rawlings, Hasbro, and AirTran.

Even before the animal cruelty case surfaced in 2007, however, Vick&#x27;s corporate status had deteriorated. Among the negative incidents was his middle finger gesture to Atlanta football fans in 2006. Vick&#x27;s first endorsement after being released from prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011, with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads. Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing marked the first time a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.

In 2012, Vick launched a sports clothing line called V7 to be sold exclusively at Modell&#x27;s. Part of the proceeds was to go to the Boys and Girls Club of Philadelphia.

==Charitable foundations==
Vick has been a principal in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just before the start of the foundation&#x27;s first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program.

After the Virginia Tech massacre on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 to assist families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia to be placed in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford, and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the money would be used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.

<doc id="428987" wikidata="Q1126823" url="?curid=428987" title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">
<text>In computing, the SSH File Transfer Protocol, also known as Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream. It was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0 to provide secure file transfer capabilities, and is seen as a replacement of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) due to superior security. The IETF Internet Draft states that, even though this protocol is described in the context of the SSH-2 protocol, it could be used in a number of different applications, such as secure file transfer over Transport Layer Security (TLS) and transfer of management information in VPN applications.

This protocol assumes that it is run over a secure channel, such as SSH, that the server has already authenticated the client, and that the identity of the client user is available to the protocol.

==Capabilities==
Compared to the SCP protocol, which only allows file transfers, the SFTP protocol allows for a range of operations on remote files which make it more like a remote file system protocol. An SFTP client&#x27;s extra capabilities include resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. There is also support for all UNIX file types, including symbolic links.

SFTP attempts to be more platform-independent than SCP; with SCP, for instance, the expansion of wildcards specified by the client is up to the server, whereas SFTP&#x27;s design avoids this problem. While SCP is most frequently implemented on Unix platforms, SFTP servers are commonly available on most platforms. In SFTP, the file transfer can be easily terminated without terminating a session like other mechanisms do.

SFTP is not FTP run over SSH, but rather a new protocol designed from the ground up by the IETF SECSH working group. It is sometimes confused with Simple File Transfer Protocol.

The protocol itself does not provide authentication and security; it expects the underlying protocol to secure this. SFTP is most often used as subsystem of SSH protocol version 2 implementations, having been designed by the same working group. It is possible, however, to run it over SSH-1 (and some implementations support this) or other data streams. Running an SFTP server over SSH-1 is not platform-independent as SSH-1 does not support the concept of subsystems. An SFTP client willing to connect to an SSH-1 server needs to know the path to the SFTP server binary on the server side.

Uploaded files may be associated with their basic attributes, such as time stamps. This is an advantage over the common FTP protocol.

==History and development==
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group &quot;Secsh&quot; that was responsible for the development of the Secure Shell version 2 protocol (RFC 4251) also attempted to draft an extension of that standard for secure file transfer functionality. Internet Drafts were created that successively revised the protocol into new versions. The software industry began to implement various versions of the protocol before the drafts were standardized. As development work progressed, the scope of the Secsh File Transfer project expanded to include file access and file management. Eventually, development stalled as some committee members began to view SFTP as a file system protocol, not just a file access or file transfer protocol, which places it beyond the purview of the working group. After a seven-year hiatus, in 2013 an attempt was made to restart work on SFTP using the version 3 draft as the baseline.

===Versions 0–2===
Prior to the IETF&#x27;s involvement, SFTP was a proprietary protocol of SSH Communications Security, designed by Tatu Ylönen with assistance from Sami Lehtinen in 1997. Differences between versions 0–2 and version 3 are enumerated upon in section 10 of draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.

===Version 3===
At the outset of the IETF Secure Shell File Transfer project, the Secsh group stated that its objective of SSH File Transfer Protocol was to provide a secure file transfer functionality over any reliable data stream, and to be the standard file transfer protocol for use with the SSH-2 protocol.

Drafts 00–02 of the IETF Internet Draft define successive revisions of version 3 of the SFTP protocol.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 00, January 2001
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 01, March 2001
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 02, October 2001

===Version 4===
Drafts 03–04 of the IETF Internet Draft define version 4 of the protocol.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 03, October 2002
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 04, December 2002

===Version 5===
Draft 05 of the IETF Internet Draft defines version 5 of the protocol.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 05, January 2004

===Version 6===
Drafts 06–13 of the IETF Internet Draft define successive revisions of version 6 of the protocol.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 06, October 2004
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 07, March 2005
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 08, April 2005 
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 09, June 2005 – Added byte-range locks. ACL changes. Rearranged SSH_FXP_REALPATH request parameters.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 10, June 2005 – Extensions &quot;vendor-id&quot;, &quot;md5-hash&quot;, &quot;space-available&quot;, &quot;home-directory&quot; removed. ACL changes.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 11, January 2006 – ACL transfer fully specified. Editorial changes.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 12, January 2006 – Added &quot;IANA considerations&quot;. A size parameter is now allowed for file creation as an advisory signal.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 13, July 2006 – editorial changes

=== Extensions ===
The SFTP protocol supports a generic way of indicating extended commands, along with a method of including them in version negotiation. An IANA registry is requested, but since the protocol never became an official standard, no such registry has been created.
* Draft 13 specifies , , , , , , , .
* OpenSSH, the most widespread implementation, defines constants to convert and values across the protocol, using the version identifier. It only implements version 3 from draft 1.

==Software==

===SFTP client===

The term SFTP can also refer to Secure file transfer program, a command-line program that implements the client part of this protocol. As an example, the sftp program supplied with OpenSSH implements this.

Some implementations of the codice_1 &quot;program&quot; support both the SFTP and SCP protocols to perform file transfers, depending on what the server supports. The scp program supplied with OpenSSH 9.0 and higher defaults to using SFTP.

===SFTP server===
Some FTP server implementations implement the SFTP protocol; however, outside of dedicated file servers, SFTP protocol support is usually provided by an SSH server implementation, as it shares the default port of 22 with other SSH services. SFTP implementations may include an SSH protocol implementation to leverage integration of SSH connection details with preexisting FTP server access controls, where an alternative SSH server is tolerable or where alternative ports may be used. An SSH-2 server which supports subsystems may be leveraged to keep a uniform SSH implementation while enhancing access controls with third party software, at the cost of fine-grained integration with connection details, and SSH-1 compatibility.

===SFTP proxy===
It is difficult to control SFTP transfers on security devices at the network perimeter. There are standard tools for logging FTP transactions, like TIS gdev or SUSE FTP proxy, but SFTP is encrypted, rendering traditional proxies ineffective for controlling SFTP traffic.

There are some tools that implement man-in-the-middle for SSH which also feature SFTP control. Examples of such a tool are Shell Control Box from Balabit and CryptoAuditor from SSH Communications Security (the original developer of the Secure Shell protocol) which provides functions such as SFTP transaction logging and logging of the actual data transmitted on the wire.

<text>Bose Corporation () is an American manufacturing company that predominantly sells audio equipment. The company was established by Amar Bose in 1964 and is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. It is best known for its home audio systems and speakers, noise-canceling headphones, professional audio products, and vehicle sound systems. Bose has a reputation for being particularly protective of its patents, trademarks, and brands. The majority owner of Bose Corporation is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Non-voting shares were donated to MIT by founder Amar Bose and receive cash dividends. The company&#x27;s annual report for the 2021 financial year stated that Bose Corporation&#x27;s yearly sales were $3.2 billion, and the company employed about 7,000 people.

==History==
The company was founded in Massachusetts in 1964 by Amar Bose with angel investor funding, including Amar&#x27;s thesis advisor and professor, Y. W. Lee. Bose&#x27;s interest in speaker systems had begun in 1956 when he purchased an audio system and was disappointed with its performance. The purpose of the company was to develop speaker systems which used multiple speakers aimed at the surrounding walls to reflect the sound and replicate the sound of a concert hall.

In 1966, the Bose 2201 was the first product sold by the company. It was an unusual design consisting of 22 speakers, with many of them facing away from the listener. The 2201 was designed to be located in the corner of a room, using reflections off the walls to increase the apparent size of the room. The 2201 failed in the marketplace and was discontinued after three or four years.

After this experience, Bose concluded that the audio system measurement techniques of the time (such as measuring distortion and frequency response) were ineffective ways to evaluate the goal of natural sound reproduction. Bose argued that the listener&#x27;s perception was the best measure of audio quality. Also in 1968, the company introduced the Bose 901 stereo speaker system, which used eight mid-range drivers pointing toward the wall behind the speaker, and a ninth driver toward the listener. This design aimed to achieve a dominance of reflected over direct sound in home listening spaces. The design used in the 901 was unconventional compared with most systems, where mid-range and high-frequency speakers directly face the listener. The 901 was an immediate commercial success. As a result, Bose Corporation experienced rapid growth during the 1970s. The Bose 901 model name was a mainstay of the Bose line-up for many years, being produced from 1968 until 2016.

In 1991, a team of Bose researchers debunked a 1989 experiment that claimed to have created energy through cold fusion.

The first Bose retail store was opened in 1993 in Kittery, Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innovations/achievements&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, then-chairman and primary stockholder Amar Bose donated the majority of the firm&#x27;s non-voting shares to his former employer and alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An annual cash dividend is paid out to &quot;advance the research and education mission of MIT.&quot; However, the conditions of receiving the shares stated that MIT was not allowed to sell them, nor was MIT permitted to participate in the company&#x27;s management and governance. Following Amar Bose&#x27;s death in 2013, Bob Maresca became the Chief Executive Officer.

In June 2016, Bose and Flex manufacturing extended their strategic partnership, transferring Bose operations in Malaysia and Mexico to Flex.

At the end of 2017, Maresca stepped down as CEO, and Bose President Phil Hess took the position. Maresca remained Chairman of the Board.

In January 2020, Bose announced that they would be closing all their more than 100 retail stores in North America, Japan, Europe, and Australia. They would retain their online presence, as well as sell their products through Target, Best Buy, and Amazon.

In late January 2020, President and COO Jim Scammon replaced Phil Hess.

In August 2020, Bose selected their first female CEO, Lila Snyder, who was formerly an executive at Pitney Bowes. Snyder, who took her position in September 2020, is an MIT alumna, having earned her masters and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering there.

== Production facilities ==
Bose&#x27;s products are manufactured in the United States, Mexico, China, and Malaysia. The company&#x27;s factories in the United States are located in Framingham, Massachusetts (also the site of the company headquarters), Westborough, Massachusetts and Stow, Massachusetts. In early 2021, Bose Corporation notified the Town of Stow of intention to vacate the 81.5 acre Stow campus after 18 years at the site, moving nearly 1500 employees to the Framingham headquarters. The Bose factories in Mexico are located in Tijuana and San Luis Río Colorado. The Malaysian Bose factory is located in Batu Kawan and is the company&#x27;s Asia-Pacific and Middle East distribution hub. In 2015, two facilities in Columbia, South Carolina, US and Carrickmacross, Ireland, were closed (with the loss of 300 and 140 jobs, respectively) as part of a &quot;global streamlining of Bose&#x27;s supply chain. Bose used the Columbia facility, which opened in 1993, for distribution and repair, sub-manufacturing and regional manufacturing, and final assembly for some headsets. The Carrickmacross factory began operations in 1978 and did the final assembly for some home theater systems, Wave radios, and other regional manufacturing. The operation of the San Luis and Batu Kawan factories were taken over by contract manufacturer Flex in 2016 and continued to produce Bose products.

== Products ==
=== Automotive ===
Following an unsuccessful attempt to sell aftermarket car speakers, Bose&#x27;s first OEM audio installation was in a MY1983 Cadillac Seville. Bose has since supplied audio systems for many car manufacturers. In 2007, the Bose media system won the International Telematics Award for the &quot;Best Storage Solution for In-Car Environment.&quot;

A prototype active suspension system, using electromagnetic motors instead of hydraulic/pneumatic power, was unveiled by the company in 2004 and was due for release in 2009. However, it did not materialize due to weight and cost. The system used electromagnetic linear motors to raise or lower the wheels of an vehicle in response to uneven bumps or potholes on the road. The wheels are raised when approaching a bump (or lowered into a pothole) to keep the vehicle level, using principles similar to noise cancelling audio devices. A prototype car had been engineered to jump over an obstacle. The company said that the system was too expensive and heavy, even after development over more than 20 years and costing $100 million. In November 2017, it was reported that Bose had sold the technology to ClearMotion. In May 2018, it was announced that five major car manufacturers had expressed interest in the technology and that it may be available in 2019 for low-volume vehicles and by 2020 for the mass market.

A truck seat system called &quot;Bose Ride&quot; was introduced in 2010. This active seat system aims to reduce fatigue, back pain and physical stress experienced by truck drivers by reducing vibration from the road. Bose claimed up to a 90% reduction in driver&#x27;s seat vibration.

Vehicle brands that currently have Bose audio systems available in their vehicles include Alfa Romeo, Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, Geely, GMC, Honda, Hongqi, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Mazda, MG, Nissan, Opel, Renault, Roewe, Vauxhall and Volkswagen Group.

===Home audio and video===

Bose&#x27;s product range has included:
In 2012, Bose was the highest-selling company in the United States for retail home theater systems and the third highest-selling for portable audio products.

=== Headphones ===

The company has sold aviation headsets since 1989 and consumer headphones since 2000. The current range of headphones/headsets consists of over-ear, in-ear, aviation and military models.

Bose has contracts with the U.S. military and NASA.
=== Commercial sound systems ===
The &quot;Bose Professional&quot; division was established in 1972 to produce and install public address systems. In 2009, the division accounted for about 60% of Bose&#x27;s annual revenue. Bose was the first company to pay for the title of official Olympics sound system supplier, providing audio equipment for the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics in Calgary and Albertville respectively. Bose&#x27;s systems have not received THX certification. The &quot;Bose L1&quot; is a range of portable line array loudspeaker systems for musicians. The L1 was introduced in 2003 with models retroactively known as the &quot;L1 Classic&quot; range. These products were replaced by the &quot;L1 Model I&quot; and &quot;L1 Model II&quot; in 2007. A smaller and lighter &quot;L1 Compact&quot; model was introduced April 2009. The L1 Model I was replaced by the &quot;L1 Model 1S&quot; in 2012, and the &quot;B1 Bass Module&quot; was replaced by the larger &quot;B2 Bass Module&quot;. Since the 1980s, Bose has offered 25-volt and 70-volt installed commercial audio systems for businesses.

== View on published specifications ==
The company is known for electing not to provide audio specifications for its products. This policy dates back to 1968 when Amar Bose published a paper titled &quot;On the Design, Measurement, and Evaluation of Loudspeakers&quot; wherein he rejected numerical test data in favor of subjective evaluation. In a 2007 interview, Amar stated: &quot;There are two reasons we cut out the specifications: 1- We don&#x27;t know of any measurements that actually determine anything about a product, and 2- Measurements are phony, in general, as they are printed.&quot;

==Reception==
In some non-audio-related publications, Bose has been cited as a producer of &quot;high-end audio&quot; products. Commenting in 2007 on Bose&#x27;s &quot;high-end&quot; market positioning among audiophiles, a &quot;PC Magazine&quot; product reviewer stated, &quot;not only is Bose equipment&#x27;s sound quality not up to audiophile standards, but one could buy something that does meet these stringent requirements for the same price or, often, for less.&quot; Bose has also received mixed reviews from the public. Bose has not been certified by THX for its home entertainment products even though its more expensive home theater products compete at prices where THX certification is common. Some other views include:

* Bose&#x27;s flagship 901 speaker system was given a negative review by Consumer Reports in 1970 (see &quot;Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.&quot;). &quot;Stereophile&quot; magazine, in 1979, also gave a negative review, stating that the system was unexceptional and unlikely to appeal to perfectionists with a developed taste in precise imaging, detail, and timbre and that these shortcomings were an excessive price to pay for the improvement in impact and ambiance generated by the large proportion of reflected sound [to on-axis sound]. However, the author also stated that the system produced a more realistic resemblance of natural ambiance than any other speaker system. A more recent positive review by TONE Audio found that the 901 was better than expected and a good value for the price range.
*A 2005 market study published by Forrester Research reported that Bose&#x27;s brand name was among several computer and consumer electronics brands most trusted by US consumers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard.
*A 2007 review in &quot;Audioholics&quot; online magazine reiterated that Bose was very expensive for its performance. Of the Bose Lifestyle V20 Home Theater System, the reviewer wrote, &quot;The Bose system is very expensive at nearly $2,000, and the sound quality isn&#x27;t really any better than many other surround systems costing a third of the price... the smaller [bass] cones cannot reproduce lower tactile [sic] frequencies.&quot; The review included an interview with a Best Buy sales manager who suggested from his experience that, despite his directing customers to a better-sounding and less expensive alternative, some customers insisted on Bose.
*A July 2012 review by NBC News of the $5,000 46&quot; Bose TV noted that the video screen, produced by Samsung, resembled most closely a $750 flat panel television and that the technology used was not up to par with other screens in the same category. The review then questioned the value of the additional $4,250 cost for the Bose TV, suggesting there were compelling audio alternatives for less than 1/5th the price difference. The same system received a positive review by &quot;PC Magazine&quot; that cited the user interface and sound quality in an unobtrusive design.
*In July 2013, &quot;iLounge&quot; wrote about the Bose Soundlink Mini, a small remote speaker competing against inexpensive, low-end audio devices, that &quot;Audio quality is SoundLink Mini&#x27;s real trump card over Jambox and most—not all—of its competitors... SoundLink Mini delivers much deeper bass and cleaner mid-bass at all volumes, suffering from noticeable distortion solely at the top of its volume scale.&quot;

==Legal actions==
Audio industry professionals have described Bose as a litigious company. In 1981, Bose unsuccessfully sued the magazine &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; for libel. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; reported in a review that the sound from the system they reviewed &quot;tended to wander about the room.&quot; Initially, the Federal District Court found that &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; &quot;had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity&quot; when it changed what the original reviewer wrote about the speakers in his pre-publication draft, that the sound tended to wander &quot;along the wall.&quot; The Court of Appeals then reversed the trial court&#x27;s ruling on liability, and the United States Supreme Court affirmed in a 6–3 vote in the case &quot;Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.&quot;, finding that the statement was made without actual malice, and therefore there was no libel. In an interview decades later Amar Bose said &quot;We had 37 people at the time. I gathered them in one room and said, &#x27;If we don&#x27;t do anything, it will probably kill us. But if we do something, we have no credibility since we&#x27;re just a small company, and we can&#x27;t do anything against this.&#x27; I said I think we oughtta do something. I wanted a vote. It was unanimous in favor of taking action. Little did we know it would take 14 years to go through the legal process.&quot; Bose sued Thiel Audio in the early 1990s to stop the audiophile loudspeaker maker from using &quot;.2&quot; at the end of its product model &quot;CS2.2&quot;. To comply with Bose&#x27;s trademark of &quot;.2&quot; associated with the Bose Model 2.2 product, Thiel changed their model name to &quot;CS2 2&quot;, substituting a space for the decimal point. Bose did not trademark &quot;.3&quot; so in 1997 when Thiel introduced the next model in the series, they named it the &quot;Thiel 2.3&quot;, advertising &quot;the return of the decimal point.&quot; In 1996, Bose sued two subsidiaries of Harman International Industries—JBL and Infinity Systems—for violating a Bose patent on elliptical tuning ports on some loudspeaker products. In 2000, the court determined that Harman was to cease using elliptical ports in its products, and Harman was to pay Bose $5.7 million in court costs. Harman stopped using the disputed port design but appealed the financial decision. At the end of 2002, the earlier judgment was upheld, but by this time, Bose&#x27;s court expenses had risen to $8 million, all to be paid by Harman. Bose was successful in blocking QSC Audio Products from trademarking the term &quot;PowerWave&quot; in connection with a specific QSC amplifier technology. In 2002, a court decided that the &quot;Wave&quot; trademark was worthy of greater protection because it was well-known on its own, even beyond its association with Bose. In 2003, Bose sued Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association (CEDIA), a non-profit electronics trade organization, for use of the &quot;Electronic Lifestyles&quot; trademark, which CEDIA has been using since 1997. Bose argued that the trademark interfered with its own &quot;Lifestyle&quot; trademark. Bose had previously sued to protect its &quot;Lifestyle&quot; trademark beginning in 1996 with success against Motorola and continuing with settlements against New England Stereo, Lifestyle Technologies, Optoma and AMX. In May 2007, CEDIA won the lawsuit after the court determined Bose to be guilty of laches (unreasonable delays) and that Bose&#x27;s assertions of fraud and the likelihood of confusion were without merit. CEDIA was criticized for spending nearly $1 million of its members&#x27; money on the lawsuit, and Bose was criticized for &quot;unsportsmanlike action against its own trade association,&quot; according to Julie Jacobson of &quot;CE Pro&quot; magazine. In July 2014, Bose sued Beats Electronics for patent infringement, alleging that its &quot;Studio&quot; headphones line incorporated Bose noise-canceling technology. Bose and Apple had collaborated on the SoundDock for iPod music players in 2004. Then, in May 2014, Apple bought out Beats, bringing Bose and Apple into direct competition in the headphone market. In Apple stores, Bose headphones were once the foremost brand offered, but at the time of the lawsuit, Beats products outnumbered Bose. In 2014, for the total premium headphone market share, Beats held 62%, and Bose held 22%. In October 2014, Bose dropped the lawsuit, as Bose and Beats settled out of court without revealing the terms. Apple removed all Bose products from its Apple stores a few days after the lawsuit was settled, but two months later, Bose products returned. In April of 2017, Bose was sued alleging a privacy violation regarding the mobile phone apps delivered by Bose to control their Bluetooth headphones.

<text>Timgad (, known as Marciana Traiana Thamugadi) was a Roman city in the Aurès Mountains of Algeria. It was founded by the Roman Emperor Trajan around 100 AD. The full name of the city was &quot;Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi&quot;. Emperor Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus.

Located in modern-day Algeria, about east of the city of Batna, the ruins are noteworthy for representing one of the best extant examples of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.

== Name ==

In the former name of Timgad, Marciana Traiana Thamugadi, the first part – Marciana Traiana – is Roman and refers to the name of its founder, Emperor Trajan and his sister Marciana. The second part of the name – Thamugadi – &quot;has nothing Latin about it&quot;. Thamugadi is the Berber name of the place where the city was built, to read Timgad plural form of Tamgut, meaning &quot;peak&quot; or &quot;summit&quot;.

==History==

The city was founded as a military colony by the emperor Trajan in the year 100AD. It was intended to serve primarily as a Roman bastion against the Berbers in the nearby Aures Mountains, and it was originally populated largely by Roman veterans and colonists. Although most of them had never seen Rome before, and Timgad was hundreds of miles away from the Italian city, it invested heavily in Roman culture and identity.

The city enjoyed a peaceful existence for the first several hundred years and became a center of Christian activity starting in the 3rd century, and a Donatist center in the 4th century. During the Christian period, Timgad was a diocese which became renowned at the end of the 4th century when Bishop Optat became the spokesman for the Donatist movement. After Optat, Thamugadai had two bishops Gaudentius (Donatist) and Faustinus (Catholic).

In the 5th century, the city was sacked by the Vandals before falling into decline. Timgad was destroyed at the end of the 5th century by Berber tribes from the Aurès Mountains. In 539 AD, during the Moorish wars, the Byzantine general Solomon retook and rebuilt the city, incorporating it into Byzantine North Africa. The reconquest revived some activities in the city, which became part of a line of defense against the Moors. However, the early Muslim conquests brought about the final ruin of Thamugadi as it ceased to be inhabited by the 8th century.

Travelling Northern Africa, Scottish explorer James Bruce reached the city ruins on 12 December 1765, likely being the first European to visit the site in centuries and described the city as “a small town, but full of elegant buildings.” In 1790, he published the book &quot;Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile&quot;, where he described what he had found in Timgad. The book was met with skepticism in Great Britain, until 1875 when Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain&#x27;s consul in Algiers, inspired by Bruce&#x27;s account, visited the site. In 1877 Playfair described Timgad in more detail in his book &quot;Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce in Algeria and Tunis&quot;. According to Playfair, “These hills are covered with countless numbers of the most interesting mega-lithic remains”. The French colonists took control of the site in 1881, began investigations and maintained it until 1960. During this period, the site was systematically excavated.

==Description==
Located at the intersection of six roads, the city was walled but not fortified.
Originally designed for a population of around 15,000, the city quickly outgrew its original specifications and spilled beyond the orthogonal grid in a more loosely organized fashion.

At the time of its founding, the area surrounding the city was a fertile agricultural area, about 1000 meters above sea level.

The original Roman grid plan is magnificently visible in the orthogonal design, highlighted by the &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; (east–west-oriented street) and the &quot;cardo&quot; (north–south-oriented street) lined by a partially restored Corinthian colonnade. The &quot;cardo&quot; does not proceed completely through the city but instead terminates in a &quot;forum&quot; at the intersection with the &quot;decumanus&quot;.

At the west end of the &quot;decumanus&quot; rises a 12 m high triumphal arch, called the &quot;Arch of Trajan&quot;, which was partially restored in 1900. The arch is principally of sandstone, and is of the Corinthian order with three arches, the central one being 11&#x27; wide. The arch is also known as the Timgad Arch.

A 3,500-seat theater is in good condition and is used for contemporary productions. The other key buildings include four thermae, a library, and a basilica.

The &quot;Capitoline Temple&quot; is dedicated to Jupiter and is of approximately the same dimensions as the Pantheon in Rome. Nearby the capitol is a square church, with a circular apse dating from the 7th century AD. One of the sanctuaries featured iconography of (Dea) Africa. South of the city is a large Byzantine citadel built in the later days of the city.

==Library==

The Library at Timgad was a gift to the Roman people by Julius Quintianus Flavius Rogatianus at a cost of 400,000 sesterces. As no additional information about this benefactor has been unearthed, the precise date of the library&#x27;s construction remains uncertain. Based on the remaining archaeological evidence, it has been suggested by scholars that it dates from the late 3rd or possibly the 4th century.

The library occupies a rectangle long by wide. It consists of a large semi-circular room flanked by two secondary rectangular rooms, and preceded by a U-shaped colonnaded portico surrounding three sides on an open court. The portico is flanked by two long narrow rooms on each side, and the large vaulted hall would have combined the functions of a reading room, stack room, and perhaps a lecture room. Oblong alcoves held wooden shelves along walls that would likely have been complete with sides, backs and doors, based on additional evidence found at the library at Ephesus.

It is possible that free-standing bookcases in the center of the room, as well as a reading desk, might also have been present. While the architecture of the Library at Timgad is not especially remarkable, the discovery of the library is historically important as it shows the presence of a fully developed library system in this Roman city, indicating a high standard of learning and culture. While there is no evidence as to the size of the collection the library harbored, it is estimated that it could have accommodated 3,000 scrolls.

==World Heritage Site==
Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.

<text>Carnival Corporation &amp; plc is a British and American cruise operator with a combined fleet of over ninety vessels across nine cruise line brands. A dual-listed company, Carnival is composed of the Panama-incorporated, US-headquartered Carnival Corporation, and UK-based Carnival plc, which function as one entity. Carnival Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, whereas Carnival plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange with an ADR listing on the NYSE. Carnival is listed in both the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 250 indices.

The American entity Carnival Corporation has its headquarters in the United States, with operational headquarters located in the city of Doral, Florida. The UK entity Carnival plc has its headquarters in Southampton, England. 
==History==
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions. Between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.

P&amp;O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&amp;O group. Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&amp;O operated the world&#x27;s first commercial cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&amp;O group in the 20th century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&amp;O Cruises and P&amp;O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises, as well as establishing the A&#x27;Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.

In 2003, Carnival Corporation acquired P&amp;O Princess Cruises plc. It was agreed that P&amp;O Princess Cruises plc would remain a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company was renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group. Prior to Carnival Corporation&#x27;s acquisition, P&amp;O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.

Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007 and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.

In October 2015, CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping, a joint venture between Carnival, the China Investment Corporation, and the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, was founded, with operations expected to commence in 2019.

In March 2018, Carnival Corporation announced its intention to invest in the construction of a new terminal in the port of Sasebo, Japan. It is expected to open in 2020.

In June 2018, Carnival Corporation announced that it had acquired the White Pass and Yukon Route from TWC Enterprises Limited for US$290 million. The properties acquired were port, railroad and retail operations in Skagway, Alaska.

In 2023, Carnival Corporation sold their interest in Adora Cruises. 

===Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic===
All cruise ship itineraries were cancelled in March 2020 due to the worldwide pandemic and eventually, 55 passengers on ships owned by Carnival Corporation &amp; plc were reported as having died. After months of cancelled cruises, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc announced in September 2020 that it intended to dispose of 18 ships, a full 12% of the global fleet. By that time, five ships had already been scrapped: &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot;, &quot;Carnival Imagination&quot;, &quot;Carnival Inspiration&quot; and &quot;Costa Victoria&quot;.

The corporation also announced that it was delaying the delivery of several ships already on order. These steps were part of the company&#x27;s cost-cutting plan, important because the &quot;pause in guest operations continues to have a material negative impact on all aspects of the company&#x27;s business, including the company&#x27;s liquidity, financial position and results of operations&quot;. The adjusted net loss in the third quarter was reported by the corporation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as US$1.7 billion.
As of September 2020, the no-sail rule by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prohibited cruising in the U.S. until October 31, 2020, at the earliest. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association, including Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, had announced in early August that its members were extending a voluntary suspension until October 31; that applied to cruises that were to depart from the U.S. or planned to stop at U.S. ports of call.

In November 2020, the CEO said he was confident that &quot;universal testing, which doesn&#x27;t exist in any other industry of scale&quot; would help start the cruising industry.

The company&#x27;s fourth quarter (ending 30 November 2020) financial statement released on January 11, 2021, indicated that one extra ship, in addition to the 18 previously planned, was to be sold. Carnival Corporation was in an excellent cash position, with US$9.5 billion, but suffered an adjusted net loss of $1.9 billion in the quarter.

==Operations==
The Carnival group comprises nine cruise line brands and one cruise experience brand operating a combined fleet of 91 ships.

In June 2023, Carnival restructured its corporate umbrella and created six new separate units that have full executive control of the brands in their portfolio.

==Brands and ships==

===AIDA Cruises===

AIDA Cruises originated from the state-owned East German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany, in 1952. The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship &quot;AIDA&quot;, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.

In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&amp;O, with the &quot;AIDA&quot; name being repurchased from NCL. P&amp;O formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. &quot;AIDA&quot; was renamed &quot;AIDAcara&quot;, with &quot;AIDAvita&quot; and &quot;AIDAaura&quot; launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.

===Carnival Cruise Line===

Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis. Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. Through the acquisition of existing ships the company continued to grow. In 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the &quot;Tropicale&quot;, which was completed in 1981/2. Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the &quot;Holiday&quot; (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987).

In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital. The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.

===Costa Cruises===

Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854. Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was &quot;Maria C&quot;, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953. The company&#x27;s first dedicated passenger ship was the &quot;Anna C&quot;, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.

Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. In 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world.

The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours. On January 13, 2012, Costa Concordia, a ship operated by the line, hit an underwater rock and ran aground in Isola del Giglio, Tuscany, resulting in 32 deaths. Investigations proved that the captain and general bad organization was responsible for the disaster, and the company was fined.

===Cunard Line===

The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&amp;O, Cunard Line originated in 1840 and celebrated its 180th anniversary in 2020. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840. After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879. The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot;, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties. To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934. Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996. In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder. Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival&#x27;s most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and the development of the world&#x27;s largest trans-Atlantic Ocean liner &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.

===Holland America Line===

Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin &amp; Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM). The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including SS &quot;Rotterdam&quot;, which operated the company&#x27;s first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with &quot;dam&quot;, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973. Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.

===P&amp;O Cruises===

P&amp;O Cruises was originally a subsidiary of the British shipping company P&amp;O and was founded in 1977. Along with P&amp;O Cruises Australia, it has the oldest heritage of any cruise line in the world, dating to P&amp;O&#x27;s first passenger operations in 1837. P&amp;O Cruises was divested from P&amp;O in 2000, subsequently becoming a subsidiary of P&amp;O Princess Cruises, before coming under the ownership of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc in 2003, following the merger between P&amp;O Princess Cruises and Carnival Corporation. P&amp;O Cruises is based in Southampton, England, and operates a fleet of seven ships, dedicated to serving the British market.

==Violations of environmental laws==
In 2002 the Carnival Corporation pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Miami to criminal charges related to falsifying records of the oil-contaminated bilge water that six of its ships dumped into the sea from 1996 through 2001. The Carnival Corporation was ordered to pay $18 million in fines and perform community service, received five years&#x27; probation and must submit to a court-supervised worldwide environmental-compliance program for each of its cruise ships.

For dumping oiled waste into the seas and lying to cover it up, Princess Cruise Lines was fined $40 million in 2016. According to federal authorities, it was the &quot;largest-ever criminal penalty&quot; for intentional vessel pollution. Officials said that these practices began in 2005 and persisted until August 2013, when a newly hired engineer blew the whistle. As part of its plea agreement, ships of the parent company Carnival Cruise lines were subjected to a court supervised environmental compliance plan for five years.

For violation of the probation terms of 2016 Carnival and its Princess line were ordered to pay an additional $20 million penalty in 2019. The new violations included discharging plastic into waters in the Bahamas, falsifying records, and interfering with court supervision.

<text>Anson Jones (January 20, 1798 – January 9, 1858) was an American medical doctor, businessman, member of Congress, and the fourth and last president of the Republic of Texas.

== Early life ==
Jones was born on January 20, 1798, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He traveled to Seneca Falls, New York, and opened a one-room school. He taught there from 1812 to 1813. In 1820, Jones was licensed as a doctor by the Oneida, New York, Medical Society, and began medical practice in 1822. However, his practice prospered, and he moved several more times before finally being arrested in Philadelphia by a creditor. He stayed in Philadelphia for a few more years, teaching and practicing medicine, until in 1823, he decided to go to Venezuela.

Later, Jones returned to Philadelphia, earned an MD, and reopened his practice. He never had much success as a doctor, and in 1832, he renounced medicine and headed for New Orleans, where he entered the mercantile trade. Once again, though, Jones&#x27;s dreams were thwarted. Though he safely weathered two plagues, his business efforts never met with any success, and within a year he had no money.

He was a member and Past Master of the Masonic Harmony Lodge No. 52 of Philadelphia. He was a Past Grand of Independent Order of Odd Fellows Washington Lodge no. 2 and Philadelphia Lodge no. 13 in Pennsylvania and the Past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania of Oddfellows.

=== Life in Texas ===
In 1832, Jones headed west to Texas, settling eventually in Brazoria. Here, at last, he met with success, establishing a medical practice that prospered quickly. In 1835, he began to speak out about the growing tensions between Texas and Mexico, and that year he attended the Consultation, a meeting held at Columbia, by Texas patriots to discuss the fight with Mexico (the meeting&#x27;s leadership did not want to call the meeting a &quot;convention&quot;, for fear the Mexican government would view it as an independence forum). Jones himself presented a resolution at the Consultation calling for a convention to be held to declare independence, but he himself refused to be nominated to the convention.

During the Texas Revolution, Jones served as a judge advocate and surgeon to the Texas Army, though he insisted on holding the rank of private throughout the conflict. After the war, Jones returned to Brazoria and resumed his medical practice.

Upon his return to Brazoria, Jones found that James Collinsworth, a fellow Texas patriot and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Brazoria, had set up a law practice in Jones&#x27;s office. Jones evicted Collinsworth and challenged him to a duel (though the duel never occurred).

Just a few months before the revolution, on March 2, 1834, Jones met with four other Masons at Brazoria and petitioned the Grand Master of Louisiana for a dispensation and a charter to form the first Masonic lodge in Texas. In December, when the lodge was set to labor, Jones was elected its first Master. The charter for Holland Lodge No. 36 arrived during the final days of the revolution, and Jones carried it in his saddlebags during the decisive Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. At the formation of the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas in December 1837, he was elected its first Grand Master. He also became the first Grand Master of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in Texas.

On May 17, 1840, he married Mary Smith Jones. Together, they had four children.

=== Move to politics ===
Jones and Collinsworth would spar again. Collinsworth was instrumental in starting the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company, to which Jones was vehemently opposed. Jones was elected to the Second Texas Congress as an opponent of the company; however, his most significant act in Congress was to call for the withdrawal of the Texas proposal for annexation by the United States. He also helped draw up legislation to regulate medical practice, and called for the establishment of an endowment for a university.

Jones expected to return to his practice at Brazoria after his term in Congress, but Texas President Sam Houston instead appointed him Minister to the United States, where Jones was to formally withdraw the annexation proposal.

During this time, while many Texans hoped to encourage eventual annexation by the United States, some supported waiting for annexation or even remaining independent. The United States, in the late 1830s, was hesitant to annex Texas for fear of provoking a war with Mexico. Jones and others felt that Texas gaining recognition from European states was important, and began to set up trade relations with them, to make annexation of Texas more attractive to the United States, or failing that, to give Texas the strength to remain independent.

Jones was recalled to Texas by new president Mirabeau Lamar in 1839. Back at home, he found himself elected to a partial term in the Senate, where he quickly became a critic of Lamar&#x27;s administration. He retired from the Senate in 1841, declining the opportunity to serve as Vice President in favor of returning to his medical practice. Late in 1841, though, he was named Texas Secretary of State by President Houston, who had recently been elected president again by opponents of Lamar.

Jones served as Secretary of State until 1844. During his term, the main goal of Texas foreign policy was to get either an offer of annexation from the United States, or a recognition of Texas independence from Mexico, or preferably, both at the same time.

Anson Jones served as the fourth and last President of the Republic of Texas.

== After presidency ==

Jones hoped that the new Texas state legislature would send him to the United States Senate. He was not chosen, and as time went on, he became increasingly bitter about this slight. Although Jones prospered as a planter and eventually amassed an enormous estate, he was never able to get past the fact that Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk were chosen over him to represent Texas in Washington, DC.

After the suicide of Thomas Jefferson Rusk in 1857, Jones became convinced that the legislature would finally send him to the Senate, but he received no votes.

In 1849 Jones was thrown from a horse. His left arm was crushed and became withered and discolored. This injury sent him back east for medical treatment. In the east he was exposed to and found keen interest in new technology, especially railroads.

=== Death ===
For four days, he had lodged at Houston&#x27;s old Capitol Hotel, the former seat of government of the Republic of Texas. His arm permanently injured in a fall, and having received no votes for a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, he brooded over his career. After dinner on January 9, 1858, he returned to his room and fatally shot himself. He was 59 years old. Jones was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.

== Legacy ==
Jones County, Texas, and its county seat, Anson, were both named for Anson Jones. The Anson Jones Elementary Schools in Bryan and Midland are named for him along with Anson Jones Middle School in San Antonio, as well as Anson Jones Elementary in the Dallas ISD system. His plantation home, known as Barrington, is preserved at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Park.

Anson Jones served as the fourth and last President of the Republic of Texas.

<text>William Edgar Stafford (January 17, 1914 – August 28, 1993) was an American poet and pacifist. He was the father of poet and essayist Kim Stafford. He was appointed the twentieth Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1970.

==Early life==

===Background===
Stafford was born in Hutchinson, Kansas, the oldest of three children in a highly literate family. During the Depression, his family moved from town to town in an effort to find work for his father. Stafford helped contribute to family income by delivering newspapers, working in sugar beet fields, raising vegetables, and working as an electrician&#x27;s apprentice.

Stafford graduated from high school in the town of Liberal, Kansas in 1933. After initially attending senior college, he received a B.A. from the University of Kansas in 1937. He was drafted into the United States armed forces in 1941 while pursuing his master&#x27;s degree at the University of Kansas, but declared himself a pacifist. As a registered conscientious objector, he performed alternative service from 1942 to 1946 in the Civilian Public Service camps. The work consisted of forestry and soil conservation work in Arkansas, California, and Illinois for $2.50 per month. While working in California in 1944, he met and married Dorothy Hope Frantz, with whom he later had four children (Bret, who died in 1988; Kim, writer; Kit, artist; Barbara, artist). He received his M.A. from the University of Kansas in 1947. His master&#x27;s thesis, the prose memoir &quot;Down In My Heart&quot;, was published in 1948 and described his experience in the forest service camps. He taught English for one academic semester (1947) to 11th graders (juniors) at Chaffey Union High School, Ontario, California. That same year he moved to Oregon to teach at Lewis &amp; Clark College. In 1954, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Stafford taught for one academic year (1955–1956) in the English department at Manchester College in Indiana, a college affiliated with the Church of the Brethren where he had received training during his time in Civilian Public Service. The following year (1956–57), he taught at San Jose State in California, and the next year returned to the faculty of Lewis &amp; Clark.

==Career==
One striking feature of his career is its late start. Stafford was 48 years old when his first major collection of poetry was published, &quot;Traveling Through the Dark&quot;, which won the 1963 National Book Award for Poetry. The title poem is one of his best-known works. It describes encountering a recently killed doe on a mountain road. Before pushing the doe into a canyon, the narrator discovers that she was pregnant and the fawn inside is still alive.

Stafford had a quiet daily ritual of writing, and his writing focuses on the ordinary. Paul Merchant, writing in the Oregon Encyclopedia, compared his gentle quotidian style to Robert Frost. Merchant states, &quot;his poems are accessible, sometimes deceptively so, with a conversational manner that is close to everyday speech. Among predecessors whom he most admired are William Wordsworth, Thomas Hardy, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson.&quot; His poems are typically short, focusing on the earthy, accessible details appropriate to a specific locality. Stafford said this in a 1971 interview:
I keep following this sort of hidden river of my life, you know, whatever the topic or impulse which comes, I follow it along trustingly. And I don&#x27;t have any sense of its coming to a kind of crescendo, or of its petering out either. It is just going steadily along.
Stafford was a close friend and collaborator with poet Robert Bly. Despite his late start, he was a frequent contributor to magazines and anthologies and eventually published fifty-seven volumes of poetry. James Dickey called Stafford one of those poets &quot;who pour out rivers of ink, all on good poems.&quot; He kept a daily journal for 50 years, and composed nearly 22,000 poems, of which roughly 3,000 were published.

In 1970, he was named Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, a position that is now known as Poet Laureate. In 1975, he was named Poet Laureate of Oregon; his tenure in the position lasted until 1990. In 1980, he retired from Lewis &amp; Clark College but continued to travel extensively and give public readings of his poetry. In 1992, he won the Western States Book Award for lifetime achievement in poetry.

===Personal life===
Stafford died at his home in Lake Oswego, Oregon on August 28, 1993. The morning of his death he had written a poem containing the lines, &quot;&#x27;You don&#x27;t have to / prove anything,&#x27; my mother said. &#x27;Just be ready / for what God sends.&#x27;&quot; In 2008, the Stafford family gave William Stafford&#x27;s papers, including the 20,000 pages of his daily writing, to the Special Collections Department at Lewis &amp; Clark College.

Kim Stafford, who serves as literary executor for the Estate of William Stafford, has written a memoir, &quot;Early Morning: Remembering My Father, William Stafford&quot; (Graywolf Press).

<doc id="429040" wikidata="Q4992093" url="?curid=429040" title="Troll doll">
<text>A troll doll (Danish: &quot;Gjøltrold&quot;) is a type of plastic doll with furry up-combed hair depicting a troll, also known as a Dam doll after their creator Danish woodcutter Thomas Dam. The inspiration came from trolls in old Scandinavian folklore. The toys are also known as good luck trolls.

The dolls were first created in 1956 or earlier and were larger and made from a softer, more rubbery material than the smaller versions that became popular in 1959, before becoming one of the United States&#x27; biggest toy fads in the early 1960s. They became briefly popular again during the 1970s through the 1990s and were copied by several manufacturers under different names. During the 1990s, several video games and a video show were created based on troll dolls.

In 2003, the Dam company restored the United States copyrights for the trolls, stopping unlicensed production.

In 2005, the Dam company licensed the brand to DIC Entertainment to modernize the brand by creating a cartoon under the name &quot;Trollz&quot;, but the show only lasted one season. The failed cartoon also led to a lawsuit followed by a counter-claim lawsuit.

In 2013, the brand was bought by DreamWorks Animation, with an animated feature film called &quot;Trolls&quot; being released in 2016, followed by two sequels released in 2020 and 2023.

== Toy history ==
Troll dolls were available in a larger size made of more pliable material in 1956, and popularized in a smaller size in 1959 by Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam. Dam was initially a baker, but when flour supplies suffered, he sought numerous jobs, including fishing and selling logs, and whenever he was home, he would carve little wooden dolls depicting various mythical creatures for his kids, especially his daughter Lila. Eventually he started selling the toys, and developing statues for department stores throughout Scandinavia, but in 1959 could not afford a Christmas gift for his young daughter Lila and there carved a shock-haired bug-eyed troll doll from his imagination. Other children in the Danish town of Gjøl saw the doll and wanted one. Dam&#x27;s company Dam Things began producing the dolls in plastic under the name &quot;Good Luck Trolls&quot;. It became popular in several European countries during the early 1960s, shortly before they were introduced in the United States. They became one of the United States&#x27; biggest toy fads from the autumn of 1963 to 1965. The originals were of the highest quality, also called &quot;Dam dolls&quot; and featuring sheep wool hair and glass eyes. Their sudden popularity, along with an error in the copyright notice of Thomas Dam&#x27;s original product, resulted in cheaper imitations.

The Dam company never stopped its production of trolls in Denmark, where they were always a popular item. In the late 1980s, the Dam trolls started making another comeback in North America. E.F.S. Marketing Associates, Inc. was one of the few corporations granted permission to import and market the Thomas Dam trolls for resale in the United States. These Dam Trolls were marketed under the trade name of Norfin Trolls, with an &quot;Adopt A Norfin Troll&quot; logo on the tags.

During the period of popularity in the early to mid-1990s, several attempts were made to market the troll dolls to young boys. This included action figure lines such as The Original Battle Trolls from Hasbro, the Stone Protectors franchise, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Trolls. The popular Mighty Max line also had a series named Hairy Heads, also known as Dread Heads.

In 2003, the Dam copyright was restored by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The Uneeda Doll Company, a company that made millions of US dollars by manufacturing troll dolls in the U.S., challenged the restoration. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the lower court&#x27;s preliminary injunction, enjoining Uneeda from manufacturing, distributing, or selling &quot;Wish-nik&quot; troll dolls. The Toy Industry Association named troll dolls in its Century of Toys List, a list of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.

In 2005, Dam licensed the trolls to DIC Entertainment as &quot;Trollz&quot;. With this, the licensing campaign saw the troll dolls being pushed towards young girls, featuring products such as fashion dolls and fashion accessories. The campaign failed and eventually lead into a lawsuit.

In 2007, DIC sued the Dam company, claiming that they alleged claims of fraud in the inducement and negligent misrepresentation in connection with Dam&#x27;s troll doll, and DIC&#x27;s &quot;Trollz&quot;, which was created after DIC licensed the brand from Dam. Dam counter-sued DIC, claiming that the company financially misrepresented its ability to create and market a modern troll doll toy campaign and destroyed the image and goodwill of the doll.

In 2013, DreamWorks Animation acquired the intellectual property for the Trolls franchise from the Dam Family and Dam Things and became the exclusive worldwide licensor of the merchandise rights, except for Scandinavia, where Dam Things remains the licenser.

== In entertainment ==
=== Television and film ===
In 1991, Créativité &amp; Développement released a cartoon special called &quot;The Magic Trolls and the Troll Warriors&quot;, the special featured Magic Trolls battling against King Nolaf and his Troll Warriors.

In 1992, DIC (who would later produce &quot;Trollz&quot; in 2005) released a half hour special called &quot;Super Trolls&quot;. The special featured three heroic trolls who fight an evil troll named Craven. The special was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Video.

In that same year, a direct-to-video sing-along special was released titled &quot;The Trollies Radio Show&quot;, with puppet trolls singing somewhat dated hits such as &quot;Kokomo&quot;, &quot;Woolly Bully&quot;, and &quot;Do Wah Diddy&quot;, as well as some original songs.

Also in the same year, GoodTimes Entertainment released a direct-to-video sing along series &quot;Treehouse Trolls&quot;. The two videos were &quot;Treehouse Trolls Forest of Fun and Wonder&quot; and &quot;Treehouse Trolls Birthday Day&quot;.

In 1993, Graz Entertainment and Sachs TV Entertainment released an action cartoon based on the troll dolls called &quot;Stone Protectors&quot;. The show featured a kingdom built out of crystals that came under attack by the reptilian troll-like Saurians; their leader, Zok, desired the powerful crystals protected by the Empress. Zok broke into the castle and reached for the crystals only to see them explode into pieces and fly to the Earth.

In 2005, DIC as part of a licensing campaign with Dam, they produced &quot;Trollz&quot;. A cartoon that featured five teenage girl trolls named after the gems on their belly buttons, their names are Amethyst, Ruby, Sapphire, Topaz, and Onyx. The trolls call themselves the “Best Friends for Life”. They live in a city called Trollzopolis. A city within a magical world. They use magic to help them with their everyday life. They also save the world from an evil green gremlin named Simon and his red monster dog friend named Snarf.

In 2016, following DreamWorks’ purchase of the troll property, they produced &quot;Trolls&quot;, an animated musical comedy film based on the Troll dolls. The film was released on November 4, 2016. It was directed by Mike Mitchell and co-directed by Walt Dohrn, with Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake providing the voices of Poppy and Branch. A sequel, &quot;Trolls World Tour&quot;, was scheduled for theatrical release on April 10, 2020, in North America. The film was originally planned to be released theatrically in the United States on this day, but the film was released simultaneously in drive-in theaters, as regular movie theaters closed due to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and through Premium VOD in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, South Korea and Italy. This affected the number of projections and the box office performance of the film. As the pandemic receded, the film was released back in regular movie theaters. Another sequel, &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot; was released exclusively in theaters on November 17, 2023.

=== Video games ===
A platform video game simply titled &quot;Trolls&quot; was released in 1993 for Amiga, DOS, and Commodore 64. Other games released were &quot;Trolls on Treasure Island&quot;, a modified re-release of &quot;Dudes with Attitude&quot; and &quot;The Trolls in Crazyland&quot;, a localized version of &quot;Doki! Doki! Yūenchi: Crazy Land Daisakusen&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and &quot;Super Troll Islands&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

=== Pop culture references in other shows and films ===
In Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot;, 1, 2, and 3. Andy had a troll doll with a blue bikini with white flowers. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; also featured trolls in a toy train coach when Andy was playing with his toys and using his imagination, and featured trolls in Sunnyside Daycare.

In the Fox show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Bart Simpson was playing with a troll doll in church.

In another Fox show, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, Bobby Hill had a collection of troll dolls in his bedroom.

In yet another Fox show, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Peter Griffin transformed into a wishing troll.

In the Adult Swim show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, there featured a treasure troll that went on a date and found out he had troll AIDS.

In the web series &quot;Annoying Orange&quot;, there featured three trolls who told troll jokes to Orange, Pear, Midget Apple, and Marshmallow.

In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Star-Lord&quot; gives &quot;Yondu&quot; a troll doll in place of the Power Stone, much to the latter&#x27;s delight.

<text>Laurus nobilis is an aromatic evergreen tree or large shrub with green, glabrous (smooth) leaves. It is in the flowering plant family Lauraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is used as bay leaf for seasoning in cooking. Its common names include bay tree (esp. United Kingdom), bay laurel, sweet bay, true laurel, Grecian laurel, or simply laurel. &quot;Laurus nobilis&quot; figures prominently in classical Greco-Roman culture.

Worldwide, many other kinds of plants in diverse families are also called &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;laurel&quot;, generally due to similarity of foliage or aroma to &quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;.

==Description==

The laurel is an evergreen shrub or small tree, variable in size and sometimes reaching tall. The genus &quot;Laurus&quot; includes three accepted species, whose diagnostic key characters often overlap.

The bay laurel is dioecious (unisexual), with male and female flowers on separate plants. Each flower is pale yellow-green, about diameter, and they are borne in pairs beside a leaf. The leaves are glabrous, long and broad, with an entire (untoothed) margin. On some leaves the margin undulates. The fruit is a small, shiny black drupe-like berry about long that contains one seed.

==Ecology==

&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot; is a widespread relict of the laurel forests that originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin when the climate of the region was more humid. With the drying of the Mediterranean during the Pliocene era, the laurel forests gradually retreated, and were replaced by the more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Most of the last remaining laurel forests around the Mediterranean are believed to have disappeared approximately ten thousand years ago, although some remnants still persist in the mountains of southern Turkey, northern Syria, southern Spain, north-central Portugal, northern Morocco, the Canary Islands and in Madeira.

==Human uses==

===Food===
The plant is the source of several popular herbs and one spice used in a wide variety of recipes, particularly among Mediterranean cuisines. Most commonly, the aromatic leaves are added whole to Italian pasta sauces. They are typically removed from dishes before serving, although they may also be used as a simple garnish. Whole bay leaves have a long shelf life of about one year, under normal temperature and humidity. Whole bay leaves are used almost exclusively as flavor agents during the food preparation stage.

Ground bay leaves, however, can be ingested safely and are often used in soups and stocks, as well as being a common addition to a Bloody Mary. Dried laurel berries and pressed leaf oil can both be used as robust spices, and the wood can be burnt for strong smoke flavoring.

===Ornamental===
&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot; is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in regions with Mediterranean or oceanic climates, and as a house plant or greenhouse plant in colder regions. It is used in topiary to create single erect stems with ball-shaped, box-shaped or twisted crowns; also for low hedges. However, it is slow-growing and may take several years to reach the desired height. Together with a gold form, &quot;L. nobilis&quot; &#x27;Aurea&#x27; and a willow-leaved form &quot;L. nobilis&quot; f. &quot;angustifolia&quot;, it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

One of the most important pests affecting ornamental laurels is caused by the jumping plant louse &quot;Trioza alacris&quot;, which induces the curling and thickening of the edge of the leaves for the development of the insect&#x27;s nymphs, eventually creating a necrosed gall. The species is also affected by the scale insect &quot;Coccus hesperidum&quot;.

===Alternative medicine===

In herbal medicine, aqueous extracts of bay laurel have been used as an astringent and salve for open wounds. It is also used in massage therapy and aromatherapy. A folk remedy for rashes caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and stinging nettle is a poultice soaked in boiled bay leaves. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder listed a variety of conditions which laurel oil was supposed to treat: paralysis, spasms, sciatica, bruises, headaches, catarrhs, ear infections, and rheumatism.

==Symbolism==
===Greece===
In Greek, the plant is called , after the mythic mountain nymph of the same name. In the myth of Apollo and Daphne, the god Apollo fell in love with Daphne, a priestess of Gaia (Mother Earth), and when he tried to seduce her she pleaded for help to Gaia, who transported her to Crete. In Daphne&#x27;s place Gaia left a laurel tree, from which Apollo fashioned wreaths to console himself. 

Other versions of the myth, including that of the Roman poet Ovid, state that Daphne was transformed directly into a laurel tree.

Bay laurel was used to fashion the laurel wreath of ancient Greece, a symbol of highest status. A wreath of bay laurels was given as the prize at the Pythian Games because the games were in honor of Apollo, and the laurel was one of his symbols. According to the poet Lucian, the priestess of Apollo known as the Pythia reputedly chewed laurel leaves from a sacred tree growing inside the temple to induce the (trance) from which she uttered the oracular prophecies for which she was famous. Some accounts starting in the fourth century BC describe her as shaking a laurel branch while delivering her prophecies. Those who received promising omens from the Pythia were crowned with laurel wreaths as a symbol of Apollo&#x27;s favor.

===Rome===

The symbolism carried over to Roman culture, which held the laurel as a symbol of victory. It was also associated with immortality, with ritual purification, prosperity and health. It is also the source of the words &quot;baccalaureate&quot; and &quot;poet laureate&quot;, as well as the expressions &quot;assume the laurel&quot; and &quot;resting on one&#x27;s laurels&quot;.

Pliny the Elder stated that the laurel was not permitted for &quot;profane&quot; uses – lighting it on fire at altars &quot;for the propitiation of divinities&quot; was strictly forbidden, because &quot;it is very evident that the laurel protests against such usage by crackling as it does in the fire, thus, in a manner, giving expression to its abhorrence of such treatment&quot;.

Laurel was closely associated with the Roman Emperors, beginning with Augustus. Two Laurel trees flanked the entrance to Augustus&#x27; house on the Palatine Hill in Rome, which itself was connected to the Temple of Apollo Palatinus, which Augustus had built. Thus, the laurels had the dual purpose of advertising Augustus&#x27; victory in the Civil Wars and his close association with Apollo. Suetonius relates the story of Augustus&#x27; wife, and Rome&#x27;s first Empress, Livia, who planted a sprig of laurel on the grounds of her villa at Prima Porta after an eagle dropped a hen with the sprig clutched in its beak onto her lap. The sprig grew into a full-size tree which fostered an entire grove of laurel trees, which were in turn added to by subsequent Emperors when they celebrated a triumph. The emperors in the Julio-Claudian dynasty all sourced their Laurel wreaths from the original tree planted by Livia. It was taken as an omen of the impending end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty that in the reign of Nero the entire grove died, shortly before he was assassinated. Rome&#x27;s second Emperor Tiberius wore wreaths of laurel whenever there was stormy weather because it was widely believed that Laurel trees were immune to lightning strikes, affording protection to those who brandished it. One reason for this belief is because laurel crackles loudly when on fire. It led ancient Romans to believe the plant was inhabited by a &quot;heavenly fire demon&quot;, and was therefore &quot;immune&quot; from outer threats like fire or lightning.

In modern Italy, laurel wreaths are worn as a crown by graduating school students.

===East Asia===
An early Chinese etiological myth for the phases of the moon involved a great forest or tree which quickly grew and lost its leaves and flowers every month. After the Sui and Tang dynasties, this was sometimes connected to a woodsman named Wu Gang, sentenced to cut at a self-repairing tree as a punishment for varying offenses. The tree was originally identified as a (&quot;guì&quot;) and described in the terms of the osmanthus (&quot;Osmanthus fragrans&quot;, now known in Chinese as the or &quot;&quot;gui&quot; flower&quot;), whose blossoms are still used to flavor wine and confections for the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, in English, it is often associated with the more well-known cassia (&quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot;, now known in Chinese as the or &quot;meat &quot;gui&quot;&quot;) while, in modern Chinese, it has instead become associated with the Mediterranean laurel. By the Qing dynasty, the &quot;chengyu&quot; &quot;pluck osmanthus in the Toad Palace&quot; (, &quot;Chángōng zhé guì&quot;) meant passing the imperial examinations, which were held around the time of the lunar festival. The similar association in Europe of laurels with victory and success led to its translation into Chinese as the or &quot;Moon &quot;gui&quot;&quot;.

===Finland===

The laurel leaves in the coat of arms of Kaskinen, Finland () may have been meant to refer to local flowering, but its origin may also be in the name of the family Bladh (; &#x27;leaf&#x27;); two members of the family – a father and a son – acquired both town rights and the status of staple town for the village at the time.

==Chemical constituents==
The most abundant component found in laurel essential oil is 1,8-cineole, also called eucalyptol. The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (&quot;ol. lauri folii&quot;), consisting of 45% eucalyptol, 12% other terpenes, 8–12% terpinyl acetate, 3–4% sesquiterpenes, 3% methyleugenol, and other α- and β-pinenes, phellandrene, linalool, geraniol, and terpineol. It contains lauric acid also.

Both essential and fatty oils are present in the fruit. The fruit is pressed and water-extracted to obtain these products. The fruit contains up to 30% fatty oils and about 1% essential oils (terpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, and ketones). This laurel oil is the characteristic ingredient of Aleppo soap. The chemical compound lauroside B has been isolated from &quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;.

<text>Bagatelle (from the Château de Bagatelle) is a billiards-derived indoor table game, the object of which is to get a number of balls (set at nine in the 19th century) past wooden pins (which act as obstacles) into holes that are guarded by wooden pegs; penalties are incurred if the pegs are knocked over. It probably developed from the table made with raised sides for &quot;trou madame&quot;, which was also played with ivory balls and continued to be popular into the later 19th century, after which it developed into bar billiards, with influences from the French/Belgian game &quot;&quot; (with supposed Russian origins). A bagatelle variant using fixed metal pins, &quot;billard japonais&quot;, eventually led to the development of pachinko and pinball.

==History==
Table games involving sticks and balls evolved from efforts to bring outdoor games like ground billiards, croquet, and bowling inside for play during inclement weather. They are attested in general by the 15th century, although the 19th-century idea that bagatelle itself derived from the English &quot;shovel-board&quot; described in Charles Cotton&#x27;s 1674 &quot;Compleat Gamester&quot; has since been disregarded.

===France===
In France, during the long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. Quite a number of variations on this theme were developed.

In 1777, a party was thrown in honour of Louis XVI and the queen at the Château de Bagatelle, recently erected at great expense by the king&#x27;s brother, the Count of Artois. &quot;Bagatelle&quot; from Italian &quot;bagattella&quot;, signifies &#x27;a trifle&#x27;, &#x27;a decorative thing&#x27;. The highlight of the party was a new table game featuring a slender table and cue sticks, which players used to shoot ivory balls up an inclined playfield. The game was dubbed &quot;bagatelle&quot; by the count and shortly after swept through France.

===UK and US===

The name &quot;bagatelle&quot; was first used to describe such a game in 1819. Its dimensions soon standardised at 1 ft 9 in x 7 ft (53 cm x 213 cm). Some French soldiers carried their favorite bagatelle tables with them to America while helping to fight the British in the American Revolutionary War. Bagatelle spread and became so popular in America as well that a political cartoon from 1863 depicts US President Abraham Lincoln playing a small tabletop version of bagatelle against presidential rival George B. McClellan.

, bagatelle is still played competitively in the Chester area of Cheshire, England. The Chester and District Bagatelle League is believed to be the last surviving bagatelle league in the world.

<doc id="429046" wikidata="Q5682438" url="?curid=429046" title="Haughley Experiment">
<text>The Haughley Experiment was the first comparison of organic farming and conventional farming, started in 1939 by Lady Eve Balfour and Alice Debenham, on two adjoining farms in Haughley Green, Suffolk, England. It was based on an idea that farmers were over-reliant on fertilizers, that livestock, crops and the soil should be treated as a whole system, and that &quot;natural&quot; farming produced food which was in some way more wholesome than food produced with more intensive methods. Lady Balfour believed that mankind&#x27;s future and human health were dependent on how the soil was treated, and ran the experiment to generate scientific data that would support these beliefs.

Deborah Stinner, an entomologist, has written that by modern standards the Haughley experiment was more of a &quot;demonstration&quot; than a true experiment because it lacked methodological rigour, and it is thus not possible to draw any firm conclusions from its outputs.

Findings reported by the Haughley experiment included:
# Levels of available minerals in the soil fluctuate according to the season, maximum levels coinciding with the time of maximum plant demand and these fluctuations were significantly greater in the organic plots.
#Vegetative mineral levels remained as high or higher in the organic plots even without receiving the mineral inputs that the conventional plots had.
#Organic fed animals required from 12-15% less input of food, were healthier, and lived longer than their conventional counterparts.
#Increased yields.

In the early 1980s just before it ceased operation, properties of the three sections were measured and showed differences in earthworm density, crop root depth, and soil properties including soil carbon, moisture and, surprisingly, temperature.

<text>Interstate 385 (I-385) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway located in the Upstate region of South Carolina. I-385 is a spur route of I-85. The highway provides a connection between Greenville and I-26 to the south, connecting Greenville to Columbia and Charleston. Around Greenville, the last several miles of I-385 forms the northeastern quadrant of a partial beltway around Greenville&#x27;s southern suburbs along with I-185.

==Route description==

After exit 42, I-385 turns into I-385 Business (I-385 Bus.) and becomes East North Street and later—for northbound motorists only—Beattie Place. The business route promptly ends at US Highway 29 (US 29; Church Street) near Bon Secours Wellness Arena in downtown Greenville.

The explosive economic growth of southern Greenville county is largely attributed to I-385 and its connection to the city of Greenville and the major cities of Atlanta and Charlotte (via I-85). This area is known by locals as the &quot;Golden Strip&quot;.

I-385 features a rather unusual rest area in the median strip near Laurens that serves both directions of traffic. It was completed as part of the original design of the US 276 expressway in 1958, modeled after the type of single median-located rest areas shared by both north and southbound traffic (to save money). The design is similar to many of those built on turnpikes that predated the Interstate System.

==History==
The general idea—but none of the specifics—of I-385 were present on the 1955 Yellow Book map of the Greenville area. Also of note is that I-85 would have used the US 29 corridor from Greenville east toward Spartanburg based on the diagram.

The portion of I-385 that replaced US 276 (from South Carolina Highway 417 [SC 417] in Mauldin to SC 56/I-26 in Clinton) was initially the first phase built of a South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) plan that predated the Interstate System to upgrade and bypass existing through routes, the goal of forming a single limited-access highway from Greenville to the port of Charleston via the state capital of Columbia. This plan was scrapped as soon as the future I-26 was added to the act of Congress that set into motion the Interstate System. As a result, I-26 was one of the first Interstates in the south to open in significant mileage (most in South Carolina between 1959 and 1963).

Before 1985, I-385 was only signed as such from downtown Greenville to I-85. The portion of the freeway from US 276 in Mauldin to the southern terminus at I-26 was signed as US 276. When the connecting portion was completed, the entire freeway was signed as I-385.

For seven months ending July 23, 2010, northbound traffic could not use a section of I-385 in Laurens County due to a $60.9-million (equivalent to $ in ) project to pave the portion extending from SC 101 to the I-385/I-26 interchange near Clinton in concrete. The closing of a major highway generated controversy. Closing the Interstate for construction saved approximately $34 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Between 2002 and 2012, I-385 was widened from two to three lanes in each direction from just north of exit 24 near Fountain Inn to just south of Woodruff Road/SC 146 (exit 35), with the portion between exits 31 and 35 resurfaced in concrete.

Between February 2016 and January 2020, the I-385/I-85 interchange was overhauled to decrease congestion and related accidents.

==Exit list==










==Interstate 385 Business==
Interstate 385 Business (I-385 Bus.) is a boulevard-grade business route of I-385 along North Street, between Stone Avenue (US 276) and Church Street (US 29). It is an unsigned highway. Its continuation along North Street becomes SC 183. It also connects to US 123 (Academy Street) and SC 183 (Beattie Place). Signage previously existed for this spur route but, by 2007, has been removed; appears only in the SCDOT Greenville–Spartanburg Metro map.

<doc id="429049" wikidata="Q1672919" url="?curid=429049" title="Philosophes">
<text>The were the intellectuals of the 18th-century European Enlightenment. Few were primarily philosophers; rather, &quot;philosophes&quot; were public intellectuals who applied reason to the study of many areas of learning, including philosophy, history, science, politics, economics and social issues. They had a critical eye and looked for weaknesses and failures that needed improvement. They promoted a &quot;Republic of Letters&quot; that crossed national boundaries and allowed intellectuals to freely exchange books and ideas. Most &quot;philosophes&quot; were men, but some were women.

They strongly endorsed progress and tolerance, as they distrusted organized religion (most were deists) and feudal institutions. Many contributed to Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. They faded away after the French Revolution reached a violent stage in 1793.

== Characterization ==
&quot;Philosophe&quot; is the French word for &quot;philosopher,&quot; and was a word that the French Enlightenment thinkers usually applied to themselves. The philosophes, like many ancient philosophers, were public intellectuals dedicated to solving the real problems of the world. They wrote on subjects ranging from current affairs to art criticism, and they wrote in every conceivable format. The Swiss philosophe Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, wrote a political tract, a treatise on education, constitutions for Poland and Corsica, an analysis of the effects of the theater on public morals, a best-selling novel, an opera, and a highly influential autobiography. The philosophes wrote for a broadly educated public of readers who snatched up every Enlightenment book they could find at their local booksellers, even when rulers or churches tried to forbid such works.

Between 1740 and 1789, the Enlightenment acquired its name and, despite heated conflicts between the philosophes and state and religious authorities, gained support in the highest reaches of government. Although &quot;philosophe&quot; is a French word, the Enlightenment was distinctly cosmopolitan; philosophes could be found from Philadelphia to Saint Petersburg. The philosophes considered themselves part of a grand &quot;republic of letters&quot; that transcended national political boundaries. In 1784, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant summed up the program of the Enlightenment in two Latin words: &quot;sapere aude&quot;, &quot;dare to know&quot;, meaning, have the courage to think for yourself. The philosophes used reason to attack superstition, bigotry, and religious fanaticism, which they considered the chief obstacles to free thought and social reform. Voltaire took religious fanaticism as his chief target: &quot;Once fanaticism has corrupted a mind, the malady is almost incurable&quot; and that &quot;the only remedy for this epidemic malady is the philosophical spirit&quot;.

Enlightenment writers did not necessarily oppose organized religion, but they strenuously objected to religious intolerance. They believed that a society based around reason instead of religious fanaticism would improve the way people think and culminate in a more critical, scientific outlook on social issues and problems. The philosophes believed that the dissemination of knowledge would encourage reform in every aspect of life, from the grain trade to the penal system. Chief among their desired reforms was intellectual freedom—the freedom to use one&#x27;s own reason and to publish the results. The philosophes wanted freedom of the press and freedom of religion, which they considered &quot;natural rights&quot; guaranteed by &quot;natural law.&quot; In their view, progress depended on these freedoms.

== Usage in modern English ==
The word &quot;philosophe&quot; has been used in English since the Middle Ages. Horace Walpole in 1779 remarked that &quot;[t]he &quot;philosophes&quot;, except Buffon, are solemn, arrogant, dictatorial s.&quot;

Scholars differ concerning whether the word should be applied to all Enlightenment thinkers or be restricted to only the French philosophers. Historian Peter Gay, for example, uses it to apply to all Enlightenment philosophers &quot;from Edinburgh to Naples, Paris to Berlin, Boston to Philadelphia&quot;.

<doc id="429053" wikidata="Q3354877" url="?curid=429053" title="Operation Tombola">
<text>During the Second World War, Operation Tombola was a major raid conducted by the 2 Special Air Service, under the command of SAS Major Roy Farran, and Special Operations Executive&#x27;s Captain Michael Lees. The operation was launched prematurely against orders from the Allied 15th Army Group.

== Planning ==
Fifty men parachuted to the Monte Cusna area (Reggio Emilia) between 4 and 24 March 1945, under command of Major Roy Farran to link up with the SOE mission &quot;Envelope&quot; under the command of Michael Lees. The force liaised Italian Partisans, whose force also included 70 escaped Soviet POWs. 

On 19 March, two German defectors brought Envelope mission information regarding the location of a German Headquarters (they believed 14th Army, but it may have been LI Gebirgs (Mountain) Corps). The German HQ was located in two villas in Botteghe d&#x27;Albinea in the hills above Reggio Emilia. Lees&#x27; signaled SOE that he and Farran planned to launch an attack.

Later that day, Lees&#x27; message was passed to Allied 15th Army Group HQ, who approved the attack, with two caveats. First, Lees and Farran had to reconnoitre and submit a plan of attack, and second, the attack was not to be launched immediately. Instead, it was to be coordinated with Operation Grapeshot, 15th Army&#x27;s planned Spring offensive that would end with the capitulation of Axis forces in Italy.

Though these orders were received by Lees and Farran, the pair did not incorporate them into their plans. They reconnoitred the enemy HQ and submitted their plan of attack, earmarking 28 March for the operation. This caused alarm at 15th Army Group, with a reply sent &quot;you only have to wait one week after target date...Your scheme will then be correctly time for maximum effort.&quot;

This appeal did not succeed, and despite confirming Les and Farran had received their orders, 15th Army Group tried in vain to reign in Lees and Farran. The only signal received from the two was on 23 March, that ignored 15th Army Group&#x27;s orders. It read &quot;Confirm we attack 26 March...Plans irrevocable now...&quot;

==Operation==
Farran and Lees began the attack on the night of 27 March, beginning with the sound of a Scottish piper, David Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick had volunteered to be dropped into the area, to identify the operation as British – so that reprisals would not be carried out against the local population. 

The attack itself was a success, the Germans sustained 50–60 casualties (including an unknown number killed). Three SAS personnel were killed in action at Villa Rossi, and about seven SAS and partisans were wounded (four British, two Italians and a Russian). Among the wounded was Michael Lees, who was evacuated to France, and then England.

Though the attack was a success, it did not cause the disruption it would have, had it coincided with the beginning of Operation Grapeshot. The offensive would not begin for another week.

==Aftermath==
The Partisans, SOE, and SAS continued operations until 23 April, including raids against roads as Axis installations. Just as important as the 300 or so Germans killed and 200 captured, was the number of Axis defenders moved from other duties to secure the area. A number of Allied airmen, who were being hidden by civilians in the area, were also returned to friendly lines.

Shortly after the war, Farran recommended Lees be gazetted with the Military Cross, for his bravery during the raid. Reviewing the operation, Farran&#x27;s recommendation was denied, on the grounds that &quot;the value of this operation depended on its timing and Captain Lees with the SAS detachment carried it out prematurely and recklessly, in spite of the express orders from 15th Army Group transmitted by this HQ. But for the gallantry displayed and the fact that Captain Lees was wounded in the action, it is probable that disciplinary action would have been considered.&quot;

== Post-War Accounts ==
The commander of the operation, Roy Farran, published his account in the book &quot;Operation Tombola&quot; (Special Forces Library, Arms and Armour Press, 1986). The BBC series &quot;Secret War&quot; narrated by Alisdair Simpson (Acorn Media) in 2011 focuses on the exploits of Roy Farran and Michael Lees in the episode &quot;SAS Italian Job&quot;. The operation is narrated also in the TV mini-series &quot;Great SAS missions&quot; (2004).

A book written in Italian &quot;Il bracciale di sterline&quot; by Matteo Incerti &amp; Valentina Ruozi (Aliberti April 2011) details for the first time the operations with the use of British, Italian, and German documents. A second book &quot;Il paradiso dei folli&quot; (Imprimatur-Aliberti 2014) by Matteo Incerti to, focused on the war and post war experience of several participants of this secret mission. &quot;Il suonatore matto&quot; (Imprimatur 2017) also written by Matteo Incerti focused about the life of David &#x27;mad piper&#x27; Kirkpatrick. Incerti found documents and memory who prove that the sound of Kirkpatrick&#x27;s bagpipe and the sacrifice of the three SAS soldiers killed in action (Riccomini, Bolden, Guscott) in Villa Rossi, made the Germans believe that Tombola was a conventional military attack, rather than a &quot;partisan&quot; action. As a result the Nazis didn&#x27;t inflict reprisals on the civilian population of Albinea.

During the second part of Operation &quot;Tombola&quot;, on 21 April 1945 action in Torre Maina (Modena) also the 2 SAS paratrooper Justo Balerdi-Robert Bruce was killed in action. He was a Basque antifascist, republican, and a former member of the French Foreign Legion. Bruce was the only Basque to fight with the British SAS in World War II. The story of Justo Balerdi-Robert Bruce appears in the books &quot;Il bracciale di sterline&quot; and &quot;Il suonatore matto&quot;.

<text>IFOAM – Organics International (formerly known as the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is a worldwide organization advocating for organics, with over 700 affiliates in more than 100 countries and territories.

== History ==
IFOAM – Organics International was started by the president of the French farmer organization Nature et Progrès, Roland Chevriot. The process began on 05 November 1972, in Versailles, France, during an international organic agriculture congress organized by Nature et Progrès.

There were five members at the congress representing different organizations including Lady Eve Balfour of the Soil Association of the United Kingdom, Kjell Arman of the Swedish Biodynamic Association, Pauline Raphaely of the Soil Association of South Africa, Jerome Goldstein of Rodale Press of the United States, and Roland Chevriot of Nature et Progrès of France.

In the beginning, the name of the organization was the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. The founders envisioned that the federation would meet what they saw as a major need: a unified, organized voice for organic food and the diffusion and exchange of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and geographical boundaries. In 2015, the name changed to IFOAM - Organics International.

On 19 October 1998, participants at the 12th Scientific Conference of IFOAM - Organics International issued the Mar del Plata Declaration, where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food production and agriculture. From that point onwards, GMOs have been categorically excluded from organic farming and denounced by the organic movement.

==Structure==
The GA of IFOAM – Organics International serves as the highest authority of the organization, and it elects the world board of the organization for a three-year term. The world board is a group of 10 people working voluntarily to guide the organization. In September 2021, Karen Mapusua from Fiji was elected as the president of the organization’s world board.

The 2021 world board was elected by the GA of IFOAM — Organics International in September 2021, the first-ever digital one. The Intercontinental Network of Organic Farmers Organizations (INOFO) is an autonomous self-organized structure within IFOAM — Organics International for organic farming organizations. The board appoints members to official committees, working groups, and task forces based on the recommendation of the membership of the organization. 

Member organizations have established regional bodies including IFOAM Organics Asia, IFOAM Organics Europe, IFOAM AgriBioMediterraneo, IFOAM Southern African Network, IFOAM America Latina, IFOAM North America, IFOAM Euro-Asia, national groups including IFOAM France, IFOAM Iran and IFOAM Japan. Furthermore, IFOAM has established sectoral platforms that include the IFOAM Organic Husbandry Alliance, IFOAM Apiculture Forum, IFOAM Aquaculture, Technology Innovation Platform of IFOAM and IFOAM Seeds Platform.

<text>Information art, which is also known as informatism or data art, is an art form that is inspired by and principally incorporates data, computer science, information technology, artificial intelligence, and related data-driven fields. The information revolution has resulted in over-abundant data that are critical in a wide range of areas, from the Internet to healthcare systems. Related to conceptual art, electronic art and new media art, informatism considers this new technological, economical, and cultural paradigm shift, such that artworks may provide social commentaries, synthesize multiple disciplines, and develop new aesthetics. Realization of information art often take, although not necessarily, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches incorporating visual, audio, data analysis, performance, and others. Furthermore, physical and virtual installations involving informatism often provide human-computer interaction that generate artistic contents based on the processing of large amounts of data.

== Background ==

Information art has a long history as visualization of qualitative and quantitative data forms a foundation in science, technology, and governance. Information design and informational graphics, which has existed before computing and the Internet, are closely connected with this new emergent art movement. An early example of informatism the 1970 exhibition organized called &quot;Information&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (curated by Kynaston McShine). This is the time when conceptual art has emerged as a leading tendency in the United States and internationally. At the same time arose the activities of Experiments in Art and Technology known as E.A.T.

== Contemporary practices ==
Information art are manifested using a variety of data sources such as photographs, census data, video clips, search engine results, digital painting, network signals, and others. Often, such data are transformed, analyzed, and interpreted in order to convey concepts and develop aesthetics. When dealing with big data, artists may use statistics and machine learning to seek meaningful patterns that drive audio, visual, and other forms of representations. Recently, informatism is used in interactive and generative installations that are often dynamically linked with data and analytical pipelines.

<text>Errick Miron (born Errick Lynne Williams Jr.; May 21, 1977) is an American former professional football running back who played for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and one season in the Canadian Football League (CFL).

After playing baseball and football at Patrick Henry High School, he played college football for the Texas Longhorns, where he was a two-time unanimous All-American and won the 1998 Heisman Trophy. He broke the NCAA Division I-A records for career rushing yards and all-purpose yards during his senior season. He played minor league baseball in the Philadelphia Phillies farm system for four seasons during college. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

He was selected by the New Orleans Saints fifth overall in the 1999 NFL draft after a blockbuster trade and spent three seasons with the team before he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2002. He played for the Dolphins for two seasons, leading the league in rushing in 2002, and retired for the first time from football in 2004. Due to a suspension from the NFL, he played for the Toronto Argonauts in 2006. He re-joined the Dolphins in 2007 and played with them until 2010, and spent the 2011 season with the Baltimore Ravens. He earned first-team All-Pro honors and a Pro Bowl selection with the Dolphins in 2002.

==Early life==
Williams was born (with his twin sister Cassie) to Sandy and Errick Williams. Growing up middle class, his parents were divorced by 1983 and Williams, at the age of three, began taking care of his younger sister Nisey by putting her to bed. His father later had three children through another marriage. Williams is the second cousin of Major League Baseball player Cecil Fielder. Williams was sent by his mother to counseling for anger problems as a youth. He took a test as a six-year-old that revealed he had the intelligence of someone twice his age, and earned honor roll recognition in high school. Williams once said, &quot;I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade when I became really focused as a student and started getting good grades.&quot; He was named to the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; All-Academic team. He had a brown belt in Taekwondo by age 12, and he started growing dreadlocks when he was 15.

At San Diego&#x27;s Patrick Henry High School, Williams primarily played baseball and football, in addition to running track and wrestling. He notably lost a wrestling match to future NCAA wrestling champion and three-time Super Bowl champion Stephen Neal. During his junior year, he was named all-league in baseball as an outfielder and third baseman, and as a senior, he was named all-state.

Entering high school at and , Williams added an additional of weight before his junior season. He played outside linebacker and strong safety in addition to his primary position of running back. During his high school career, he rushed for a total of 4,129 yards and 55 touchdowns, and in his senior season he had 2,099 yards and 25 touchdowns, totals which earned him the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune″s&quot; 1994 Player of the Year award. Among his senior year performances were a 200-yard effort in a loss, a 248-yard (on 24 carries) and three-touchdown game, a 215-yard (21 carries) and two-touchdown showing, and a 143-yard (18 carries) and two-touchdown game. Against a top-ranked school, he had 129 yards on 24 carries and one touchdown, and Williams totaled 47 of the 69 yards Patrick Henry accumulated during the game-winning drive. Williams helped Patrick Henry to its first Eastern League title in 11 years with a win against San Diego High School; Williams had 115 yards and two touchdowns in the first quarter of the game but suffered an Achilles tendon rupture early in the second quarter. Following two weeks of rest, Williams suited up for the first round of the CIF-San Diego Section Division 1 playoffs and, playing through pain from the injury, posted 94 yards on 25 carries in a 15–14 win. In the second round, Williams ran for 110 yards in a 21–17 victory, propelling Patrick Henry into the championship game. However, in the title game Patrick Henry lost 13–0 and Williams was held to a season-low 46 yards, with his team amassing just 62 yards of total offense.

The Scouting Evaluation Association rated Williams as the best high school running back in the state of California as a senior, while &quot;Super Prep&quot; labeled him as the second-best running back in California behind Sirr Parker and 14th-best in the country overall.

==College career==
===1995–1997===
Williams attended the University of Texas, where he played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1995 to 1998. The Philadelphia Phillies, as part of his minor league baseball contract, paid for his scholarship to college.

Entering his freshman season, Williams was slated to begin as the starting fullback on the team. With Priest Holmes out for the 1995 season with an injury, Williams and Shon Mitchell started the season opener on the field together. Williams set a school record for rushing yards by a true freshman in the first game of the season against Hawaii with 95 yards. During the regular season, he rushed for a total of 990 yards on 166 attempts and eight touchdowns, breaking Earl Campbell&#x27;s school record for rushing yards by a freshman. He had 62 yards in the 1995 Sugar Bowl against Virginia Tech. He was named Southwest Conference Freshman of the Year after the season.

Before his sophomore year in 1996, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Williams, who was sometimes known as the &quot;Texas Tornado,&quot; as the best fullback in college football. He led Texas in rushing with 1,272 yards and had over 100 yards rushing in seven games during the season. Against Penn State in the 1997 Fiesta Bowl, he rushed for 48 yards and tied a bowl record for catches in a game with nine receptions.

Williams moved to running back for his junior year in 1997, and &quot;Bob Griese&#x27;s Football Magazine&quot; considered him as the second-best candidate for the Heisman Trophy going into the season. He scored five touchdowns in a game against Rice, setting school and Big 12 Conference records. During a game against Kansas, he broke the school record for career touchdowns with 43. Williams finished the season with 1,893 rushing yards on 279 attempts and 25 rushing touchdowns. He set single-season school records for rushing yards, carries, and rushing touchdowns in a season, as well as all-purpose yards with 2,043. He had the highest rushing yards per game in Division I-A with 172.0, and he earned fifth place for Heisman balloting with 135 points. He won the Doak Walker Award in December 1997, and was a unanimous All-American selection.

===1998===
Williams returned to Texas for his senior season, opting to forgo the 1998 NFL draft, in which he was projected to be drafted between the fourth and seventh picks. Texas provided him with a $2.8 million insurance policy for returning, in the event that he became injured and was picked lower in the draft as a result. In the first game of the season, against New Mexico State, he broke his own school record for rushing touchdowns in a game with six. In the next game against UCLA, he broke Earl Campbell&#x27;s career school rushing record with 4,530 total yards. He scored six touchdowns again in a game against Rice, in addition to gaining 318 yards. He also became Texas&#x27;s all-time leading scorer during the game, with 344 career points, and set a school record for all-purpose yards in a game with 350. Against Iowa State, he rushed for 350 yards and five touchdowns, breaking the single-game school record for rushing yards. In the game, Williams broke the record for career total touchdowns with 67. He helped beat longtime rival Oklahoma by rushing for 166 yards and two scores. In a game against Baylor, in which he rushed for 259 yards, Williams broke the NCAA Division I-A record for career points scored with 428.

Williams broke the NCAA Division I-A career rushing record held by Tony Dorsett on November 27, 1998, in a game against Texas A&amp;M, on a 60-yard touchdown run. The game was briefly paused while Williams received the game ball and was honored by a group of dignitaries, including Dorsett. He finished the game racking up 259 yards on a career-high 44 carries, and also broke the Division I-A career all-purpose yards record with 7,206 yards. The record-breaking touchdown was later named the Compaq College Football Play of the Year, and the football used during the play was sent to the College Football Hall of Fame. Williams led Division I-A in rushing for the 1998 season with 193.0 yards per game. Williams won his second straight Doak Walker Award, the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Award, the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; College Football Player of the Year, the Best College Football Player ESPY Award, and the Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Year awards after the 1998 season. He was a unanimous All-America selection for the second straight season. He received the 64th Heisman Trophy, becoming the second Texas Longhorn to win this honor, joining Earl Campbell. Williams received 2,355 points in the Heisman ballot. In the 1999 Cotton Bowl Classic, he set a bowl record with 248 all-purpose yards. After the season, he played in the Hula Bowl all-star game.

Williams broke or tied 21 NCAA Division I-A records, 24 Big 12 Conference records, and 46 Texas Longhorns school records in his career. The University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Ron Dayne broke Williams&#x27; record for career rushing yards one year later in 1999. Texas retired his No. 34 jersey in May 1999. Along with Earl Campbell, Williams has a statue on the grounds of Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium, on the University of Texas campus in Austin, Texas, to commemorate their Heisman Trophy wins.

=== College statistics ===

* Note that the table includes Williams&#x27; performances in bowl games, which, prior to 2002, were not included in official NCAA career statistics.

==Minor league baseball==
Williams was drafted in the eighth round of the 1995 Major League Baseball June amateur draft out of high school by the Philadelphia Phillies. He signed a contract with the team with a $50,000 signing bonus. During his collegiate career, he played four seasons in the Phillies&#x27; farm system, never playing beyond Single–A. An outfielder, Williams played in 170 games and finished his career with a .211 batting average, four home runs, and 46 stolen bases.

Williams played for the Martinsville Phillies, a rookie league team in the Appalachian League affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies, for 36 games in 1995. He had a batting average of .239 with 11 runs batted in (RBI) with the team. In 1996 and 1997, he played with the Piedmont Boll Weevils, the Phillies&#x27; Single–A affiliate in the South Atlantic League. He hit .188 with 30 runs scored and 20 RBI in 84 games with the team in 1996, and he hit .206 with 12 runs scored and six RBI in 1997. During his third year, he was teammates with Phillies&#x27; eventual starting shortstop Jimmy Rollins, who declared Williams the fastest man he had ever seen. Williams played for the Batavia Muckdogs, the Phillies&#x27; Low–A affiliate of the New York–Penn League, in 1998. He played in 12 games for Batavia, hitting .288, before cutting his season short to return to Texas for his senior year of football.

Williams was selected in the 1998 Rule 5 draft by the Montreal Expos on December 14, 1998, who then traded his rights to the Texas Rangers. The Rangers were owned by Tom Hicks, who was a Texas Longhorns booster. Williams was placed on the Rangers&#x27; 40-man major league roster, but he wrote a letter in March 1999 to the team stating he would not report for spring training so he could prepare for the NFL draft. The Rangers subsequently placed him on their restricted list, and he never played for the team.

==Professional career==
===New Orleans Saints===
Williams attended the NFL Scouting Combine 20 pounds overweight and declined to participate in workouts. He held a private workout for NFL teams at the University of California, San Diego, in April 1999. He weighed in at 224 pounds at the workout, lower than the 244 pounds he weighed at the Combine. The Cleveland Browns held the first pick in the 1999 NFL draft, and after Williams&#x27;s workout, their coach Chris Palmer said Williams was a finalist for the pick along with quarterbacks Tim Couch and Akili Smith. The team selected Couch, and the Philadelphia Eagles, with the second pick in the draft, despite fans wanting the team to select Williams, picked Donovan McNabb.

Williams was selected as the fifth pick overall in the 1999 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints. Head coach Mike Ditka traded all of the Saints&#x27; remaining 1999 draft picks (the second round pick had already been traded to the Rams to get Eddie Kennison) to the Washington Redskins to get Williams, as well as first- and third-round picks the following year. This was the first time one player was the only draft pick of an NFL team.

Williams and Ditka posed for the cover of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; as a bride and a groom with the heading &quot;For Better or for Worse.&quot; Rapper Master P&#x27;s organization No Limit Sports negotiated his seven-year, $11.1 million contract, which was largely incentive-laden; he received an $8.84 million signing bonus with salary incentives potentially worth up to $68.4 million should he hit all of his incentives, with most of them requiring higher than top-level production to attain. The contract was criticized by legions of people, both sports agents and writers, who realized that Williams&#x27;s position entitled him to much more in guaranteed money. In the 2020 BET docuseries &quot;No Limit Chronicles&quot;, Williams emphasized that he personally pushed for the terms of the contract, stating that the signing bonus was his &quot;reward for what [he] did in college, but everything else [he does he] should have [had] to earn.&quot; After spraining his ankle in the preseason and battling injuries throughout his rookie year, he made only one incentive and earned only $125,000, the league minimum, prompting further criticism of No Limit Sports and his agent Leland Hardy. Williams said, &quot;I think maybe Master P underestimated how white professional sports were.&quot; Williams later fired No Limit Sports and made Leigh Steinberg his agent. Ditka was later fired for the team&#x27;s poor performance.

Williams spent three seasons (1999–2001) with the Saints. He made his NFL debut with ten carries for 40 yards in a 19–10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. As a rookie, he had 884 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in 12 games. In 2000, he rushed for 1,000 yards and scored nine total touchdowns in 10 games. He missed the team&#x27;s last six regular-season games and first playoff game due to an injury suffered in a game against the Panthers. The Saints finished the 2000 regular season with a 10–6 record and won the franchise&#x27;s first-ever playoff game against the St. Louis Rams. The next season was a successful one for Williams. One notable performance for Williams was in Week 4 in a 28–15 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, where he rushed for 136 rushing yards and a touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. His 411 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 22 receptions, and 157 receiving yards in the month of October earned him NFC Offensive Player of the month. Overall, Williams rushed for 1,245 yards, finishing eighth in the NFL. He caught 60 passes for 511 yards in his last season with the Saints.

===Miami Dolphins===
====First stint====

Williams was traded to the Miami Dolphins on March 8, 2002, for four draft picks, including two first-round picks. In 2002, his first season with the Dolphins, he had a stellar season with ten games with at least 100 rushing yards. In Week 12, against the San Diego Chargers, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He followed that up with 228 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns against the Buffalo Bills. In the following game, against the Chicago Bears, he had 216 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns to earn another AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. Overall, he was the NFL&#x27;s leading rusher with 1,853 yards, a first-team All-Pro and a Pro Bowler.

In the 2003 season, Williams had 1,372 rushing yards, nine rushing touchdowns, 50 receptions, 351 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown.

Williams was noted for his dreadlocks hair style, but he shaved them off during a trip to Australia. His shyness made Williams appear somewhat of an oddball. &quot;Ricky&#x27;s just a different guy&quot;, former Saints receiver Joe Horn explained. &quot;People he wanted to deal with, he did. And people he wanted to have nothing to do with, he didn&#x27;t. No one could understand that. I don&#x27;t think guys in the locker room could grasp that he wanted to be to himself – you know, quiet. If you didn&#x27;t understand him and didn&#x27;t know what he was about, it always kept people in suspense.&quot; Besides keeping to himself, Williams was known for conducting post-game interviews with his helmet on (complete with tinted visor) and avoiding eye contact. Williams was later diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.

====Early retirement from football====

It was announced on May 14, 2004, that Williams tested positive for marijuana in December 2003 and faced a $650,000 fine and a four-game suspension for violating the NFL&#x27;s substance-abuse policy. He previously tested positive for marijuana shortly after he joined the Dolphins. Shortly before training camp was to begin in July 2004, Williams publicly disclosed his intent to retire from professional football.

Rumored to have failed a third drug test before announcing his retirement, Williams made his retirement official on August 2, 2004. Williams was ineligible to play for the 2004 season, and studied Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of holistic medicine, at the California College of Ayurveda that autumn in Grass Valley, California. The Dolphins finished the 2004 season with a 4–12 record.

Williams maintains that he does not regret the retirement decision. He thinks that it was the &quot;most positive thing&quot; he has ever done in his life, allowing him time to find himself.

====Return to football====

Williams officially returned to the Dolphins on July 24, 2005, paid back a percentage of his signing bonus and completed his four-game suspension for a failed drug test. At his return press conference, Williams expressed his apologies for leaving the team two days before the start of training camp, which had contributed to the Dolphins&#x27; having their worst season in years. Williams finished with six touchdowns and a 4.4 yards per carry average on 168 carries and 743 yards during 2005. While he shared time with Ronnie Brown, he did run for 172 yards in Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans, and 108 yards in Week 17 against the New England Patriots.

On February 20, 2006, the National Football League announced that Williams had violated the NFL drug policy for the fourth time. His mother reportedly said she did not think it was another marijuana violation, and that he may have been in India when he was supposed to be tested. On April 25, 2006, Williams was suspended for the entire 2006 season. It has been suggested that the substance may have been an herb related to his interest in holistic medicine.

===Toronto Argonauts===
With Williams suspended for the entire 2006 NFL season, the CFL&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts decided to put Williams on the negotiation list for the 2006 season.
This guaranteed that the team would become the rightful CFL organization to negotiate with Williams if his NFL contract were to be terminated at any time. The Dolphins allowed Williams to play for the Argonauts on the condition that he would return to them in 2007.

On May 28, 2006, Williams became the highest-paid running back in the CFL when he signed a one-year Can$340,000 contract with the Argonauts. He chose to wear the #27 on his jersey.

The signing drew the ire of former Argonauts quarterback Joe Theismann. On May 30, 2006, Theismann was interviewed by Toronto radio station The Fan 590 whereupon he criticized the Argonauts for signing the suspended Williams. Theismann claimed he was disgraced to be associated with a team that would knowingly sign &quot;an addict&quot; such as Williams. The CFL had no substance abuse policy in place, nor did it prohibit its teams from signing players suspended from other leagues, despite Williams being under contract with the Dolphins for the 2006 season.

The Argonauts&#x27; ownership responded to Theismann&#x27;s criticism, noting that Theismann&#x27;s son, Joe, pleaded guilty in 2002 to a felony charge of possessing drug paraphernalia. He received a 10-year suspended prison term, was placed on five years of probation and fined. &quot;It&#x27;s really a delicate subject for him to attack someone if he has that in his own family&quot;, Argo co-owner David Cynamon said. &quot;If I was his son and he&#x27;s calling [Williams] a drug addict and he should quit and he&#x27;s a loser, I&#x27;d be shattered. This thing is really bothersome.&quot;

Williams made his official CFL debut on June 17, 2006, in a home game against the Tiger-Cats at the Rogers Centre. In that game, he rushed for 97 yards on 18 carries, with his longest carry for 35 yards in the fourth quarter. Williams caught two passes for 24 yards as the Argonauts defeated the Tiger-Cats by a score of 27–17.

On July 22, 2006, Williams suffered a broken bone in his left arm during a game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Regina, Saskatchewan. He underwent surgery on July 23, 2006, to repair the broken bone. Shortly after injuring his arm, Williams suffered yet another injury after a door at the Argonauts&#x27; practice facility swung behind him and clipped the running back on his left achilles tendon requiring 16 stitches to close the gash. During his recovery, Williams received hyperbaric oxygen therapy in St. Catharines, Ontario to expedite his return from injury. In all, Williams missed two months of game action because of the injuries, returning on September 23, 2006, against the Calgary Stampeders.

In the 11 games that he played during 2006 CFL regular season, Williams rushed 109 times for 526 yards, scoring two touchdowns, with a long run of 35 yards. He caught 19 passes for 127 yards.

Williams stated his love for Toronto and mentioned the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. &quot;I was thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be bad to come back up here and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe get a chance to coach up here&quot;, Williams said. &quot;Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It&#x27;s really nice. I get to teach. It&#x27;s wonderful here.&quot; In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, &quot;If I came back here, you can put me anywhere&quot;, he says. &quot;Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver — even play the line. The NFL is so structured — &#x27;You do this.&#x27; Here I can do so much.&quot;

With the controversy over, the Argonauts signing Williams prompted outgoing CFL commissioner Tom Wright, in his final state of the league address, to introduce a new rule that would come in effect before the start of the 2007 CFL season that would prevent a player under suspension in the NFL from signing with a CFL club. This rule has been informally dubbed &quot;The Ricky Williams Rule.&quot;

The new rule, however, was grandfathered so that players who were still playing in the league, such as Argonaut tackle Bernard Williams, who was suspended by the NFL for drug abuse and did not seek reinstatement when the ban ended, could continue playing.

===Miami Dolphins (second stint)===
On May 11, 2007, an anonymous source reported that Williams had failed a drug test again. The source indicated that NFL medical advisors had recommended to the commissioner that Williams not be allowed to apply for reinstatement that September.

Williams adhered to a strict regimen of multiple drug tests per week in 2007 as part of his attempt to be reinstated by the NFL. He practiced yoga, which, he claimed, helped him to stop using marijuana. In October 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell granted his request for reinstatement. Williams returned for a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on November 26, 2007. He rushed six times for 15 yards before Lawrence Timmons, a Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker, stepped on his right shoulder, tearing his pectoral muscle. The next day it was reported that he would miss the rest of the season, and on November 28, Williams was placed on injured reserve.

Williams bounced back in the 2008 season, rushing for 659 yards on 160 carries and scoring four touchdowns while playing in all 16 games for the Dolphins. He and Ronnie Brown ran the Wildcat formation together, resulting in an 11–5 season for the Dolphins.

In 2009, during the Dolphins ninth game, starting running back Ronnie Brown suffered a season-ending injury, and Williams, at age 32, became the starter for the remainder of the year. In Week 11, against the Carolina Panthers, he had 22 carries for 119 yards and two touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He finished the season with 1,121 yards rushing and a 4.7 yards per carry, along the way setting an NFL record of the longest time span (six years) between 1,000 yard seasons (2003–2009). Williams also became only the seventh player in NFL history to begin a season age 32 or older and reach 1,000 yards rushing during that season.

In the 2010 season, Williams carried 159 times for 673 yards and two touchdowns for the Dolphins while splitting duties, averaging 4.2 yards a carry at the age of 33.

===Baltimore Ravens===
Williams signed a two-year, $2.5 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens on August 8, 2011. Williams scored his first touchdown of the season against the Houston Texans on October 16. He finished the 2011 season with 444 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. On January 1, 2012, Williams surpassed the 10,000 career rushing yards mark and became the 26th player in the history of the NFL to do so. On February 7, 2012, Williams informed the Ravens of his retirement from the NFL.

==After football==
In 2013, Williams was hired as the running backs coach at the University of Incarnate Word in San Antonio, where he worked for two seasons. In 2015 he returned to Texas to get his degree in educational psychology, which he completed in 2017. He then served as an analyst on Longhorn Network&#x27;s GameDay show for several years. He then became a wellness expert and entrepreneur, co-founder of Real Wellness Herbal, a licensed astrologer and CEO of LILA Astrology, spokesman, podcaster and involved in numerous business ventures.

==Personal life==
Williams is a medical cannabis advocate. He once stated his &quot;personal goal is to elevate the legitimacy of cannabis as a medicine and the respect of medical professionals for cannabis users.&quot; By 1999, Williams had several tattoos: one of a spider web on his shoulder, one of Mickey Mouse on his biceps, a barbed wire around his arm, one of a dagger on his pectoral, and a Gemini symbol on his other pectoral.

Williams has admitted being very shy and was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder with which he struggled to cope during his football career. Williams was treated with therapy and medication. Williams was briefly a spokesperson for the drug Paxil as treatment. He worked with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline to educate the public about the disorder. Williams later quit using Paxil and said that cannabis was a much better form of treatment.

Williams is a qualified yoga instructor. He has stated that one of his main reasons for joining the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts was for the opportunity to teach free yoga lessons at a local Toronto yoga facility. It has been reported that Williams uses pranic healing, no-touch energy healing system, to recover from injuries. In 2009, Williams enrolled at Acupuncture and Massage College in Miami, Florida to study massage therapy and Japanese Shiatsu. In 2018, Williams co-founded an herbal wellness company with his second wife Linnea Miron named Real.

In May 2022, Williams legally changed his last name to Miron, his wife&#x27;s last name, after they married.

The son of a minister, Williams was raised Southern Baptist and attended church twice a week during his childhood. He still self-identifies as a Christian, but his yoga study opened his mind to other religions, and his exact views on religion are difficult to label. He believes religions are cultural, and his beliefs are inclusive of at least some Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu philosophies. Williams is in the first year of a master&#x27;s program at Emperor&#x27;s College of Traditional Oriental Medicine in Santa Monica, CA.

In 2015, Williams signed with global talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME) for representation in media prior to being inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Williams is a vegetarian. He was previously a vegan or at least had a meat-free diet. Tim Graham has reported that Greek yogurt is the only non-vegan food in Williams&#x27;s diet. PETA has used video of him praising meatless alternatives to popular chicken dishes.

Williams was the single-largest victim of professional scam artist/fraudster Peggy Ann Fulford (Peggy King, Peggy Williams, Peggy Ann Barard, &quot;etc.&quot;), who stole $3.01million from Williams, amongst the $5.79million in total she stole from him, Travis Best, Dennis Rodman, Rashad McCants, Lex Hilliard and others. Fulford, who was indicted by the FBI in December 2016, continued her criminal activity until sentenced in February 2018 to 10 years in prison and full financial restitution (unlikely) to her victims.

<text>Brigid Antonia Brophy (married name Brigid Levey, later Lady Levey; 12 June 19297 August 1995), was an English author, literary critic and polemicist. She was an influential campaigner who agitated for many types of social reform, including homosexual parity, vegetarianism, humanism, and animal rights. Brophy appeared frequently on television and in the newspapers of the 1960s and 1970s, making her prominent both in literary circles and on the wider cultural scene. Her public reputation as an intellectual woman meant she was both revered and feared. Her oeuvre comprises both fiction and non-fiction, displaying the impressive range of Brophy&#x27;s erudition and interests. All her work is suffused with her stylish crispness and verve.

Brophy&#x27;s major achievements include igniting contemporary debate about animal rights, and the establishment of the Public Lending Right by which writers in the UK receive a payment each time their book is borrowed from a public library.

== Biography ==
Born in London to the writer John Brophy and his teacher wife, Charis, Brigid Brophy&#x27;s education was fragmented by her wartime attendance at many different schools, including St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, in London&#x27;s Brook Green. A precocious child, her literary talents were kindled by her father, who encouraged her to read the authors he admired, including George Bernard Shaw, John Milton and Evelyn Waugh. Aged 15, Brophy gained a scholarship to Oxford University. She studied classics at St Hugh&#x27;s College; however, she did not gain a degree: the authorities asked her not to return after her fourth term. (This caused Brophy such severe upset that afterwards she only sketched the reasons for it, citing frowned-upon sexual activity and drunkenness.) After a period of psychological turmoil, Brophy worked as a shorthand-typist and shared a rented flat near London Zoo with a friend from Oxford.

At a party, Brophy met art historian Michael Levey (afterwards Director of the National Gallery 1973–87, and knighted in 1981), and they married in 1954. They had one daughter, Katharine (Kate) Levey, in 1957. Brophy and Levey rejected sexual orthodoxy and each partner was free to enjoy outside relationships; this unconventional set-up was happy. For some years, Brophy had a complex amorous liaison with Iris Murdoch, and later a stable love partnership with writer Maureen Duffy. When that was suddenly ended by Duffy in 1979, Brophy had a severe emotional crisis, which she believed played a part in her developing difficulty in walking. It was some time before her symptoms were diagnosed as late-onset multiple sclerosis: Brophy was then in her 50s.

In 1987, Levey resigned from his demanding role as Director of the National Gallery in order to better care for Brophy. Brophy had always been a punctilious correspondent and an indefatigable worker; she continued to write even while her mobility declined. However, following increasing debilitation and needing full-time care, Brophy unwillingly left London in 1991. She was cared for in a nursing home in Lincolnshire, in the town to which her husband and daughter had moved. Levey devoted each afternoon to visiting his wife until she died, aged 66, in 1995.

== Fiction ==
In 1953, when she was in her early twenties, Brophy became a published author with the issue of her volume of short stories, &quot;The Crown Princess&quot;. It was critically admired, yet she subsequently disowned the book. In the same year, the first of her seven novels, &quot;Hackenfeller&#x27;s Ape&quot;, appeared. The stimulus for the novel was Brophy&#x27;s living within earshot of the roar of caged lions in London Zoo; from childhood Brophy had been sympathetic to the plight of non-human animals. The plot involves the plan to send a captive ape into space as a scientific experiment and the attempt to foil this plan. &quot;Hackenfeller&#x27;s Ape&quot; was commended for its originality, and was awarded first prize for a debut novel at the Cheltenham Literary Festival; the attendant publicity established Brophy as a novelist. She continued, however, to publish short stories.

&quot;The King of A Rainy Country&quot; (1956) follows Susan and her nearly-boyfriend Neale in their quest for a girl Susan had loved at school. The novel is both funny and elegiac, and is thought to be the nearest Brophy came to autobiography. &quot;Flesh&quot; (1962) charts the course of the initially-diffident Marcus, whose mature impulses amusingly lead him to bodily excess. &quot;The Finishing Touch&quot; (1963) is a light piece, playing on the aerated, wispy dialogue of Ronald Firbank, an undervalued writer whom Brophy much praised. The novel portrays Anthony Blunt, an art historian known to Levey, in the guise of a headmistress of a finishing school. 

With characteristic firmness of judgement Brophy recognised her next novel, &quot;The Snow Ball&quot; (1964), as a masterpiece: set at a sumptuous costume ball on New Year&#x27;s Eve in the 1960s, the novel is sparked by the Mozart opera that Brophy thought most perfect, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Described by a reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;swirling, sumptuous, sensual feast of a book&quot;, &quot;The Snow Ball&quot; is an account of seduction that revels in sensual detail, its dialogue witty and profound. As Giles Gordon noted, it is considered Brophy&#x27;s finest novel, and following its initial publication by Secker &amp; Warburg would be reprinted several times, as a Corgi paperback, then in 1979 by Allison &amp; Busby (alongside their reissues of &quot;Hackenfeller&#x27;s Ape&quot; and &quot;Flesh&quot;), and most recently by Faber and Faber in 2020.

The novel &quot;In Transit&quot; (1969) takes place in an airport lounge, where the protagonist has &quot;lost&quot;, and is seeking to rediscover, his/her sex. Brophy plays with narrative consciousness; the text is dense with puns and allusions, forming a captivating consideration of gender and sexual orientation, language and meaning; overall, there is a serious political point. &quot;In Transit&quot; is considered Brophy&#x27;s most radical in form, leading to her being hailed a postmodern writer. &quot;The Adventures of God in his Search for the Black Girl&quot; (1973) is described in its subtitle as &quot;a novel and some fables&quot;. (The title inverts Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God&quot;.) The volume contains some of Brophy&#x27;s most pointed and poignant short stories, and an inventive discursive scenario where ideas are challenged.

Brophy&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Palace Without Chairs&quot; (1978), is set in a fictitious European kingdom. The royal family is democratic, domestic, but at court politics intrude. Prince Ulrich, heir to the throne, subverts the expectations of his position, rebelling in ways to which Brophy is clearly sympathetic. 

Brophy&#x27;s irrepressible imagination was not only fertile but versatile. As well as short stories (and plays and poems that remain unpublished), Brophy produced &quot;Pussy Owl&quot; (1976), a book for children that features her invented &quot;Superbeast&quot;, the narcissistic, stomping progeny of Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;. BBC television devoted an episode of &quot;Jackanory&quot; to &quot;Pussy Owl&quot;.

Her performed and published plays are a play for radio, &quot;The Waste Disposal Unit&quot; (broadcast in 1964), and her farce for the theatre, &quot;The Burglar&quot; (which opened in Brighton, transferring to London&#x27;s West End in 1967). &quot;The Burglar&quot; had a short run; it was a singular and stinging flop.

== Non-fiction ==

Brophy was a ceaseless worker, often dealing with several different types of project simultaneously. As well as composing fiction, at times in a creative frenzy, she undertook extensive research for her non-fiction. Her first published study was &quot;Black Ship to Hell&quot; (1962). The title refers to the Greek myth of the underworld. In this wide-ranging study, Brophy illuminates the origins of man&#x27;s self- destructive forces, taking a Freudian analytical approach.

Much in demand as a provocative, often acerbic literary critic, Brophy reviewed books for journals and newspapers. She was also an essayist and wrote pamphlets for the causes she supported. She was a prolific contributor to the opinion columns and letters pages of the press, seldom missing an opportunity to comment on matters such as vivisection, the Vietnam War, or censorship – all of which she vehemently and cogently opposed. In addition, she did not shrink from pointing out factual errors or a piece of sophistry she had spotted.

Her later critical explorations were &quot;Mozart the Dramatist&quot; (1964, revised 1990), in which Brophy expounds Mozart&#x27;s flair for presenting authentic psychology in his dramas. In &quot;Prancing Novelist: A Defence of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank&quot; (1973), Brophy explores the life and mind of Firbank, in a framework that justifies the value of the genre he employed.

A collaboration with her husband Michael Levey and their friend Charles Osborne appeared in 1967, to considerable clamour in the press. &quot;Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without&quot; debunks the canon of texts traditionally served up to students and general readers and accepted as &quot;great literature&quot;. It was a deliberately provocative volume, and some critics were outraged by the trio&#x27;s cheek.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; invited Brophy to write an opinion-piece; Brophy&#x27;s response was &quot;The Rights of Animals&quot; (1965). This incisive article was much discussed. As a parallel to Paine&#x27;s essays &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;, &quot;The Rights of Animals&quot; made Brophy pivotal to the revivified animal rights movement. Her views as a rational, uncompromising animal advocate attracted criticism from the less stringent-minded. In all spheres Brophy dealt with her detractors calmly, utilising devastating courtesy.

Brophy wrote two books on Aubrey Beardsley (&quot;Black and White&quot;, published in 1968, and &quot;Beardsley and His World&quot; in 1976), the draftsman whose mastery of black ink on white Brophy not only much admired but profoundly understood. In 1983, &quot;The Prince and the Wild Geese&quot; appeared. With a largely pictorial format, the book follows the attempted romance between a Russian Prince and an Irish girl, who in fact rejected him. The watercolours reproduced are by Prince Gagarin himself.

Brophy devised a literary panel game, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;, where well-known authors participated.

In 1969, Brophy collaborated with Maureen Duffy to exhibit, at a London gallery, a display of their home-made three-dimensional &quot;heads and boxes&quot;, which they designated &quot;Prop Art&quot;. The playful-yet-serious items were offered for sale, and although few were bought, there was a ripple of publicity, some of it puzzled. Each artefact illustrated or evoked abstract concepts, using visual and verbal puns to plunder the unconscious mind and reveal punchy connections.

In the early 1970s, Brophy, with Michael Levey and Maureen Duffy and two others formed the Writers Action Group (WAG, pronounced &quot;wag&quot;) to press for authors to receive a small payment each time one of their works was borrowed from a public library in the UK. This system is still operant today, and the Public Lending Right (PLR) authors receive is much appreciated. In a seven-year campaign which took up almost all Brophy&#x27;s time, she succeeded in bringing about something her late father, John Brophy had agitated for in the early 1950s. He had conceived the notion of &quot;The Brophy Penny&quot; (his idea was for a different funding format, whereas a founding principle of Brigid Brophy&#x27;s scheme was that it be funded by central government). The Writers Action Group recruited support from writers, then organised shrewd publicity, including a demonstration with placards in central London. With help from a few sympathetic parliamentarians, the PLR UK Bill was finally passed in 1979. Brophy later wrote an informative and entertaining guide to PLR (see list of non-fiction works, below).

<doc id="429081" wikidata="Q47682" url="?curid=429081" title="Administrative divisions of New York (state)">
<text>The administrative divisions of New York are the various units of government that provide local services in the American state of New York. The state is divided into boroughs, counties, cities, towns, and villages. (The only boroughs, the five boroughs of New York City, have the same boundaries as their respective counties.) They are municipal corporations, chartered (created) by the New York State Legislature, as under the New York State Constitution the only body that can create governmental units is the state. All of them have their own governments, sometimes with no paid employees, that provide local services. Centers of population that are not incorporated and have no government or local services are designated hamlets. Whether a municipality is defined as a borough, city, town, or village is determined not by population or land area, but rather on the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York State Legislature. Each type of local government is granted specific home rule powers by the New York State Constitution. There are still occasional changes as a village becomes a city, or a village dissolves (stops existing), each of which requires legislative action. New York also has various corporate entities that provide local services and have their own administrative structures (governments), such as school and fire districts. These are not found in all counties.

Almost every piece of land in the state is part of a city or town, which is part of one county. The exceptions are the city of Geneva; New York City; and ten Indian reservations.

, New York has 62 counties (including New York City&#x27;s five boroughs), which are subdivided into 933 towns and 61 cities (including Geneva in both Ontario and Seneca counties, but excluding New York City and Sherrill). In total, the state has more than 3,400 active local governments and more than 4,200 taxing jurisdictions.

==Home rule==
Counties and incorporated municipal governments (also known as &quot;general purpose units of local government&quot;; i.e., cities, towns and villages) in the State of New York have been granted broad home rule powers enabling them to provide services to their residents and to regulate the quality of life within their jurisdictions. They do so while adhering to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York. Articles VIII (titled &quot;Local Finances&quot;) and IX (titled &quot;Local Government&quot;, but commonly referred to as the &quot;Home Rule&quot; article) of the state constitution establish the rights and responsibilities of the municipal governments.

The New York State Constitution provides for democratically elected legislative bodies for counties, cities, towns and villages. These legislative bodies are granted the power to enact local laws as needed in order to provide services to their citizens and fulfill their various obligations.

== County ==


The county is the primary administrative division of New York. There are sixty-two counties in the state. Five of the counties are governed as boroughs of the City of New York so do not have separate county governments. While originally created as subdivisions of the state meant to carry out state functions, counties are now considered municipal corporations with the power and fiscal capacity to provide an array of local government services. Such services generally include law enforcement and public safety, social and health services (such as Medicaid), and education (special needs and community colleges).

Every county outside of New York City has a county seat, which is the location of county government.

Nineteen counties operate under county charters, while 38 operate under the general provisions of the County Law. Although all counties have a certain latitude to govern themselves, &quot;charter counties&quot; are afforded greater home rule powers. The charter counties are Albany, Broome, Chautauqua, Chemung, Dutchess, Erie, Herkimer, Monroe, Nassau, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Putnam, Rensselaer, Rockland, Schenectady, Suffolk, Tompkins, Ulster, and Westchester.

Sixteen counties are governed through an assembly with the power of a board of supervisors, composed of the supervisors of its constituent towns and cities. In most of these counties, each supervisor&#x27;s vote is weighted in accordance with the town&#x27;s population in order to abide by the U.S. Supreme Court mandate of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;. Other counties have legislative districts of equal population, which may cross municipal borders; these counties may also have an elected County Executive. Most counties in New York do not use the term &quot;Board of Supervisors.&quot; 34 counties have a County Legislature, six counties have a Board of Legislators, and one county has a Board of Representatives. The five counties, or boroughs, of New York City are governed by a 51-member City Council.

In non-charter counties, the legislative body exercises executive power as well. Although the legislature can delegate certain functions and duties to a county administrator, who acts on behalf of the legislature, the legislature must maintain ultimate control over the actions of the administrator. Many, but not all, charter counties have an elected executive who is independent of the legislature; the exact form of government is defined in the County Charter.

==City==


In New York, each city is a highly autonomous incorporated area that, with the exceptions of New York City and Geneva, is contained within one county. Cities in New York are classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as incorporated places. They provide almost all services to their residents and have the highest degree of home rule and taxing jurisdiction over their residents. The main difference between a city and a village is that cities are organized and governed according to their charters, which can differ widely among cities, while most villages are subject to a uniform statewide Village Law (twelve villages still operate under charters issued by the state legislature prior to a revision of the State Constitution in 1874 that forbade chartering villages). Also, villages are part of a town (or towns; some villages cross town borders), with residents who pay taxes to and receive services from the town. Cities are neither part of nor subordinate to towns except for the city of Sherrill, which for some purposes is treated as if it were a village of the town of Vernon. Some cities are completely surrounded by a town, typically of the same name.

There are sixty-two cities in the state. , 54.1% of state residents were living in a city; 42.2% were living in New York City; 11.9% were living in one of the other 61 cities. In 1686, the English colonial governor granted the cities of New York and Albany city charters, which were recognized by the first State Constitution in 1777. All other cities have been established by act of the state legislature and have been granted a charter. Cities have been granted the power to revise their charters or adopt new ones. There are no minimum population or area requirements in order to become a city. While there is no defined process for how and when a village becomes a city, the Legislature requires clear evidence, usually in the form of a locally drafted charter, that the community in question seeks to incorporate as a city.

The forms of government cities can have are council–manager, strong mayor–council, weak mayor–council or commission. Forty-six cities, the majority, use the mayor–council form.
*Strong mayor–council – An elective mayor serves as the chief executive and administrative head of the city. A city council serves as a legislature. The mayor has veto power over council decisions, prepares a budget, and appoints and removes agency heads. This form sometimes includes a professional administrator appointed by the mayor.
*Weak mayor–council – The mayor is a ceremonial figure. The city council serves as both a legislature and executive committee. There is generally no mayoral veto.
*Council–manager – The mayor, if such a position exists, is ceremonial only. A professional administrator, appointed by the city council, serves as the administrative head. While empowered to appoint and remove agency heads and responsible for preparing a budget, the administrator does not have veto power. The city council serves as the legislature.
*Commission – Elected commissioners administer individual city departments and together act as a legislature. This form sometimes includes an administrator. There is no mayor, although commissioners sometimes assume mayoral ceremonial duties.

The City of New York is a special case. The state legislature reorganized government in the area in the 1890s in an effort to consolidate. Other cities, villages, and towns were annexed to become the &quot;City of Greater New York&quot;, (an unofficial term, the new city retained the name of New York), a process basically completed in 1898. At the time of consolidation, Queens County was split. Its western towns joined the city, leaving three towns that were never part of the consolidation plan as part of Queens County but not part of the new Borough of Queens. (A small portion of the Town of Hempstead was itself annexed, also.) The next year (1899), the three eastern towns of Queens County separated to become Nassau County. The city today consists of the entire area of five counties (named New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond). While these counties have no county government, boroughs—with boundaries coterminous with the county boundaries—each have a Borough Board made up of the Borough President, the borough&#x27;s district council members, and the chairpersons of the borough&#x27;s community boards. A mayor serves as the city&#x27;s chief executive officer.

The most populous and largest city in the state is New York City, with a population of over 8.5 million inhabitants and comprising just over of land ( total area, which includes water). The least populous city is Sherrill, New York, with just 3,071 inhabitants in 2010. The smallest city by area is Mechanicville, New York, which covers (of which is water).

Some places containing the word &quot;city&quot; in their name are not cities. Examples include Johnson City, Garden City, and New City.

===Wards and other submunicipal divisions===


Several cities, such as Albany, are divided into &quot;wards&quot; for the purposes of municipal representation. Each ward elects one member to the city&#x27;s legislative body, and the wards are redistricted roughly every ten years. These divisions can go by other names by city; in Buffalo they are known as &quot;districts&quot;. These divisions can either be numbered or named. New York City was divided into wards at various times in its history between 1683 and 1938, although they were gradually replaced by Assembly and Senate districts starting in the mid-19th century; the New York City Council is currently elected from special districts, which are allowed to cross borough lines.

New York City has a unique system of divisions, some of which possess governmental power, see Divisions unique to New York City.

== Town ==

In New York, a town is a municipal corporation, and is the major division of each county (excluding the five boroughs that comprise New York City), very similar to townships in other states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Towns in New York are classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as minor civil divisions. Like New Jersey and southern New England, all of New York is incorporated; all residents who do not live in a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town.

Towns provide or arrange for the primary functions of local government. While some provide most municipal services for all town residents and selected services for residents of villages, some provide little more than road maintenance. There were 933 towns in New York. , 45.8% of state residents were living in a town; 35.9% were living in a town but outside a village. Whereas cities and villages can cross county boundaries, each town in New York is completely contained within a single county.

New York towns are classified by statute as being a &quot;town of the first class&quot; or a &quot;town of the second class&quot;. Additionally, a town of the first class can further be classified as a &quot;suburban town&quot; upon meeting certain criteria. Originally, towns of different classes possessed different powers. Since 1964, all towns, regardless of classification, have had the same legal powers as were once available only to suburban towns. Even so, towns of different classifications continue to have organizational differences and certain conditions that must be met before a town&#x27;s classification changes.

The town board serves as the legislative branch. The board is composed of one elected town supervisor (or chief executive officer in suburban towns) and a specific number of elected council persons; towns of the second class generally have two but may have four council persons, whereas towns of the first class generally have four but can have two or six. The supervisor presides over the board, voting on all matters but not possessing veto or tie-breaking power. Certain towns operate under a town manager form of government, creating an executive branch in the town government, as permitted by legislation enacted in 1976. As such, some supervisors have additional authority or executive powers, whereas some towns have town managers or chief executive officers who serve as the executive branch. All town justices were originally part of a town&#x27;s board. Today, justices belong to a separate judicial branch known as Town Court or Justice Court, part of New York&#x27;s Justice Court system.

A town may contain one or more villages. Many towns have no villages. Five towns are coterminous with their single village and share the same name: Green Island in Albany County; East Rochester in Monroe County; and Scarsdale, Harrison, and Mount Kisco in Westchester County. A sixth, the town of Palm Tree in Orange County was incorporated in 2019 and is coterminous with the village of Kiryas Joel, having acquired land from the town of Monroe. When such an entity is formed, officials from either unit of government may serve in both village and town governments simultaneously. A referendum is held to decide whether residents prefer a village-style or town-style government, which will then function primarily as a village or town but will perform some of the functions of the other form. Villages remain part of the towns in which they are located; village residents pay both town and village taxes, and vote in both town and village elections.

Towns can contain several hamlets and communities. If the United States Postal Service (USPS) has a post office in a hamlet it often will use the name of that hamlet, as will the local fire department or elementary school. Businesses may also use the name of a hamlet as part of their name. The United States Census Bureau will, with consideration from the town, designate a census-designated place (CDP) that may use the name of one or more hamlets, though boundaries may differ from what is used by the ZIP code, local fire department, etc.

Towns in New York may be further subdivided into wards, although , only fifteen of the state&#x27;s 932 towns used this system. In towns operating under the ward system, citizens vote for councilmen who represent a specific area (ward) of the town, as opposed to the at-large councilmen elected in the majority of the state&#x27;s towns.

Towns vary in size and population. The largest town by area is Brookhaven (Suffolk County), which covers , but more than half of that is water. The town of Webb (Herkimer County) has the greatest land area, at . The smallest town, Green Island (Albany County), covers . The town of Hempstead (Nassau County) has about 760,000 people (2010 census), making it more populous than any city in the state except New York City. Red House (Cattaraugus County), the least populous, has 38 permanent residents (2010 census).

The use of &quot;town&quot; in a community&#x27;s name is irrespective of municipal status. Elizabethtown, Germantown and Stephentown are towns. Cooperstown, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, is a village; Jamestown and Middletown are cities; and Levittown is an unincorporated hamlet.

===Census-designated place===
A census-designated place (CDP) is defined by the United States Census Bureau as &quot;a statistical entity defined for each decennial census according to Census Bureau guidelines, comprising a densely settled concentration of population&quot; that is not part of a city or a village &quot;but is locally identified by a name.&quot; CDPs may cross town and county borders. CDPs are defined collaboratively by state and local officials and the Census Bureau. They are defined for each census, and it is commonplace to change boundaries and define new CDPs for each census.

The Census Bureau formerly referred to CDPs as &quot;unincorporated places&quot; from 1950 through the 1970 decennial censuses. The term CDP was first used for the 1980 census, and minimum population criteria for CDPs were dropped with the 2000 census.

=== Hamlet ===
Though the term &quot;hamlet&quot; is not defined under New York law, many people in the state use the term hamlet to refer to a community within a town that is not incorporated as a village but is identified by a name, i.e. an unincorporated community. A hamlet often has a name corresponding to the name of a local school district, post office, or fire district. Because a hamlet has no government of its own, it depends upon the town or towns that contain it for municipal services and government. Because they do not have governments, hamlets have no clear boundaries.

Suffolk County publishes maps that give hamlet boundaries,
but towns within the county also publish maps that conflict both in the number of hamlets and their boundaries.
Nevertheless, all land not within a village is administered by the town.

Most of the rest of New York&#x27;s hamlets, however, have less well-defined boundaries, and most towns have areas that are not considered to be a part of any hamlet. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) puts hamlet names on rectangular green signs with white lettering at roadside locations of its choosing. The NYSDOT and local governments also provide community identification signs on some scenic byways to be placed at the roadside boundaries of hamlets, as decided by the sign provider. Many towns have special zoning or planning districts and planning strategies for their hamlets, and many places welcome signs at the gateways to the hamlets.

Some hamlets are former villages that have dissolved their incorporation (Old Forge in Herkimer County; Rosendale, in Ulster County; and Andes in Delaware County, for example).

Notwithstanding hamlets are not cities or towns, many of them are called out in formal addresses for those residents residing within the limits. Based on the ZIP Code, the United States Postal Service (USPS) identifies the correct location for mail delivery.

The &quot;New York State Gazetteer&quot;, published by the New York State Department of Health in 1995, includes a list of hamlets in the state. The criteria used for inclusion in the &quot;Gazetteer&quot; are not stated.

The Adirondack Park Agency also uses the term &quot;hamlet&quot;, though as a land-use classification for private land under its Adirondack Park Land Use and Development Plan (APLUDP). The APLUDP extends the boundaries for its classification of hamlets &quot;well beyond established settlements&quot; to allow for growth.

== Village ==


In New York, a village is an incorporated area. About 85% of villages fall within a single town. Villages in the State of New York are classified by the Census Bureau as incorporated places. Like all municipal corporations, villages have clearly defined legal boundaries. A village is a municipality that provides services to the residents, services that may or may not include garbage collection, management of cemeteries, street and highway maintenance, street lighting, and building codes. Some villages provide their own police and other municipal services. Villages have less autonomy than cities. While cities are not subject to a town&#x27;s jurisdiction, villages legally remain part of the town or towns in which they are located. Village residents pay both town and village taxes, and vote in town and village elections. Those services not provided by the village are provided by the town or towns containing the village. census, 9.9% of the state&#x27;s population was living in one of the 556 villages in New York.

The legislature of a village is the board of trustees, composed of a mayor and (usually) four trustees. The board is responsible for approving mayoral appointments, managing village finances and property, and approving a budget. The mayor, who is generally the chief executive of the village, may vote in all business before the board and must vote to break a tie. The mayor generally does not possess veto power, unless this is provided for by local law. Administrative duties of the mayor include enforcing laws and supervising employees. A village may also have a full-time village manager who performs these administrative duties instead of the mayor. In 2007, sixty-seven villages had such a manager. Some villages have their own village justice, while others utilize the justice of the town or towns in which they are located.

While most villages are subject to a uniform statewide Village Law, twelve villages operate under charters issued by the state legislature prior to 1874. Before a revision to the State Constitution in that year, villages were formed by the state legislature through granting of charters. Many villages reincorporated, dumping their charters in favor of the Village Law. The villages that retain their charters are Alexander, Carthage, Catskill, Cooperstown, Deposit, Fredonia, Ilion, Mohawk, Ossining, Owego, Port Chester, and Waterford. These villages must still comply with those aspects of Village Law that are not inconsistent with their charters.

To be incorporated, the area of the proposed village must have at least 1,500 inhabitants and not be part of an existing city or village. Additionally, the proposed village can be no more than 5 square miles (13 km2) in area unless its boundaries are to be coterminous with a school, fire, improvement or other district, or the entire town. The process of incorporation begins with a petition by either 20% of residents or owners of 50% of assessed real property. If deemed legally sufficient, incorporation is then voted upon by the qualified voters living in the proposed village only. Some villages have fewer than 500 residents, having incorporated before the present population requirement or fallen below the old 500-resident threshold after incorporation.

A village may also be dissolved, returning all government control to the town level. The process of dissolution can be initiated by the village board itself, or upon the submission of a proper petition to the board. The village board must produce a &quot;dissolution plan&quot; that settles specific matters, such as the village&#x27;s debts, its employees and property, and the financial impact dissolution would have on village and non-village town residents. This plan is voted upon by village voters only.

About 15% of villages cross other municipal boundaries. More than 70 villages are located in two or more towns. Seven villages are in two counties. The village of Saranac Lake is in three towns and two counties.

Five towns are coterminous with their single village and have a coterminous town-village form of government.

Despite their names, Greenwich Village, the East Village, and Queens Village are not villages, but neighborhoods of the City of New York.

==Divisions unique to New York City==
===Boroughs===


A borough is one of the five major administrative divisions of the consolidated City of New York. Boroughs do not currently exist elsewhere in the state. Each of the five boroughs of the city is coextensive with a county of the state of New York. Under New York State&#x27;s General Municipal Law, a borough results when the towns, villages and cities in a county merge with the county itself. This occurred in 1898 when New York City merged with surrounding counties, cities and towns to form its present configuration. The five boroughs are:
*The Bronx (Bronx County)
*Brooklyn (Kings County)
*Manhattan (New York County)
*Queens (Queens County)
*Staten Island (Richmond County)

The boroughs were originally intended to retain some local governance in the consolidated city. Each borough individually elects a borough president and used to elect two at-large city council members, in addition to those elected based on each borough&#x27;s population. The borough presidents once wielded considerable power as members of the New York City Board of Estimate, but the position is now largely ceremonial and advisory. Boroughs function as counties for certain purposes, but have no county government. The five New York City district attorneys, however, are still elected by county (for example, the district attorney for Brooklyn is called the Kings County District Attorney).

===Community districts===
There are fifty-nine community districts in New York City, each represented by an appointed advisory group called a community board. Each board consists of fifty unpaid members appointed by the borough president. Half of the members are nominated by the City Council members who represent the area. The power of the community boards is very limited. They serve in an advisory capacity regarding land use and zoning, budget, and various concerns of the community. The boards can recommend action on the part of the city government, but they cannot mandate it. Each is identified by borough name and a number (e.g. Manhattan Community Board 3).

==Special purpose units of government==
In New York, special purpose units of government provide specialized services only to those who live in the district, and are empowered to tax residents of the district for the services provided in common. Special districts often cross the lines of towns, villages, and hamlets, and occasionally cities or counties.

===School district===
School districts are the most common kind of special district in New York. They provide, arrange, or contract for all public education services, including special education and school transportation, the latter also for non-public schools.

School districts are rarely precisely coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning that a person living in one hamlet or village might send their children to a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district in which they live and any children living with them attend school. All tax-paying residents are eligible for the STAR Program tax rebate, which in effect lessens the value of an individual&#x27;s primary residence to lessen the tax burden on the residence.

All but five school districts are separate from municipal governments. The exceptions are the five cities whose populations exceed 125,000 (Buffalo, New York, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers), in which education is part of the municipal budget.

Schools in the city of New York are controlled by the New York City Department of Education, and the city is divided by the department into 11 &quot;school regions&quot; (10 geographic regions and a &quot;District 75&quot; for students with disabilities)

There are five types of school districts in the state, each with slightly different laws.

====Common school district====
Common school districts, established in 1812, were the first type of school district in the state. In July 2004, there were only 11 such districts remaining. They are not authorized to provide secondary education. They must, therefore, contract with neighboring school districts to provide high school education for pupils in the district. Typically one trustee or a three-person board of trustees will govern the district.

====Union free school district====

In 1853, the legislature established union free school districts, which are districts resulting from a &quot;union&quot; of two or more common school districts, &quot;free&quot; from the restrictions that previously barred them from operating high schools. In July 2004, there were 163 school districts of this type. Despite being able to operate high schools, thirty-one of these districts provided only elementary education. Those districts that are not components of central school districts provide secondary education either by contracting with other districts or being located in one of the three central high school districts. Each union free school district is governed by a three- to nine-member board of education.

====Central school district====
Central school districts are the most prevalent type of school district in New York. In July 2004, there were 460 such districts. They began as a result of legislation in 1914. Central school districts may form from any number (including one) of common, union free, and/or central school districts. Central school districts are permitted to provide secondary education. Its board of education must consist of five, seven, or nine members and length of service must be three, four, or five years, each decided upon by the voters in the district.

====Central high school district====
Not to be confused with central school districts, there are only three central high school districts in New York state, all in Nassau County: Bellmore–Merrick Central High School District, Sewanhaka Central High School District, and Valley Stream Central High School District. Central high school districts provide secondary education to students in two or more common or union free districts. With creation authorized by the legislature in 1917 and repealed in 1944, creation was reauthorized exclusively for Suffolk County in 1981. Such districts already established were not affected by the repeal.

====City school district====
In those cities with populations exceeding 125,000 (New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Rochester, and Syracuse), the city school districts are coterminous with the city limits, and education is part of the municipal budget. These districts cannot incur debts or levy taxes. The governmental structure in all of these except for New York is that of an elected or appointed board of education. New York&#x27;s public education is headed by a chancellor and has a 13-member all-appointed Department of Education Panel for Education Policy.

The city school districts for the 57 cities having fewer than 125,000 people are separate from the municipal government and are authorized to levy taxes and incur debt. Each of them is governed by an elected board of education with five, seven, or nine members. Districts for smaller cities often extend beyond the city borders and are referred to as &quot;enlarged city school districts&quot;, seven of which have reorganized as &quot;central city school districts&quot;.

====Supervisory school district (BOCES)====
Owing to the extremely large number (730) of school districts, many of which are quite small, most of them are organized into 37 supervisory districts. Each of these has a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES). Each BOCES provides services that are considered difficult for the component school districts to provide on their own, often including special classes for students with disabilities, trades, medical professions such as physical therapy or other specialized classes.

===Fire district===
Fire districts are public corporations that generally provide fire protection and other emergency response in towns outside villages. A fire district can levy taxes and incur debt just like other general purpose municipal corporations, although fire districts do not have home rule powers and the taxes are generally collected by the town or towns that the district serves. Fire districts depend on their towns for initial establishment, expansion of district territory, and dissolution, but are otherwise thereafter autonomous political entities able to exercise only those specific powers granted to them by statute. The district is governed by a board of elected commissioners.

Villages generally provide their own fire protection, but joint town-village fire districts are permitted. A Joint Fire District is a fire district that encompasses more than one town, wholly or in part, and may also include a village. This is some times done to reduce duplication of services in a small area or to help spread the tax burden when there is a large difference in tax base between neighboring towns. A joint fire district may also be formed when a fire department in a village that has fire protection districts in the surrounding towns separates itself from the village government to obtain greater self-governance. This was seen in 2003 when the fire department in the village of Baldwinsville formed a joint fire district consisting of the village of Baldwinsville and parts of the towns of Lysander and Van Buren in Onondaga County.

There were 868 fire districts in New York at the end of 2003.

===Fire protection district===
A fire protection district is established by a town board in order to contract fire protection services with any city, village, fire district or incorporated fire company. Unlike fire districts, fire protection districts are not authorized to levy property taxes and do not have an independently elected board of commissioners. The levy to support fire protection districts is part of the town levy and the oversight of the district is via the town board.

===Public benefit corporation/authority===

Public benefit corporations in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are a form of government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their own debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting so much of the credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.

Public benefit corporations get charters from New York and are usually designed to perform a specific, narrow function in the public interest. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority manages public transportation in the New York Metropolitan Area (this includes the New York subway and public bus systems, as well as Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority). The New York State Thruway Authority originally only maintained the New York State Thruway from New York City to the Pennsylvania border southwest of Buffalo, but now maintains the toll-free Interstate 287 corridor. Many regions also have authorities to manage their local public transportation such as the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, which manages public transportation in Onondaga, Oswego, Cayuga, and Oneida counties; and the Capital District Transportation Authority for the Capital District area around Albany, Schenectady, Troy, and Saratoga Springs.

At the end of 2005, there were 866 public benefit corporations, of which 266 were public authorities.

===Library district===
Library districts are usually coextensive with the same school district but raise taxes separately and serve all the residents of the library district. They often form cooperative associations with other library districts for shared services, purchasing and cross-library lending.

===Lake Protection and Rehabilitation district===
Lake Protection and Rehabilitation districts are created to allow local government entities raise additional tax funding for projects in and around lakes. The NY State legislature defines these projects and duties as:

Initiating and coordinating research and surveys for the purpose of gathering data on the lake, related shorelands, and the drainage basin;&lt;br&gt;
Planning lake rehabilitation projects;&lt;br&gt;
Adopting by resolution rules for carrying out their duties and plans for lake rehabilitation projects;&lt;br&gt;
Contacting and attempting to secure the cooperation of officials of units of general purpose government in the area for the purpose of enacting ordinances deemed necessary by the board of supervisors as furthering the objectives of the district;&lt;br&gt;
Carrying out lake protection and rehabilitation projects and obtaining any necessary permits therefor; and&lt;br&gt;
Maintaining liaison with those officials of state government and local government involved in lake protection and rehabilitation.

===Other types of special purpose units===
Other special districts may include emergency rescue squads
(also known as Consolidated Health Districts), sanitation, police, water, sewer, park, and parking.

<text>Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (; often shortened to its historical name, Tbilisi State University or TSU) is a public research university established on 8 February 1918 in Tbilisi, Georgia. Excluding academies and theological seminaries, which have intermittently functioned in Georgia for centuries, TSU is the oldest university in Georgia and the Caucasus region. The total enrollment is over 23,500 students, and there are 5,000 faculty and staff members (collaborators) overall.

The main founder of the university was a Georgian historian and academician, Ivane Javakhishvili. Among the co-founders were also several scientists, including Giorgi Akhvlediani, Shalva Nutsubidze, Dimitri Uznadze, Grigol Tsereteli, Akaki Shanidze, Andrea Razmadze, Korneli Kekelidze, Ioseb Kipshidze, Petre Melikishvili and Ekvtime Takaishvili. Professor Petre Melikishvili, a Georgian chemist, became the first rector of TSU. Elizabeth Orbeliani, who was also among the co-founders, became the first woman to teach in the university&#x27;s history.

==History==
Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918 owing to the leadership of Georgian historian Ivane Javakhishvili and the group of his followers. It was the first and the only educational body of this type in Caucasus Region by that time. The university is housed in the former building of Georgian Nobility Gymnasium constructed by the architect Simon Kldiashvili from 1899 to 1906.

The construction and development of the future building of Tbilisi State University were spearheaded by Niko Tskhvedadze, a founding member and board participant of the Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians. His role in overseeing the construction was pivotal to the university&#x27;s establishment.

Georgia has a tradition of education, as evidenced by the functioning of the School of Philosophy and Rhetoric of Phazisi in Colchis (4th century); as well as the setting up of cultural-enlightenment centers in Palestine (5th century), Syria (6th century), Greece (10th–15th centuries) and Bulgaria (11th century); Gelati and Iqalto Academies in Georgia (11th–12th centuries); However, as a result of political-economic decrease and at last becoming the colony of Russia, there had been no national higher educational Institution in Georgia for the next few centuries.

After Georgia became independent and declared itself a national democratic state, one of the first achievements of the Georgian people at the beginning of the 20th century was the foundation of the Georgian National University in Tbilisi. Afterwards, through the Bolshevik and Communist period, in spite of the forced ideology and fierce censorship, Tbilisi State University maintained schools in mathematics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and historiography. The foundation of the Academy of Science of Georgia and other higher educational institutions was encouraged by the university.

The university was opened on 26 January 1918, the day of remembrance of the Georgian king David the Builder. A church in the university garden, named after the King, has been functioning since 5 September 1995. In 1989 the university was named after its founder - Ivane Javakhishvili.

Petre Melikishvili, a chemist and professor, was elected as the first rector of the university. At its commencement, the university had one faculty - that of philosophy. Javakhishvili, a Georgian historian, delivered the first lecture. At the beginning of 1918 the board of professors and lecturers numbered 18, the student body of the university counted 369 students and 89 free listeners.

Today the number of professors involved in tuition and training amounts to 3275, including 55 academicians and corresponding member of the academy, 595 professors and doctors, 1246 assistant professors and candidates of sciences.

Over 35 thousand students are studying at the University and its eight regional branches. Important changes at the university began on 25 April 1994, when the scientific council of the University adopted &quot;The Concepts of University Education&quot;page3-5, according to which since the year 1994 the university has transferred to the two-stage form of study (the step-by-step rearrangements were launched in 1992).

At the end of the I stage of the reform implemented, at the beginning of 2005, the bodies functioning at TSU were: 22 faculties with 184 chairs, 8 branches with 46 faculties, 3 scientific-research and study-scientific institutes, 81 scientific-research laboratories and centers, 161 study laboratories and rooms, clinical hospitals and diagnostic centers, publishing and editorial houses, the library with 3,650,000 items, 5 dormitories. 95 educational programs were used at the bachelor&#x27;s course, 194 at master&#x27;s studies, and 16 at the single-step tuition.

Schools that came into being at Tbilisi University were: 
* Mathematics (Andrea Razmadze for whom the department was renamed in 1944, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, Ilia Vekua, Viktor Kupradze, Andro Bitsadze and others), 
* Physics (Elephter Andronikashvili, for whom the Institute was renamed in 1999, Mate Mirianashvili, Vagan Mamasakhlisov, Givi Khutsishvili Albert Tavkhelidze and others), 
* Psychology (Dimitri Uznadze and others),

The chairs and scientific research departments serve for preparation of postgraduate students and scientific degrees. 26 qualification councils operate for conferring scientific degrees in almost all fields of science.

Medical education was restored at the university in 1994. Originally the specialty of medicine was opened at the faculty of biology and medicine, and the faculty of medicine became an independent unit in 2000. A center for the Management of Health Care and the Department for Continuous Medical Education were opened, and the board of trustees of medicine and medical information service were founded. The university diagnostic center provides the health care of the professors and lecturers and collaborators of the university.

A printing press was set up in 1923 and a publishing-house in 1933. The University Archive was founded in 1933. The scientific edition &quot;The Proceedings of Tbilisi University&quot; has been published since 1919. The program Textbooks for Students has been functioning since 1996. The University publishes two weekly newspapers &quot;Tbilisis Universiteti&quot; (since 1927) and &quot;Kartuli Universiteti&quot; (since 1998).

<text>Preston North End Football Club, commonly referred to as Preston, North End or PNE, is a professional association football club in Preston, Lancashire, England. They currently play in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system.

Originally a cricket club, Preston has been based at Deepdale since 1875. The club first took up football in 1878 as a winter fitness activity, and decided to focus on it in May 1880, when the football club was officially founded. Deepdale is now football&#x27;s oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a league club. Preston North End was a founder member of the Football League in 1888. In the 1888–89 season, the team won both the inaugural league championship and the FA Cup, the latter without conceding a goal. They were the first team to achieve the &quot;Double&quot; in English football and, as they were unbeaten in all matches, are remembered as &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. Preston won the league championship again in 1889–90 but their only major success since then has been their 1938 FA Cup final victory over Huddersfield Town. The club&#x27;s most famous players have been Sir Tom Finney, Alan Kelly Sr. and Bill Shankly, who are all commemorated at Deepdale by stands named after them.

Until 1961, Preston were usually members of the First Division but, having been relegated after the 1960–61 season, they have not yet returned to the top flight. They were first relegated to the Third Division after the 1969–70 season and have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions of the Football League, including a span of 19 seasons from 1981–1982 to 1999–2000. Preston has faced serious financial issues and was twice in danger of closure. The club was owned by businessman Trevor Hemmings until his death in October 2021 and has been in the EFL Championship since gaining promotion in 2015, with a highest finishing position since then of 7th (2017–18).

==History==
Preston North End was founded in 1863, originally as a cricket club, and played their first matches at the Marsh near the River Ribble in the Preston suburb of Ashton. Later that year, they switched to Moor Park in the north of the town, calling themselves &quot;North End&quot; in recognition of the new location. On 21 January 1875, the club leased a field opposite Moor Park on the site of the current Deepdale stadium, which has been its home ever since.

The club formed a rugby union team in 1877 as a winter fitness activity but this was not a success and, a year later, they played their first game under the rules of association football. In May 1880, a proposal to fully adopt the association code was unanimously accepted and Preston North End Football Club was officially founded.

Preston became one of the first professional clubs by hiring players from Scotland. The players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. In 1887, they beat Hyde 26–0 in the first round of the FA Cup, still a record winning margin in English first-class football. Scottish forward Jimmy Ross scored eight goals in the match before going on to score 19 goals in the competition that season, also still a record.
In 1888–89, Preston became the first league champions and the first winners of &quot;The Double&quot;, becoming the only team to date to go throughout an entire season unbeaten in both the league and FA Cup – winning the FA Cup without conceding a goal. The team did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players (the Scotch Professors). In a contribution to Paul Agnew&#x27;s 1989 biography of Tom Finney, the player himself wrote: &quot;The club has long been known as Proud Preston, and the Old Invincibles of the previous century set some incredible standards&quot;. The author wrote elsewhere: &quot;...and that team became immortalised as the &#x27;Old Invincibles&#x27;&quot;. Other sources call the team &quot;The Invincibles&quot; and both versions of the nickname have been used. In his autobiography, Finney wrote: &quot;The championship stayed with North End — by now tagged the Old Invincibles — the following year, but runners-up spot had to suffice for the next three seasons&quot;. As Finney said, Preston were league champions again in 1889–90, but have not won the title since. In total, they have been league runners-up six times, including the three consecutive seasons from 1890-91 to 1892–93, and twice in the 1950s when Finney was playing. The club&#x27;s last major trophy win was in the 1938 FA Cup Final when they defeated Huddersfield Town 1–0 and the team included Bill Shankly, Andy Beattie and goalscorer George Mutch.

Preston&#x27;s most famous player, Tom Finney, joined the club as a teenager in 1938. His first team debut was delayed until 1946 by the Second World War but he played for Preston until he retired in 1960. He was nicknamed the &quot;Preston Plumber&quot; because of his local business. Finney remains the club&#x27;s top goalscorer, with 187 goals from 433 appearances, and also scored 30 international goals for England in 76 appearances.

A year after Finney&#x27;s retirement, Preston were relegated to the Second Division and have not played in the top division since. They had a memorable season in 1963–64 when, managed by former player Jimmy Milne, they finished third in the Second Division and reached the 1964 FA Cup Final where they lost a thrilling match 3–2 to West Ham United.

Preston were first relegated to the Third Division after the 1969–70 season. Although they won promotion again immediately, the team have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions, including a span of 19 seasons from 1981-82 to 1999–2000. The club experienced a near-terminal decline in the 1980s which brought about the very real threat of closure, the nadir being the 1985–86 season when they finished 23rd in the Fourth Division and had to seek re-election to the league.
Under manager John McGrath, the team recovered and won promotion back to the Third Division only a year later but it was a false dawn as the team spent another three years in the bottom division from 1993 to 1996. The club finally began to recover and move forward after a takeover by heating manufacturer Baxi in 1994 but their ownership ended in June 2002. The team&#x27;s central defender David Moyes, then aged 34, began his managerial career when appointed by the Baxi-controlled board in February 1998. Moyes was successful and managed the team to the third tier championship in 2000. Preston reached the 2001 play-off final but were defeated by Bolton Wanderers. In the 2005 play-off final, under Moyes&#x27; successor Billy Davies, Preston were beaten 1–0 by West Ham United.

Following the Baxi sell-off and the departure of Moyes to Everton in 2002, the team was established at second-tier level through the 2000s but more problems arose at the end of the decade with an HM Revenue and Customs winding-up order in 2010 and relegation to the third tier in 2011. The taxation issue was resolved by local businessman Trevor Hemmings, already a shareholder, who bought a controlling interest in June 2010. The team were promoted again, via the play-offs, in 2015 and have remained in the EFL Championship since then, with a highest finishing position of 7th in the 2017–18 season.

==Ground==
Deepdale was the original cricket club&#x27;s home from 1875 and has been a football venue from 1878. It is the world&#x27;s oldest football ground in terms of continuous use by a club in a major league. The biggest attendance seen was 42,684 for a Division One clash with Arsenal in April 1938.

When Baxi took control, it embarked on an investment programme between 1996 and 2009 with the aim of upgrading Deepdale into a modern stadium. The old ground was demolished and rebuilt in four stages and the last of the new stands was opened in 2008. The stadium has a seated capacity of 23,404. The current pitch dimensions are 110 x 75 yards.

Part of the Baxi-funded redevelopment was the original National Football Museum which opened at Deepdale in 2001, but it was relocated to Manchester in 2012 after being closed for two years.

===Statue===

Outside the Sir Tom Finney Stand is a statue of the famous player himself, which is known as &quot;The Splash&quot; or the &quot;Tom Finney Splash&quot;. The statue, sculpted by Peter Hodgkinson and unveiled in July 2004, was inspired by a famous photograph taken at the Chelsea versus Preston game in 1956, played at Stamford Bridge in particularly wet conditions.

===1913 terrorist incident===

An attempt was made to destroy the ground in 1913. As part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, suffragettes carried out a series of bombings and arson attacks nationwide during their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. In April 1913, suffragettes attempted to burn down Deepdale&#x27;s grandstand but were foiled. In the same year, suffragettes succeeded in burning down Arsenal&#x27;s then South London stadium, and also attempted to burn down Blackburn Rovers&#x27; ground. More traditionally male sports were targeted in order to protest against male dominance.

==Sponsorship and kits==

Preston North End have traditionally worn white shirts with blue shorts for their home kit, with yellow being a common colour for Preston&#x27;s away kit. The club&#x27;s main sponsors, since shirt sponsorship was introduced in 1979, have been as follows:

==Rivalries==

Historically, Preston North End&#x27;s main rivalry is with Blackpool — the two clubs&#x27; grounds being seventeen miles apart — and the West Lancashire derby between the two clubs has been contested 96 times across all four divisions of the Football League and cup competitions since 1901. Preston&#x27;s other local rivals in the league over the years include Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic.

<text>GLORIAD (Global Ring Network for Advanced Application Development) is a high-speed computer network used to connect scientific organizations in Russia, China, United States, the Netherlands, Korea and Canada. India, Singapore, Vietnam, and Egypt were added in 2009.

GLORIAD is sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, a consortium of science organizations and Ministries in Russia, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Science and Technology of Korea, the Canadian CANARIE network, the national research network in The Netherlands SURFnet and has some telecommunications services donated by Tyco Telecommunications.

GLORIAD provides bandwidth of up to 10 Gbit/s via OC-192 links, e.g. between KRLight in Korea and the Pacific NorthWest GigaPOP in the United States.

The previous version of the network, &quot;Little GLORIAD&quot;, was completed in mid-2004, and it connected Chicago, Hong Kong, Beijing, Novosibirsk, Moscow, Amsterdam and Chicago again. For this network, a direct computer link was drawn between Russia and China for the first time in history.
