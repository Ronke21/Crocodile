<text>Jalal Talabani (; ; 12 November 1933 – 3 October 2017) was an Iraqi Kurdish politician who served as the sixth president of Iraq from 2005 to 2014, as well as the president of the Governing Council of Iraq.

Talabani was the founder and secretary-general of one of the main Kurdish political parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). He was a prominent member of the Interim Iraq Governing Council, which was established following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Talabani was an advocate for Kurdish rights and democracy in Iraq for more than 50 years.

==Early life ==
Talabani was born in Kelkan village into the Koysinjaq branch of the Talabani family. The Talabani lineage has produced many leading social figures including the poet Riza Talabani, his grandfather, Abd al-Karim Qasim prime minister (1958–1963) and former National Democratic Party&#x27;s member Hasan Talabani and Mukarram Talabani, a prominent member of the Communist party.

Talabani received his elementary and intermediate school education in Koya (Koysanjak) and his high school education in Erbil and Kirkuk. When he was in his teens, Talabani&#x27;s peers began referring to him as &quot;Mam&quot; Jalal, as &#x27;mam&#x27; meaning &quot;paternal uncle&quot; in Kurdish, and the Kurds have called him by this affectionate name ever since. In 1953, he began to study law at the Baghdad University. He had to flee into exile in Syria in 1956, in order to prevent an arrest for being involved In activities of the Kurdish Students Union. Residing in Damascus, he was involved in the establishment the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS). He later returned to Iraq and gained a degree in 1959.

==Career==

===Rights for Kurds===
After completing his studies at the Baghdad University, he entered the Iraqi Army, where he served shortly as a tank unit commander. In the early 1960s, he was made the head of the Polit bureau of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). When in September 1961, the Kurdish uprising for the rights of the Kurds in northern Iraq was declared against the Baghdad government of Abd al-Karim Qasim, Talabani took charge of the Kirkuk and Silemani battlefronts and organized and led separatist movements in Mawat, Rezan and the Qaradagh regions.

In March 1962, he led a coordinated offensive that brought about the liberation of the district of Sharbazher from Iraqi government forces. When not engaged in fighting in the early and mid-1960s, Talabani undertook numerous diplomatic missions, representing the Kurdish leadership at meetings in Europe and the Middle East. In 1964, he and the Barzani family had a dispute over the direction of the KDP and Talabani left Iraq and settled in Iran. In Iran he purchased weapons without the knowledge of the Barzanis, following which he was expelled from the KDP in summer 1964.

After the March 1970 agreement between the Iraqi government and the Kurdish rebels, Talabani returned to Iraqi Kurdistan, and rejoined the KDP, even though he wouldn&#x27;t hold an office at the time. The Kurdish separatist movement collapsed in March 1975, after Iran ended their support in exchange for a border agreement with Iraq. This agreement was the 1975 Algiers Agreement, where Iraq gave up claims to the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rūd) waterway and Khuzestan, which later became the basis for the Iran–Iraq War. Believing it was time to give a new direction to the Kurdish separatists and to the Kurdish society, Talabani, with a group of Kurdish intellectuals and activists, founded the Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (Yekiaiti Nishtimani Kurdistan) in 1975.

In 1976, he began organizing an armed campaign for Kurdish independence inside Iraqi Kurdistan. From 1977 onwards, he established the PUK base within Iranian Kurdistan in Nawkhan and another one in Iraqi Kurdistan in Qandil. During the 1980s, Talabani sided with Iran and led a Kurdish struggle from bases inside Iraq until the crackdown against Kurdish separatists from 1987 to 1988. Following the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990, he travelled to the United States, in order to offer his services and troops to the United States and raise support for the PUK. But his attempts did not bear the success he expected at the time.

In 1991, he helped inspire a renewed effort for Kurdish independence. He negotiated a ceasefire with the Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist government that saved the lives of many Kurds and worked closely with the United States, United Kingdom, France and other countries to set up the safe haven in Iraqi Kurdistan. In 1992 the Kurdistan Regional Government was founded. He was also supportive of peace negotiations between the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party and Turkey, and was also present as Abdullah Öcalan announced the ceasefire of the PKK on 17 March and prolonged it indefinitely on 16 April 1993. He was given a Turkish passport by the then-president Turgut Özal in 1992 in order to help Talabani travel freely. He returned the passport in 2003.

Talabani pursued a negotiated settlement to the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War, as well as the larger issue of Kurdish rights in the current regional context. He worked closely with other Kurdish politicians as well as the rest of the Iraqi opposition factions. In close coordination with Masoud Barzani, Talabani and the Kurds played a key role as a partner of the U.S. led Coalition in the invasion of Iraq.

Talabani was a member of the Iraqi Governing Council which negotiated the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), Iraq&#x27;s interim constitution. The TAL governed all politics in Iraq and the process of writing and adopting the final constitution.

===Presidency=== 


Talabani was elected President of Iraq on 6 April 2005, by the Iraqi National Assembly and sworn into office the following day.

On 22 April 2006, Talabani began his second term as President of Iraq, becoming the first President elected under the country&#x27;s new constitution. His office was part of the Presidency Council of Iraq. Nawshirwan Mustafa was Talabani&#x27;s deputy until Mustafa resigned in 2006 and formed an opposition party called Gorran.

He supported Barzani&#x27;s extended presidency of the Kurdistan Region post-2013.

==Health and death==
On 18 December 2012, Talabani suffered a stroke and was in intensive care in Baghdad, where his condition eventually stabilized after reports that he was in a coma. A statement on the President&#x27;s official website said that he was being treated for blocked arteries. On 20 December, Talabani&#x27;s condition had improved enough to allow travel to Germany for treatment. The head of Talabani&#x27;s medical team in Iraq has been Governor Najmiddin Karim. On 19 July 2014, Jalal Talabani returned to Iraq after more than 18 months of medical treatment. Due to his absence from politics, as a result of his illness, the PUK became consumed by a succession crisis.

Jalal Talabani died on 3 October 2017, at the age of 83 in Berlin, Germany of cerebral hemorrhage due to the complications caused by the stroke he suffered five years prior in 2012. He died a few days after the referendum about the independence of Iraqi Kurdistan was approved by the voters. Masoud Barzani, President of Kurdistan Regional Government and for years his Kurdish rival, announced seven days of mourning in Iraqi Kurdistan in memory of Talabani. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi also announced three days of mourning in the country. His state funeral was held on 6 October 2017. Millions turned out across the cities and memorials were held across the globe.

==Personal life==
Talabani was married to Hero Ibrahim Ahmed, daughter of Ibrahim Ahmed. They had two sons, Bafel and Qubad. Qubad is the deputy prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil since 2014. His nephew is Lahur Talabany.

<doc id="440245" wikidata="Q66288" url="?curid=440245" title="Rudolf Bahro">
<text>Rudolf Bahro (18 November 1935 – 5 December 1997) was a dissident from East Germany who, since his death, has been recognized as a philosopher, political figure and author. Bahro was a leader of the West German party The Greens, but left the party after becoming disenchanted with the party. Bahro spent the remainder of his life exploring spiritual approaches to sustainability at Humboldt University in Berlin.

==Early life and education==
Bahro was the eldest of three children of Max Bahro, a livestock-industry consultant, and Irmgard Bahro (née Conrad). Until 1945, the family lived in Lower Silesia: first in the spa town of Bad Flinsberg and then in neighboring Gerlachsheim, where Bahro attended the village school. Towards the end of World War II Max Bahro was drafted into the Volkssturm, and, after his capture, detained as a Polish prisoner. As the Eastern Front approached, the family was evacuated and Bahro was separated from his mother and siblings during the flight (the rest of Bahro&#x27;s family, with the exception of his father, died of typhoid soon afterwards). Bahro lived with an aunt in Austria and Hesse, spending several months in each location and eventually reuniting with his father, who was managing a widow&#x27;s farm in Rießen (now part of Siehdichum).

From 1950 to 1954, Bahro attended high school in Fürstenberg (now part of Eisenhüttenstadt). Since it was assumed that all high-school students would join the Free German Youth (FDJ), Bahro reluctantly joined in 1950. This was, as he later commented, the only time he did something against his will under pressure. In 1952 he applied for membership in the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which he joined in 1954. Bahro was regarded as intelligent, and graduated from high school with honors. He attended Humboldt University in Berlin from 1954 to 1959 and studied philosophy. Among his teachers were Kurt Hager (who later became the philosopher of the SED), Georg Klaus and Wolfgang Heise. The topic of his thesis was &quot;Johannes R. Becher and the relationship of the German working class and its party to the national question of our people&quot;.

Until 1956, Bahro was an admirer of Lenin and Stalin; Khrushchev&#x27;s leaked &quot;secret speech&quot; in February 1956 changed his views. He followed the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolution with great interest, expressed his solidarity with the insurgents in a wall newspaper and openly criticized the restricted-information policy of the GDR leadership. As a result of his views, national security spied on him for two years.

==Party work==
After passing the government licensing examination, the SED sent Bahro to Sachsendorf (a part of Lindendorf). He edited a local newspaper, &quot;Die Linie&quot; (&quot;The Line&quot;) and encouraged the area&#x27;s farmers to join the LPG agricultural cooperative. In 1959 Bahro married Gundula Lambke, a Russian language teacher. The couple had two daughters (one of whom died at birth) and a son, in addition to Gundula&#x27;s daughter. In 1960 Bahro was appointed to the party leadership of the University of Greifswald, where he founded the &quot;Unsere Universität&quot; (&quot;Our University&quot;) newspaper and served as editor-in-chief. The same year saw the publication of his first book, a collection of poems entitled &quot;In dieser Richtung&quot; (&quot;In This Direction&quot;). Beginning in 1962, Bahro worked as a consultant for the Corporate Executive Committee of the Union of Science (one of the divisions of the Free German Trade Union Federation) in Berlin; in 1965 he was appointed deputy chief of the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) student magazine, &quot;Forum&quot;. During Bahro&#x27;s tenure with the FDJ he was hampered by conflict with the increasingly restrictive policies of the SED, which made him a target of criticism. Due to the unauthorized publication of an article by Volker Braun, Bahro was dismissed as deputy chief in 1967.

==Evolution of ideas==
From 1967 to 1977 Bahro worked for a number of companies in the rubber and plastics industry as an organization development specialist. Seeing conditions in the factories soon brought him to the conclusion that the East German economy was in a crisis and the primary reason for this was that workers had little voice in the workplace. He expressed this view in a December 1967 letter to the Chairman of the State Council, Walter Ulbricht, proposing a transfer of workplace responsibility to the workers with grassroots democracy. A few weeks later, the Prague Spring began; Bahro took a lively interest, supported the movement. In May 1968 he was interviewed by a member of the Central Committee, who made it clear that his solidarity with the &quot;counter-revolution&quot; was no longer tolerated. This led Bahro to develop his ideas systematically, and to publish them. His decision was reinforced by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August. This was, as Bahro later said, &quot;the blackest day&quot; of his life and the reason for his final break with the SED. He decided not to make the break publicly, to protect his book project.

In 1972 Bahro began part-time work on his dissertation on development conditions of high-school and technical-college groups in the VEBs (state-owned enterprises of the GDR). At the same time, he secretly wrote a thematically broader manuscript which later became &quot;The Alternative&quot;. In 1973, Gundula filed for divorce; both spouses said later this was as a precautionary measure to protect the children against government reprisals. However, in 1974 Gundula informed state security about the secret book project and handed over a copy of the manuscript; after that, Bahro was under surveillance.

In 1975 Bahro submitted his dissertation at the Technical University Leuna-Merseburg, which was evaluated favorably by three reviewers. The Stasi intervened, engineering two opposing reviews. His work on &quot;The Alternative&quot; was unhindered, but Bahro was convinced that he would be unable to disseminate his book to the GDR citizenry. In December 1976 he learned that one of his samizdats had fallen into Stasi hands, which prompted him to finish his work quickly. Intermediaries arranged a contract with Europäische Verlagsanstalt, a West German publisher. Swiss musicologist Harry Goldschmidt smuggled the finished manuscript into West Berlin, and copies of the manuscript reached individuals in the GDR by mail.

Later in West Germany, Bahro said that the theoretical bases for &quot;The Alternative&quot; were Karl August Wittfogel&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power&quot; and earlier Marxist works. He was unable to cite Wittfogel because of the latter&#x27;s anticommunism. Wittfogel also influenced Bahro&#x27;s later ecological work.

==&quot;The Alternative&quot;==
&quot;The Alternative&quot; is divided into three parts:
# The non-capitalist path to an industrial society
# Anatomy of socialism
# Strategy for a communist alternative
The introduction begins with the premise that the Communist movement did not lead to the theoretically expected situation, but instead continued on the capitalist path with only superficial changes. &quot;Alienation and the subaltern mentality of the working masses continue on a new level.&quot; The book analyzes the reasons for this, and offers solutions.

The first part is a historical analysis of the development of socialism in the Soviet Union. Bahro concludes that in the Soviet Union (and, consequently, also in countries such as the GDR) not the theoretically expected socialism but a form of proto-socialism had emerged. For the reason, he posits that at the time of the October Revolution the Soviet Union was far from the stage of development presumed in Marx&#x27;s theory of history. Nevertheless, the path chosen by Lenin was correct. Bahro regards Stalin&#x27;s subsequent massive industrialization as a necessary development, justifying the party purge as inevitable.

In the second part, Bahro analyzes the existing social system, which he believes was incorrectly called &quot;real socialism&quot; when in reality it was still a class society. He details how this society worked, and argues that this provided the rationale for the observed economic stagnation.

In the third part, he develops solutions, including a call for a new revolution which would transform not only the social circumstances but the people. Its intention is to overcome the subaltern mentality, the &quot;form of existence and way of thinking of ordinary people.&quot; He demands the abolition of the division of labor; all should participate in science, art and menial work.

==Response==
On 22 August 1977, the West German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published an extract from &quot;The Alternative&quot; and an interview with Bahro, during which he admitted writing the book. The next day, Bahro was arrested and taken to the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen prison. That evening, West German television stations ARD and ZDF broadcast Bahro&#x27;s interview.

In early September, the book went on sale. The first edition was sold out before delivery, and was translated into other languages. &quot;The Alternative&quot; sparked debate in the West European left about the nature of socialism. From November 16-19 an &quot;International Congress on and for Rudolf Bahro&quot; was held in West Berlin. Notable leftists from around Europe, such as Herbert Marcuse, Pierre Frank, Rudi Dutschke, and others attended. Their contributions were subsequently published. They also called for Bahro&#x27;s release from prison. Among the attendees was Herbert Marcuse, who considered Bahro&#x27;s book &quot;the most important contribution to Marxist theory and practice that has appeared in recent decades;&quot; a similar view was expressed by the Trotskyist Ernest Mandel, who called the book &quot;the most important theoretical work to come out of the countries that have abolished capitalism since Leon Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot;.&quot; To Lawrence Krader, Bahro was the &quot;conscience of the revolution, the strength of the truth&quot;. Rudi Dutschke was critical, classifying Bahro as detached from Leninism with too little respect for human rights and calling his suggestions &quot;totally unrealistic.&quot; In contrast Ivan Szelenyi criticized what he referred to as Bahro&#x27;s &quot;neo-Leninism&quot; and &quot;neo-Bolshevism.&quot; 

These analyses were accompanied by a broad wave of publicly expressed solidarity with Bahro, climaxing in a letter by Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass in &quot;The Times&quot; on 1 February 1978 that was also signed by Arthur Miller, Graham Greene, Carol Stern, Mikis Theodorakis and other celebrities. In the GDR, however, Bahro&#x27;s recognition was suppressed, and he was told nothing of the reaction to his book and subsequent arrest. About half of the copies of &quot;The Alternative,&quot; which Bahro had mailed shortly before his arrest in the GDR, were intercepted by East German authorities. His influence on East German students was thus limited.

To write and publish a book was, in itself, legal in the GDR; however, Bahro was accused of working for the West German intelligence service (from whom he was thought to have obtained his information). On 30 June 1978, Bahro was convicted &quot;in camera&quot; of treason and betraying state secrets and sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment. Evidence indicates a kangaroo court with a predetermined verdict; an appeal to the Supreme Court of the GDR filed by defense attorney Gregor Gysi was summarily rejected as unfounded.

The verdict immediately sparked violent protests and expressions of solidarity in the West. The Committee for the Release of Rudolf Bahro organized an international conference, held 16 to 19 November 1978 in West Berlin and attended by over 2,000 participants. The depth of solidarity is illustrated by an appeal to the State Council of the GDR in the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; of 11 May 1979, organized by Bahro Committee in 12 countries and signed by a number of celebrities. Bahro was awarded the Carl von Ossietzky Medal by the International League for Human Rights (Berlin) and made a member of the Swedish and Danish chapters of PEN International.

On 11 October 1979, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Bahro was granted amnesty. On 17 October he was deported with his former wife, their two children and his partner Ursula Beneke to the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with his July request..

==West German work==
In West Germany Bahro soon joined the nascent party The Greens, making a commitment to unite socialist and values-based conservatism currents in the new party since compromise was a necessity. His 1980 book &quot;Socialism and Survival&quot; formulated elements of a new policy: the relationship between ecology and socialism. Breaking from his position in &quot;The Alternative&quot;, Bahro now felt that classical Marxism was no longer appropriate.

Another new motif in Bahro&#x27;s thinking was religion. While in custody he had studied the Bible, and when he moved to the west, he noticed unhappiness in spite of material prosperity. He interpreted this as a lack of introspection and transcendence, rejecting the traditionally materialistic outlook of socialism. The goal of human emancipation was represented (in different ways) by Karl Marx and Jesus Christ. In this context, Bahro referred to early Christianity and liberation theology.

At the beginning of 1980, Bahro studied with Oskar Negt at the University of Hanover. His thesis appeared as a book, &quot;A Plea for Creative Initiative&quot;. In 1983, he earned his habilitation in social philosophy.

In 1982, Bahro adopted a more radical position due to the contemporary economic crisis. He advocated a restructuring of society in economic, environmental and social-policy terms, which should be linked to a broad retreat from the world market and a move away from capitalist industry. Bahro also became involved in the peace movement, advocating a nuclear-free Europe.

Bahro&#x27;s Dare Commune was an alternative community during the early days of the Greens. He believed that the transformation of society must begin on a small scale, requiring a change in the people themselves and a rediscovery of spirituality. Bahro was influenced by the Congregation of the Benedictines and the mystical experience of God.

In 1981 Bahro visited North Korea, where he was received as a guest of the state. He saw this as his most important trip, to a state he admired with a system &quot;to satisfy all the basic requirements of security&quot;. As part of a lecture tour of the United States in summer 1983, Bahro enjoyed several weeks at Rajneeshpuram with Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho).

After the Green Party entered the Bundestag for the first time in March 1983, the question arose whether they would join a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (the SPD) or remain in opposition. Bahro strongly favored the latter option (which placed him in opposition to Joschka Fischer), and believed in renewal rather than reform. In his December 1984 &quot;Hamburg speech,&quot; Bahro made a comparison with the political and social situation in the Weimar Republic: At that time, there had also been a broad movement in society that was dissatisfied with prevailing conditions and wanted change. What mattered now was to prevent the errors and political disasters of the past. In the Weimar Republic, the &quot;brown&quot; pole of the political spectrum (the Nazis) overpowered the left with &quot;nationalist mythology in disguise; therefore, resistance to capitalist development&quot; could not begin. Bahro&#x27;s &quot;popular uprising&quot; could occur this time without violence, but it was important that the Greens &quot;are not lost&quot; in the system. Bahro also called for the conquest of the right-left divide: to escape its minority position, the Greens should also &quot;penetrate the territory of the Bavarian CSU.&quot; Bahro&#x27;s Hamburg speech ended with the allegation that Joschka Fischer&#x27;s supporters had a lust for power, a situation that could lead to civil war and subsequent dictatorship.

During the summer of 1985 Bahro left the Greens and focused on his new book, which was published in 1987 as &quot;Logic of Salvation&quot;. In it he described a &quot;logic of self-extermination&quot; and its consequences for humanity at present, presenting a &quot;logic of life&quot; requiring a &quot;leap in consciousness&quot; and a withdrawal from the industrial &quot;mega-machine.&quot; It was important to implement a &quot;rescue policy,&quot; before the worsening environmental crisis leads to an emergency government. Bahro called for long-term goals, the elimination of short-term tactics and government decentralization. He advocated an &quot;invisible church,&quot; which would provide the necessary spiritual dimension. As a conservative on the left, he noted common ground with CDU politician and critic Kurt Biedenkopf. Inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;perestroika&quot;, Bahro hoped for a &quot;prince of environmental change&quot; and suggested the establishment of a consensus-oriented body similar to the British House of Lords. The book met a mostly negative response, and Bahro&#x27;s references to a prince and an invisible church were criticized.

In 1986, Bahro held &quot;learning workshops&quot; at his home in Worms, which featured discussion of his ideas and meditation. He met Beatrice Ingermann, who had been conducting a similar project since 1983 that at a community in the Eifel. Bahro joined her group; they married in 1988 and had a daughter.

==In Berlin after the fall of the Wall==
Seeing the rapid decline of the GDR, at the end of 1989 Bahro went to East Berlin to fight against the feared &quot;sellout of the GDR,&quot; its absorption by the Federal Republic. He wanted to work to ensure that the regime could keep its autonomy and maintain what he thought was its greatest political achievement: the primacy of politics over economics.

On 16 December 1989, Bahro had the opportunity of speaking to the assembled delegates of the extraordinary party conference of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whose chairman had been his former legal counsel, Gregor Gysi. The main item on the agenda was whether the party should continue or be dissolved. What was finally decided was that the party should continue under a new name: Socialist Unity Party of Germany – Party of Democratic Socialism (German: Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands – Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus, abbreviated SED-PDS). Bahro&#x27;s request to address the conference as a guest speaker found only a slight majority (54%), and he was granted only 30 minutes, not the requested 45 minutes. Bahro was annoyed at this and had to improvise. After reading out the names of all the people who had helped him with his book &quot;Die Alternative&quot;, he criticized the previous speaker, Minister President and Deputy Party Chairman Hans Modrow, as well as Karl Marx, Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. He went on to present his vision of a &quot;socio-ecological&quot; restructuring of the GDR. His radical environmental ideas, which were hardly known in the GDR at that time, were far removed from the problems that interested the delegates, and his polemical introduction provoked fierce resentment. Bahro concluded that he no longer had anything in common with this party.

In the spring of 1990, he began setting up an &quot;Institute for Social Ecology&quot; at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Instead of the usual discussion of the ecological crisis, he wanted this institute to address the issue holistically and, above all, study the deeper social and cultural causes of the crisis and develop practical alternatives. Bahro thus set up his own school of social science that is not to be confused with others that also go by the name of social ecology.

On 16 June 1990, again represented by Gysi, Bahro was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the GDR. On 15 September, shortly before the end of the GDR, the Minister of Education and Science appointed him associate professor of social ecology at Humboldt University. From the winter semester 1990/91, Bahro regularly held lectures on issues of the environmental crisis, where he further developed the theories that he had put forward in his book &quot;Logik der Rettung&quot; (published in English as &quot;Avoiding Social and Ecological Disaster: The Politics of World Transformation: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Spiritual and Ecological Politics&quot;). The lectures, to which he frequently invited guest speakers, were aimed at students in all years and also attracted an audience from outside the university. In the first years, the main lecture hall (&quot;auditorium maximum&quot;) of the university was consistently full, which resulted in increased sales of his book on which the lectures were based. However, the Institute remained a temporary arrangement that could only exist thanks to financial support from the Schweisfurth Foundation [de]. It was not until 1995 that the institute was integrated into the university as a working group of the Faculty of Agriculture and Horticulture.

In 1990, there were accusations that Bahro was striving for &quot;eco-dictatorship.&quot; This accusation was made particularly aggressively by the &quot;&quot;, a right-wing organization founded in Zurich which, in a work titled &quot;The Fascism of the New Left&quot;, claimed that Bahro&#x27;s real goal was an &quot;eco-fascist dictatorship.&quot; Bahro indignantly denied this but soon found himself confronted with more accusations of this nature. The accusations were based on quotations from his book &quot;Logik der Rettung&quot;. In 1992, a former party colleague of his, Jutta Ditfurth, joined the debate when, in her book &quot;Feuer in die Herzen&quot; [Putting Fire in the Hearts], she accused him of turning to esoteric, authoritarian and nationalist ideas.

In addition to his activities in Berlin, until 1991 Bahro also active in the &quot;Lernwerkstatt&quot; [Learning Workshop] a non-profit organization in Niederstadtfeld, in which he planned similar experiments with new sustainable living and economic systems in the former GDR. A conversation with the Minister-President of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, in the summer of 1991 led to the socio-ecological futurology project &quot;LebensGut&quot; in the village of Pommritz, near Bautzen. There the socio-ecological research begun at the Humboldt University is also being continued, mainly by Bahro&#x27;s former associate Maik Hosang.

In September 1993, Bahro&#x27;s wife Beatrice committed suicide following a marital dispute. Bahro was so devastated that he canceled a semester of lectures. In the spring of 1994, he also became physically ill, and in the autumn of that year he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. Bahro was convinced that his illness was the consequence of traumatic experiences such as the suicide of his wife, so he resisted conventional therapy, instead trying various alternative methods of diagnosis and therapy and temporarily moving into a monastery. Only after his condition deteriorated dramatically did he agree to another course of chemotherapy. In May 1995, on his sickbed, he married his girlfriend and companion Marina Lehnert, who had been caring for his daughter for some time.

After a year&#x27;s break due to illness, in summer 1996 Bahro resumed teaching, but only to a limited extent. He gave his last lecture in July 1997. After that, he caught pneumonia and the cancer broke out again.

Rudolf Bahro died in Berlin on 5 December 1997 and was buried at the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin.

<text>Corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards are regulations in the United States, first enacted by the United States Congress in 1975, after the 1973–74 Arab Oil Embargo, to improve the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks (trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles) produced for sale in the United States. More recently, efficiency standards were developed and implemented for heavy-duty pickup trucks and commercial medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. CAFE neither directly offers incentives for customers to choose fuel efficient vehicles nor directly affects fuel prices. Rather, it attempts to accomplish the goals indirectly, by making it more expensive for automakers to build inefficient vehicles by introducing penalties.

CAFE standards are administered by the secretary of transportation via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The original CAFE standards sought to drive automotive innovation to curtail fuel consumption, and now the aim is also to create domestic jobs and cut global warming.
Stringent CAFE standards together with government incentives for fuel efficient vehicles in the United States should accelerate the demand for electric vehicles.

==Overview==
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended by the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), requires that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) establish standards separately for passenger automobiles (passenger cars) and nonpassenger automobiles (light trucks) at the maximum feasible levels in each model year, and requires that DOT enforce compliance with the standards. DOT has delegated the responsibilities to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Through EPCA and EISA, U.S. law (49 U.S. Code § 32919) also preempts state or local laws: &quot;a State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards.&quot;

The CAFE achieved by a given fleet of vehicles in a given model year is the production-weighted harmonic mean fuel economy, expressed in miles per US gallon (mpg), of a manufacturer&#x27;s fleet of current model year passenger cars or light trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds (3,856 kg) or less (but also including medium-duty passenger vehicles, such as large sport-utility vehicles and passenger vans, with GVWR up to 10,000 pounds), produced for sale in the United States. The CAFE standards in a given model year define the CAFE levels that manufacturers&#x27; fleets are required to meet in that model year, specific levels depending on the characteristics and mix of vehicles produced by each manufacturer. If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer&#x27;s annual fleet of vehicle production falls below the applicable requirement, the manufacturer must either apply sufficient CAFE credits (see below) to cover the shortfall or pay a penalty, currently $14 per 0.1 mpg under the standard, multiplied by the manufacturer&#x27;s total production for the U.S. domestic market. Congress established both of these provisions explicitly in EPCA, as amended in 2007 by EISA. In addition, a Gas Guzzler Tax is levied on individual passenger car models (but not trucks, vans, minivans, or SUVs) that get less than .

Starting in 2011, the CAFE standards are newly expressed as mathematical functions depending on vehicle footprint, a measure of vehicle size determined by multiplying the vehicle&#x27;s wheelbase by its average track width. A complicated 2011 mathematical formula was replaced starting in 2012 with a simpler inverse-linear formula with cutoff values.
CAFE footprint requirements are set up such that a vehicle with a larger footprint has a lower fuel economy requirement than a vehicle with a smaller footprint. For example, the fuel economy target for the 2012 Honda Fit with a footprint of is , equivalent to a published fuel economy of (see #Calculations of MPG overestimated for information regarding the difference), and a Ford F-150 with its footprint of has a fuel economy target of , i.e., published. Individual vehicles do not have to meet their fuel economy targets; CAFE compliance is enforced at the fleet level. CAFE 2016 target fuel economy of 34.0 MPG (44 sq. ft. footprint) compares to 2012 advanced vehicle performance of Prius hybrid on the compliance test cycles: 70.7 MPG, Plug-in Prius hybrid: 69.8 MPGe and LEAF electric vehicle: 141.7 MPGe. The compliance fuel economy of plug-in electric vehicles such as the Plug-in Prius or LEAF is complicated by accounting for the energy used in generating electricity.

CAFE has separate standards for &quot;passenger cars&quot; and &quot;light trucks&quot; even if the majority of &quot;light trucks&quot; are being used as passenger vehicles. The market share of &quot;light trucks&quot; grew steadily from 9.7% in 1979 to 47% in 2001, remained in 50% numbers up to 2011. More than 500,000 vehicles in the 1999 model year exceeded the GVWR cutoff and were thus omitted from CAFE calculations. More recently, coverage of medium duty trucks has been added to the CAFE regulations starting in 2012, and heavy duty commercial trucks starting in 2014.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulates CAFE standards and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measures vehicle fuel efficiency. Congress specifies that CAFE standards must be set at the &quot;maximum feasible level&quot; given consideration for:
# technological feasibility;
# economic practicality;
# effect of other standards on fuel economy;
# need of the nation to conserve energy.

Historically, the EPA has encouraged consumers to buy more fuel efficient vehicles, while the NHTSA expressed concerns that smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles may lead to increased traffic fatalities.
Thus higher fuel efficiency was associated with lower traffic safety, intertwining the issues of fuel economy, road-traffic safety, air pollution, and carbon emissions. In the mid-2000s, increasing safety of smaller cars and the poor safety record of light trucks began to reverse this association. Nevertheless, in 2008, the on-road vehicle fleets in the United States and Canada had the lowest overall average fuel economy among first world nations: in North America, versus in the European Union and was even higher in Japan, according to data as of 2008. Furthermore, despite general opinion that larger and heavier (and therefore relatively fuel-uneconomical) vehicles are safer, the U.S. traffic fatality rate—and its trend over time—is higher than some other western nations, although it has recently started to gradually decline at a faster rate than in previous years.

== Effect on automotive fuel economy ==
In 2002, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences wrote a report on the effects of the CAFE standard. The report&#x27;s conclusions include a finding that in the absence of CAFE, and with no other fuel economy regulation substituted, motor vehicle fuel consumption would have been approximately 14 percent higher than it actually was in 2002. However, due to the effect of these standards on the types and weights of vehicles sold, it has increased the costs of vehicles and may have led to an estimated 1,300 to 2,600 increased fatalities in the year 1993 alone, though certain members of the committee dissented from the latter opinion.

A plot of average overall vehicle fuel economy (CAFE) for new model year passenger cars, the required by law CAFE standard target fuel economy value (CAFE standard) for new model year passenger cars, and fuel prices, adjusted for inflation, shows that there has been little variation over the past 20 years. Within this period, there are three distinct periods of fuel economy change:
# from 1979 to 1982 the fuel economy rose as the CAFE standard rose dramatically and the price of fuel increased;
# from 1984 to 1986 the fuel economy rose as the CAFE standard rose and the price of fuel decreased rapidly;
# from 1986 to 1988 the fuel economy rose at a significantly subdued rate and eventually leveled off as the price of fuel fell and the CAFE standard was relaxed
before returning to 1986 levels in 1990. These are following by an extended period during which the passenger car CAFE standard, the observed average passenger car fuel economy, and the price of gasoline remained stable, and finally a period starting about 2003 when prices rose dramatically and fuel economy has slowly responded.

The law of supply and demand would predict that an increase in gasoline prices would lead in the long run to an increase in the average fuel economy of the U.S. passenger car fleet, and that a drop in gasoline prices would be associated with a reduction in the average fuel economy of the entire U.S. fleet. There is some evidence that this happened with an increase in market share of lower fuel economy light trucks and SUVs and decline in passenger car sales, as a percentage of total fleet sales, as car buying trends changed during the 1990s, the impact of which is not reflected in this chart.
In the case of passenger cars, U.S. average fuel economy did not fall as economic theory would predict, suggesting that CAFE standards maintained the higher fuel economy of the passenger car fleet during the long period from the end of the 1979 energy crisis to the rise of gasoline prices in the early 2000s. Most recently, fuel economy has increased about one mpg from 2006 to 2007. This increase is due primarily to increased fuel efficiency of imported cars. Similarly, the law of supply and demand predicts that due to the United States&#x27; large percentage consumption of the world&#x27;s oil supply, that increasing fuel economy would drive down the gasoline prices that U.S. consumers would otherwise have to pay. Reductions in petroleum demand in the United States helped create the collapse of OPEC market power in 1986.

The &quot;CAFE&quot; and &quot;CAFE standard&quot; shown here only regards new model passenger car fuel economy and target fuel economy (respectively) rather than the overall U.S. fuel economy average which tends to be dominated by used vehicles manufactured in previous years, new model light truck CAFE standards, light truck CAFE averages, or aggregate data.

== Calculation ==
Under CAFE regulations, a light vehicle&#x27;s fuel economy, formula_1, is determined as the weighted harmonic average of the values measured on the “city” (FTP-75) and “highway” (HWFET) drive cycles.

formula_2

formula_1 has long been known to overestimate real-world fuel economy which, as of the 2022 model year, is typically 76 percent of formula_1, and has gotten worse over its decades of use. formula_1 is not the same as the Monroney window sticker value for consumer information.

Fleet fuel economy is calculated using a harmonic mean, not a simple arithmetic mean (average) – namely, the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocal values. For a fleet composed of four different kinds of vehicle A, B, C and D, produced in numbers nA, nB, nC and nD, with fuel economies fA, fB, fC and fD, the CAFE would be:

formula_6

For example, a fleet of 4 vehicles getting 15, 13, 17, and 100 mpg has a CAFE of slightly less than 19 mpg:

formula_7

While the arithmetic mean fuel economy of the fleet is just over 36 mpg:

formula_8

The harmonic mean captures the fuel economy of driving each car in the fleet for the same number of miles, while the arithmetic mean captures the fuel economy of driving each car using the same amount of gas (i.e., the 13 mpg vehicle would travel with one gallon while the 100 mpg vehicle would travel 100 miles).

For the purposes of CAFE, a manufacturer&#x27;s car output is divided into a domestic fleet (vehicles with more than 75 percent U.S., Canadian or post-NAFTA Mexican content) and a foreign fleet (everything else). Each of these fleets must separately meet the requirements. The two-fleet requirement was developed by the United Automobile Workers (UAW) as a means to ensure job creation in the United States. The UAW successfully lobbied Congress to write this provision into the enabling legislation – and continues to advocate this position. The two fleet rule for light trucks was removed in 1996.

For the fuel economy calculation for alternative fuel vehicles, a gallon of alternative fuel is deemed to contain 15% fuel (which is approximately the amount of gasoline in a gallon of E85)
as an incentive to develop alternative fuel vehicles. The mileage for dual-fuel vehicles, such as E85 capable models and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, is computed as the average of its alternative fuel rating—divided by 0.15 (equal to multiplying by 6.666)—and its gasoline rating. Thus an E85-capable vehicle that gets 15 mpg on E-85 and 25 mpg on gasoline might logically be rated at 20 mpg. But in fact the average, for CAFE purposes, despite perhaps only one percent of the fuel used in E85-capable vehicles is actually E85, is computed as 100 mpg for E-85 and the standard 25 mpg for gasoline, or 62.5 mpg. However, the total increase in a manufacturer&#x27;s average fuel economy rating due to dual-fueled vehicles cannot exceed 1.2mpg. Section 32906 reduces the increase due to dual-fueled vehicles to 0 through 2020. Electric vehicles are also incentivized by the 0.15 fuel divisor, but are not subject to the 1.2 mpg cap like dual-fuel vehicles.

Manufacturers are also allowed to earn CAFE &quot;credits&quot; in any year they exceed CAFE requirements, which they may use to offset deficiencies in other years. CAFE credits can be applied to the three years before or the five years after the year in which they are earned. The reason for this flexibility is so manufacturers are penalized only for persistent failure to meet the requirements, not for transient non-compliance due to market conditions.

== History ==
Fuel economy regulations were first introduced in 1978, only for passenger vehicles. NHTSA kept CAFE standards for cars the same from 1985 to 2010, except for a slight decrease in required mpg from 1986 to 1989. The next year, a second category was defined for light trucks. These were distinguished from heavy duty vehicles by a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 6000 pounds or less. The GVWR threshold was raised to 8500 pounds in 1980 and has remained at that level through 2010. Thus certain large trucks and SUV&#x27;s were exempt, such as the Hummer and the Ford Excursion. From 1979 to 1991, separate standards were established for two-wheel drive (2WD) and four-wheel drive (4WD) light trucks, but for most of this period, car makers were allowed to choose between these separate standards or a combined standard to be applied to the entire fleet of light trucks they sold that model year. In 1980 and 1981, respectively, a manufacturer whose light truck fleet was powered exclusively by basic engines which were not also used in passenger cars could meet standards of 14 mpg and 14.5 mpg.

===Standards by model year, 1978–2020===
===Performance in practice===

Since 1980, the traditional Japanese manufacturers have increased their combined fleet average fuel economy by 1.6 miles per gallon according to the March 30, 2009, Summary of Fuel Economy Performance published annually by NHTSA. During this time, they also increased their sales in the United States by 221%. The traditional European manufacturers actually decreased their fleet average fuel economy by 2 miles per gallon while increasing their sales volume by 91%. The traditional U.S. manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors, increased their fleet average fuel economy by 4.1 miles per gallon since 1980 according to the government figures. During this time the sales of U.S. manufacturers decreased by 29%.

A number of manufacturers choose to pay CAFE penalties rather than attempt to comply with the regulations. These tend to be companies with small U.S. market share and expensive, high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche, Mercedes, and Fiat. In model year 2012, Jaguar (Land Rover) and Volvo did not meet CAFE requirements. They paid fines totaling 15 million dollars for the year.

For the 2014 model year, Mercedes SUVs followed by GM and Ford light trucks had the lowest fleet average while Tesla followed by Toyota and Mazda had the highest.

Before the oil price increases of the 2000s, overall fuel economy for both cars and light trucks in the U.S. market reached its highest level in 1987, when manufacturers managed 26.2 mpg (8.98 L/100 km). The average in 2004 was 24.6 mpg. In that time, vehicles increased in size from an average of 3,220 pounds to 4,066 pounds (1,461 kg to 1,844 kg), in part due to an increase in truck ownership from 28% to 53%.

===2006 reform attempt and lawsuit===
The CAFE rules for trucks were officially amended at the end of March 2006. However, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has the rules, returning them to NHTSA, as discussed below. These changes would have segmented truck fleets by vehicle size and class as of 2011. All SUVs and passenger vans up to 10,000 pounds GVWR would have had to comply with CAFE standards regardless of size, but pickup trucks and cargo vans over 8500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) would have remained exempt.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with NHTSA that economic benefit-cost analysis (maximizing net economic benefits to the Nation) is, under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), an appropriate method to select the maximum feasible stringency of CAFE standards, but nonetheless found that NHTSA incorrectly set a value of zero dollars to the global warming damage caused by CO2 emissions; failed to set a &quot;backstop&quot; to prevent trucks from emitting more CO2 than in previous years; failed to set standards for vehicles in the 8,500 to range; and failed to prepare a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) rather than a more abbreviated environmental impact assessment. The Court directed NHTSA to prepare a new standard as quickly as possible and to fully evaluate that new standard&#x27;s impact on the environment.

===Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007===
In 2007, the House and Senate passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) with broad support, setting a goal for the national fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2020 and rendering the court judgment obsolete. On December 19, 2007, President George W. Bush signed the bill. The bill&#x27;s standard would increase the fuel economy standards by 40 percent and save the United States billions of gallons of fuel. The requirement applies to all passenger automobiles, including &quot;light trucks.&quot; President Bush faced serious pressure to reduce the Nation&#x27;s dependency on oil and this was part of his initiative to do so.

===New &quot;footprint&quot; model===
Under the new final light truck CAFE standard 2008–2011, fuel economy standards would have been restructured so that they are based on a measure of vehicle size called &quot;footprint&quot;, the product of multiplying a vehicle&#x27;s wheelbase by its track width. A target level of fuel economy would have been established for each increment in footprint using a continuous mathematical formula. Smaller footprint light trucks had higher fuel economy targets and larger trucks lower targets. Manufacturers who made more large trucks would have been allowed to meet a lower overall CAFE target, manufacturers who make more small trucks would have needed to meet a higher standard. Unlike previous CAFE standards there was no requirement for a manufacturer or the industry as a whole to meet any particular overall actual MPG target, since that will depend on the mix of sizes of trucks manufactured and ultimately purchased by consumers. Some critics pointed out that this might have had the unintended consequence of pushing manufacturers to make ever-larger vehicles to avoid strict economy standards. However, the equation used to calculate the fuel economy target had a built in mechanism that provides an incentive to reduce vehicle size to about 52 square feet (the approximate midpoint of the current light truck fleet.)

==== Increases and light truck standard reform ====
In 2006, the rule making for light trucks for model years 2008–2011 included a reform to the structure for CAFE standards for light trucks and gave manufacturers the option for model years 2008–2010 to comply with the reformed standard or to comply with the unreformed standard. The reformed standard was based on the vehicle footprint. The unreformed standard for MY 2008 was set to be 22.5mpg, 23.1mpg for MY 2009, and 23.5mpg for MY 2010.

To achieve the target of 35mpg authorized under EISA for the combined fleet of passenger cars and light truck for MY2020, NHTSA is required to continue raising the CAFE standards. In determining a new CAFE standard, NHTSA must assess the environmental impacts of each new standard and the effect of this standard on employment. With the EISA, NHTSA needed to take new analysis including taking a fresh look at the potential impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and assessing whether or not the impacts are significant within the meaning of NEPA.

NHTSA has to issue its new standards eighteen months before the model year for fleet. According to NHTSA report, to achieve this industry wide combined fleet of at least 35mpg, NHTSA must set new standards well in advance of the model year so as to provide the automobile manufacturers with lead time enough to make extensive necessary changes in their automobiles. The EISA also called for a reform where the standards set by the Transportation Department would be are &quot;attribute based&quot; so as to ensure that the safety of vehicles is not compromised for higher standards.

==== CAFE credit trading provisions ====
The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act also instructed NHTSA to establish a credit trading and transferring scheme to allow manufacturers to transfer credits between categories, as well as sell them to other manufacturers or non-manufacturers. In addition, the period over which credits could be carried forward was extended from three years to five. Traded or transferred credits may not be used to meet the minimum standard in the domestic passenger car fleet, however they may be used to meet the &quot;attribute standard&quot;. This latter allowance has drawn criticism from the UAW which fears it will lead manufacturers to increase the importation of small cars to offset shortfalls in the domestic market.

These new flexibilities were implemented by regulation on March 23, 2009, in the Final Rule for 2011 Model Year Passenger Cars and Light Trucks.

Calculations using official CAFE data, and the newly proposed credit trading flexibility contained in the September 28, 2009, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking show that ninety-eight percent of the benefit derived from just the cross fleet credit trading provision flows to Toyota. According to these calculations 75% of the benefit from the two new CAFE credit trading provisions, cross fleet trading and five-year carry-forward, falls to foreign manufacturers. Toyota can use the provision to avoid or reduce compliance on average by 0.69 mpg per year through 2020,
* Hyundai (1.01 mpg),
* Nissan (0.65),
* Honda (0.83 mpg),
* Mitsubishi (0.13 mpg),
* Subaru (0.08),
* Chrysler (0.14 mpg),
* GM (0.09 mpg), and
* Ford (0.18 mpg) also benefit.

The estimated value of the CAFE exemption gained by Toyota is $2.5 billion; Honda&#x27;s benefit is worth $800 million, and Nissan&#x27;s benefit is valued at $900 million in reduced CAFE compliance costs. Foreign companies gained $5.5 billion in benefits compared with the $1.8 billion that went to the Detroit Three.

====Out-year and alternative fuel standard changes====
In the years 2021 to 2030, the standards requires MPG to be the &quot;maximum feasible&quot; fuel economy. The law allows NHTSA to issue additional requirements for cars and trucks based on the footprint model or other mathematical standard. Additionally, each manufacturer must meet a minimum standard of the higher of either 27.5 mpg for passenger automobiles or 92% of the projected average for all manufacturers. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is directed based on National Academy of Sciences studies to set medium and heavy-duty truck MPG standards to the &quot;maximum feasible&quot;. Additionally, the law phases out the mpg credit previously granted to E85 flexible-fuel vehicle manufacturers and adds in one for biodiesel, and it adds a requirement that NHTSA publish replacement tire fuel efficiency ratings. The bill also adds support for initial state and local infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles.

==== Implementing regulations ====
On April 22, 2008, NHTSA responded to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 with proposed new fuel economy standards for cars and trucks effective model year 2011.

The new rules also introduce the &quot;footprint&quot; model for cars as well as trucks, where if a manufacturer makes more large cars and trucks they will be allowed to meet a lower standard for fuel economy. This means that an overall fuel efficiency for a particular manufacturer nor the fleet as a whole cannot be predicted with certainty since it will depend on the actual product mix manufactured. However, if the product mix is as NHTSA predicts, car fuel economy would increase from a current standard of to in 2011. The new regulations are designed to be &quot;optimized&quot; with respect to a certain set of assumptions which include: gas prices in 2016 will be $2.25 a U.S. gallon (59.4¢/L), all new car purchasers will pay 7% interest rates on their vehicles purchases, and only care about fuel costs for the first 5 years of a vehicle&#x27;s life, and that the social cost of carbon is $7 per tonne of CO2. This corresponds to a global warming value of $4.31 savings a year per car under the new regulations. Further, the new regulations assume that no advanced hybrids (Toyota Prius), plug-in hybrids and extended range electric vehicles (Chevrolet Volt), electric cars (Th!nk City), nor alternative fuel vehicles (Honda Civic GX) will be used to achieve these fuel economies. The proposal again explained that U.S. law (49 U.S. Code § 32919) requires that &quot;a State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards&quot;, and explained that laws or regulations applicable to motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions are related to fuel economy standards.

In mid-October 2008, DOT completed and released a final environmental impact statement in anticipation of issuing standards for model years 2011–2015. Based on its consideration of the public comments and other available information, including information on the financial condition of the automotive industry, the agency adjusted its analysis and the standards and prepared a final rule and Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) for MYs 2011–2015. On November 14, 2008, the Office of Management and Budget concluded review of the rule and FRIA. However, issuance of the final rule was held in abeyance. On January 7, 2009, the Department of Transportation announced that the final rule would not be issued, writing: &quot;The Bush Administration will not finalize its rulemaking on Corporate Fuel Economy Standards. The recent financial difficulties of the automobile industry will require the next administration to conduct a thorough review of matters affecting the industry, including how to effectively implement the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has done significant work that will position the next Transportation Secretary to finalize a rule before the April 1, 2009 deadline.&quot;
=== 2009 Obama administration directive ===
On January 27, 2009, President Barack Obama directed the Department of Transportation to review relevant legal, technological, and scientific considerations associated with establishing more stringent fuel economy standards, and to finalize the 2011 model year standard by the end of March. This single-model year standard was issued March 27, 2009, and is about one mpg lower than the fuel economy standards previously recommended under the Bush Administration. &quot;These standards are important steps in the nation&#x27;s quest to achieve energy independence and bring more fuel efficient vehicles to American families&quot;, said Secretary LaHood. The new standards will raise the industry-wide combined average to (a increase over the 2010 model year average), as estimated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It will save about of fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 8.3 million metric tons. This 2011 single-year standard will use an attribute-based system, which sets fuel economy standards for individual vehicle models, based on the footprint model. Secretary LaHood also noted that work on the multi-year fuel economy plan for model years after 2011 is already well underway. The review will include an evaluation of fuel-saving technologies, market conditions and future product plans from the manufacturers. The effort will be coordinated with interested stakeholders and other federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. The new rules were immediately challenged in court again by the Center for Biological Diversity as not addressing the inadequacies found by the previous court rulings.

===Model year 2012–2016 Obama administration proposal===
On May 19, 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a new national fuel economy program which adopts uniform federal standards to regulate both fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions while preserving the legal authorities of DOT, EPA and California. The program covered model year 2012 to model year 2016 and ultimately required an average fuel economy standard of in 2016 (of 39 miles per gallon for cars and 30 mpg for trucks), a jump from the 2009 average for all vehicles of 25 miles per gallon. Obama said, &quot;The status quo is no longer acceptable.&quot; The higher fuel economy was projected to reduce oil consumption by approximately over the life of the program and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 900 million metric tons; the expected consumer costs in terms of higher car prices was unknown. Ten car companies and the UAW embraced the national program because it provided certainty and predictability to 2016 and included flexibilities that would significantly reduce the cost of compliance. Stated goals for the program included: saving consumers money over the long term in increased fuel efficiency, preserving consumer choice (the new rules do not dictate the size of cars, trucks and SUVs that manufacturers can produce; rather it requires that all sizes of vehicles become more energy efficient), reduced air pollution in the form of greenhouse gas emissions and other conventional pollutants, one national policy for all automakers instead of three standards (a DOT standard, an EPA standard and a California standard that would apply to 13 other states), and industry desires: clarity, predictability and certainty concerning the rules while giving them flexibility on how to meet the expected outcomes and the lead time they need to innovate. The policy was expected to result in yearly 5% increases in efficiency from 2012 through 2016, of oil saved cumulatively over the lifetime of the program and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking 177 million of today&#x27;s cars off the road.

By model year 2014, many of the program&#x27;s goals were being met. The average new vehicle fuel economy was 30.7 mpg (35.6 mpg for cars and 25.5 mpg for trucks) and for the years 2012–2015, auto industry outperformed the GHG standard by a substantial margin. Consumers are expected to save an estimated 16.6 billion gallons of fuel over the lifetime of model year 2011 to 2014 vehicles due to the manufacturers exceeding the CAFE standards in those years.

===2011 agreement for model years 2017–2025===
On July 29, 2011, President Obama announced an agreement with thirteen large automakers to increase fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025. He was joined by Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota, and Volvo—which together accounted for over 90% of all vehicles sold in the United States—as well as the United Auto Workers (UAW), and the State of California, who were all participants in the deal. The agreement resulted in new CAFE regulations for model year 2017–2025 vehicles, which were finalized on August 28, 2012. The major increases in stringency and the changes in the structure of CAFE create a need for research that incorporates the demand and supply sides of the new vehicle market in a more detailed manner than was needed with static fuel economy standards.

Volkswagen responded to the July 29, 2011, agreement with the following statement:
&quot;Volkswagen does not endorse the proposal under discussion. It places an unfairly high burden on passenger cars, while allowing special compliance flexibility for heavier light trucks. Passenger cars would be required to achieve 5% annual improvements, and light trucks 3.5% annual improvements. The largest trucks carry almost no burden for the 2017–2020 timeframe, and are granted numerous ways to mathematically meet targets in the outlying years without significant real-world gains. The proposal encourages manufacturers and customers to shift toward larger, less efficient vehicles, defeating the goal of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; Additionally, Volkswagen has since approached U.S. lawmakers about lowering their proposal to double fuel efficiency for passenger cars by 2025. Volkswagen at the time claimed that the new plan was unfair, but the company was later revealed to have been systematically cheating emissions tests. As a result, Volkswagen is one of the only major auto manufacturers to not sign the agreement that has led to the current proposal from the Obama administration. Daimler, producer of Mercedes-Benz brand automobiles, expressed similar views, saying it &quot;clearly favors large SUVs and pickup trucks.&quot;

=== 2016 mid-term review ===
The 2011 agreement set up requirements for a mid-term review to look at how the industry was progressing with the new standards. On July 18, 2016, the EPA, NHTSA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a technical paper assessing whether or not the auto industry would be able to reach the 2022 to 2025 mpg standards. The Draft Technical Assessment Report, as the paper is called, is the first step in the mid-term evaluation process.

The government groups found that the auto industry had been successfully innovating and pushing towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The paper said that the technology was cheaper or about what was expected in terms of cost, and that automakers were adopting new technologies quicker than expected. Still, the paper said that the 54.5 mpg-equivalent projection is unrealistic. That goal was based on a market that was 67 percent cars and 33 percent trucks and SUVs and higher fuel prices, but American customers weren&#x27;t buying that many cars, as the market was still about 50/50 and was likely to stay that way. The paper said more realistic projections are 50 mpg to 52.6 if the 2012 standards are maintained.


====Agreed standards by model year, 2012–2025====
NB: Real-world fuel economy values are about 20 percent lower than laboratory values used for CAFE. Use of E10 decreases fuel economy further by about 3 percent.

Additionally, there were minimum standards since EISA for domestically produced passenger automobiles being the greater of 27.5 mpg or 92 percent of the CAFE projected by the secretary of transportation for the combined domestic and non-domestic passenger automobile fleets manufactured for that model year.

===2020 rollback===
In early August 2018, the EPA and Department of Transportation, then operating under the Presidency of Donald Trump, issued a proposed ruling that, if enacted, would roll back some of the goals set in 2012 under President Obama. It proposed freezing the fuel economy goals to the 2021 target of 37 mpg, would halt requirements on the production of hybrid and electric cars, and would eliminate the legal waiver that allows states like California to set more stringent standards. The EPA acting administrator Andrew R. Wheeler and the transportation secretary Elaine Chao issued a joint statement stating that the rule change was needed as the current rules &quot;impose significant costs on American consumers and eliminate jobs&quot;, while the new rules &quot;give consumers greater access to safer, more affordable vehicles, while continuing to protect the environment&quot;. The proposal included a withdrawal of the waiver that granted California the ability to set its own GHG and ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle) standards and that allowed other States to adopt the standard instead of the federal standard. Following publication of the proposed rule changes, California and eighteen other states announced that should the rule be enacted, they would sue the government to reject the rule.

The new ruling proposed by the EPA and NHTSA was named the &quot;Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicle Rules&quot;. It aimed to set new CAFE standards for MY 2022–2026 passenger car and light trucks and amend the 2021 MY CAFE standards because they are &quot;no longer maximum feasible standards.&quot; The safety reason provided by the government was to shift people to buying new vehicles once the vehicles become more affordable under SAFE standards, with a government study conducted to show new model year vehicles were associated with lower fatality rates. After releasing the proposal on August 2, 2018, NHTSA and EPA held a comment hearing period for 60 days. The deadline was later extended to October 26, 2018, after requests from 32 US senators, 18 state attorneys general, and others for a 120-day or longer comment period were received.

Researchers described in a December 2018 article in &quot;Science&quot; fundamental flaws and inconsistencies in the analysis justifying the proposed rule including miscalculating changes in the size of the automobile fleet and ignoring international benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions, thereby discarding at least $112 billion in benefits, and also by overestimating compliance costs and characterized such changes in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as misleading.

New CAFE targets went into effect in June 2020 beginning with the 2021 model year, increasing at a rate of 1.5 percent per year, far lower than the nearly 5 percent increase they replace. Additionally, the minimum standard for domestic passenger cars was lowered from the 2020 model year level until the 2023 MY.

===Updates under Biden administration===
Upon taking office, the administration of President Biden stated an intention to set new fuel efficiency standards. In August 2021 NHTSA released its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking offering new standards for the 2024–2026 model years.

The final rule covering the 2024–2026 model years was signed on March 31, 2022. Fuel economy targets for cars and light trucks each increase 8 percent for 2024 MY, 8 percent for 2025 MY, and 10 percent for 2026 MY. NHTSA projects that the updated targets lead to an industry-wide average of 49 MPG by the 2026 model year given a fleet mix of 48 percent passenger cars and 52 percent light trucks. Additionally, since by law, the minimum domestic passenger car standard (MDPCS) is &quot;92 percent of the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for the combined domestic and non-domestic passenger automobile fleets,&quot; they are also updated. However, NHTSA is retaining a &quot;1.9 percent offset&quot; to the MDPCS because of past undercompliance with the standard, keeping a roll back of the Trump administration.

On July 28, 2023 NHTSA proposed new fuel economy targets for light-duty vehicles for the 2027—2031 model years, as well as heavy-duty trucks and vans for the 2030—2035 model years. The preferred alternative calls for 2 percent annual increases for cars, 4 percent for light trucks, and 10 percent for heavy-duty trucks and vans, among other regulatory changes.

== Active debate ==
There continues to be an active debate on the safety, costs, and impact of the CAFE program.

=== Effect on traffic safety ===
NHTSA has expressed concerns that automotive manufacturers would increase mileage by reducing vehicle weight, which might lead to weight disparities in the vehicle population and increased danger for occupants of lighter vehicles. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in May 2020, &quot;the smallest late-model cars remain the most dangerous, according to the most recent driver death rates.&quot;

A National Research Council report found that the standards implemented in the 1970s and 1980s &quot;probably resulted in an additional 1,300 to 2,600 traffic fatalities in 1993.&quot; A Harvard Center for Risk Analysis study found that CAFE standards led to &quot;2,200 to 3,900 additional fatalities to motorists per year.&quot; The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s 2007 data show a correlation of about 250–500 fatalities per year per MPG.

In a 2007 analysis, IIHS found that 50 percent of fatalities in small four-door vehicles were single-vehicle crashes, compared to 83 percent in very large SUVs. The Mini Cooper had a driver fatality rate of 68 per million vehicle-years (multi-vehicle, single-vehicle, &amp; rollover) compared to 115 for the Ford Excursion, which has a high proportion of fatalities from vehicle rollover. The Toyota Matrix was even lower at 44, while the rollover-prone Chevrolet S-10 Blazer 2 door was 232. The Nissan 350Z sports car (193) and the mechanically similar Nissan Altima sedan (79) show that driving style can&#x27;t be isolated from engineering in these results. The analysis&#x27; conclusions include findings that death rates generally are higher in lighter vehicles, but cars almost always have lower death rates than SUVs or pickup trucks of comparable weight.

Against this evidence, proponents of higher CAFE standards argue that it is the &quot;footprint&quot; model of CAFE for trucks that encourages production of larger trucks with concomitant increases in vehicle weight disparities. A 2005 IIHS plot shows that in collisions between SUVs weighing and cars, the car driver is more than 4 times more likely to be killed, and if the SUV weighs over the car driver is 9 times more likely to be killed, with 16 percent of deaths occurring in car-to-car crashes and 18 percent in car-to-truck crashes. Recent studies find about 75 percent of two-vehicle fatalities involve a truck, and about half these fatalities involve a side-impact crash. Risk to the driver of the other vehicle is almost 10 times higher when the vehicle is a one-ton pickup compared to an imported car.

Proponents of higher CAFE standards also argue that the quality of the engineering design is the prime determinant of vehicular safety, not the vehicle&#x27;s mass. In 2006, IIHS found that some of the smallest cars have good crash safety, and others do not. A 2003 Transportation Research Board study show greater safety disparities among vehicles of differing price, country of origin, and quality than among vehicles of different size and weight. A 2006 study discounts the importance of vehicle mass to traffic safety, pointing instead to the quality of engineering design as the primary factor.

=== Economic arguments ===
A key argument is that economic forces are responsible for fuel economy gains, and that higher fuel prices already drove customers to seek more fuel-efficient vehicles.

The law of supply and demand predicts an increase in gasoline prices would lead in the long run to an increase in the average fuel economy of the U.S. passenger car fleet, and that a drop in gasoline prices would be associated with a reduction in the average fuel economy of the entire U.S. fleet.

Rather than mandating fuel economy increases, Charles Krauthammer advocated using a significant increase in gasoline taxes that would be revenue-neutral for the government.
CAFE advocates assert that most of the gains in fuel economy over the past 30 years can be attributed to the standard itself.

Economic research in 2015 concludes that firms are shown to be more incentivized toward innovations on fuel economy while the expenses of other safety considerations are undetermined.

According to the Transportation Research Board, the weakening of 2022-2025 CAFE standards would make it much harder for the U.S. to avoid a two-degree-Celsius global warming scenario as per the Paris Agreement, meaning substantial more effort would have to be made between 2025 and 2050 if the SAFE standard is administrated to halt the original CAFE regulations.

A study has found that the adoption of CAFE standards, if supported together by government incentives, would accelerate the Electric Vehicle Market. The U.S. could be less dependent on fossil fuels from the shift to EV market adoption.

===Automaker viewpoints===
In the May 6, 2007, edition of &quot;Autoline Detroit&quot;, GM vice-chairman Bob Lutz, an automobile designer/executive of BMW and Big Three fame, asserted that the CAFE standard was a failure and said it was like trying to fight obesity by requiring tailors to make only small-sized clothes.

In late 2007, Lutz called hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles the &quot;ideal solution&quot;.

Automakers have said that small, fuel-efficient vehicles cost the auto industry billions of dollars. They cost almost as much to design and market but cannot be sold for as much as larger vehicles such as SUVs, because consumers expect small cars to be inexpensive.

Former GM chairman Rick Wagoner admitted in 2008 not knowing which fuel efficiency technologies consumers really want, he said &quot;we are moving fast with technologies like E‑85 (ethanol), all-electric, fuel cells, and a wide range of hybrid offers&quot;.

Ethanol fuel being studied by GM and other manufacturers, has a &quot;gasoline gallon equivalency&quot; (GGE) value of 1.5, i.e. to replace the energy of 1 volume of gasoline, 1.5 times the volume of ethanol is needed.
To overcome this fact, Congress enacted The Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) in 1988 to gain CAFE credits for the manufacture of flexible-fuel vehicles. The formula using an example is: alternative fuel vehicle that achieves 15 mpg fuel economy while operating on alcohol would have a CAFE calculated as follows: Fuel Economy = (1/(0.15 AMFA factor)) x (15mpg) = 100 miles per gallon, providing a very healthy economic incentive for manufacturers of ethanol vehicles.

NHTSA&#x27;s public records show in 2005 that automakers publicly expressed doubts as to the economic practicality and feasibility of increased light truck CAFE standards.

Toyota has invested heavily in developing the complex Hybrid Synergy Drive system, which allows the company to meet CAFE targets.

Volkswagen embraced the rising CAFE standards and tailored its US product line with a fleet of economical, popular, inexpensive diesel vehicles, beginning in 2009. In 2014 Volkswagen registered an impressive CAFE of . The company even received &quot;green car&quot; subsidies and tax exemptions in the US. This result was achieved by installing a defeat device in the electronic control unit of each vehicle, in what is now known as the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal.

Tesla, a firm that makes vehicles like the 142 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus, earned $428 Million in AMFA CAFE Credits paid to it by other manufacturers in Q2 2020, a new record.

=== Consumer preferences ===
The Insurance Companies&#x27; Highway Loss Data Institute publishes data showing that larger vehicles are more expensive to insure, so forcing consumers to purchase smaller vehicles is in their best interest.

Automotive enthusiasts decry the &quot;Malaise era&quot; of auto design, partially brought on by CAFE. Some consumers felt so strongly, that by 1985, 66,900 individuals purchased vehicles in the grey market to avoid the sluggish, unreliable vehicles mandated by the government.
In 2003, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers spokesman Eron Shosteck noted that automakers produce more than 30 models rated at 30 mpg or more for the U.S. market, and they are poor sellers, indicating that consumers do not prioritize fuel economy.

In 2004, GM retiree Charles Amann said that consumers do not pick the weak-performing vehicle when given a choice of engines.

Vehicle safety ratings are now made available to consumers by NHTSA. and by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

A 2006 Consumer Reports survey concluded fuel economy is the most important consideration in consumers&#x27; choice of vehicle and a 2007 Pew Charitable Trusts survey found that nine out of ten Americans favor tougher CAFE standards, including 91% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans. In 2007, the 55 mpg Toyota Prius outsold the top-selling SUV, the 17 mpg Ford Explorer.
In 1999, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported small cars tend to depreciate faster than larger cars, so they are worth less in value to the consumer over time. However, 2007 Edmunds depreciation data show that some small cars, primarily premium models, are among the best in holding their value.

===SUVs and minivans created due to original mandate===

CAFE standards signaled the end of the traditional long station wagon, but Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca developed the idea of marketing the minivan as a station wagon alternative, while certifying it in the separate truck category to allow compliance with less-strict CAFE standards. Eventually, this same idea led to the promotion of the SUV.

The definitions for cars and trucks are not the same for fuel economy and emission standards. For example, a Chrysler PT Cruiser was defined as a car for emissions purposes and a truck for fuel economy purposes. Under then light truck fuel economy rules, the PT Cruiser had have a lower fuel economy target (28.05 mpg beginning in 2011) than it would if it were classified as a passenger car.

=== Increased automobile usage ===
As fuel efficiency rises, people may drive their cars more, which can mitigate some of fuel savings and the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from the higher standards. According to the National Academies Report (Page 19) a 10% improvement in fuel efficiency leads to an average increase in travel distance of 1–2%. This phenomenon is referred to as the &quot;rebound effect&quot;. The report stated (page 20) that the fuel efficiency improvements of light-duty vehicles have reduced the overall U.S. emissions of by 7%.

===Technological considerations===

There are a large number of technologies that manufacturers can apply to improve fuel efficiency short of implementing hybrid or plug-in hybrid technologies. Applied aggressively, at a cost of a few thousand dollars per vehicle, the National Research Council estimated that these technologies can almost double fuel economy versus a 2008 model year baseline vehicle.

Some technologies, such as multi-valve cylinders, are already widely applied in cars, but not trucks. Manufacturers dispute how effective these technologies are, their retail price, and how willing customers are to pay for these improvements. Payback on these improvements is highly dependent on fuel prices.

=== Calculations of MPG overestimated ===
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) laboratory measurements of MPG had consistently overestimated fuel economy of gasoline vehicles and underestimated diesel vehicles. John DeCicco, the automotive expert for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), estimated that this results in about 20% higher actual consumption than measured CAFE goals. Starting with 2008-model vehicles, the EPA has adopted a new protocol for estimating the MPG figures presented to consumers. The new protocol includes driving cycles more closely representative of today&#x27;s traffic and road conditions, as well as increased air conditioner usage. This change does not affect how the EPA calculates CAFE ratings; the new protocol changes only the mileage estimates provided for consumer information.

=== Low penalty ===
Some critics argue that CAFE fines do not seem to be having much impact in the fuel economy drive. As noted in the 2007 United States Government Accountability Office Report to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (page 23) &quot;Several experts stated that this is (&quot;penalties&quot;) not enough of a monetary incentive for manufacturers to comply with CAFE.&quot; For example, in 25 years, from 1983 to 2008, Mercedes-Benz paid penalties 21 times and BMW paid penalties 20 times.

From the 1997 through the 2018 model year, the CAFE penalty was US$55 per vehicle for every 1 MPG under the standard. For the year 2006 Mercedes-Benz drew a $30.3 million penalty for violating fuel economy standards by 2.2 MPG, or $122 per vehicle. According to the &quot;fueleconomy.gov&quot; website operated by the EPA, violating CAFE by 2.42 MPG means consuming an extra () of mostly imported fuel in 10 years which is worth $3,490 (based on 45% highway, 55% city driving for annually, at a fuel price of $2.95 per gallon), which is 13.4% more than the target and also it means emitting an extra 14 Tons of in 10 years, which is 12.7% more. These numbers are based on comparison of 2010 Mercedes ML 350 4MATIC with CAFE Unadjusted Average Fuel Economy of 21.64 MPG (which met 2006 CAFE requirements of 21.6 MPG) and 2010 Mercedes ML 550 4MATIC with CAFE Unadjusted Average Fuel Economy of 19.22 MPG. So spending an extra $3,490 on mostly imported fuel and emitting an extra 14 tons of draws a penalty of only $122 for a single luxury car buyer, which is only 0.3% of the price of a $40,000 car (the average 2010 price of a luxury car). Several experts stated that this is not enough of a monetary incentive to comply with CAFE.

The CAFE penalty had increased only 10% since 1983, the year it was first implemented, while cumulative inflation has exceeded 150%. Thus, the CAFE penalty in 2019 is actually less than 40% of what it was in 1983. NHTSA officials stated that in addition to the authority the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 under the EPCA, the NHTSA has the authority to raise CAFE penalties to $100 per mpg shortfall. However, the NHTSA currently does not exercise this authority. In fact, in 2015 Congress required federal agencies to adjust civil penalties for inflation (Public Law 114–74) and NHTSA under Heidi King unlawfully delayed its implementation.

In 2022 NHTSA reinstated the inflation adjustment that was made in 2016 and began making annual inflation adjustments as required by law. For the 2019 through 2021 model years the rate is $14 per 0.1 MPG and increased to $15 per 0.1 MPG for the 2022 model year. Stellantis was the first manufacturer fined under a new rate.

<text>Irmgard Keun (; 6 February 1905 – 5 May 1982) was a German novelist. Noted for her portrayals of the life of women, she is described as &quot;often reduced to the bold sexuality of her writing, [yet] a significant author of the late Weimar period and &quot;die Neue Sachlichkeit.&quot;&quot; She was born into an affluent family and was given the autonomy to explore her passions. After her attempts at acting ended at the age of 16, Keun began working as a writer after years of working in Hamburg and Greifswald. Her books were banned by Nazi authorities but gained recognition during the final years of her life.

==Biography==
Irmgard Keun was born on 6 February 1905 in Charlottenburg (at the time an independent town, now part of Berlin) to Eduard and Elsa Keun. Her father was an agent for a company that imported petrol, her mother a housewife. Keun later recalled her mother as &quot;stark hausfraulich eingestellt, auf eine sehr schauerliche Weise&quot; (quite domestically inclined, in a very horrible way). She and her family, including her brother Gerd, born in 1910, lived in the city until 1913, when they moved to Cologne. There Keun attended a Lutheran girls&#x27; school, from which she graduated in 1921. She worked as a stenotypist, but also attended acting school in Cologne from 1925 until 1927. Although she had stage roles in Greifswald and Hamburg, these were only somewhat successful, and she decided to abandon her acting career in 1929. Encouraged by Alfred Döblin, she turned to writing.

In 1931 Keun&#x27;s first novel &quot;Gilgi, eine von uns&quot; was published and became a success. In 1932 a second novel &quot;Das kunstseidene Mädchen&quot; (The Artificial Silk Girl) came out. Although there were allegations that she had plagiarised a novel by Robert Neumann (a claim endorsed by her erstwhile promoter Kurt Tucholsky – and disproven only much later), this novel also became a success.

In 1932, Keun married the writer and director . They divorced in 1937. After 1945, she claimed that this had been because he was a Nazi sympathizer; however, there is evidence that she stayed in close touch with him well after 1933, and that the reasons may have been much more personal in nature.

In 1933/34, her books were confiscated and banned by the Nazis. In the spring of 1933 she met and fell in love with the Arnold Strauss, a Jewish doctor who wanted to treat her for her alcoholism. Strauss, as a Jew, lost his position at the Berlin hospital that employed him and went to the USA in 1935; however, they stayed in touch (and many of their letters survive). Keun continued to publish in Germany after 1935, occasionally using pseudonyms, but after she was finally banned from publishing by the authorities - and after she had tried to sue the government for loss of income, and her final appeal to be admitted to the (the official author&#x27;s association of Nazi Germany, a subdivision of the Reich Chamber of Culture) was refused - she went into exile to Belgium and later the Netherlands in 1936. Between sometime in 1936 and 1938 she lived with writer Joseph Roth, while, at the same time pursuing her relationship with Strauss in the US. Invited by Strauss, she even visited him in Norfolk, Virginia in 1938, yet returned to Europe that same year. In 1940 she returned to Cologne from the Netherlands, where she lived through the war years using an alias. How she managed to do this remains unclear. Keun claimed she seduced a Nazi official in the Netherlands and, however that may be, her cover back in Germany may have been helped by the fact that the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (among others) reported her suicide in Amsterdam on 16 August 1940. 

She counted among her friends such literary notables as Egon Erwin Kisch, Hermann Kesten, Stefan Zweig, Ernst Toller, Ernst Weiss, and Heinrich Mann. From 1936 to 1938, she had the already mentioned romantic relationship with Joseph Roth, a relationship that at first had a positive effect on her literary output. She worked together with Roth, traveling with him to various cities such as Paris, Wilna, Lemberg, Warsaw, Vienna, Salzburg, Brussels and Amsterdam. After the German invasion of the Netherlands, she returned in 1940 to Nazi Germany. Protected by false reports of her own suicide, she lived there undercover until 1945.

In the 1960s, her life was overshadowed by alcoholism and homelessness in spite of help from the literary community. In 1966, she was put under tutelage and committed to the psychiatric ward at the Bonn State Hospital, where she remained until 1972. In 1977, she was re-discovered after an article in &quot;Stern&quot; magazine. From 1979 onwards, her financial situation recovered thanks to new editions of her work. She died in Cologne in 1982 of lung cancer.

== Response to her work ==

Keun received great acclaim for her sharp-witted books, most notably from such well-known authors as Alfred Döblin and Kurt Tucholsky, who said about her, &quot;A woman writer with humor, check this out!&quot;. Keun utilizes her characters from her novels to highlight and critique the social problems of the early 1930s. Keun&#x27;s biggest criticisms of consumerism and the complexity of a feminine identity are displayed through the female protagonists&#x27; relationships with men. Breaking the archetypal mold, Keun&#x27;s characters offer depth to the feminine identity and challenge the idea that a woman must be placed into a category. For example, &quot;Keun&#x27;s representative novels of the New Woman&#x27;s experience during the Weimar Republic, &quot;Gilgi—eine von uns&quot; (1931) and &quot;Das kunstseidene Mädchen&quot; (1932), feature two such young stylized New Women, Gilgi and Doris, who try to shape their lives in the aforementioned image by taking their cues from the popular media&quot;. In the case of &quot;Das kunstseidene Mädchen&quot; (The Artificial Silk Girl), Keun tells the story from Doris&#x27; perspective, which she does to give the reader &quot;insights into the social injustice of Weimar Berlin&#x27;s class and gender hierarchy&quot;. Keun&#x27;s novel reflects critically on these discourses by casting its heroine&#x27;s sentimental journey in terms of an education in vision.

In an interview, Keun&#x27;s daughter, Martina Keun-Geburtig, answered the question if her mother was a happy woman, &quot;Well, she always said that the Nazis took her best years. Starting in 1933 her success was abruptly ended through the book-burning up until &#x27;45, &#x27;46. It&#x27;s a pretty long time…&quot;.

<text>Wolfgang Harich (9 December 1923 – 15 March 1995) was a philosopher and journalist in East Germany.

A deserter from the German army in World War II and a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Harich became a professor of philosophy at Humboldt University in 1949. He was arrested in 1956 and sentenced to ten years in prison for the &quot;establishment of a conspiratorial counterrevolutionary group.&quot; He was released in 1964, after eight years, and rehabilitated in 1990. In 1994 he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism.

His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

== Life ==
Wolfgang Harich was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, on 9 December 1923, into an upper-class literary educated family. His father was a writer Walter Harich and his mother was Anne-Lise Wyneken, the daughter of Alexander Wyneken, editor in chief of the &quot;Königsberger Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.

Harich became known as one of the stronger voices in post war debates at a very young age in Germany. He firmly believed in uniting war torn Germany. He studied philosophy at the Humboldt University of Berlin and, upon graduation, became professor of philosophy and taught at the same university. His strong voice eventually led him to be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for conspiracy. Although he only served eight years, Harich was kept in solitary confinement for more than seven of those eight years, which took a large toll on his mental health, giving him severe depression and dizziness. He emigrated to Austria in 1979, moved to West Germany in 1980, and returned to the &quot;Besseres Deutschland&quot; or &quot;Better Germany&quot; in 1981. Although he had a heart attack in July 1960, he fought through it and recovered, surviving until 15 March 1995, when he died at the age of 71.

== Education ==
Harich studied philosophy at Humboldt University in East Berlin with Nicolai Hartmann and Eduard Spranger, graduating in 1951. He began giving lectures in 1949 on Marxist Philosophy, and in 1952 he became the University&#x27;s Professor of Philosophy. Before his final studies at Humboldt, he had entered the &quot;Kammer Der Kunst Schaffenden&quot;, Department of Creative Artists, in June 1945 as Paul Wegener&#x27;s personal assistant. This experience gave him the ability to become considered as one of Berlin&#x27;s best theater critics.

== Political views ==
Harich was a convinced communist and an environmentalist. He joined &quot;Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands&quot; (KPD), the Communist Party of Germany, then later joined &quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot; (SED), the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which later became the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in 1946.

As a twenty-year-old, Harich was drafted into the Wehrmacht, but left and joined an anti-Nazi group in 1944. He was a Stalinist until the early 1950s; he wrote in a memoir of recalling &quot;crying an ocean of tears over Stalin&#x27;s death.&quot; Yet, after the removal of the Stalinists, he moved on to wanting a neutralized and united, democratic socialist Germany. His beliefs and principles were driven by self-transformation, and he was mostly interested in Marxist philosophy. Harich was looking for a &quot;third way&quot; between Stalinism and capitalism, he wanted a &quot;humanistic socialism&quot; in a reunified Germany. He established and engaged his friends, opponents, and social democrats in controversy in West Germany to argue that the GDR should make reforms to further the reunion of Germany. His sweeping reform proposals represented the only Party attempt at the internal restructuring of the GDR before it collapsed. He pushed for free elections, the admission of legal opposition groups, and the dissolution of the Stasi, the secret police of General Erich Mielke, leading others to often look at his ideas as Utopian, but was granted the title of &quot;most brilliant head in the SED.&quot; Agreeing with Bloch and Lukács, Harich criticized Stalinism and believed in renewing Marxism from a humanist and naturalist point of view.

Harich produced a manifesto and presented his ideas in October–November 1956 to Georgy Pushkin, the Soviet ambassador and to Walter Ulbricht, the first secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, himself. This presentation and his notorious loose tongue led him to being convicted of &quot;counterrevolutionary plotting,&quot; indicted with &quot;formation of an enemy group&quot; on behalf of the West German SPD, and branded a revisionist. He was arrested on 29 November 1956, indicted in March 1957 and sentenced to imprisonment in July 1957. He remained in jail until released in December 1964. Harich referred to his years in jail as his &quot;Rufmord&quot;, or reputation-murder, and felt guiltless because all he did was &quot;just talk.&quot; He actually thanked the Stasi for their vigilance in arresting him, for without their attention, he would not have been given ten years in jail, and instead he would be looking at the noose. This quote of Harich&#x27;s was recorded at his hearing,

He had later testified against a former friend Walter Janka, head of the Aufbau Publishing Company, creating a new &quot;text book&quot; characterized enemy. &quot;Janka vs. Harich: the worldly older man vs. the young genius, the practical man vs. the classically educated intellectual, the tough working-class war hero vs. the bourgeois academic utopian.&quot; Janka refused to ever meet Harich again after the trial, insisting that Harich&#x27;s false testimony landed him three years in Bautzen, the most horrific jail for political criminals.

After being released from jail, Harich was allowed to resume his previous literary work and became an editor of &quot;Akademie Verlag&quot; in Berlin in 1965, even though it took 33 years for the court to pronounce him &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in April 1990. Having spent most of his time in jail in solitary confinement, Harich emerged in 1964 as a hard-line Stalinist and enthusiastic critic of all modernist experimentation, even labeling Friedrich Nietzsche as a &quot;Nazi worshipper.&quot; and insisting that his legacy was nothing but &quot;a giant trash bin.&quot; Harich focused on more environmental political problems in the 1970s. In 1975 he undertook an impractical campaign for a state communism in the service of environmental protection, in hopes of making some change. Also, after the &quot;Wende&quot; (change) in Germany in 1989, he became the chairman of the &quot;Alternative Enquete Komission&quot; (AEK) which conducted research on the history of the GDR, and aligned himself with the self-proclaimed Mikhail Gorbachev reform communists after 1990.

== Literary work ==
Harich became accomplished and created a name for himself at a very young age. He followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a Jean Paul scholar, writing two books dealing with Paul&#x27;s epistemology and poetic vision, which are arguably his finest scholarship. In 1946, he worked for the newspaper of the soviet occupation regime, &quot;Tägliche Rundschau&quot;; and he was also a journalist for the French-licensed daily. He became editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie&quot; along with Arthur Baumgarten, Ernst Bloch, and Karl Schroter in 1953. In the same year, Harich also received the prestigious &quot;Heinrich Mann Prize&quot; for editing and journalism, conferred by the &quot;GDR Academy of Fine Arts&quot;. Upon his arrest, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; devoted its cover story to Harich in 1956, stating that West German intellectuals regarded him highly and saying, &quot;despite his youth, probably the only GDR intellectual capable of calling into question the current foundation of the communist state, the doctrine of hard-frozen Stalinism.&quot; They even called him &quot;an intellectual phenomenon&quot; and &quot;a pure intellect on two feet.&quot; In the 1970s, Harich published &quot;Communism without Growth: Babeuf and the Club of Rome with Rowohlt Verlag&quot;, which argued that a neo-Stalinist state with dictatorial authority to enforce environmental standards could avert an ecological catastrophe.

<text>Josef Casimir Hofmann (originally Józef Kazimierz Hofmann; January 20, 1876February 16, 1957) was a Polish-American pianist, composer, music teacher, and inventor.

==Biography==
Josef Hofmann was born in Podgórze (a district of Kraków), in Austro-Hungarian Galicia (present-day Poland) in 1876. His father was the composer, conductor and pianist Kazimierz Hofmann, and his mother the singer Matylda Pindelska. He had an older sister – Zofia Wanda (born June 11, 1874, also in Kraków). Throughout their childhood, their father, Kazimierz, was married to Aniela Teofila &quot;née&quot; Kwiecińska (born January 3, 1843, in Warsaw), who, after moving to Warsaw in 1878 with her husband, died there on October 12, 1885. Then the next year Kazimierz Mikołaj Hofmann married on June 17, 1886, Matylda Franciszka Pindelska - the mother of his children, (daughter of Wincenty and Eleonora &quot;née&quot; Wyszkowska, b. in 1851 in Kraków) in the Holy Cross Basilica in Warszawa.

In order to ensure their son Josef a thorough musical education, the whole family moved to Berlin from 1886. Josef Hofmann, a child prodigy, gave a debut recital in Warsaw at the age of 5, and a long series of concerts throughout Europe and Scandinavia, culminating in a series of concerts in America in 1887-88 that elicited comparisons with the young Mozart and the young Mendelssohn. The young Hofmann took music lessons from Heinrich Urban (composition) and with the pianist and composer Moritz Moszkowski. Subsequently, Anton Rubinstein took Hofmann as his only private student in 1892 and arranged the debut of his pupil in Hamburg, Germany, in 1894. Hofmann toured and performed extensively over the next 50 years as one of the most celebrated pianists of the era. In 1913, he was presented with a set of keys to the city of St. Petersburg, Russia.

As a composer, Hofmann published over one hundred works, many of those under the pseudonym &quot;Michel Dvorsky&quot;, including two piano concertos and ballet music. He made the United States his base during World War I and became a US citizen in 1926. In 1924, he became the first head of the piano department at the inception of the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia; he became the institute&#x27;s director in 1927 and remained so until 1938.

He was instrumental in recruiting illustrious musicians such as Efrem Zimbalist, Fritz Reiner, Marcella Sembrich, Isabella Vengerova, Moriz Rosenthal, Wilhelm Backhaus, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Abram Chasins, David Saperton, Wanda Landowska, and Leopold Auer to the Curtis faculty. Hofmann&#x27;s pupils included Jacques Abram, Jeanne Behrend, Abram Chasins, Shura Cherkassky, William Harms, Harry Kaufman, Angelica Morales von Sauer, Ezra Rachlin, Nadia Reisenberg (see ), Abbey Simon, Lucie Stern, and Ruth Slenczynska. While not a pupil, Jorge Bolet benefited from Hofmann&#x27;s interest. In 1937, the 50th anniversary of his New York debut performance was celebrated with gala performances including a &quot;Golden Jubilee&quot; recital at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City. In 1938 he was forced to leave the Curtis Institute of Music over financial and administrative disputes. In the years from 1939 to 1946, his artistic eminence deteriorated, in part due to family difficulties and alcoholism. In 1946, he gave his last recital at Carnegie Hall, home to his 151 appearances, and retired to private life in 1948.

He spent his last decade in Los Angeles in relative obscurity, working on inventions and keeping a steady correspondence with associates.

As an inventor, Hofmann had over 70 patents, and his invention of pneumatic shock absorbers for cars and airplanes was commercially successful from 1905 to 1928. Other inventions included a windscreen wiper, a furnace that burned crude oil, a house that revolved with the sun, a device to record dynamics (U.S. patent number 1614984) in reproducing piano rolls that he perfected just as the roll companies went out of business, and piano action improvements adopted by the Steinway Company (U.S. patent number 2263088).

Hofmann moved to Los Angeles in 1939. He died there of pneumonia on February 16, 1957, at a nursing home. He had four children; a daughter and three sons. In 1928, it became public that Hofmann had divorced his first wife—Marie Eustis, with whom he had a daughter—in 1924 and had married his second wife—Betty Short, who had initially been one of his students—shortly thereafter. His eldest son, Josef Anton Hofmann, became a noted audio engineer.

==Legacy==
The Josef Hofmann Piano Competition, co-sponsored by the American Council for Polish Culture and the University of South Carolina Aiken, was established in his honor in 1994.

==Career as a child prodigy==

Anton Rubinstein heard the seven-year-old Hofmann play Beethoven&#x27;s C minor Piano Concerto in Warsaw and declared him to be an unprecedented talent. At Rubinstein&#x27;s suggestion, German impresario Hermann Wolff offered career management and offered to send the boy on a European tour, but Hofmann&#x27;s father refused to let the boy travel until he was nine years old. At that age, Hofmann gave concerts in Germany, France, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Great Britain.

At the age of 12, young Josef Hofmann was probably the first pianist of note to record on Edison&#x27;s phonograph; Hans von Bülow recorded a Chopin Mazurka on Edison&#x27;s improved phonograph the same year, i.e., 1888.
In 1887, an American tour was arranged, with three months of performances that included fifty recitals, seventeen of which were at the Metropolitan Opera House. Yet soon after, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children stepped in, citing the boy&#x27;s fragile health. However, as per the contract that had paid Hofmann $10,000, he was legally obliged to complete the tour. The contract was rendered void by Alfred Corning Clark who donated $50,000 and, in turn, legally forbade Hofmann to perform in public until he turned 18 years old. The final segment of the tour was cancelled and the family returned to Potsdam, outside Berlin. This marked the end of Hofmann&#x27;s child prodigy years. (See and for details.)

==Education in music==
Clark&#x27;s donation enabled Hofmann to continue individual study in science and mathematics, and he continued to take music lessons from Heinrich Urban (composition) and with the pianist and composer Moritz Moszkowski. In 1892, Rubinstein accepted Hofmann as his only private pupil, the two meeting for 42 sessions in Dresden&#x27;s Hotel d&#x27;Europe. Initial lessons, a week apart, included ten Bach Preludes and Fugues and two Beethoven sonatas, from memory. Hofmann was never allowed to bring the same composition twice, as Rubinstein said as a teacher he would probably forget what he told the student during the previous lesson. Rubinstein never played for Hofmann, but gave ample evidence of his pianistic outlook during many recitals the boy heard. In a three-day period Hofmann heard in Berlin&#x27;s new Bechstein Hall recitals by Hans von Bülow, Johannes Brahms and Rubinstein, and commented on their radically different playing. Rubinstein arranged Hofmann&#x27;s adult debut on March 14, 1894, in Hamburg&#x27;s Symphonic Assembly Hall, the piece being Rubinstein&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 in D minor, with the composer conducting. After the concert, Rubinstein told Hofmann there would be no more lessons, and they never saw each other again. Rubinstein returned to Russia and died later that year. In later years Hofmann referred to his relationship with the titanic Russian master as the &quot;most important event in my life.&quot;.
==Hofmann at the end of his career==
By the early 1930s, Hofmann had become an alcoholic but he retained exceptional pianistic command throughout this decade; Rudolf Serkin and a young Glenn Gould have recounted magical impressions created on them by Hofmann&#x27;s concerts in the middle and late 1930s. After his departure from the Curtis Institute in 1938, a combination of his drinking, marital problems and a loss of interest in performing caused a rapid deterioration in his artistic abilities. Commenting on Hofmann&#x27;s sharp decline, Sergei Rachmaninoff said, &quot;Hofmann is still sky high ... the greatest pianist alive &quot;if&quot; he is sober and in form. Otherwise, it is impossible to recognize the Hofmann of old&quot;. Oscar Levant wrote, &quot;one of the terrible tragedies of music was the disintegration of Josef Hofmann as an artist. In his latter days, he became an alcoholic. …[H]is last public concert … was an ordeal for all of us&quot;.

==Technique and style==
Hofmann&#x27;s views on technique and musicianship are explained in his book &quot;Piano Playing with Questions Answered&quot;.
He had small but exceptionally strong hands. Steinway eventually built for him custom keyboards with slightly narrower keys (pianist/critic Stephen Hough has commented on how Hofmann&#x27;s mechanical understanding of the Steinway piano action set him apart from all other pianists.)
His concert instruments had subtle action changes for faster repetition, two pedals rather than three (he liked the older Steinway trap work geometry), faultless regulation, and were accompanied on tours by his own recital chair, built with a short folding back and a 1½&quot; slope from rear to front. After playing Hofmann&#x27;s special concert instrument in the Steinway New York basement, Gunnar Johansen reported that the piano had the biggest sonority of any he had ever tried.

Unlike Rubinstein, Hofmann sat quietly at the piano, striking the keys in a kneading manner. His finger staccato was at the time unequaled, as was his orchestral sonority. According to his student Nadia Reisenberg, he continuously used a combination of finger pedalling and foot pedalling. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg said Hofmann had all of Leopold Godowsky&#x27;s technique, a claim approved by Godowsky himself. By his own admission, Sergei Rachmaninoff, in his 40s, prepared for a career as a concert pianist by practicing over 15 hours a day with the goal of attaining the level of Hofmann&#x27;s technique. When pianist Ralph Berkowitz was asked if Vladimir Horowitz had the greatest technique of all the pianists he had heard, Berkowitz replied that Horowitz indeed was the supreme master of the technical parts of performance, but one older era pianist was his equal - Hofmann.
Hofmann&#x27;s approach and style can be summarized by his motto &quot;an aristocrat never hurries&quot;. 
 He often stated that Rubinstein and Moriz Rosenthal were the only pianists who had influenced his art, and admired singers Mattia Battistini and Marcella Sembrich. He adopted a more demonstrative style in live performances but a subtle and restrained style for his studio recordings; in both cases, he mostly adhered to the printed score, occasionally doubling left-hand octaves, and shunned sentimentality. He put spontaneity rather than structure foremost and admitted to Rachmaninoff that &quot;I do not know how to build a composition ... occasionally, it happens to sound well&quot;. Schonberg wrote that among Hofmann&#x27;s contemporaries, only Godowsky had the finish and refinement of Hofmann but lacked Hofmann&#x27;s color, fire, and &quot;red blood&quot;, while only Ferruccio Busoni and Rachmaninoff were ever mentioned by contemporaries as Hofmann&#x27;s equals. After hearing a performance of Chopin&#x27;s B minor Sonata by Hofmann, Rachmaninoff cut that piece from his own repertoire saying &quot;not since Anton Rubinstein have I heard such titanic playing&quot;.

Suggested examples illustrating Hofmann&#x27;s style:
* Rubinstein&#x27;s Contradanses
* Chopin&#x27;s Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Op.22
* Chopin&#x27;s Ballade Op.23
* 2nd Movement from Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata Op.31 No.3
* Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Prelude Op.23 No.5
* Liszt&#x27;s Hungarian Rhapsody No.2
* Stojowski&#x27;s Caprice Orientale (dedicated to him by Sigismond Stojowski).

==Repertoire, musical ear and memory==
Hofmann&#x27;s repertoire was mostly confined to music written before the start of the 20th century.
Much like Rubinstein&#x27;s seven historic recitals of 1885, he gave 21 consecutive concerts in St. Petersburg without repeating a single piece, playing 255 different works from memory during that marathon cycle in 1912–1913. In the diary his wife kept during his 1909 Russian tour, she mentions his raising his eyebrows when he saw Brahms&#x27; &quot;Handel Variations&quot; on a program—a piece he had not played or even looked at for two and a half years. He played the work at the concert without hesitation.
Although a poor sight reader, he was said to possess the ability of Franz Liszt and Camille Saint-Saëns
to hear a composition once and play it back correctly without seeing the printed notes. Rosina Lhévinne recalled that Hofmann heard her husband Josef Lhévinne play Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Lorelei&quot;, a piece Hofmann had never heard but went on to play it &quot;just like my Josef (Lhevinne)&quot; for an encore at his concert later that day.
Maurice Aronson, who served as Leopold Godowsky&#x27;s assistant, recalled Hofmann learning Godowsky&#x27;s &quot;Fledermaus&quot; transcription. Godowsky and Hofmann met in Berlin in 1900, becoming friends until Godowsky&#x27;s death in 1938. Hofmann would visit Godowsky&#x27;s studio and listen while Godowsky was composing &quot;Fledermaus&quot;. A week later Hofmann visited Godowsky again and played the entire transcription, and he had never seen the music. Godowsky, in fact, had not yet written it down. Schonberg has added that Godowsky&#x27;s &quot;Fledermaus&quot; is one of the most resourceful and complicated stunts ever written for the piano.

==Recordings==
Hofmann started recording in studios in the 1880s but was never satisfied with the available technology and made only test pressings after 1923; he considered the test pressings made for HMV in November 1935 to be a worthwhile representation of his art.

In the 1940s he recorded for the Bell Telephone Hour radio programs of which some rare footage remains, including Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2, and Beethoven&#x27;s Concerto in E-flat major, &quot;Emperor&quot;. Gregor Benko has remarked that Hofmann should not have appeared on many of the Bell Telephone Hour broadcasts since, by this time,
his pianistic control had deteriorated considerably though the tonal palette was still immense and the phrasing provocative (see and ). Hofmann&#x27;s student Jeanne Behrend, after first hearing the recordings from 1940 to 1946, stated &quot;well, it&#x27;s his playing, but nothing like what we heard in the 1920s.&quot;

Cylinders recorded c. 1890 for Thomas Edison were some of the earliest recordings of classical music and were lost during World War I. Four cylinders made in Russia in 1895–1896, with music by Mendelssohn, Louis Brassin and Rubinstein, have been recently discovered and issued on CD. He made two series of reproducing piano rolls, including in 1913 23 pieces for Welte-Mignon but did not trust rolls as an accurate representation of his playing. Hofmann recorded acoustic discs from 1912 to 1923 for Columbia and Brunswick, but felt the representation of his chaste and prismatic tonal palette was not captured. Hofmann experimented with short studio test recordings for RCA Victor in 1935 (which were released on LP by RCA in 1970), and in retirement in California experimented with piano string electrical pickups and designing an additional spruce soundboard under the piano lid. RCA Victor privately recorded the 50th anniversary concert of Hofmann&#x27;s New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera House on November 28, 1937. At least two of his other concerts in 1930&#x27;s were recorded live. These concert recordings exhibit an older Hofmann (age 60–62) in public just prior to the sharp decline in his pianistic command, and include sensational readings of Chopin&#x27;s G minor Ballade, Andante Spianato and Grand Polonaise, A-flat Waltz (Op. 42) and F minor Ballade. All of these recordings have been published on compact discs under the auspices of Gregor Benko and audio restoration specialist Ward Marston.

==Stature==

Harold C. Schonberg has argued that Hofmann was the most flawless and possibly the greatest pianist of the 20th century. HMV and RCA unsuccessfully pursued recording projects with Hofmann in the 1930s. Sergei Rachmaninoff dedicated his Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor (1909) to Hofmann, although Hofmann disliked it and never played it. Older generation critics such as James Huneker labeled Hofmann the &quot;king of pianists&quot;, and Samuel Chotzinoff called him the &quot;greatest pianist of our time.&quot;
Contemporaries such as Rachmaninoff, Ignaz Friedman, Josef Lhévinne, and Godowsky considered Hofmann to be, overall, the greatest pianist of their generation, but the acclaim was not so universal from the next generation of pianists.
In his autobiography Arthur Rubinstein criticized Hofmann as someone who took interest in only the mechanics of music and not in its heart or spirituality, and commented that at the end of Hofmann&#x27;s career &quot;he was left with nothing after his technique left him&quot;. Claudio Arrau dismissed Hofmann (along with Paderewski) as someone who only happened to be very famous and said &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what to do with him&quot;. Sviatoslav Richter, after listening to a Hofmann RCA test pressing of the Scherzo from Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata in E-flat, Op. 31, No. 3, considered the older pianist to be technically &quot;stunning&quot;, but noted that Hofmann ignored the composer&#x27;s &quot;sforzando&quot; markings; while György Sándor has called him the greatest of all 20th-century pianists in terms of music, interpretation, and technique. Hofmann&#x27;s own student Shura Cherkassky compared Horowitz favorably with Hofmann as follows: &quot;Hofmann was possibly the greater musical mind. But, I think, Horowitz was the greater pianist, the greater virtuoso—he somehow appealed to the whole world. Hofmann could not communicate on that level&quot;.

To balance the record, Earl Wild acknowledged Hofmann&#x27;s style as the biggest influence on him gaining a fluid and flexible technique: ‘His interpretations were always delivered with great logic and beauty.’ Jorge Bolet is reported to have said that whenever he heard either Rachmaninoff or Hofmann, he always thought to himself, ‘Every note that they play – that is what I would like to play.’

<text>The English term enlightenment is the Western translation of various Buddhist terms, most notably bodhi and vimutti. The abstract noun &quot;bodhi&quot; (; Sanskrit: ; Pali: &quot;bodhi&quot;) means the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha. The verbal root &quot;budh-&quot; means &quot;to awaken&quot;, and its literal meaning is closer to awakening. Although the term &quot;buddhi&quot; is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions, its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism. &quot;Vimutti&quot; is the freedom from or release of the fetters and hindrances.

The term &quot;enlightenment&quot; was popularised in the Western world through the 19th-century translations of British philologist Max Müller. It has the Western connotation of general insight into transcendental truth or reality. The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote (initial) insight (&quot;prajna&quot; (Sanskrit), &quot;wu&quot; (Chinese), &quot;kensho&quot; and &quot;satori&quot; (Japanese)); knowledge (&quot;vidya&quot;); the &quot;blowing out&quot; (&quot;nirvana&quot;) of disturbing emotions and desires; and the attainment of supreme Buddhahood (&quot;samyak sam bodhi&quot;), as exemplified by Gautama Buddha.

What exactly constituted the Buddha&#x27;s awakening is unknown. It may have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and &quot;dhyāna&quot;, applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between &quot;dhyana&quot; and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bodhi&quot;, Sanskrit , &quot;awakening&quot;, &quot;perfect knowledge&quot;, &quot;perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a man becomes a बुद्ध [Buddha] or जिन [&quot;jina&quot;, &quot;arahant&quot;; &quot;victorious&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;], the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a Buddha or जिन)&quot;.

The word Bodhi is an abstract noun, formed from the verbal root &quot;*budh-&quot;, Sanskrit , &quot;to awaken, to know&quot;, &quot;to wake, wake up, be awake&quot;, &quot;to recover consciousness (after a swoon)&quot;, &quot;to observe, heed, attend to&quot;.

It corresponds to the verbs &quot;bujjhati&quot; (Pāli) and &quot;bodhati&quot;, बोदति, &quot;become or be aware of, perceive, learn, know, understand, awake&quot; or &quot;budhyate&quot; (Sanskrit).

The feminine Sanskrit noun of &quot;*budh-&quot; is , &quot;buddhi&quot;, &quot;prescience, intuition, perception, point of view&quot;.

==Translation==
Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term &quot;enlightenment&quot; to translate the term &quot;bodhi&quot;. The root &quot;budh&quot;, from which both &quot;bodhi&quot; and &quot;Buddha&quot; are derived, means &quot;to wake up&quot; or &quot;to recover consciousness&quot;. Cohen notes that &quot;bodhi&quot; is not the result of an illumination, but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding. The term &quot;enlightenment&quot; is event-oriented, whereas the term &quot;awakening&quot; is process-oriented. The western use of the term &quot;enlighten&quot; has Christian roots, as in Calvin&#x27;s &quot;It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths&quot;.

Early 19th-century &quot;bodhi&quot; was translated as &quot;intelligence&quot;. The term &quot;enlighten&quot; was first being used in 1835, in an English translation of a French article, while the first recorded use of the term &#x27;enlightenment&#x27; is credited (by the Oxford English Dictionary) to the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; (February 1836). In 1857 &quot;The Times&quot; used the term &quot;the Enlightened&quot; for the Buddha in a short article, which was reprinted the following year by Max Müller. Thereafter, the use of the term subsided, but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller&#x27;s &quot;Chips from a german Workshop&quot;, which included a reprint from the &quot;Times&quot; article. The book was translated in 1969 into German, using the term &quot;&quot;. Max Müller was an essentialist, who believed in a natural religion, and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; was a means to capture natural religious truths, as distinguished from mere mythology. This perspective was influenced by Kantian thought, particularly Kant&#x27;s definition of the Enlightenment as the free, unimpeded use of reason. Müller&#x27;s translation echoed this idea, portraying Buddhism as a rational and enlightened religion that aligns with the natural religious truths inherent to human beings.

By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha &quot;enlightened&quot;, and by the end of the 1880s the terms &quot;enlightened&quot; and &quot;enlightenment&quot; dominated the English literature.

=== Insight ===
==== Bodhi ====
While the Buddhist tradition regards &quot;bodhi&quot; as referring to full and complete liberation (&quot;samyaksambudh&quot;), it also has the more modest meaning of knowing that the path that is being followed leads to the desired goal. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, Tillman Vetter, and K.R. Norman, &quot;bodhi&quot; was at first not specified. K.R. Norman:
According to Norman, &quot;bodhi&quot; may basically have meant the knowledge that &quot;nibbana&quot; was attained, due to the practice of &quot;dhyana&quot;. Originally only &quot;prajna&quot; may have been mentioned, and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating, with the stilling of pleasure or pain in the fourth jhana, not the gaining of some perfect wisdom or insight. Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development.

In Theravada Buddhism, &quot;bodhi&quot; refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. In Theravada Buddhism, &quot;bodhi&quot; is equal to supreme insight, and the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. According to Nyanatiloka,
This equation of &quot;bodhi&quot; with the four noble truths is a later development, in response to developments within Indian religious thought, where &quot;liberating insight&quot; was deemed essential for Liberation. The four noble truths as the liberating insight of the Buddha eventually were superseded by Pratītyasamutpāda, the twelvefold chain of causation, and still later by anatta, the emptiness of the self.

In Mahayana Buddhism, &quot;bodhi&quot; is equal to &quot;prajna&quot;, insight into the Buddha-nature, sunyata and tathatā. This is equal to the realisation of the non-duality of absolute and relative.

==== Prajna ====
In Theravada Buddhism &quot;pannā&quot; (Pali) means &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;. &quot;Insight&quot; is equivalent to &quot;vipassana&quot;, insight into the three marks of existence, namely &quot;anicca&quot;, &quot;dukkha&quot; and &quot;anatta&quot;. Insight leads to the four stages of enlightenment and Nirvana.

In Mahayana Buddhism Prajna (Sanskrit) means &quot;insight&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;, and entails insight into &quot;sunyata&quot;. The attainment of this insight is often seen as the attainment of &quot;enlightenment&quot;.

====Wu, kensho and satori====
&quot;Wu&quot; is the Chinese term for initial insight. &quot;Kensho&quot; and &quot;satori&quot; are Japanese terms used in Zen traditions. &quot;Kensho&quot; means &quot;seeing into one&#x27;s true nature&quot;. &quot;Ken&quot; means &quot;seeing&quot;, &quot;sho&quot; means &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;essence&quot;, c.q Buddha-nature. &quot;Satori&quot; (Japanese) is often used interchangeably with kensho, but refers to the &quot;experience&quot; of kensho. The Rinzai tradition sees &quot;kensho&quot; as essential to the attainment of Buddhahood, but considers further practice essential to attain Buddhahood.

East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism emphasizes insight into Buddha-nature. This term is derived from Indian tathagata-garbha thought, &quot;the womb of the thus-gone&quot; (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the &quot;ālaya vijñāna&quot;, and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening &quot;and&quot; the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not distinct entities, but mutually co-dependent.

=== Knowledge ===
The term &quot;vidhya&quot; is being used in contrast to &quot;avidhya&quot;, ignorance or the lack of knowledge, which binds us to samsara. The &quot;Mahasaccaka Sutta&quot; describes the three knowledges which the Buddha attained:
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of karma and reincarnation
# Insight into the Four Noble Truths

According to Bronkhorst, the first two knowledges are later additions, while insight into the four truths represents a later development, in response to concurring religious traditions, in which &quot;liberating insight&quot; came to be stressed over the practice of &quot;dhyana&quot;.

=== Freedom ===
Vimukthi, also called &quot;moksha&quot;, means &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;release&quot;, &quot;deliverance&quot;. Sometimes a distinction is being made between &quot;ceto-vimukthi&quot;, &quot;liberation of the mind&quot;, and &quot;panna-vimukthi&quot;, &quot;liberation by understanding&quot;. The Buddhist tradition recognises two kinds of &quot;ceto-vimukthi&quot;, one temporarily and one permanent, the last being equivalent to &quot;panna-vimukthi&quot;.

Yogacara uses the term &quot;āśraya parāvŗtti&quot;, &quot;revolution of the basis&quot;,
=== Nirvana ===
Nirvana is the &quot;blowing out&quot; of disturbing emotions, which is the same as liberation. The usage of the term &quot;enlightenment&quot; to translate &quot;nirvana&quot; was popularized in the 19th century, in part, due to the efforts of Max Müller, who used the term consistently in his translations.

== Buddha&#x27;s awakening ==
=== Buddhahood ===
There are three recognized types of Buddha:
* Arhat (Pali: &quot;arahant&quot;), those who reach Nirvana by following the teachings of the Buddha. Sometimes the term Śrāvakabuddha (Pali: &quot;sāvakabuddha&quot;) is used to designate this kind of awakened person;
* Pratyekabuddhas (Pali: &quot;paccekabuddha&quot;), those who reach Nirvana through self-realisation, without the aid of spiritual guides and teachers, but do not teach the Dharma;
* Samyaksambuddha (Pali: &quot;samma sambuddha&quot;), often simply referred to as &quot;Buddha&quot;, one who has reached Nirvana by his own efforts and wisdom and teaches it skillfully to others.

Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, is said to have achieved full awakening, known as &quot;samyaksaṃbodhi&quot; (Sanskrit; Pāli: &quot;sammāsaṃbodhi&quot;), &quot;perfect Buddhahood&quot;, or &quot;anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi&quot;, &quot;highest perfect awakening&quot;. Specifically, &quot;anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi&quot;, literally meaning unsurpassed, complete and perfect enlightenment, is often used to distinguish the enlightenment of a Buddha from that of an Arhat.

The term &quot;Buddha&quot; and the way to Buddhahood is understood somewhat differently in the various Buddhist traditions. An equivalent term for Buddha is Tathāgata, &quot;the thus-gone&quot;.

===The awakening of the Buddha===

====Canonical accounts====
In the suttapitaka, the Buddhist canon as preserved in the Theravada tradition, a couple of texts can be found in which the Buddha&#x27;s attainment of liberation forms part of the narrative.

The &quot;Ariyapariyesana Sutta&quot; (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes how the Buddha was dissatisfied with the teachings of Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, wandered further through Magadhan country, and then found &quot;an agreeable piece of ground&quot; which served for striving. The sutta then only says that he attained Nibbana.

In the &quot;Vanapattha Sutta&quot; (Majjhima Nikaya 17) the Buddha describes life in the jungle, and the attainment of awakening. The &quot;Mahasaccaka Sutta&quot; (Majjhima Nikaya 36) describes his ascetic practices, which he abandoned. Thereafter he remembered a spontaneous state of jhana, and set out for jhana-practice. Both suttas narrate how, after destroying the disturbances of the mind, and attaining concentration of the mind, he attained three knowledges (vidhya):
# Insight into his past lives
# Insight into the workings of karma and reincarnation
# Insight into the Four Noble Truths

Insight into the Four Noble Truths is here called awakening. The monk (&quot;bhikkhu&quot;) has &quot;...attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.&quot; Awakening is also described as synonymous with Nirvana, the extinction of the passions whereby suffering is ended and no more rebirths take place. The insight arises that this liberation is certain: &quot;Knowledge arose in me, and insight: my freedom is certain, this is my last birth, now there is no rebirth.&quot;

====Critical assessment====
Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting &quot;liberating insight&quot;, which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36. Bronkhorst notices that
It calls in question the reliability of these accounts, and the relation between &quot;dhyana&quot; and insight, which is a core problem in the study of early Buddhism. Originally the term &quot;prajna&quot; may have been used, which came to be replaced by the four truths in those texts where &quot;liberating insight&quot; was preceded by the four jhanas. Bronkhorst also notices that the conception of what exactly this &quot;liberating insight&quot; was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by &quot;pratityasamutpada&quot;, and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person. And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this &quot;liberating insight&quot; exist in the Buddhist canon:
An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42–43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.

==Understanding of &quot;bodhi&quot; and Buddhahood==
The term bodhi acquired a variety of meanings and connotations during the development of Buddhist thoughts in the various schools.

===Early Buddhism===
In early Buddhism, &quot;bodhi&quot; carried a meaning synonymous to &quot;nirvana&quot;, using only a few different metaphors to describe the insight, which implied the extinction of &quot;lobha&quot; (greed), &quot;dosa&quot; (hate) and &quot;moha&quot; (delusion).

===Theravada===
In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning: that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion. &quot;Bodhi&quot;, specifically, refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant. It is equal to supreme insight, the realisation of the four noble truths, which leads to deliverance. Reaching full awakening is equivalent in meaning to reaching Nirvāṇa. Attaining Nirvāṇa is the ultimate goal of Theravada and other śrāvaka traditions. It involves the abandonment of the ten fetters and the cessation of dukkha or suffering. Full awakening is reached in four stages. According to Nyanatiloka,
Since the 1980s, western Theravada-oriented teachers have started to question the primacy of insight. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, &quot;jhana&quot; and &quot;vipassana&quot; (insight) form an integrated practice. Polak and Arbel, following scholars like Vetter and Bronkhorst, argue that right effort, c.q. the four right efforts (sense restraint, preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and the generation of wholesome states), mindfulness, and &quot;dhyana&quot; form an integrated practice, in which &quot;dhyana&quot; is the actualisation of insight, leading to an awakened awareness which is &quot;non-reactive and lucid&quot;.

===Mahayana===
In Mahayana-thought, bodhi is the realisation of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, and the unity of subject and object. Similar to prajna, the realizing of the Buddha-nature, bodhi realizes sunyata and suchness. In time, the Buddha&#x27;s awakening came to be understood as an immediate full awakening and liberation, instead of the insight into and certainty about the way to follow to reach enlightenment. In some Zen traditions, however, this perfection came to be relativized again; according to one contemporary Zen master, &quot;Shakyamuni buddha and Bodhidharma are still practicing.&quot;

Mahayana discerns three forms of awakened beings:
# Arahat – Liberation for oneself;
# Bodhisattva – Liberation for living beings;
# Full Buddhahood.

Within the various Mahayana-schools exist various further explanations and interpretations. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Bodhisattva is the ideal. The ultimate goal is not only of one&#x27;s own liberation in Buddhahood, but the liberation of all living beings. The cosmology of Mahayana Buddhism regards a wide range of buddhas and bodhisattvas, who assist humans on their way to liberation.

Nichiren Buddhism, a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, regards Buddhahood as a state of perfect freedom, in which one is awakened to the eternal and ultimate truth that is the reality of all things. This supreme state of life is characterized by boundless wisdom and infinite compassion. The Lotus Sutra reveals that Buddhahood is a potential in the lives of all beings.

====Buddha-nature====
In the Tathagatagarbha and Buddha-nature doctrines, bodhi becomes equivalent to the universal, natural and pure state of the mind:
According to these doctrines, bodhi eternally exists within one&#x27;s mind, although requiring the mind&#x27;s defilements to be removed. This vision is expounded in texts such as the Shurangama Sutra and the Uttaratantra.

In Shingon Buddhism as well, the state of Bodhi is regarded as naturally inherent in the mind. Bodhi is the mind&#x27;s natural and pure state, where no distinction is being made between a perceiving subject and perceived objects. This is also the understanding of Bodhi found in Yogacara Buddhism.

To achieve this vision of non-duality, it is necessary to recognise one&#x27;s own mind:
===Vajrayana===
During the development of Mahayana Buddhism, the various strands of thought on Bodhi were continuously being elaborated. Attempts were made to harmonize the various terms.

The Vajrayana Buddhist commentator Buddhaguhya treats various terms as synonyms:
==Bodhi Day==
Sakyamuni&#x27;s awakening is celebrated on Bodhi Day. In Sri Lanka and Japan, different days are used for this celebration. According to the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka, Sakyamuni reached Buddhahood at the full moon in May. This is celebrated at Vesākha Pūjā, the full moon in May, known as Sambuddhatva jayanthi (or Sambuddha jayanthi).

<text>The National Association of Realtors (NAR) is an American trade association for those who work in the real estate industry. it had over 1.5 million members, making it the largest trade association in the United States including NAR&#x27;s institutes, societies, and councils, involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries. The organization holds a U.S. trademark over the term &quot;Realtor&quot;. NAR also functions as a self-regulatory organization for real estate brokerage. The organization is headquartered in Chicago.

==Overview==

The National Association of Realtors was founded on May 12, 1908 as the National Association of Real Estate Exchanges in Chicago, Illinois. In 1916, it changed its name to The National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB). The current name was adopted in 1972.

NAR&#x27;s members are residential and commercial real estate brokers, real estate salespeople, immovable property managers, appraisers, counselors, and others engaged in all aspects of the real estate (immovable property) industry, where a state license to practice is required. Members belong to one or more of some 1,600 local realtor boards or associations. They are pledged to a code of ethics and standards of practice, a version of which was first adopted in 1913.

==NAR and Multiple Listing Service (MLS) systems==
The NAR governs the hundreds of local Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) which are the information exchanges used across the nation by real estate brokers. (However, many MLSs are independent of NAR, although membership is typically limited to licensed brokers and their agents; MLSPIN is an example of one of the larger independent MLSs in North America.)

Through a complicated arrangement, NAR sets the policies for most of the Multiple Listings Services, and in the late 1990s, with the growth of the Internet, NAR evolved regulations allowing Internet Data Exchanges (IDX) whereby brokers would allow a portion of their data to be seen on the Internet via brokers&#x27; or agents&#x27; websites and Virtual Office Websites (VOW) which required potential buyers to register to obtain information.

These policies allowed participants—whether they were individual one-person brokers or large regional companies—to limit access to some or all of the MLS data by individual brokers (whether they were brokers operating solely on the Internet or local competitors). In 2005, this prompted the Department of Justice to file an antitrust lawsuit against NAR alleging its MLS rules regarding these types of limitations on the display of data were the product of a conspiracy to restrain trade by excluding brokers who used the Internet to operate differently from traditional brick-and-mortar brokers. (For a description of the DOJ action, see &quot;Antitrust Case filings for U.S. vs. National Association of Realtors&quot;.) Meanwhile, various real estate trends such as expanded consumer access and the Internet are consolidating existing local MLS organizations into larger and more statewide or regional MLS systems, such as in California and Virginia/Maryland/Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Metropolitan Regional Information Systems.

In response to the case, NAR had proposed setting up a single Internet Listing Display system which would not allow participants to exclude individual brokers (whether of a bricks-and-mortar type or solely internet-based) but require a blanket opting out of display on &quot;all other brokers″&quot; sites. This system became the IDX system. Although IDX allows the public to view MLS listings, it still requires the listing brokerage information to be placed on the listing every place it appears (brokers legally &quot;own&quot; the listings of their brokerage), to prevent misrepresentation of the listing information, and to place accountability for the information on the broker as the law dictates.

The antitrust lawsuit was settled in May 2008. The settlement agreement mandated that all Multiple Listing Service systems allow access to Internet-based competitors. It required NAR to treat online brokers the same as traditional brokers and barred NAR from excluding online brokers from membership because they do not have a traditional business model. The NAR admitted no wrongdoing, and it paid neither fines nor damages as part of the deal. A federal judge formally approved the settlement in November 2008. NAR&#x27;s general counsel believed that the settlement would not affect commissions paid by the general public, but a business professor at Western Michigan University predicted that the increased competition would cause a 25 to 50 percent decrease in commissions.

Another major anti-competitive practice is supported (indirectly) by various state laws which prohibit the &quot;sharing&quot; of commissions with unlicensed individuals. In broad interpretations, this is deemed to prevent a buyers&#x27; agent from providing credit to his or her buyers from commissions received. Currently, there are 10 states where real estate agents and brokers are barred from offering homebuyers or sellers cash rebates or gifts of any kind with a cash value of more than $25. Various realtors in such states have successfully contested this interpretation in states which now allow the practice (notably, Patrick Lea, a realtor in Ohio, and numerous agents in Kentucky). The Kentucky case was ultimately tried with the United States Department of Justice as the plaintiff and the Kentucky Real Estate Commission as the defendant.

In 2019, The National Association of Realtors’ board approved the Clear Cooperation Policy. A policy that requires brokers to submit a listing to the Multiple Listings Service within one business day of marketing a property to the public.

==Lobbying==
The National Association of Realtors is considered one of the most powerful special interests in the United States. In 2023, the organization spent $52 million on lobbying, ranking second on the OpenSecrets list of top spenders. It has spent a total of $850 million on lobbying since 1998.

The Real Estate Political Education Committee (REPEC), a political action committee, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of electing Realtor-friendly candidates. It was renamed the Realtors Political Action Committee (RPAC) in 1974 following changes to federal election law. RPAC now claims to be the largest trade association PAC in the country and gives around $4 million per year to candidates who support real estate interests. The N.A.R.&#x27;s website says &quot;RPAC is one of the most bipartisan PACs in the country, giving to both Democrats and Republicans alike&quot;, and historically half of its expenditures have gone to Democrats, and the other half to Republicans.

Around 2019, N.A.R.created an affiliate nonprofit called the American Property Owners Alliance; in its first four years, the nonprofit, solely funded by the N.A.R., gave $12.8 million in grants, with almost $10m of that going to Republican-aligned super PACs and groups with conservative agendas.

==Role in housing segregation==
Between 1924 and 1950, the Realtor Code of Ethics included explicit references to racial segregation. Realtors were prohibited from helping Black homebuyers move into white neighborhoods and faced career-ending penalties for not complying. The clause encouraging segregation was not fully removed from the Realtor Code of Ethics until 1974.
The National Association of Realtors opposed the Fair Housing Act in 1968, which outlawed racial discrimination in home sales.

==Enabling the subprime mortgage crisis==

Some experts believe that brokers and realtors bear at least partial responsibility for the subprime mortgage crisis, purposefully inflating the perceived market values of homes, and subsequently encouraging buyers to take out larger mortgages than needed. The theory is that collusion with mortgage lenders enabled realtors to earn high volumes of commission on borrowed money for inflated house values with no risk to the realtors. Many victims feel that home buyers were tricked into taking out larger loans to buy more expensive homes, and the higher sales prices paid the realtors higher commissions. This practice is not considered &quot;unethical&quot; by the NAR which claims to be a Self-regulatory organization; however, obvious implications show extensive and substantial harm rendered to the public. Many victims are encouraging the Securities and Exchange Commission to begin aggressively regulating agents and refunding overpayments to homebuyers.

==Antitrust lawsuits==
In 2005, the United States Department of Justice filed a formal complaint against the National Association of Realtors for violating Section 4 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The complaint sought to enjoin the National Association of Realtors &quot;from maintaining or enforcing a policy that restrains competition from brokers who use the Internet to more efficiently and cost effectively serve home sellers and buyers, and from adopting other related anticompetitive rules.

The DOJ challenged NAR&#x27;s MLS rules that inhibited competition from Internet-based brokers. On November 18, 2008, the Court entered a Final Judgment approving a settlement against NAR.
Under the Final Judgment, the NAR agreed to the policies challenged by the United States and replaced those policies with rules that do not discriminate against brokers who use the Internet to provide low-priced brokerage services to consumers.

In 2012, American Home Realty Network, Inc., the operator of NeighborCity, filed antitrust counterclaims in response to a pair of copyright lawsuits, alleging that the &quot;copyright lawsuits filed against it by two multiple listing services with financial backing from the National Association of Realtors are part of a concerted effort by NAR to drive the company out of business and eliminate it as a provider of services to real estate brokers.&quot; The counter-claims also allege that the copyrights asserted were never properly registered. In the Minnesota case, which recites claims against the NAR but does not directly name the NAR as a counter-defendant, AHRN filed a second amended counterclaim adding Edina Realty and Home Services of America as Counter-Defendants in the antitrust and unfair competition claims. Edina Realty is a subsidiary of HomeServices of America, Inc., a Berkshire Hathaway company, which owns real estate brokerage firms in states across the country, including Minnesota, Maryland, North Carolina, Georgia, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Illinois, Kansas, South Carolina, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, and California. Earlier in 2012, the mid-Atlantic multiple listing service Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc. (MRIS) and St. Paul, MN-based Regional Multiple Listing Service of Minnesota Inc. (NorthstarMLS) filed copyright claims against NeighborCity. The National Association of Realtors said it would provide financial support for NorthstarMLS and MRIS legal expenses.

Another lawsuit was filed in March 2019 challenging NAR&#x27;s compensation policies which require all member brokers demand blanket, non-negotiable buyer-side commission fees when listing a home on a Multiple Listing Service (MLS).

=== &quot;Burnett et al v. National Association of Realtors et al&quot; ===

On October 31, 2023, a federal civil jury found that the NAR had conspired to inflate commissions paid to home-buyers&#x27; real estate agents, and determined that NAR and its codefendants owed damages of almost billion. The lawsuit, &quot;Burnett et al v. National Association of Realtors et al&quot;, was heard in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri in Kansas City, and involved allegations of violations of federal and state antitrust laws by the NAR, HomeServices of America, Keller Williams Realty, Anywhere Real Estate (parent of Coldwell Banker, Century 21 Real Estate, and Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty) and Re/Max. Anywhere and Re/Max had previously settled their liability and agreed to pay lesser damages, leaving NAR, HomeServices and Keller Williams to defend the suit at trial. Upon announcement of the verdict and before final judgment was entered, NAR and HomeServices stated their intention to appeal, and Keller Williams was considering doing so. In March 2024, NAR agreed to settle for a reduction of damages to million, eliminating its rules on commissions, and waiving its right to appeal. As a result of the settlement, starting August 2024, buyers’ agents commission fees are not allowed to be advertised and buyers must sign a contract with their agent before seeing properties together. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported the settlement is expected to reduce real estate commissions, force some agents out of the industry, and lead to a decline in NAR’s membership.

==Specializations==
===NAR educational requirements and recognized designations===
Realtors, as members of NAR, also have the option of studying for additional certifications in a variety of specialties, several of which are backed by NAR with offerings of certification and update courses available nationwide.

==Consumer outreach==
The NAR launched HouseLogic.com in February 2010 in an attempt to reach consumers directly for the first time.

<text>Ella Wheeler Wilcox (November 5, 1850October 30, 1919) was an American author and poet. Her works include the collection &quot;Poems of Passion&quot; and the poem &quot;Solitude&quot;, which contains the lines &quot;Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.&quot; Her autobiography, &quot;The Worlds and I&quot;, was published in 1918, a year before her death.

==Biography==
Ella Wheeler was born in 1850 on a farm in Johnstown, Wisconsin, east of Janesville, the youngest of four children. The family later moved north of Madison, after losing its wealth, as the result of her father&#x27;s failed business aspirations and speculation. Wilcox&#x27;s family held themselves to be intellectuals, and a mastery of the nuances of the English language was prized. During her childhood, Wilcox amused herself by reading books and newspapers, which may have influenced her later writing (most notably William Shakespeare, &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&quot; and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, in addition to the few other pieces of literature that were to be had in her home).

Around the age of 8, Wilcox turned to writing poetry as an outlet. When she was 13 years old, her first poem was published. After losing her subscription to &quot;The New York Mercury&quot;, and being unable to afford to resubscribe, Wilcox thought that if she could get a piece of literature published, she would at least receive a copy of the paper wherein her piece was printed. The piece that she submitted is lost, and Wilcox later admitted that she could not recall even the topic of the poem. Wilcox became known as a poet in her own state by the time she graduated from high school.

Her poem &quot;The Way of the World&quot; was first published in the February 25, 1883, issue of &quot;The New York Sun&quot;. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor&#x27;s inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler sat next to her and sought to comfort her for the rest of the journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that she could barely attend the scheduled festivities. As she looked at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow. It was at that moment that she wrote the opening lines of &quot;Solitude&quot;:

:Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
:Weep, and you weep alone.
:For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth
:But has trouble enough of its own

She sent the poem to the &quot;Sun&quot; and received $5 for her effort. It was collected in the book &quot;Poems of Passion&quot; shortly afterward in May 1883. This collection was reported to have made $2000 that year.

In 1884, she married Robert Wilcox of Meriden, Connecticut, where the couple lived before moving to New York City and then to Granite Bay in the Short Beach section of Branford, Connecticut. The two homes they built on Long Island Sound, along with several cottages, became known as Bungalow Court, and they would hold gatherings there of literary and artistic friends. They had one child, a son, who died shortly after birth. Not long after their marriage, they both became interested in Theosophy, New Thought, and Spiritualism.

Early in their married life, Robert and Ella Wheeler Wilcox promised each other that whoever died first would return and communicate with the other. Robert Wilcox died in 1916, after over thirty years of marriage. She was overcome with grief, which became ever more intense as week after week went without any message from him. It was at this time that she went to California to see the Rosicrucian astrologer, Max Heindel, still seeking help in her sorrow, still unable to understand why she had no word from her Robert. She wrote of this meeting:

Several months later she composed a little mantra or affirmative prayer which she said over and over &quot;I am the living witness: The dead live: And they speak through us and to us: And I am the voice that gives this glorious truth to the suffering world: I am ready, God: I am ready, Christ: I am ready, Robert.&quot;
Wilcox made efforts to teach occult things to the world. Her works, filled with positive thinking, were popular in the New Thought Movement and by 1915 her booklet, &quot;What I Know About New Thought&quot; had a distribution of 50,000 copies, according to its publisher, Elizabeth Towne.

The following statement expresses Wilcox&#x27;s unique blending of New Thought, Spiritualism, and a Theosophical belief in reincarnation: &quot;As we think, act, and live here today, we build the structures of our homes in spirit realms after we leave earth, and we build karma for future lives, thousands of years to come, on this earth or other planets. Life will assume new dignity, and labor new interest for us, when we come to the knowledge that death is but a continuation of life and labor, in higher planes.&quot;

Her final words in her autobiography &quot;The Worlds and I&quot;: &quot;From this mighty storehouse (of God, and the hierarchies of Spiritual Beings) we may gather wisdom and knowledge, and receive light and power, as we pass through this preparatory room of earth, which is only one of the innumerable mansions in our Father&#x27;s house. Think on these things.&quot;

Wilcox was an advocate of animal rights and vegetarianism. She died of cancer on October 30, 1919, in Short Beach, Connecticut.

==Poetry==

None of Wilcox&#x27;s works were included by F. O. Matthiessen in &quot;The Oxford Book of American Verse,&quot; but Hazel Felleman chose fourteen of her poems for &quot;Best Loved Poems of the American People,&quot; while Martin Gardner selected &quot;The Way Of The World&quot; and &quot;The Winds of Fate&quot; for &quot;Best Remembered Poems&quot;.

She is cited in the anthology of bad poetry, &quot;Very Bad Poetry&quot;. Sinclair Lewis indicates Babbitt&#x27;s lack of literary sophistication by having him refer to a piece of verse as &quot;one of the classic poems, like &#x27;If—&#x27; by Kipling, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox&#x27;s &#x27;The Man Worth While.&#x27;&quot;
The latter opens: 
:&quot;It is easy enough to be pleasant,&quot;
:    &quot;When life flows by like a song,&quot;
:&quot;But the man worth while is one who will smile,&quot;
:    &quot;When everything goes dead wrong.&quot;

Her poem &quot;Solitude&quot; opens:

:&quot;Laugh and the world laughs with you,&quot;
:    &quot;Weep, and you weep alone;&quot;
:&quot;The good old earth must borrow its mirth,&quot;
:    &quot;But has trouble enough of its own.&quot;

&quot;The Winds of Fate&quot;

:&quot;One ship drives east and another drives west&quot;
:&quot; With the selfsame winds that blow.&quot;
:&quot; &#x27;Tis the set of the sails,&quot;
:&quot; And Not the gales,&quot;
:&quot; That tell us the way to go.&quot;

:&quot;Like the winds of the sea are the ways of fate;&quot;
:&quot; As we voyage along through life,&quot;
:&quot; &#x27;Tis the set of a soul&quot;
:&quot; That decides its goal,&quot;
:&quot; And not the calm or the strife.&quot;

Wheeler Wilcox cared about alleviating animal suffering, as can be seen from her poem, &quot;Voice of the Voiceless&quot;. It begins as follows:

:&quot;So many gods, so many creeds,&quot;
:&quot;So many paths that wind and wind,&quot;
:&quot;While just the art of being kind&quot;
:&quot;Is all the sad world needs.&quot;

:&quot;I am the voice of the voiceless;&quot;
:&quot;Through me the dumb shall speak,&quot;
:&quot;Till the deaf world’s ear be made to hear&quot;
:&quot;The wrongs of the wordless weak.&quot;

:&quot;From street, from cage, and from kennel,&quot;
:&quot;From stable and zoo, the wail&quot;
:&quot;Of my tortured kin proclaims the sin&quot;
:&quot;Of the mighty against the frail.&quot;

She made an appearance during World War I in France, reciting her poem, &quot;The Stevedores&quot; (&quot;Here&#x27;s to the Army stevedores, lusty virile and strong...&quot;) while visiting a camp of 9,000 US Army stevedores.

<text>Real estate agents and real estate brokers are people who represent sellers or buyers of real estate or real property. While a broker may work independently, an agent usually works under a licensed broker to represent clients. Brokers and agents are licensed by the state to negotiate sales agreements and manage the documentation required for closing real estate transactions. 

==Categories of representation==
A real estate broker typically receives a real estate commission for successfully completing a sale. Across the U.S, this commission can generally range between 5-6% of the property&#x27;s sale price for a full-service broker but this percentage varies by state and even region.

==Real estate licensing and education==
In most jurisdictions in the United States, a person must have a license to perform licensed activities, and these activities are defined within the statutes of each state. The main feature of the requirement for having a license to perform those activities is the work done &quot;for compensation&quot;. Hence, hypothetically, if a person wants to help a friend out in either selling or buying a property, and no compensation of any kind is expected in return, then a license is not needed to perform all the work. However, since most people would expect to be compensated for their efforts and skills, a license would be required by law before a person may receive remuneration for services rendered as a real estate broker or agent. Unlicensed activity is illegal and the state real estate commission has the authority to fine people who are acting as real estate licensees, but buyers and sellers acting as principals in the sale or purchase of real estate are usually not required to be licensed. It is important to note that in some states, lawyers handle real estate sales for compensation without being licensed as brokers or agents. However, even lawyers can only perform real estate activities that are incidental to their original work as a lawyer. It cannot be the case that a lawyer can become a seller&#x27;s selling agent if that is all the service that is being requested by the client. Lawyers would still need to be licensed as a broker if they wish to perform licensed activities. Nevertheless, lawyers do get a break in the minimum education requirements (for example, 90 hours in Illinois).

Some other states have recently eliminated the salesperson&#x27;s license, instead, all licensees in those states automatically earn their broker&#x27;s license.

The term &quot;agent&quot; is not to be confused with salesperson or broker. An agent is simply a licensee that has entered into an agency relationship with a client. A broker can also be an agent for a client. It is commonly the firm that has the actual legal relationship with the client through one of their sales staff, be they salespersons or brokers.

In all states, the real estate licensee must disclose to prospective buyers and sellers the nature of their relationship 

== Specific representation laws==
Some U.S. state real estate commissions – notably Florida&#x27;s after 1992 (and extended in 2003) and Colorado&#x27;s after 1994 (with changes in 2003) created the option of having no agency or fiduciary relationship between brokers and sellers or buyers.

As noted by the South Broward Board of Realtors, Inc. in a letter to State of Florida legislative committees:

The result was that, in 2003, Florida created a system where the default brokerage relationship had &quot;all licensees ... operating as transaction brokers, unless a single agent or no brokerage relationship is established, in writing, with the customer&quot; and the statute required written disclosure of the transaction brokerage relationship to the buyer or seller customer only through July 1, 2008.

In the case of both Florida and Colorado, dual agency and sub-agency (where both listing and selling agents represent the seller) no longer exist.

Other brokers and agents may focus on representing buyers or tenants in a real estate transaction. However, licensing as a broker or salesperson authorizes the licensee to legally represent parties on either side of a transaction and providing the necessary documentation for the legal transfer of real property. This business decision is for the licensee to decide. They are fines for people acting as real estate agents when not licensed by the state.

In the United Kingdom, an estate agent is a person or business entity whose business is to market real estate on behalf of clients. There are significant differences between the actions, powers, obligations, and liabilities of brokers and estate agents in each country, as different countries take markedly different approaches to the marketing and selling of real property.

== The difference between salespersons and brokers ==
&quot;Before&quot; the &quot;Multiple Listing Service (MLS)&quot; was introduced in 1967, when brokers (and their licensees) only represented sellers by providing a service to provide legal documentation on the transfer real property, the term &quot;real estate salesperson&quot; may have been more appropriate than it is today, given the various ways that brokers and licensees now help buyers through the legal process of transferring real property. Legally, however, the term &quot;salesperson&quot; is still used in many states to describe a &quot;real estate licensee&quot;.

===Real estate broker (or, in some states, qualifying broker)===
After gaining some years of experience in real estate sales, a salesperson may decide to become licensed as a real estate broker (or Principal/qualifying broker) in order to own, manage, or operate their own brokerage. In addition, some states allow college graduates to apply for a broker&#x27;s license without years of experience. College graduates fall into this category once they have completed the state-required courses as well. California allows licensed attorneys to become brokers upon passing the broker exam without having to take the requisite courses required of an agent. Commonly more coursework and a broker&#x27;s state exam on real estate law must be passed. Upon obtaining a broker&#x27;s license, a real estate agent may continue to work for another broker in a similar capacity as before (often referred to as a broker associate or associate broker) or take charge of their own brokerage and hire other salespersons (or broker licensees). Becoming a branch office manager may or may not require a broker&#x27;s license. Some states allow licensed attorneys to become real estate brokers without taking any exam. In some states, there are no &quot;salespeople&quot; as all licensees are brokers.

==Types of services that a broker can provide==
Real Estate Services are also called trading services 

==Real estate brokers and sellers==
=== Flat-fee real estate agents ===
Flat-fee real estate agents charge a seller of a property a flat fee, $500 for example, as opposed to a traditional or full-service real estate agent who charges a percentage of the sale price. In exchange, the seller&#x27;s property will appear in the multiple listing service (MLS), but the seller will represent him or herself when showing the property and negotiating a sales price. The result is the seller pays less commission overall (roughly half) when the property sells. This is because a seller will pay a percentage of the sales price to a buyer&#x27;s agent but not have to pay a percentage to a seller&#x27;s agent (because there isn&#x27;t one; the seller is representing himself).

===Brokerage commissions===
In consideration of the brokerage successfully finding a buyer for the property, a broker anticipates receiving a commission for the services the brokerage has provided. Usually, the payment of a commission to the brokerage is contingent upon finding a buyer for the real estate, the successful negotiation of a purchase contract between the buyer and seller, or the settlement of the transaction and the exchange of money between buyer and seller. Under common law, a real estate broker is eligible to receive their commission, regardless of whether the sale actually takes place, once they secure a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase the dwelling. 

Economist Steven D. Levitt famously argued in his 2005 book Freakonomics that real estate brokers have an inherent conflict of interest with the sellers they represent because their commission gives them more motivation to sell quickly than to sell at a higher price. Levitt supported his argument with a study finding brokers tend to put their own houses on the market for longer and receive higher prices for them compared to when working for their clients. He concluded that broker commissions will reduce in future. A 2008 study by other economists found that when comparing brokerage without listing services, brokerage significantly &quot;reduced&quot; the average sale price.

====RESPA====
Real estate brokers who work with lenders can not receive any compensation from the lender for referring a residential client to a specific lender. To do so would be a violation of a United States federal law known as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). RESPA ensures that buyers and sellers are given adequate notice of the Real Estate settlement process. 

==Realtor==
In the United States, the term realtor is trademarked by the National Association of Realtors, which uses it to refer to its active members, who may be real estate agents or brokers. In Canada, the trademark is used by members of the Canadian Real Estate Association. Both organizations advise against the use of &quot;realtor&quot; as a generic synonym for &quot;real estate agent&quot;.

== Continuing education ==
States issue licenses for an annual or multi-year period and require real estate agents and brokers to complete continuing education prior to renewing their licenses. For example, California licensees must complete 45 hours of continuing education every 4 years in topics such as agency, trust fund handling, consumer protection, fair housing, ethics, and risk management.

<doc id="440276" wikidata="Q1147255" url="?curid=440276" title="Chiyou">
<text>Chiyou () is a mythological being that appears in Chinese mythology. He was a tribal leader of the Nine Li tribe () in ancient China. He is best known as a king who lost against the future Yellow Emperor during the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors era in Chinese mythology. According to the Song dynasty history book &quot;Lushi&quot;, Chiyou&#x27;s surname was Jiang (), and he was a descendant of the Flame Emperor.

Chiyou is often associated with chaos and war, earning him the status of a demon god in later mythological interpretations, especially in northern China. In some Daoist traditions, he is considered a demon or evil god representing war and violence. His image has also been used as a protective figure, especially by soldiers, who see him as a war deity capable of offering protection in battle. Conversely, for some Hmong people, Chiyou or Txiv Yawg was a sagacious mythical king. He has a particularly complex and controversial ancestry, as he may fall under Dongyi Miao or even Man, depending on the source and view. 

According to legend, Chiyou had a bronze head with a distinct metal forehead. He had four eyes and six arms, wielding terrible sharp weapons in every hand, similar to a description of &quot;fangxiangshi&quot;. In some sources, Chiyou had certain features associated with various mythological bovines: his head was that of a bull with two horns, although the body was human, and his hindquarters were those of a bear. He is said to have been unbelievably fierce, and to have had 81 brothers and many followers. Historical sources often described him as &#x27;bold leader&#x27;, as well as &#x27;brave&#x27;. Some sources have asserted that the figure 81 should rather be associated with 81 clans in his kingdom. Chiyou knows the constellations and the ancients spells for calling upon the weather. For example, he called upon a fog to surround Huangdi and his soldiers during the Battle of Zhuolu.

== Tribe ==
Chiyou is regarded as a leader of the Nine Li tribe (, RPA ) by nearly all sources. However, his exact ethnic affiliations are quite complex, with multiple sources reporting him as belonging to various tribes, in addition to a number of diverse peoples supposed to have directly descended from him.

Some sources from later dynasties, such as the &quot;Guoyu book&quot;, considered Chiyou&#x27;s Li tribe to be related to the ancient San miao tribe (). In the ancient Zhuolu Town is a statue of Chiyou commemorating him as the original ancestor of the Miao people. The place is regarded as the birthplace of the San miao / Miao people, the Hmong being a subgroup of the Miao. In various sources, the &quot;nine Li&quot; tribe is called the &quot;Jiuli&quot; kingdom, Jiuli meaning &quot;nine Li&quot;. Modern Han Chinese scholar Weng Dujian considers Jiuli and San Miao to be Man southerners. Chiyou has also been counted as part of the Dongyi.

== Allusions and legends ==
Legend has it that in ancient times, the Miao people lived on the edge of the Yellow River, with a total of &quot;eighty-one&quot; villages. Their leader was called Chi You. Chi You got rid of the &quot;lop-eared witch&quot; who harmed the Miao people, so that the people could live and work in peace and contentment. Later, The three demon children of the witch invited Red Dragon and Huang Long (i.e. Emperor Yan and Huang Emperor) to take revenge. Chi You led the Miao people to fight bravely and defeated Red Dragon and Huang Long many times.

The story of Guan Gong being invited by Taoist Zhang Tianshi to kill Chi You. Legend has it that during the reign of Zhenzong of the Song dynasty, the Jiezhou Salt Pond did not produce salt. Zhang Tianshi from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi Province was summoned to the court to tell the emperor that the lack of salt produced Chi You, and that he could be killed by Guan Gong. After Zhang Tianshi followed the emperor&#x27;s order, he burned a talisman to summon Guan Gong. Guan Gong showed his power, Chi You was beheaded, the salt pond was restored, and all the people rejoiced.

==Epic battles==
When the Yan emperor was leading his tribe and conflicts with Nine Li tribes led by Chiyou, the Yan emperor stood no chance and lost the fight. He escaped, and later ended up in Zhuolu begging for help from the Yellow Emperor. At this point the epic battle between Chiyou and the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s forces began. The battle last for 10 years with Chiyou having the upper hand. 

During the Battle of Zhuolu, Chiyou breathed out a thick fog and obscured the sunlight. The battle dragged on for days while the emperor&#x27;s side was in danger. Only after the Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, did he find his way out of the battlefield. Chiyou then conjured up a heavy storm. The Yellow Emperor then called upon the drought demon Nüba (), who blew away the storm clouds and cleared the battlefield. Chiyou and his army could not hold up, and were later killed by the Yellow Emperor. After this defeat, the Yellow Emperor is said to become the ancestor of all Huaxia. His followers were forced to live in the mountains and leave their Li kingdom. After Chiyou&#x27;s death, it is said that it rained blood for some time.

==Legacy==
According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Qin Shi Huang worshipped Chiyou as the God of War, and Liu Bang worshiped at Chiyou&#x27;s shrine before his decisive battle against Xiang Yu. The mythical title God of War was given to Chiyou because the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor could not defeat Chiyou alone. Altogether, Chiyou won nine major battles including 80 minor confrontations. On the 10th and final war, both emperors combined their forces and conquered Chiyou. Chiyou remains as a figure of worship today.

In one mythical episode, after Chiyou had claimed he could not be conquered, the goddess Nuwa dropped a stone tablet on him from Mount Tai. The stone failed to crush Chiyou, who managed to escape. From then on, the 5-finger-shaped stone tablet, inscribed &quot;Mount Tai &quot;shigandang&quot;&quot; () became a spiritual weapon to ward off evil and disasters.

Chiyou is also identified with the Taotie motif present on ritual bronze vessels. The historian , in his work the &quot;Lushi&quot;, writes of Chiyou that the Yellow Emperor &quot;cut his head off; and for this reason sages later cast his portrait on bronzes to warn the greedy.&quot; Luo Bi&#x27;s son, , then expanded on this, writing that:

In Chinese honghuang novels and online literature, Chiyou ranks first among the &quot;Ten Great Demon Gods of Ancient Times&quot;, including Xingtian, Kuafu, Gonggong, Feilian, Pingyi, Shentu and Yulei, Houqing, Hanba, and Yinlingzi.

The Tale of Heike mentions a comet &quot;of the type called Chiyou&#x27;s Banner or Red Breath.&quot;

<text>In the Eastern Orthodox Church, akribeia () is the strict adherence to the letter of the law of the Church.

&quot;Akribeia&quot; is to be distinguished from economy, which is discretionary deviation from the letter of the law in order to adhere to the spirit of the law.

== Canon law ==
In Eastern Orthodox canon law, there are two notions: &quot;akriveia&quot; and &quot;economia&quot;. &quot;Akriveia&quot;, which is harshness, &quot;is the strict application (sometimes even extension) of the penance given to an unrepentant and habitual offender.&quot; &quot;Economia&quot;, which is sweetness, &quot;is a judicious relaxation of the penance when the sinner shows remorse and repentance.&quot;

<doc id="440284" wikidata="Q180911" url="?curid=440284" title="Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer">
<text>Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawar (, born 1958) is an Iraqi politician. He was the vice president under the Iraqi Transitional Government in 2006, and was interim president of Iraq under the Iraqi Interim Government from 2004 to 2005. He also served as the president of the Governing Council of Iraq in 2004 following the US-led coalition invasion.

Al-Yawar was originally a member of the Iraqi Governing Council created following the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2004 he was appointed by the council to serve as interim President of Iraq following the 28 June return of Iraqi sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority.

==Early life and education==
Born in Mosul, Iraq in 1958, al-Yawar completed his primary and secondary education in Iraq. He then went on to study in King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) for two years before completing his BSc in civil engineering in the UK. Al-Yawar enrolled in an English language program at American University in Washington, D.C., and then received his master&#x27;s degree from George Washington University in the mid 1980s.

Al-Yawar is Sunni Muslim. The House of Yawar has been the head of the Shammar tribe for centuries. The Shammar is one of Iraq&#x27;s biggest tribal confederations with more than 1.5 million people covering vast territories from Iraq into Syria and Saudi Arabia. Composed of both Sunnis and Shiites, the Shammar are generally religiously and politically moderate. &quot;My mother would take me to visit the holy shrines in Najaf and Karbala, in addition to the Sunni mosques in Baghdad and St. Mary&#x27;s Church,&quot; Yawar told the Iraqi paper &quot;Al Zaman&quot;. This had an impact on al-Yawar&#x27;s leadership approach later in his political career, and one that made a lasting impression. According to Jaffar Saheb Said, an elder at the northern Baghdad shrine of Imam Kadhem, a Shiite saint, &quot;he&#x27;s deep-rooted and well-known among Arab clans. He&#x27;s able to navigate between both Shias and Sunnis and solve their problems.&quot;

His uncle, Sheikh Mohsen Ajil al-Yawar, is the current head of the Shammar tribe and his grandfather played a role in guiding Iraq towards independence in the 1920s, later serving as a member of the king&#x27;s parliament. When al-Yawar&#x27;s uncle refused to sanction Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 the family went into exile in London. Al-Yawar, who was then residing in Saudi Arabia, eschewed politics and instead established a successful telecommunications company. He spent much of the past two decades in Saudi Arabia, where he became vice president of a telecommunications company High Capabilities Co. (HiCap).

==Presidency==
After the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003, al-Yawar returned to Iraq at the request of his uncle, Mohsen al-Yawar. Following the assassination of Iraqi Governing Council President Ezzedine Salim on 17 May 2004, Ghazi al-Yawar assumed the May rotating presidency for the Governing Council. During his term as interim president, leading up to the dissolution of the Governing Council, al-Yawar spoke out against the misperception that Arab Sunnis in Iraq enjoyed huge privileges under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule. Al-Yawar adamantly affirmed that &quot;Saddam did not believe in any religion or sect – his injustices were inflicted on Sunnis, Shi&#x27;is, Kurds and all other national groups and sects. He did not differentiate between one Iraqi and another.&quot;

Al-Yawar was scheduled to be the last holder of the rotating council presidency, with a term lasting until 30 June 2004, the date of the expected transition to official Iraqi sovereignty. Instead, he was chosen at an earlier date to be Iraq&#x27;s formal Head of State, and occupy the largely symbolic post of &quot;State President&quot; of Iraq. Adnan Pachachi was preferred by UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, but most members of the Governing Council had favored al-Yawar. Members of the council had accused the UN of trying to impose a new Iraqi president against their wishes. The dispute delayed the announcement of the interim government that would lead Iraq from the end of the month, but on 1 June 2004 the special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, confirmed Sheikh Ghazi&#x27;s appointment as interim president. Ayad Allawi, who served as Prime Minister during al-Yawar&#x27;s presidency, is a Shiite Muslim. The two collectively represented Iraq&#x27;s largest Muslim sects. Al-Yawar and the Iraqi Interim Government were sworn in on 28 June 2004, when the U.S.-led coalition handed over power two days early.

Sheikh Ghazi&#x27;s selection as interim president, at first resisted and then accepted by the American administrators in Iraq, is further recognition of the tribal revival at this time. Although this post was described as largely ceremonial, it in fact exercised both symbolic and political sway. As a Sunni tribal leader, he reassured his fellow Sunnis while also representing a familiar type of authority figure for the tribal Kurds, and embodying traditional values esteemed by Shiite religious figures. Faleh A. Jabar, a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, called Sheikh Ghazi &quot;a tribal figure who knows modern ways, not a modern leader who knows tribal ways. He is clever, cautious in choosing words and values the seniority of age, a supreme value in tribal people. Being a sheikh, you have to give the lead to each and everyone except yourself.&quot;

L. Paul Bremer in his memoirs indicated that George W. Bush himself urged the appointment of al-Yawar, as Bush &quot;had been favorably impressed by Ghazi&#x27;s open thanks to the Coalition for overthrowing Saddam and by his determination to continue the process to sovereignty and eventual democracy.&quot;

But to many Iraqis, Sheikh al-Yawar was part of the Governing Council, which had lost virtually all legitimacy after its inability to solve the military and political crisis that had erupted across Iraq in April. Al-Yawar had been openly critical of the sectarian Governing Council, often acknowledging that the council was more focused on survival than on serious issues, adding only to the country&#x27;s problems. &quot;We sit in the council while the country is burning and argue over procedure,&quot; Sheikh Ghazi told the Christian Science Monitor. &quot;We&#x27;re like the Byzantines in Constantinople, debating whether angels are male or female with the barbarians at the gate.&quot; Like Ayad Allawi, the prime minister, and many of the council members appointed to new jobs in the cabinet and ministries, he faced a struggle to live down his role as a former council member.

Al-Yawar proved determined not to appear as a puppet of the Coalition forces. He pulled no punches when criticizing the United States for the dismal lack of security in Iraq. &quot;We blame the United States 100 percent for the security in Iraq,&quot; he said. &quot;They occupied the country, disbanded the security agencies and for 10 months left Iraq&#x27;s borders open for anyone to come in without a visa or even a passport.&quot;

In addition, Sheikh Ghazi condemned the U.S. for remaining in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s former Republican Palace presidential compound and converting it to their embassy, as some reports suggested. &quot;This is like someone who pokes his finger in another&#x27;s eye,&quot; he declared.


As the Coalition-led siege in Fallujah peaked during his term as interim president, al-Yawer openly disparaged the assault that only a few months earlier led him to almost resign from the Governing Council in protest of the Coalition&#x27;s actions. He told Reuters &quot;I completely disagree with those who see a need to decide the [Fallujah] matter through military action. The Coalition&#x27;s handling of the crisis is wrong. It&#x27;s like someone who fired bullets at his horse&#x27;s head just because a fly landed on it; the horse died and the fly went away.&quot; He condemned the actions of the coalition forces, holding them completely accountable (according to the UN resolution) for delivering safety and aid to the Iraqi people.

== Post-presidency ==
Al-Yawar held the position as President of Iraq in an interim capacity until an elected Iraqi Parliament could select a new permanent president, as mandated in the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. This happened on 6 April 2005 when Jalal Talabani was elected president, and al-Yawar, after much negotiation, accepted to serve as one of Iraq&#x27;s two vice-presidents.

As vice-president, Sheikh Ghazi addressed some of the many challenges faced by the new government. Due to the boycott of elections by Iraqi Sunnis, al-Yawar stood by his conviction that the new constitution should not be written in light of the past elections that created a unique situation – a complete sector of the Iraqi people were unable to partake in them. The election results were to be taken as the basis for a balance in drafting a constitution for all Iraqis. The constitution, as al-Yawar said in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, &quot;was meant to be always for all the Iraqis and to look after them all and not be 100 percent the whims of a group, religion, or ideology but must have more common ground and denominators for the Iraqi people.&quot; At this time, al-Yawar called for a separation between religion and politics, believing religion is too sacred to be polluted by politics. &quot;Religion directs the country towards the public welfare and love while politics is much planning, maneuvers, prevarications and compromises and it is inappropriate for it to put on the cloak of religion.&quot;

In the January 2005 Iraqi election for the Iraqi National Assembly, he was the leader of The Iraqis (Iraqioun), the largest secular list of candidates with a Sunni leader. His list won about 150,000 votes, 2% of the national vote. Al-Yawar, one of only a handful of Sunni leaders that did not boycott the elections and the only Sunni figure of national standing who appeared to have secured a place in the assembly, took five seats in Parliament.

In the January 2006 election, he joined the Iraqi National List coalition with other secular politicians Ayad Allawi and Adnan Pachachi. He then became a member of the Iraqi Parliament and after a short period of time resigned from the Parliament to return to his private life. Although it was hard to find research or polling on the subject, a few Sunni commentators, such as &quot;Riverbend&quot; of Baghdad Burning, suggested that Ghazi al-Yawer&#x27;s poor showing in the elections was largely because he was held in low esteem by common Sunni Iraqis, being called by the epithet &quot;al Baqara al dhahika&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;the laughing cow&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Al-Yawar has been married since 1984 and has four children.

<doc id="440288" wikidata="Q313816" url="?curid=440288" title="Ayad Allawi">
<text>Ayad Allawi ( ; born 31 May 1944) is an Iraqi politician. He served as the vice president of Iraq from 2014 to 2015 and 2016 to 2018. Previously he was interim prime minister of Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and the president of the Governing Council of Iraq (38th prime minister of Iraq) in 2003.

A prominent Iraqi political activist who lived in exile for almost 30 years, Allawi, a Shia Muslim, became a member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council, which was established by U.S.-led coalition authorities following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He became Iraq&#x27;s first head of government since Saddam Hussein when the council dissolved on 1 June 2004, and named him prime minister of the Iraqi Interim Government. His term as prime minister ended on 7 April 2005, after the selection of Islamic Dawa Party leader Ibrahim al-Jaafari by the newly elected transitional Iraqi National Assembly.

A former Ba&#x27;athist, Allawi helped found the Iraqi National Accord, which today is an active political party. In the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the INA provided intelligence about alleged weapons of mass destruction to MI6. Allawi has lived about half of his life in the UK. His wife and children still live in the UK for their security. He survived assassination attempts in 1978, in 2004, and on 20 April 2005.

Allawi&#x27;s first name is sometimes rendered as Iyad or Eyad.

== Allawi&#x27;s early life ==
Allawi was born in 1944 to a prominent Shiite merchant family; his grandfather helped to negotiate Iraq&#x27;s independence from Britain and his father was an Iraqi Member of Parliament. He became involved in Ba&#x27;athism at a young age and organized against the government of Abdul Karim Qassim. In the 1960s, he studied at medical school in Baghdad at Baghdad University. Previously, he had attended high school and college at Baghdad College, a Catholic, Jesuit high school and college. He obtained his master&#x27;s degree at University College in London and performed a residency at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. Allawi has three children, one of them, Hamza, studies in a school in Surrey. Allawi is related to Ahmed Chalabi, another prominent former exile who died in 2015, through Chalabi&#x27;s sister. Former minister of trade Ali Allawi is Chalabi&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son as well as Ayad Allawi&#x27;s cousin. The relationship between Chalabi and Allawi had been described as alternating between rivals and allies. In addition, Nouri Badran, interim Minister of Interior, is married to Iyad Allawi&#x27;s sister. He is also a cousin of Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi.

== Early political career ==

In 1971, he moved to London due to increasing differences with the Ba&#x27;ath party and in order to continue his medical education. He resigned from the Ba&#x27;ath party in 1975, &quot;having decided that Saddam was exerting too much control over it&quot;. Allawi himself states that he remained active in the international Ba&#x27;athist movement, but had no ties to the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi Regional Branch.

At first Saddam, then Iraq&#x27;s vice president, pressured Allawi, who was in contact with senior military and party officers that were increasingly critical of Saddam, to rejoin the Ba&#x27;ath Party. In 1978, friends told Allawi that his name was on a liquidation list. In February 1978 Allawi was awoken in bed one night by an intruder in his Surrey home, who proceeded to attack him with an axe. The intruder left, convinced that Allawi was dead as he lay in a pool of blood. He survived the attempted murder, and spent the next year in hospital recovering from his injuries. His first wife, Atour, was also wounded in the attack. It is presumed that the attack was an assassination attempt ordered by Saddam Hussein. He separated with his wife after mutual agreement.

== The Iraqi National Accord ==
While still recovering in hospital from the attack, Allawi started organising an opposition network to work against the government of Saddam Hussein. Through the 1980s he built this network, recruiting Iraqis while traveling as a businessman and for the UNDP.

In December 1990, Allawi announced the existence of the Iraqi National Accord (INA). Six years later, using disillusioned Ba&#x27;athists in the military and government, it mounted an unsuccessful coup in Baghdad. One of Allawi&#x27;s allies in the INA was Salah Omar Al-Ali, a former member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council and ambassador to the United Nations. The INA received open backing from the UK, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States. The group consisted mainly of former military personnel who had defected from Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq to instigate a military coup. Allawi established links and worked with the CIA in 1992 as a counterpoint to Chalabi, and because of the INA&#x27;s links in the Ba&#x27;athist establishment. It is alleged Allawi&#x27;s INA organised attacks in Iraq. This campaign never posed a threat to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule, but was designed to test INA&#x27;s capability to effect regime change. Though Saddam&#x27;s government claimed the attacks have caused up to 100 civilian deaths there are no true records of these statistics to date.

A military coup was planned for 1996, in which Iraqi generals were to lead their units against Baghdad and remove Saddam Hussein. The CIA supported the plot, code-named DBACHILLES, and added Iraqi officers that were not part of INA. The plan ended in disaster as it had been infiltrated by agents loyal to Saddam. US support was also questionable - requests by the CIA station chief in Amman for American air support were refused by the Clinton administration. Many participants were executed. Lands and factories belonging to the Allawi family were confiscated. Even their graveyard in Najaf was seized, although it was later returned. According to Allawi, his family lost $250M worth of assets. US support for INA continued, receiving $6 million in covert aid in 1996 and $5 million in 1995 (according to books by David Wurmser as well as Andrew and Patrick Cockburn).

The INA channelled the report from an Iraqi officer claiming that Iraq could deploy its supposed weapons of mass destruction within &quot;45 minutes&quot; to British Intelligence. This claim featured prominently in the &quot;September Dossier&quot; which the British government released in 2002 to gain public support for the Iraq invasion. In the aftermath of the war, the &quot;45 minute claim&quot; was also at the heart of the confrontation between the British government and the BBC, and the death of David Kelly later examined by Lord Hutton. Giving evidence to the Hutton Inquiry, the head of MI6 Richard Dearlove suggested that the claim related to battlefield weapons rather than weapons of mass destruction.

== Post-Saddam ==
Shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority (the &quot;CPA&quot;) was established by the occupying forces in order to administer the country until sovereignty could be restored. The CPA decided to establish a grouping of senior Iraqi politicians to carry out some administrative responsibilities, with a view to giving the occupation a more &quot;Iraqi face&quot;. This grouping was referred to as the Governing Council, and was made up of 25 Iraqis that were appointed by the CPA. Allawi was one of those selected to serve on the Governing Council, and held the position of Minister of Defence (although his real responsibilities in that regard were limited considering Iraq remained under occupation). He held the rotating presidency of the interim governing council during October 2003. In April 2004, Allawi reportedly resigned as head of the IGC security committee over concerns of US bombing in Fallujah, according to a letter published in INA&#x27;s newspaper.

In December 2003, he flew to CIA headquarters in Langley together with fellow INA official Nouri Badran to discuss detailed plans for setting up a domestic secret service. The agency was to be headed by Badran, a former Ba&#x27;athist who served Saddam as an ambassador until 1990, and, controversially, recruited several agents for Saddam&#x27;s Mukhabarat. When the Iraqi National Intelligence Service was set up in March 2004, its designated director was Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed al-Shehwani, another former Ba&#x27;athist exile with ties to INA.

== Interim Prime Minister ==

On 28 May 2004, Allawi was elected unanimously by the Governing Council to be the Interim Prime Minister of Iraq to govern the country beginning with the United States&#x27; handover of sovereignty (30 June 2004) until national elections, scheduled for early 2005. Although many believe the decision was reached largely on the advice of United Nations special envoy to Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Brahimi only endorsed him reluctantly after pressure from U.S. officials. (In response to a question about the role of the U.S. in Allawi&#x27;s appointment, Brahimi replied: &quot;I sometimes say, I&#x27;m sure he doesn&#x27;t mind me saying that, Bremer is the dictator of Iraq. He has the money. He has the signature. Nothing happens without his agreement in this country.&quot;) Two weeks later, Brahimi announced his resignation, due to &quot;great difficulties and frustration&quot;.
At the time of his nomination, Allawi was often described in the US mainstream media as a moderate Shia, a member of Iraq&#x27;s majority faith, chosen for his secular, national views. On 28 June 2004 (two days early), the U.S.-led coalition handed over power to Allawi and the Iraqi Interim Government, who were sworn in later that same day. After his interim government assumed legal custody of Saddam Hussein and re-introduced capital punishment, Allawi gave assurances that he would not interfere with the trial and would accept any court decisions. In an interview with Dubai-based TV station Al Arabiya he said: &quot;As for the execution, that is for the court to decide—so long as a decision is reached impartially and fairly.&quot;

Allawi&#x27;s government also wrote a new emergency regulation, which allows the executive branch to declare martial law, impose curfews and detain suspects. Paul Bremer&#x27;s aides said Allawi lacked the power to impose martial law, and Secretary of State Colin Powell warned that the U.S. would not support such a move. &quot;The last thing we want&quot;, says a senior U.S. official, &quot;is for the world to think we&#x27;re foisting a new strongman on Iraq&quot;. Though, in addition to the stick of martial law, the government planned to offer a carrot of a broad amnesty for insurgents who have taken up arms against the U.S.-led occupation forces. Allawi himself has made clear that his government will reach out to Iraqi insurgents who have fought the Coalition for &quot;patriotic motives&quot; while seeking to isolate and destroy foreign elements such as the network led by the Jordanian jihadist Musab al-Zarqawi. Allawi knew that both the Sunni insurgency and the one waged by supporters of Shiite firebrand Moqtada Sadr have significant popular support, while his own government has yet to win the loyalty of Iraqis. On 18 July, Iraqi militants offered a $285,000 reward for anyone who could kill Iyad Allawi.

During the summer of 2004, Allawi made several decisions seen as controversial at the time, but later worked in his interest as they demonstrated to Iraqis that Allawi did not favour one sect over another, and that he was a strong leader not afraid to use force to bring back the rule of law. Most notably, his decision to support the military incursions of both Najaf and Falluja made him extremely unpopular amongst some Iraqis at the time. He also announced the creation of General Security Directorate, a domestic spy agency, whose main role is to counteract terrorist groups and the Iraqi insurgency.

Allawi led the Iraqi National Accord during the January 2005 Iraqi election. His campaign was mainly characterised by his attempt to combat the character assassination that was led by Iranian-sponsored groups. His campaign suffered when he visited the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf on 4 December 2004, where an unknown group attacked him. Allawi claimed that it was an assassination attempt.

The INA came in at third place in the first elections, with 14% of the vote, which on a party versus coalition makes him head one of the largest represented parties. In the 2010 elections, Allawi&#x27;s list won the most votes and beat incumbent Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki by 2 seats.

===Assassination attempt===
On 3 December 2004 Rafik Yousef and two other men, all members of Ansar al-Islam were arrested, and later convicted, of planning to assassinate Allawi.

In one tape in August 2004, a speaker identified as Abu Anas al-Shami (second man of Zarqawi and leader of Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad made up mostly by foreigners) said the militants planned to kill Iraqi prime minister Ayad Allawi, soldiers and police officers.

== Post-Prime Ministership ==
In preparation for the next parliamentary elections that took place in Iraq in December 2005, Allawi formed an alliance between many groups, including secular Sunni and Shia groups and the Iraqi Communist Party under one electoral list (the Iraqi National List).

The Iraqi National List was represented in the coalition government led by Nouri al-Maliki, but Allawi himself did not take a Cabinet post. The party eventually boycotted the government in 2007. In preparation for upcoming national elections, Allawi formed a new coalition with leading Shia politician Iskander Witwit (one of the leaders of the 1991 uprising against Saddam), Shia tribal Sheikh Hussein al-Shalan, the deputy Prime Minister Rafi al-Issawi, Sunni politician Saleh Mutlaq and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi called the Iraqi National Movement.

The 2010 parliamentary election ended with a weeks-long wait for an announcement of results by the Iraqi election commission. When the results finally came on 26 March 2010, Allawi&#x27;s Iraqiya bloc was declared the biggest winner of the parliamentary election with two seats more than Allawi&#x27;s rival al-Maliki&#x27;s party in the Assembly.

He was appointed one of the three Vice Presidents of Iraq by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on 8 September 2014. On 11 August 2015, the Parliament approved a reform package by Prime Minister al-Abadi that foresaw, among other measures, the elimination of the three vice president posts. However, following a lawsuit filed by fellow Vice President Usama al-Nujayfi, al-Maliki declared in September 2015 that he was still holding his office because removing the post was not in line with the Iraqi Constitution. Osama al-Nujaifi filed a complaint against the decision in November 2015, calling it unconstitutional. On 10 October 2016, the three posts of Vice Presidents were restored by the Supreme Court of Iraq which termed their abolition unconstitutional.

Allawi stated on 17 April 2017, that he had received information from Iraqi and regional contacts knowledgeable about Iraq that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group was in talks with al-Qaeda about a possible alliance. He added that even if the group lost all of its territory, its insurgency in the form of sleeper cells will continue.

Allawi stated that &quot;the Iraqi people are longing for the days of Saddam Hussein&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Allawi allegedly has faced several assassination attempts in England and throughout the Middle East, purportedly by agents of Saddam&#x27;s regime.

According to Mossack Fonseca documents that came to light in the Panama Papers release by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2016, Allawi had Mossack Fonseca supply a nominee director to stand in for him and shield his ownership of the Panama-registered company IMF Holdings. This company was dissolved in 2013; it had owned a $1.5 million house near London. A second offshore, Moonlight Estates, registered in the British Virgin Islands, also held a property in London on his behalf. His media contact confirmed his sole ownership of the two companies and of Foxwood Estates as well, saying IMF was set up to own real estate for security reasons based on legal advice following an assassination attempt, and added that any income from the properties was reported, and taxes paid &quot;promptly and on time&quot;.

He is cousin of Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi.

<text>Mowaffak Baker al-Rubaie (alternative transliterations Muwaffaq al Rubaie and Muwaffaq al-Rubay&#x27;i) () is an Iraqi politician, and was Iraq National Security Advisor in the government of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and in 2005–2006 Prime Minister Ibrahim Al Jaafari and 2006–2009 Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. He was elected to the Iraqi Council of Representatives in December 2005 as a nominee of the United Iraqi Alliance and from 2014–2018 in the Iraqi Parliament.

A Shia Muslim and neurologist by training, al-Rubaie was born 24 June 1948 in Dhi Qar Governorate in southern Iraq and left Iraq in 1979 to study in Britain. There he became a member of the British Royal College of Physicians and then a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians practicing internal medicine and neurology. Whilst in London, he became the official spokesman for the Islamic Da&#x27;awa Party which was then the main political opposition party to then President Saddam Hussein.

After the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq, he was appointed a member of the Iraqi Governing Council. In April 2004 he was appointed National Security Advisor by the Iraqi Governing Council. He held this post until 2009, thereafter serving as an MP in the following Parliamentary round.

Al-Rubaie played an important role in various negotiations, especially those between the Iraqi government and Moqtada al-Sadr during the siege of Najaf in 2004.

In 2006, al-Rubaie was widely credited with his humane treatment of the condemned Saddam Hussein, as he conducted the transfer of custody of the prisoner from US to Iraqi judicial authorities culminating in the execution of Saddam on 30 December 2006. In an interview with Vice News in December 2019, al-Rubaie displayed a noose he purported was the one used to hang Hussein, and claimed he &quot;pulled the trigger&quot; to kill the former dictator.

==Reputation==
Al-Rubaie is respected on both sides of the sectarian divide in Iraq as a pragmatic and non-partisan Nationalist whom current Deputy PM Ali Allawi gives high praise in his book &quot;The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace&quot; (2007).

A winner of the Annual Middle East Peace Prize awarded by the Foundation For Peace &amp; Democracy in the Middle East for his role in protecting Iraq&#x27;s Christian Minority, Al-Rubaie maintains good relations with Bishop Andrew White, the Canon of Baghdad.

Al-Rubaie also maintains strong relations with Iraq&#x27;s clerical community, particularly Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In February 2004, he reported that Sistani had survived an assassination attempt.

==Trip to USA==
In May, 2007, he made his first trip to Washington, D.C., to lobby leading Democratic critics of the war against withdrawing troops, primarily Senator Carl Levin and Representative John P. Murtha. al-Rubaie argued that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was making progress in stabilizing Iraq and that the United States should be patient as Iraqis make steady progress. He also met with supporters of the war, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.

<text>Abdel-Karim Mahoud al-Mohammedawi was a member of the Interim Iraq Governing Council created following the United States&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq. A Shia Muslim, al-Mohommedawi led the resistance against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government in the southern marsh regions of Iraq, where he gained the title &quot;Prince of the Marshes.&quot; He was imprisoned for six years under the Hussein regime and currently leads the Iraqi political group Hezbollah in Amarah.

After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, he organised a militia in Maysan governorate which prevented looting. These militia later joined the Maysan police. His brother was appointed governor of Maysan. In 2004 he was criticised when six unemployed demonstrators were shot outside the governor&#x27;s house.

Hezbollah (Iraq) joined the United Iraqi Alliance coalition in the Iraqi legislative election of January 2005. He was the Trade Minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government from May 2005 until May 2006. His deputy, Jawad al-Bolani, was the Interior Minister of Iraq from 2006 to 2010.

Hezbollah has clashed violently with the Islamic Virtue Party which controlled the Basra Province until 2009.

<doc id="440297" wikidata="Q1541434" url="?curid=440297" title="Count of Wisborg">
<text>The Count of Wisborg (, , ) is a title of nobility granted by the Monarch of Luxembourg to some male-members of the Swedish royal family, including their spouses and descendants. Since 1892, the title has been borne by the male-line descendants of four Princes of Sweden who married without the consent of the King of Sweden, thereby losing their right of succession to the throne for themselves and their descendants, and had their royal titles prohibited.

The four former Princes of Sweden, after use of their titles no longer was allowed, assumed the surname of Bernadotte. In each case they were given the title of nobility &quot;Prince Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg&quot; by the reigning Grand Duke or Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The latter title (count or countess) was shared with the children of each prince, since subsequent generations in the male line were authorized to bear only the title &quot;Count of Wisborg&quot;, Bernadotte being recognized as their surname by birth. In some cases, this titulature has not been adhered to, usage of the style &quot;Count [Firstname] Bernadotte af Wisborg&quot; having been adopted by some of the descendants.

Their legitimate titles of nobility, however, have not been Swedish but Luxembourgish. In Sweden, none of these title holders were admitted to the Swedish House of Nobility. However, Prince Oscar was admitted in 1945 and his son Carl in 1963 as an honorary member of the &quot;Sveriges Ointroducerade Adels Förening&quot; (Association of the unintroduced nobility in Sweden), which brings together the bearers of non-Swedish titles living in Sweden.

==The original four Counts of Wisborg==

Four original princes of Sweden were admitted in the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and given the title &quot;Count of Wisborg&quot;:

===First creation (1892–present)===
* Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland (1859–1953), second son of King Oscar II of Sweden. He married morganatically and gave up his Swedish titles on March 15, 1888. He and his wife were invested with the new titles of Prince and Princess Bernadotte on their wedding day. It has never been determined if this was a Swedish title of nobility or another form of unofficial courtesy title (such as some later dynasty members have been given by Swedish kings). On 2 April 1892, named as &quot;Oscar Prince Bernadotte&quot;, he was also given a hereditary title as Count of Wisborg by his uncle Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, previously Duke of Nassau. Oscar&#x27;s mother, Queen Sofia of Sweden, was a half-sister of Grand Duke Adolphe. The choice of the &quot;Wisborg&quot; title was because Oscar was formerly Duke of Gotland and the castle of Visborg (then spelled &quot;Wisborg&quot;) is in Gotland.

===Extended creation (1951–present)===
* Prince Lennart, Duke of Småland (1909–2004), only son of Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland and a grandson of King Gustaf V of Sweden. He married morganatically and had his Swedish titles prohibited on March 11, 1932. He was given the same titles as his granduncle Oscar by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951. Lennart styled himself in no other language than German, and then as &quot;Prof. Dr. h.c. mult. Lennart Graf Bernadotte af Wisborg (Professor and multiple honorary doctor Lennart Count Bernadotte of Wisborg)&quot;.
* Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland (1907–2002), second son of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. He married morganatically and had his Swedish titles prohibited on March 8, 1934. He was given the same titles as his cousin Lennart simultaneously by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951. On May 28, 1983 Sigvard in Sweden formally announced his title as &quot;Prince Sigvard Bernadotte&quot;. His nephew King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has consistently declined to respond and his court has refused to use that title for his uncle.
* Prince Carl Johan, Duke of Dalarna (1916–2012), fourth son of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. He married morganatically and relinquished his Swedish titles on February 19, 1946. He was ennobled just as his brother Sigvard by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg on July 2, 1951. He was the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. 

A fifth prince of Sweden, Prince Carl, Duke of Östergötland (1911–2003), only son of Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland and grandson of King Oscar II, married morganatically and relinquished his Swedish titles in 1937. He was given the title &quot;Prince Bernadotte&quot; by his brother-in-law King Leopold III of Belgium. His male-line descendants would have borne the title &quot;Count Bernadotte&quot;, but in fact his only child is a daughter (Mrs. Madeleine Kogevinas, Countess Madeleine Bernadotte).

== Later title-holders ==

The agnatic (male-line) descendants of each of these four former princes of Sweden, after the first generation of children, are entitled to the title &quot;Count of Wisborg&quot;, but in practice, their surname is often included in the title, &quot;Count Bernadotte af Wisborg&quot;.

The most well-known is Folke Bernadotte, a son of Oscar Bernadotte, the first Count of Wisborg. He was the United Nations Security Council mediator in the Arab–Israeli conflict of 1947–1948, assassinated in 1948 by Zionist militants.

A number of members of these families were guests at the 2010 Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling.
* Marianne Bernadotte, widow of Sigvard.
* Count Michael Bernadotte af Wisborg (son of Sigvard), his wife Countess Christine Bernadotte af Wisborg and their daughter Countess Kajsa Bernadotte af Wisborg.
* Carl Johan Bernadotte (above, son of King Gustaf VI Adolf) and his wife Gunnila Bernadotte.
* Countess Bettina Bernadotte af Wisborg (daughter of Lennart) and her husband Philipp Haug.
* Count Björn Bernadotte af Wisborg (son of Lennart) and his wife Countess Sandra Bernadotte af Wisborg.
* Count Bertil Bernadotte af Wisborg (son of Folke) and Countess Jill Bernadotte af Wisborg.

<text>The genus Glycera is a group of polychaetes (bristle worms) commonly known as bloodworms. They are typically found on the bottom of shallow marine waters, and some species (e.g. common bloodworms) can grow up to in length.

Although both are visually-similar and commonly-used as fishing bait, bloodworms are biologically-distinct from lugworms.

==Anatomy==
Bloodworms have a creamy pink color, as their pale skin allows their red body fluids that contain haemoglobin to show through. This is the origin of the name &quot;bloodworm&quot;. At the &#x27;head&#x27;, bloodworms have four small antennae and small fleshy projections called parapodia running down their bodies. Bloodworms can grow up to in length.

Bloodworms are carnivorous. They feed by extending a large proboscis that bears four hollow jaws. The jaws are connected to glands that supply venom which they use to kill their prey, and their bite is painful even to a human. They are preyed on by other worms, bottom-feeding fish, crustacea, and gulls.

Reproduction occurs in midsummer, when the warmer water temperature and lunar cycle among other factors triggers sexually mature worms to transform into a non-feeding stage called the epitoke. With enlarged parapodia, they swim to the surface of the water where both sexes release gametes, and then die.

The first stage in many forms of bloodworm is a zooplanktonic stage followed by the benthic instar where the familiar segmented red larvae develop protected by silk tubes made in the bottom silt. These larvae progress from tiny pale opaque worms to the larger red larvae of in length or longer over a period as short as 2–3 weeks in optimum conditions.

These animals are unique in that they contain a lot of copper without being poisoned. Their jaws are unusually strong since they too contain the metal in the form of a copper-based chloride biomineral, known as atacamite, in crystalline form. It is theorized that this copper is used as a catalyst for its venomous bite. In &quot;Glycera dibranchiata&quot;, the jaws are a composite of melanin and 10% copper.

<doc id="440307" wikidata="Q4907482" url="?curid=440307" title="History of the Latter Day Saint movement">
<text>The Latter Day Saint movement is a religious movement within Christianity that arose during the Second Great Awakening in the early 19th century and that led to the set of doctrines, practices, and cultures called &quot;Mormonism&quot;, and to the existence of numerous Latter Day Saint churches. Its history is characterized by intense controversy and persecution in reaction to some of the movement&#x27;s doctrines and practices and their relationship to mainstream Christianity (see Mormonism and Christianity). The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the different groups, beliefs, and denominations that began with the influence of Joseph Smith.

The founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was Joseph Smith, who was raised in the burned-over district of Upstate New York. Smith stated that, in response to prayer, he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, as well as angels and other visions. This eventually led him to a restoration of Christian doctrine that, he said, was lost after the early Christian apostles were killed. In addition, several early leaders made marked doctrinal and leadership contributions to the movement, including Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Brigham Young. Modern-day revelation from God continues to be a principal belief of the Mormon faith.

Mormon history as an academic field is called Mormon studies.
==Movement&#x27;s historical context==
===Second Great Awakening and the Charismatic Movement===
The Latter Day Saint movement arose in the Palmyra and Manchester area of western New York, where its founder Joseph Smith was raised during a period of religious revival in the early 19th century called the Second Great Awakening, a Christian response to the secularism of the Age of Enlightenment which extended throughout the United States, particularly the frontier areas of the west.

A significant early event in this Second Great Awakening was the Cane Ridge Revival, a large camp meeting that took place in 1801 at Cane Ridge, Kentucky. Joseph Smith&#x27;s father Joseph Smith Sr. said he had several visions or dreams, as had Smith&#x27;s paternal and maternal grandfathers.

The people of western New York, like the rest of the United States at the time, were also influenced by folk religion. The fathers of both Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were reported to have used divining rods, though not by those within the LDS church. Joseph Smith used seer stones, which he used after his claimed First Vision. People of the time used such rods and stones in various ways, including to locate underground water, to find lost items, to locate buried treasure or mineral mines, as part of religious or magic rituals, or to communicate with spirits or angels. Until about the 1830s, the use of such divining media, even as a profession, was thought by many, though not all, as &quot;honorable and profitable employment&quot;. (&quot;Palmyra Herald&quot;, July 24, 1822)

Another related strand of religious thought that became important to the Latter Day Saint movement was the Restoration Movement, primarily influenced by Barton W. Stone (who participated in the Cane Ridge revival), and Alexander Campbell, who joined Stone in 1824 in Ohio. Stone and Campbell believed that the division among Christian sects had been caused by a Great Apostasy (or falling away) from the original teachings of Jesus, and that the correct principles of Christianity could be re-established by &quot;restoring&quot; practices described in the New Testament. The Restorationists also intended to eliminate sectarianism, arguing that there should be only one Christian church, which should be called the &quot;Church of Christ.&quot;

While these restorationist ideas were circulating in the western frontier, the family of Joseph Smith was living in western New York, where they attended many of the local revivals. During this time, the area was seeing so many Christian revivals that western New York&#x27;s most well-known revivalist Charles Grandison Finney later dubbed the area the &quot;Burned-Over District&quot;. Because of a lack of clergy from established churches, this area was unusually open to religious innovations, new movements, and social experiments such as religious communism.

Latter Day Saints do not typically distinguish between this Restoration movement and the broader Protestant Reformation, since both were an attempt to return to the values and doctrines taught by Jesus and the Apostles, while most Latter Day Saint groups believe that there was a need for God to actively restore both authority and doctrine. However, in spite of their different use of the word &quot;restoration&quot;, this movement was an important part of the culture that led Joseph Smith to become interested in religion.

===Masonic influences===

Joseph Smith and several of the church founders were Freemasons, and were founding members of a lodge in Nauvoo, Illinois in March 1842. There are some similarities between Mormon temple worship and symbolism and the stories and symbols of Freemasonry. In modern times, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) holds no position for or against the compatibility of Masonry with LDS Church doctrine.

==Leadership of Joseph Smith==

===Smith&#x27;s First Vision===
Most Latter Day Saints trace the beginnings of Mormonism to Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Vision, which he said he had in about 1820 in the woods near his home. Early accounts of this vision describe it as a vision of Jesus in which he was told his sins were forgiven. Later, more detailed accounts indicate Smith was also told that all Christian denominations had become corrupt and further clarify that Smith saw multiple heavenly beings, including Jesus and God the Father.

===Early visits by angels, Urim and Thummim, and the Book of Mormon===

Smith also described many other visions involving angels. Some of his earliest visitations involved a Nephite prophet-warrior, who called himself Moroni. Smith said this angel appeared to him many times, and showed him where to find a set of buried Golden Plates containing ancient writings that the prophet-warrior had sealed in a stone box before his death, together with other artifacts. The writings on the Golden Plates, according to Smith, contained an account of the various nations that inhabited ancient America, and described how they were led to the New World by Jesus, but eventually lost their Christian faith through a series of wars and corruption.

After he said he received the Golden Plates, Smith began to dictate their translation to his wife Emma Hale Smith and various associates of his, including Martin Harris and, for most of the later translation, Oliver Cowdery. Smith said he translated the text through the gift and power of God and through the aid of the Urim and Thummim, or seer stone. The resulting writings were published in March 1830 as the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;.

The &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; was much more ambitious than being just a purported history of Native Americans. Mormons quickly adopted the book as a work of scripture of similar importance to the Bible. The book&#x27;s title page described it as an attempt to show Native Americans &quot;what great things the Lord has done for their fathers&quot;, and to convince &quot;Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.&quot; (Book of Mormon, title page.) The book contained doctrinal discussions on numerous themes, including how the pride of the wealthy leads to the downfall of civilization, the dangers of &quot;secret combinations&quot; of people who meet secretly and use secret signs and oaths &quot;to carry out the evil purposes of the group&quot;, and God&#x27;s mercy and protection over his followers. Latter Day Saints consider the crowning moment of the book to be Jesus&#x27; visit to the ancient Americans, during which time he teaches them in person about the meaning of his death and resurrection.

===Shared experiences by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and restoration of the priesthood===
Some of the early movement&#x27;s most important charismatic experiences were shared between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who joined the movement during the translation of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;. During the translation of the Golden Plates, Smith and Cowdery determined that they needed to obtain the Priesthood, or the authority to act in God&#x27;s name, which they believed had been lost from the earth during the Great Apostasy. According to an account by Cowdery in 1834, they went into the woods near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on May 15, 1829, were visited by an angel who gave them the &quot;Holy Priesthood&quot;. (Messenger and Advocate, 1(1), Oct. 1, 1834.) In 1835, Smith and Cowdery stated that the angel was John the Baptist, and that the &quot;Holy Priesthood&quot; was specifically the Priesthood of Aaron&quot;, which included the power to baptize. Today this area is preserved as the Aaronic Priesthood Restoration Site.

Smith and Cowdery further elaborated for the 1835 publication of the Doctrine and Covenants that they were also later visited by Peter, James, and John, who restored the &quot;keys of your ministry&quot; and the &quot;keys of the kingdom&quot;. Neither Smith nor Cowdery ever gave a date for this visitation.

===Organization of the Church of Christ===

After the restoration of the Priesthood, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery began baptizing dozens of people, as early as June 1829. (History of the Church 1:6, p. 59). These converts did not belong to a formal church organization. Nevertheless, this community of believers referred to themselves as &quot;the Church of Christ&quot;, and included converts in three New York towns: Fayette, Manchester, and Colesville.

There is no known record of an early Mormon concept of &quot;the Lord&#x27;s church&quot; prior to Smith&#x27;s translation of the Book of Mormon from April to June 1829. Some time in April 1829, Smith dictated a story of Alma the Elder, the former priest of a wicked king, who baptized his followers by immersion, &quot;having authority from the Almighty God&quot;, and called his community of believers the &quot;church of God, or the church of Christ&quot;.

Some time between June and December 1829, Joseph Smith, David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery said they received a revelation about &quot;how he should build up his church &amp; the manner thereof&quot;. This revelation was called the &quot;Articles of the Church of Christ&quot;, and it indicated that the church should ordain priests and teachers &quot;according to the gifts &amp; callings of God unto men&quot;. The church was to meet regularly to partake of bread and wine. Cowdery was described as &quot;an Apostle of Jesus Christ&quot;.

On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and a group of approximately 50 believers met to formally organize the Church of Christ into a legal institution. By later accounts, this meeting was a charismatic event, in which members of the congregation had visions, prophesied, spoke in tongues, ecstatically shouted praises to the Lord, and fainted (Joseph Smith History, 1839 draft). Also, the church formally ordained a lay ministry. Smith and Cowdery, according to their 1831 account, were each ordained as &quot;an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church&quot;. (&quot;Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ&quot;, &quot;Painesville Telegraph&quot;, April 19, 1831).

===Movement in Ohio===
The movement more than doubled in size with the conversion of Sidney Rigdon, a former Campbellite minister, who led several congregations of Restorationists in Ohio&#x27;s Western Reserve area, causing hundreds of his adherents to follow him into Mormonism. A fiery orator, Rigdon was called to be Smith&#x27;s spokesman, and immediately became one of the movement&#x27;s leaders. By 1831 the church&#x27;s headquarters were established in Kirtland, Ohio, and Smith urged the membership to gather there or to a second outpost of the church in Jackson County, Missouri (&quot;see below&quot;).

While based in Kirtland, the church changed its name to the &quot;Church of the Latter Day Saints&quot;, and added a number of new doctrines and leadership offices. An attempt to establish a communitarian economy known as the &quot;Law of Consecration&quot; was established in 1831. The Latter Day Saint understanding of the priesthood was elaborated by the separation of the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood offices from the lesser or Aaronic Priesthood offices and by the restoration of the Patriarchal Priesthood. Also established were the First Presidency, the High Council—later elaborated as the High Council of Zion, the Travelling High Council (or Quorum of the Twelve) and Stake high councils—Seventies, patriarchs, high priests, and bishops.

During the Kirtland era, many charismatic experiences were reported, many involving visitations of angels or communication from God through stones. However, some Church members claimed to receive revelations that contradicted those received by Joseph Smith. He and several followers prayed about the issue, and Joseph recorded a series of revelations, which included a description of several real spiritual gifts, a statement that only Joseph Smith, as the Prophet, could receive new doctrines and commandments for the Church, and a warning that not all supernatural experiences come from God. This effort to balance charismatic experience with order and stability became a lasting characteristic of the Latter Day Saint Movement.

Kirtland also was the site of the construction of the movement&#x27;s first temple. Latter Day Saints reported a great outpouring of spiritual experiences in connection with the Kirtland Temple&#x27;s dedication. The temple was associated with the Kirtland-era &quot;endowment&quot;, and with the temple ceremonies of &quot;foot washing&quot; and &quot;solemn assembly.&quot; The movement also established the &quot;School of the Prophets&quot; which met in the temple. At Kirtland, Smith reported many revelations including the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot;—advocating temperance and dietary restrictions. He acquired Egyptian papyrus scrolls which he said contained the writings of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham and Joseph. According to some reports, it was in Kirtland that Smith first began to practice the doctrine of plural marriage when he married Fanny Alger as his first plural wife in 1833.

In 1837 Smith and Rigdon founded an &quot;anti-bank&quot; called the Kirtland Safety Society. When it failed, some 300 of the Kirtland membership became disillusioned, including a third of the church leadership. The result was the movement&#x27;s first major schism. A new organization led by Smith&#x27;s former secretary, Warren Parish, along with Martin Harris and others, vied for control of the church in Kirtland. Re-establishing the original &quot;Church of Christ&quot; name, these &quot;reformed Latter Day Saints&quot; took possession of the temple and excommunicated Smith and Rigdon. Smith and Rigdon relocated to Missouri and were followed there by hundreds of loyalists in a trek known as the &quot;Kirtland Camp.&quot;

===Movement in Missouri===
As the church was gathering to Kirtland, a second gathering place was established 900 miles distant, on the frontier in Jackson County, Missouri. Joseph Smith had revealed to Latter Day Saints that they were to prepare &quot;the way of the Lord for his Second Coming&quot;, &quot;for the time is soon at hand that I shall come...&quot; (D &amp; C 34:6,7) He also revealed that the &quot;center place&quot; of the City of Zion would be near the town of Independence in Jackson County. (D &amp; C 57:3) Latter Day Saints began to settle the area to &quot;build up&quot; the City of Zion in 1831. Settlement was rapid and non-Mormon residents became alarmed that they might lose political control of the county to the Latter Day Saints. In October 1833, non-Mormon vigilantes succeeded in driving the Mormons from the county. Deprived of their homes and property, the Latter Day Saints temporarily settled in the area around Jackson County, especially in Clay County.

Years elapsed, and despite Mormon lawsuits and petitions, the non-Mormons in Jackson refused to allow the Mormons to return. Meanwhile, new converts to Mormonism continued to migrate to Missouri and settle in Clay County. In 1836, the Missouri legislature created Caldwell County specifically for Mormon settlement and Missouri branches of the church gathered there, centering on the town of Far West.

====Church headquarters established in Far West====
In 1838 Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and their loyalists left the former church headquarters of Kirtland and relocated to Far West, Missouri. A brief leadership struggle left the former heads of the Missouri portion of the church excommunicated, such as David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, William Wines Phelps and others. Years later, many of this group of &quot;dissenters&quot; became part of the Whitmerite schism in the Latter Day Saint movement.

While the church was headquartered in Far West, Smith announced revelations that changed the name of the church to the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&quot; and initiated the &quot;Law of Tithing.&quot; Conflicts with non-Mormon settlers arose as the church began to plant colonies in the counties surrounding Caldwell. These escalated into what has been called the 1838 Mormon War. The perceived militant attitude adopted by the church caused some leaders, including Thomas B. Marsh, president of the Quorum of the Twelve, to break with Smith and Rigdon. This precipitated another schism which led to the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ, the Bride, the Lamb&#x27;s Wife by George M. Hinkle, who had been the Mormon commander of the Caldwell County militia.

As a result of the war, 2,500 Missouri militia troops were called out to put down the Mormon &quot;rebellion.&quot; Smith and other church leaders were imprisoned in Liberty, Missouri and the majority of the Latter Day Saints were deprived of their property and expelled from the state.

===Movement in Illinois===
With the help of sympathetic non-Mormons in Illinois, in the spring of 1839 the Latter Day Saint refugees regrouped and began to establish a new headquarters in Nauvoo. Smith and other leaders were allowed after several months of harsh treatment to escape Missourian custody, and they rejoined the main body of the movement in April, 1839. In 1841, construction began on a new temple, significantly more elaborate than the one left behind in Kirtland. The Nauvoo city charter authorized independent municipal courts, the foundation of a university and the establishment of a militia unit known as the &quot;Nauvoo Legion.&quot; These and other institutions gave the Latter Day Saints a considerable degree of autonomy.

Nauvoo saw the final flowering of Joseph Smith&#x27;s vision for the movement, including some of Mormonism&#x27;s more controversial practices. It was here that Smith introduced Baptism for the dead, Rebaptism, the Nauvoo-era Endowment, and the ordinance of the Second Anointing. In addition, he created a new inner council of the church—containing both men and women—called the Anointed Quorum. Although, according to some reports, Smith himself had been secretly practicing what he later called plural marriage for some time, in Nauvoo he began to teach other leaders the doctrine.

In March 1844, Smith was said by William Law to have organized a secret council of the church called the &quot;Council of the Kingdom&quot;. Practices of this council included acclaiming Joseph Smith as &quot;Prophet, Priest, and King&quot; in addition to polygamy. These secrets were threatened to be released in a newspaper called the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;. Smith, acting in his capacity as mayor and head of the municipal court, responded by having the newspaper declared a &quot;public nuisance&quot; and by ordering the destruction of the press.

===Death of Joseph Smith===
Whenever Latter Day Saints gathered in large numbers, they met with opposition from neighbors who suspected that Mormon bloc-voting would lead to theocracy. By the mid-1840s, many non-Mormons in Hancock County felt threatened by growing Mormon political power, commercial rivalries, and a new religion with at least two elements that were hard to digest in the religious community of that time: first, Latter Day Saints had a somewhat different perspective on the nature of God from traditional Protestants; second, the claim of modern revelation, together with the claim of new scripture, opened the canon of the Bible.

Smith&#x27;s destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot; exacerbated all these fears and non-Mormons throughout Illinois began to clamor for his arrest. When Smith submitted to imprisonment in the county seat of Carthage, the Governor of Illinois, Thomas Ford, left the jail, taking the only impartial local militia unit with him. With the jail being guarded only by two guards and a unit of anti-Mormon militiamen, the Carthage Greys, a mob of disbanded militia units, attacked without resistance. Joseph and his brother Hyrum were killed.

All men who were tried for the murders were acquitted after the prosecuting attorney dismissed the testimonies of the state&#x27;s witnesses suddenly in his closing remarks.

==Change in leadership==
===Succession Crisis of 1844===
In the months following Smith&#x27;s murder, it was not immediately clear who would lead the church. His brother, Hyrum, who was Assistant President of the Church, (and as such would have been Smith&#x27;s natural successor) had died with him. Another Smith brother who may have been a presumed successor should both Hyrum and Joseph die, Samuel, died a month later. Before Brigham Young could return to Nauvoo and stake his claim, another Smith brother, William was also considered as a potential successor. Other men who (by some reports) were designated as successors, including Book of Mormon witnesses David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, had been excommunicated from the church.

As a result, three of the principal claimants on the scene were:

* Sidney Rigdon, the only remaining member of the First Presidency—the church&#x27;s highest executive council before his excommunication.
* The (Presiding) High Council of Nauvoo—the church&#x27;s highest legislative and judicial council—led by William Marks.
* The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—the council in charge of the church&#x27;s missionary program—led by Brigham Young.

Smith&#x27;s widow, Emma, wanted Marks to become church president, but Marks believed that Rigdon had the superior claim.

In a general meeting of the church at Nauvoo on August 8, 1844, Rigdon and Young presented their respective cases. As the only surviving member of the First Presidency (who had not officially apostatized), Rigdon argued that he should be made &quot;guardian&quot; of the church. Young argued that without Smith there, there was no presiding authority higher than the Twelve. Therefore, he proposed that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles be constituted as the new presiding authority. A vote of the congregation overwhelmingly supported Young&#x27;s proposal, said to have been caused by Brigham briefly yet miraculously having the &quot;voice and countenance of Joseph Smith&quot; during his talk. Soon after, Rigdon left Nauvoo and established his own church organization in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Rigdon, Young and Marks were later joined by a fourth claimant, James J. Strang of Voree, Wisconsin, who claimed that Smith had sent him a letter designating him as his successor. However, Strang had only recently joined the church, and lacked name-recognition among the rank-and-file Mormons in Nauvoo. Though he would manage to attract a sizable following, his assassination in 1856 all but extinguished his sect.

===Further schisms and the &quot;Mormon War in Illinois&quot;===
With Rigdon&#x27;s flight, Young and most of the Twelve Apostles assumed control of church headquarters in Nauvoo. A conflict with Joseph Smith&#x27;s last surviving brother, William, was a factor that led the remaining members of the Smith family to break with the Twelve. Many (though not all) initially followed Strang, though all later left Strang&#x27;s organization and joined themselves to the nascent Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which coalesced in the early 1860s around Joseph Smith&#x27;s eldest son, Joseph Smith III.

Meanwhile, at Nauvoo, the conflict between Mormons and non-Mormons escalated into what is sometimes called the &quot;Mormon War in Illinois.&quot; Latter Day Saints in outlying areas were driven from their homes and gathered to Nauvoo for protection. The Illinois state legislature voted to revoke Nauvoo&#x27;s charter and the city began to operate extra-legally. At about this time, Nauvoo&#x27;s population peaked; it may have had as many as 12,000 inhabitants (and several nearly as large suburbs), rivaling Chicago, Illinois, whose 1845 population was about 15,000, and its suburbs. However, by the end of 1845, it became clear that no peace was possible, and Young and the Twelve negotiated a truce so that the Latter Day Saints could prepare to abandon the city. The winter of 1845-46 saw the enormous preparations for the Mormon Exodus across the Great Plains.

===Major divisions===
The largest group of Latter Day Saints followed nine of the Twelve Apostles west, establishing a way station at Winter Quarters, Nebraska in 1846, and entering Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Having planted this initial colony in the Great Basin, Young returned to Winter Quarters and in December 1847 reorganized his faction of the church, establishing himself as the head of a new First Presidency. This reorganization led to additional schisms, including the break with Alpheus Cutler and what became the Church of Christ (Cutlerite) as well as Lyman Wight&#x27;s group in Zodiac, Texas. Young&#x27;s organization today, the LDS Church, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. (&quot;See&quot; History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)

The bulk of Sidney Rigdon&#x27;s church had dissolved by 1847, but some loyalists reorganized as The Church of Jesus Christ under the leadership of William Bickerton in 1862. James J. Strang&#x27;s church in Voree suffered a significant schism in 1849, led by former follower Aaron Smith. After Strang&#x27;s 1856 assassination, much of the remaining membership fell away from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), but a small following remained loyal. Other leaders, including David Whitmer, James Collin Brewster, James Emmett, Gladden Bishop, William Smith, and Charles B. Thompson also established church organizations that had limited followings.

Joseph Smith&#x27;s family—including his widow, Emma Hale Smith, and her children—continued to live in Nauvoo after the departure of the majority of the Latter Day Saints. In 1860, the eldest of the Smith sons, Joseph Smith III, said he received a revelation to take his place as Prophet/President of a &quot;New Organization&quot; of the Latter Day Saint church. This group had gathered together many of the remnants of the various Midwestern Latter Day Saint groups into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now called the Community of Christ. This has continued to be the second largest Latter Day Saint group, with headquarters on a portion of the original Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri.

Others remained unaffiliated, however, and in 1863 a group of Latter Day Saints from Illinois and Indiana united under the leadership of Granville Hedrick and reclaimed the name of the movement&#x27;s original organization, the &quot;Church of Christ.&quot; This group was the first group of Latter Day Saints to return to Independence, Missouri, to &quot;redeem Zion.&quot; They are now headquartered on portion of the original Temple Lot there and are known as the Church of Christ (Temple Lot).

==The Latter Day Saint movement today==

===Denominations===
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
By far the largest of the sects, with membership in the millions, the LDS Church continues to be led by Brigham Young&#x27;s successors. Young reorganized the First Presidency in 1847, and the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have continued the same succession pattern: when the Prophet dies, the senior Apostle becomes the head of the LDS Church. As of January 2018, Russell M. Nelson is the church president. Among other things, the LDS Church has become known for its proselyting and humanitarian work worldwide.

====Community of Christ====
The Community of Christ, known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS) until 2001, is the second largest group, with over 250,000 members. Joseph Smith&#x27;s descendants continued to serve as Prophet and President until the retirement of Wallace B. Smith in the early twenty-first century. Today the church is led by President/Prophet Stephen M. Veazey, who is no relation to Joseph Smith. While the Community of Christ is somewhat more in line doctrinally with mainline Protestantism, they also believe in the Book of Mormon and an open scriptural canon, and place great emphasis upon peacemaking and similar pursuits. The Community of Christ has ordained women to priesthood since 1985 and dedicated a temple in Independence, Mo., in 1994.

====Minor factions====
Other notable minor factions of the Latter Day Saint movement include: the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which owns the Temple Lot in Independence, Missouri; the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), founded by a member of Joseph Smith&#x27;s Council of Fifty; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), founded by James J. Strang in 1844; the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), founded by a follower of Sidney Rigdon in the early 1860s (and now the third-largest Latter Day Saint denomination); the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, founded in the 1940s by a man who claimed to be receiving revelations from John the Baptist; and the Restoration Branches, which broke with the Community of Christ in 1984 when the latter began ordaining women. In addition, several other Latter Day Saint factions continue to exist, some of which still practice polygamy.

===Important beliefs===

====Jesus Christ====
Latter Day Saints share a central belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. They accept his sacrifice as the only way to be saved. According to this movement&#x27;s theology, that is the central message of the scriptures.

====Revelation and scripture====
Latter Day Saints generally share an open canon. While different sects believe in different revelations, a central theme of the Latter Day Saint movement is that God always has more to say to the church, because the church&#x27;s situation is always changing.

Latter Day Saints believe in the Bible and other ancient scripture. However, the modern prophet is usually considered to be a more important source of revelation, because he receives contemporary (and, thus, more relevant) instructions from God.

====Priesthood authority====
Most Latter Day Saint sects believe that authority from Jesus Christ is necessary in order to baptize, give the gift of the Holy Ghost, or administer the Lord&#x27;s Supper (or the sacrament). This Priesthood authority can be traced to the day that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the Melchizedek Priesthood from Peter, James, and John, who received the Priesthood from Jesus himself.

====Zion====
Many of Joseph Smith&#x27;s early revelations prophesied that the Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a religious utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged his followers to give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church have come to understand Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, they will be able to build the literal city of Zion as well.

<text>The genus Paraphalaenopsis, abbreviated as Prphln in horticultural trade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae), consisting of 4 species endemic to Borneo and one natural (unconfirmed) hybrid, &quot;Paraphalaenopsis × thorntonii&quot; (&quot;P. denevei&quot; × &quot;P. serpentilingua&quot;). Named by American botanist Alex Drum Hawkes.

They are morphologically similar to &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; and were a long time considered as species of that genus. Their flowers are similar, but the leaves of &quot;Paraphalaenopsis&quot; are cylindrical and long (from 35 cm up to 3m in cultivation). This latter measurement belongs to the &quot;rat-tail orchid&quot; (&quot;P. labukensis&quot;) with a maximum length of 3.05 meters (ten feet); the greatest length of any orchid leaf. These leaves resemble the leaves of the Holcoglossum. These are epiphytes that bloom in early spring.

<doc id="440312" wikidata="Q2406479" url="?curid=440312" title="Hope (Klaatu album)">
<text>Hope is the second album by the Canadian rock band Klaatu and their first concept album. Released in September 1977, it won a Juno Award for &quot;Best Engineered Album&quot; and a Canadian Music Critics award for &quot;Best Album&quot; that same year. The album follows the loose concept of space travelers visiting a distant planet.

An alternate version of &quot;Hope&quot; was released in 2005 as part of the group&#x27;s &quot;Sun Set&quot; collection of rarities. The alternate version on &quot;Sun Set&quot; includes the complete contributions of the London Symphony Orchestra, which had largely been removed from the version released in 1977. The alternate version also includes a short unreleased track, &quot;Epilogue,&quot; which had originally been intended to be placed between &quot;So Said the Lighthouse Keeper&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Epilogue&quot; were printed on the inner sleeve for &quot;Hope&quot; despite the song being omitted from the album.

&quot;Hope&quot; was remastered and re-issued in 2012 by the band&#x27;s members, and was released on the band&#x27;s independent record label Klaatunes.

==Musical style==

A reviewer for Julian Cope&#x27;s Head Heritage described &quot;Hope&quot; as “an elaborate sci-fi prog opera, while an article in the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; described a “whimsical space-rock album”. Allmusic&#x27;s Mike DeGagne commented that the album was &quot;less pop-infused&quot; than the group&#x27;s previous album &quot;3:47 EST&quot;, and contained more &quot;progressive depth&quot; with an &quot;experimental sound&quot;. Peter Kurtz of the website felt that the album&#x27;s conceptual rock opera theme sounded &quot;pretentious, and in some cases like a rip-off of Queen&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the songs as ranging from &quot;fun light pop&quot; similar to 10cc, to &quot;theatrical melodramas&quot; similar to Queen, and to well-orchestrated ballads similar to the Moody Blues.

PopMatters described the song “Around the Universe in 80 Days” as a “powerful pop ballad” with a “gorgeous piano melody”, and a “fine example of effortless pop-rock craftsmanship”. It described “Prelude” as “an instrumental rock epic”.

== Artwork ==
Like the previous Klaatu album, the cover was painted by graphic artist Ted Jones. The cover shows &quot;the Lighthouse Keeper&#x27;s beam&quot;. The ruined stone plaza features the sun image from the cover of the previous Klaatu album.

==Track listing==

<text>Carlos Villagrán Eslava (born 12 January 1944) is a Mexican actor, comedian, and former journalist best known for playing Quico in the Televisa sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;.

==Life and career==
Villagrán started off as a photographer for the Mexico City newspaper &quot;El Heraldo&quot;, with this position leading him to become friends with screenwriter and future co-star Rubén Aguirre. Aguirre had been hired by Chespirito (Roberto Gómez Bolaños) to play the role of Professor Jirafales in the then upcoming &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; television series for Televisa. Aguirre held a party for family and friends at his house to celebrate, and Villagrán impressed him after expanding his cheeks out of proportion during one of the party&#x27;s comic steps. As a matter of a fact, that movement would later become a trademark of the character he&#x27;d play in &quot;El Chavo.&quot;

Aguirre recommended Villagrán to Chespirito, and - impressed by the photographer - Villagrán was given the role of Quico, Chavo&#x27;s rival, in the show. He also appeared on Chespirito&#x27;s other hit show, &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;. Both of Chespirito&#x27;s shows became major international hits all over Iberoamerica, Spain, the United States and other countries, catapulting Villagrán into popularity.
Villagrán left the shows in 1978, for reasons never officially confirmed; speculation suggests it was because he and Chespirito were engaged in a legal battle over the rights of the Quico character. At that same time, Ramón Valdés also left the two shows. This marked the beginning of the end of active creating for both productions, although re-runs of the program continue to this day.

===After &quot;El Chavo&quot;===

Villagrán went to Venezuela, where he acted in various Radio Caracas Televisión shows: &quot;El niño de papel&quot; (1981), &quot;Kiko Botones&quot; (1981), &quot;Federrico&quot; (1982), &quot;Las nuevas aventuras de Federrico&quot; (1983), and &quot;El circo de monsieur Cachetón&quot; (1985). These were not successful as Chespirito&#x27;s productions had been in Mexico. He and Valdés were reunited in Mexico when production company Telerey hired them to make the short-lived television show &quot;¡Ah qué Kiko!&quot; for Imevisión. Chespirito was not able to prevent the name &quot;Kiko&quot;, with its different spelling, from being used in the new show. The show was successful for its first year until Valdés died of stomach cancer in 1988. For a brief time a local comic named Sergio Ramos was brought in as Don Cejudo to replace Valdés, but the show soon was taken off the air due to the difference in chemistry between the characters causing a decline in popularity.

Like many of his co-stars in the Chespirito shows, Villagrán went on to enjoy a circus career, touring with his &quot;El circo de Kiko&quot;.

Villagrán later did what his friend Aguirre had done before, moving to Argentina, where Chespirito had no rights over the character, and continued to play the role of his old character there.

===2000s and beyond===
On April 1st, 2000, in an &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; special which reunited all the actors from the series to honor the career of Chespirito (except Ramón Valdés, Angelines Fernández, Raúl Padilla, Horacio Gómez Bolaños, who had all passed prior to the special, and Ana Lilian de la Macorra, who was unable to attend), Villagrán and Chespirito saw each other for the first time in twenty-two years and reconciled their differences. However, communication between the two declined over time and it was believed that this supposed reconciliation was basically a publicity stunt. 

Villagrán made an appearance in 2004 on the Venezuelan game show &quot;La guerra de los sexos&quot;, portraying the role of Kiko in various games and helping the men&#x27;s team to victory. He would return to the program again a year later, this time in a loss to the women&#x27;s team.

Villagrán expressed regrets in a Facebook post upon Chespirito&#x27;s death in 2014; despite rumors spreading that the actor was banned from the event, Villagrán would later attend Chespirito&#x27;s wake to reconcile with the latter&#x27;s family.

In 2017, Villagrán starred in the Brazilian film adaptation of TV presenter Danilo Gentili&#x27;s &quot;Como se Tornar o Pior Aluno da Escola&quot; in the role of Ademar, the director of the school and antagonist of the film.

Villagrán controversially later returned to the role of Quico in late 2023 for a public service announcement produced by the United States Embassy in Mexico against illegal immigration.

==Personal life==
Villagrán has three sons and three daughters. In 2022, Villagrán confirmed that one of his daughters had overcome breast cancer.

In a 2013 interview with the Brazilian newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;, Villagrán proved to be insightful on his aging and his role, suggesting that he had been considering retirement:

&quot;I am 69 years old. Out of respect for the fans, I will stop competing with my worst enemy: the younger Kiko who appears on television every day. I can&#x27;t fight with him, as he doesn&#x27;t age and doesn&#x27;t like me! But the fans won&#x27;t be orphaned, the series will continue for those who want to watch. I will miss the audience and the laughter, it&#x27;s very beautiful!&quot;

On November 17th, 2023, Univision journalist Inés Moreno revealed that the actor would be going under treatment for prostate cancer.

<doc id="440317" wikidata="Q5510686" url="?curid=440317" title="Future Integrated Soldier Technology">
<text>The Future Integrated Soldier Technology (or FIST), sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Future Infantry System Technology or Future Infantry Soldier Technology, is a project by the British Army which aims to enhance the infantry&#x27;s combat effectiveness in the 21st century as part of the Future Soldier project. The contract was awarded to Thales in March 2003.

The goal is to integrate a modular system of all equipment, weapons and their sighting systems, radios that the individual soldier carries or uses, in order to increase their overall effectiveness on the battlefield.

The programme is managed by the Dismounted Close Combat Integrated Project Team at Defence Equipment and Support, MoD Abbey Wood in Bristol.

==Subsystems==
A major complement of the FIST project is the &quot;Bowman&quot; communications system, which gives secure communications to the troops on the ground, allowing for simultaneous transmission of voice and data and having built-in GPS equipment, as well as sending visual information direct from personal cameras.

The kit aims to cover five main areas:
* Command and Control
* Lethality
* Mobility
* Survivability
* Sustainability

Command and Control is aimed to improve fire team and local commanders&#x27; awareness of the situation. Lethality is as the name suggests and includes new weapon systems such as the new NLAW and Javelin anti tank weapons and the new sights for the SA80. Mobility includes areas such as route planning and GPS locations, survivability includes armour and stealth and sustainability includes areas such as power supplies with the system aiming to run off new next generation power cells.

The Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) element of FIST was contracted to Thales to deliver a range of sights, target locators, periscopes and digital cameras in 2010–2014 at a cost of £150 million. They equip nearly 11,000 troops from all three services.

==Timescales==
The project aimed to deploy a suite of digitized weapon platforms by 2008. The first major trials of the FIST system were completed at the Salisbury Plain Training Area in January 2005, when 70 soldiers were equipped with the prototype FIST technology including GPS, communications and weapon sights, and compared to the effectiveness of 70 conventionally equipped soldiers. A further FIST V2 trial was scheduled for 2006.

35,000 sets of kit are expected to be bought and issued between 2015 and 2020. This equipment is designed to bring the British infantryman up to standards and link with new technology currently employed, including the new underslung grenade launcher for the SA80 and the deployed Bowman communications network. It is not intended that every soldier be equipped with FIST: instead unit commanders will request FIST kits as necessary so they can be tailored to the situation and mission aims.

As well as linking into the new technology for the soldier, it is designed to link in with other communications systems as well as the UK UAV project called Watchkeeper.

==Dismounted Situational Awareness==
In 2016, the MoD publicised plans to replace the existing Bowman with a system named Morpheus. Morpheus &quot;will deliver the next generation of Tactical Communication and Information Systems (TacCIS) capability. It will address critical system obsolescence and introduce a more agile TacCIS solution (both technical and business).&quot;. The element of Morpheus that handles communications for the infantry soldier is known as Dismounted Situational Awareness (DSA).

<doc id="440324" wikidata="Q600759" url="?curid=440324" title="J. J. C. Smart">
<text>John Jamieson Carswell Smart (16 September 1920 – 6 October 2012) was a British-Australian philosopher who was appointed as an Emeritus Professor by the Australian National University. He worked in the fields of metaphysics, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, and political philosophy. He wrote several entries for the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Cambridge, England, of Scottish parents, Smart began his education locally, attending The Leys School, a leading independent boarding school. His younger brothers also became professors: Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at Nottingham University; Ninian was a professor of religious studies and a pioneer in that field. Their father, William Marshall Smart, was John Couch Adams Astronomer at Cambridge University and later Regius Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow. In 1950, W. M. Smart was President of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1946, Jack Smart graduated from the University of Glasgow with an MA, followed by a BPhil from Oxford University in 1948. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, for two years.

Smart served in the Second World War with the British Army where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals on 9 October 1941 and given the service number 212091. His war service was mainly in India and Burma. He was demobilised in April 1946 and in 1950 was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant.

He arrived in Australia in August 1950 to take up the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Adelaide, which he occupied from 1950 until 1972. After twenty-two years in Adelaide, he moved to La Trobe University where he was Reader in Philosophy from 1972 to 1976. He then moved to the Australian National University where he was Professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1976 until his retirement in 1985, and where the annual Jack Smart Lecture is held in his honour. Following his retirement he was Emeritus Professor at Monash University.

Smart was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities at its establishment in 1969. In 1990 he was awarded the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia. In 1991 he was elected to become an honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and in 2010, elected to become an honorary Fellow of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

At first Smart was a behaviourist before becoming an early proponent of type identity theory.

==Metaphysics==
Smart&#x27;s main contribution to metaphysics is in the area of philosophy of time. He has been an influential defender of the B-theory of time, and of perdurantism.

His most important original arguments in this area concern the passage of time, which he claimed is an illusion. He argued that if time really passed, then it would make sense to ask at what rate it passes, but this requires some second time-dimension with respect to which passage of normal time can be measured. This in turn faces the same problems, and so there must be a third time-dimension, and so on. This is called the rate of passage argument and it was originally put forward by C. D. Broad.

Smart changed his mind about the nature and causes of the illusion of the passage of time. In the 1950s, he held that it was due to people&#x27;s use of anthropocentric temporal language. He later came to abandon this linguistic explanation of the illusion in favour of a psychological explanation in terms of the passage of memories from short-term to long-term memory.

==Philosophy of mind==
Regarding the philosophy of mind, Smart was a physicalist. In the 1950s, he was also one of the originators, with Ullin Place, of the mind–brain identity theory, which claims that particular states of mind are identical with particular states of the brain. Initially, this view was dubbed &quot;Australian materialism&quot; by its detractors, in reference to the stereotype of Australians as &quot;down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;unsophisticated&quot;.

Smart&#x27;s identity theory dealt with some extremely long-standing objections to physicalism by comparing the mind–brain identity thesis to other identity theses well known from science, such as the thesis that lightning is an electrical discharge, or that the morning star is the evening star. Although these identity theses give rise to puzzles such as Gottlob Frege&#x27;s puzzle of the Morning Star and Evening Star, in the scientific cases, some claim that it would be absurd to reject the identity theses on this ground. Since the puzzles facing physicalism are strictly analogous to the scientific identity theses, it would then also be absurd to reject physicalism on the grounds that it gives rise to these puzzles.

==Ethics==
In ethics, Smart was a defender of utilitarianism. Specifically, he defended &quot;extreme&quot;, or act utilitarianism, as opposed to &quot;restricted&quot;, or rule utilitarianism. The distinction between these two types of ethical theory is explained in his essay &quot;Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism&quot;.

Smart gave two arguments against rule utilitarianism. According to the first, rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because there is no adequate criterion on what can count as a &quot;rule&quot;. According to the second, even if there were such a criterion, the rule utilitarian would be committed to the untenable position of preferring to follow a rule, even if it would be better if the rule were broken, which Smart called &quot;superstitious rule worship&quot;.

Another aspect of Smart&#x27;s ethical theory is his acceptance of a preference theory of well-being, which contrasts with the hedonism associated with &quot;classical&quot; utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham. Smart&#x27;s combination of the preference theory with consequentialism is sometimes called &quot;preference utilitarianism&quot;.

Smart&#x27;s arguments against rule utilitarianism have been very influential, contributing to a steady decline in its popularity among ethicists during the late 20th century. Worldwide, his defence of act utilitarianism and preference theory has been less prominent but has influenced philosophers who have worked or been educated in Australia, such as Frank Jackson, Philip Pettit, and Peter Singer.

One of Smart&#x27;s two entries in &quot;The Philosophical Lexicon&quot; refers to his approach to the consequences of act utilitarianism: to &quot;outsmart&quot; an opponent is &quot;to embrace the conclusion of one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; argument.&quot; This move is more commonly called &quot;biting the bullet&quot;.

<text>Technical rescue is the use of specialised tools and skills for rescue, including but not limited to confined space rescue, rope rescue, trench rescue, structural collapse rescue, ice rescue, swift water rescue, underwater rescue, and cave rescue. These often require specialised rescue squads as they exceed the capabilities of other members of the fire service or emergency medical services (EMS).

In the United States, technical rescues will often have multiple jurisdictions operating together to effect the rescue, and will often use the Incident Command System to manage the incident and resources at the scene. National Fire Protection Association standards NFPA 1006 and NFPA 1670 state that all rescuers must have a minimum of first aid (infection control, bleeding control, shock management) and CPR training to perform any technical rescue operation, including cutting the vehicle itself during an extrication.

<doc id="440330" wikidata="Q1981083" url="?curid=440330" title="Free Trade Hall">
<text>The Free Trade Hall on Peter Street, Manchester, England, was constructed in 1853–56 on St Peter&#x27;s Fields, the site of the Peterloo Massacre. It is now a Radisson hotel.

The hall was built to commemorate the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The architect was Edward Walters. It was owned by the Manchester Corporation and was bombed in the Manchester Blitz; its interior was rebuilt and it was Manchester&#x27;s premier concert venue until the construction of the Bridgewater Hall in 1996. The hall was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1963.

==History==
The Free Trade Hall was built as a public hall between 1853 and 1856 by Edward Walters on land given by Richard Cobden in St Peter&#x27;s Fields, the site of the Peterloo Massacre. Two earlier halls had been constructed on the site, the first, a large timber pavilion was built in 1840, and its brick replacement built in 1842. The halls were &quot;vital to Manchester&#x27;s considerable role in the long campaign for the repeal of the Corn Laws. The hall was funded by public subscription and became a concert hall and home of the Hallé Orchestra in 1858. A red plaque records that it was built on the site of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819.

The Free Trade Hall was bought by Manchester Corporation in 1920; but was bombed and left an empty shell in the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. A new hall was constructed behind two walls of the original façade in 1950–51 by Manchester City Council&#x27;s architect, L. C. Howitt, opening as a concert hall in 1951. As well as being the venue for the Hallé Orchestra, it was also used for pop and rock concerts. A Wurlitzer organ from the Paramount Cinema in Manchester was installed over four years and first used in public in a BBC programme broadcast in September 1977. When the hall closed, the organ, which was on loan, was moved to the great hall in Stockport Town Hall. The Hallé Orchestra moved to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996 and the Free Trade Hall was closed by Manchester City Council.

In 1997, the building was sold to private developers despite resistance from groups such as the Manchester Civic Society, who viewed the sale as inappropriate given the historical significance of the building and its site. After the initial planning application was refused by the Secretary of State, a second modified planning application was submitted and approved. Walters&#x27; original façade was retained, behind which architects Stephenson Bell designed a 263-bedroom hotel, demolishing Howitt&#x27;s post-war hall but preserving the main staircase and the 1950s statues that were formerly attached to its rear wall. The hotel opened in 2004, having cost £45 million.

==Architecture==

The Italian palazzo-style hall was built on a trapeziform site in ashlar sandstone. It has a two-storey, nine-bay façade and concealed roof. On Peter Street, its ground floor arcade has rectangular piers with round-headed arches and spandrels bearing the coats of arms of Lancashire towns that took part in the Anti-Corn Law movement. The upper floor has a colonnaded arcade, its tympana frieze is richly decorated with carved figures representing free trade, the arts, commerce, manufacture and the continents. Above the tympanum is a prominent cornice with balustraded parapet. The upper floor has paired Ionic columns to each bay and a tall window with a pedimented architrave behind a balustraded balcony. The return sides have three bays in a matching but simpler style of blank arches. The rear wall was rebuilt in 1950–51 with pilasters surmounted by relief figures representing the entertainment which took place in the old hall. The Large Hall was in a classical style with a coffered ceiling, the walls had wood panelling in oak, walnut and sycamore.
Pevsner described it as &quot;the noblest monument in the Cinquecento style in England&quot;, whilst Hartwell considered it &quot;a classic which belongs in the canon of historic English architecture.&quot;

After its closure, the hall was sold and after a protracted planning process and consultations with English Heritage, its conversion to a hotel was agreed. During the hotel&#x27;s construction, the Windmill Street and Southmill Street facades were demolished and the north block retained and connected by a triangular glazed atrium to a 15-storey block clad in stone and glass. Artifacts salvaged from the old hall, including 1950s statues by Arthur Sherwood Edwards and framed wall plaster autographed by past performers, decorate the atrium light well.

==Events==

The Free Trade Hall was a venue for public meetings and political speeches and a concert hall. Charles Dickens performed here in the summer of 1857 in Wilkie Collins&#x27;s play &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot;. In 1872 Benjamin Disraeli gave his One Nation speech. In 1904, Winston Churchill delivered a speech at the hall defending Britain&#x27;s policy of free trade. &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most powerful and brilliant he has made.&quot;
In 1905 the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) activists, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were ejected from a meeting addressed by the Liberal politician Sir Edward Grey, who repeatedly refused to answer their question on Votes for Women. Christabel Pankhurst immediately began an impromptu meeting outside, and when the police moved them on, contrived to be arrested and brought to court. So began the militant WSPU campaign for the vote.

After Sir Charles Hallé founded the Hallé Orchestra in 1858, its home was the Free Trade Hall until the hall was damaged in the Manchester Blitz. The Hallé performed at the reopening in 1951 with the Orchestra&#x27;s musical director and conductor, Sir John Barbirolli, who remained until 1970. The final concert there was in 1996. Kathleen Ferrier sang at the re-opening of the Free Trade Hall in 1951, ending with a performance of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, the only performance of that piece in her career.

The following event is from a theatrical biography including details of pantomimes in the 1930s. &quot;Elisse De Vere and Sam Welbo were direct from the continent with a graceful act, a combination of dance and acrobatics. ... De Vere and Welbo husband and wife originated in Russia. They fled the pogroms. In England they were part of a bill, the chief part of which, was Hamilton&#x27;s Excursions, a diorama, or early form of cinema, utilising a screen. ... De Vere and Welbo operated this system when it was shown at the Manchester Free Trade Hall, as well as presenting their dance act in another part of the programme. One of their scenes worked on the Diorama - silent pictures - was Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Retreat from Moscow&quot; in their native Russia.&quot;

Bob Dylan played here in 1965, and again in 1966, the occasion of the &quot;Judas!&quot; shout. The famous bootleg that circulated from Dylan&#x27;s 1966 tour, which was incorrectly dubbed the &#x27;Royal Albert Hall&#x27; concert for years, was in fact the recording from the Manchester Free Trade Hall 1966 concert. This concert was eventually officially released in 1998 as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot;.
 Duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel played here in 1967, debuting their newly written song &#x27;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&#x27; with the original opening line of &quot;I wish I was a Kellog&#x27;s cornflake, floatin&#x27; in my bowl takin&#x27; movies&quot;, and a new song for upcoming film &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Mrs Robinson&quot;. In the late 1960s Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, The Moody Blues, T. Rex and The Dubliners played there amongst others. Pink Floyd played on five occasions. Genesis played twice, on 30 January 1971 (together with Lindisfarne and Van der Graaf Generator) and in February 1973. On 13 May 1976, Kiss played their first UK concert at the venue. On 4 June 1976, the Lesser Free Trade Hall was the venue for a concert by the Sex Pistols at the start of the punk rock movement. This concert would prove influential as it led to the formation of bands such as Joy Division, Buzzcocks, The Smiths and The Fall.

<doc id="440331" wikidata="Q2063381" url="?curid=440331" title="William Cushing">
<text>William Cushing (March 1, 1732 – September 13, 1810) was one of the original five associate justices of the United States Supreme Court; confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26, 1789, he served until his death. His Supreme Court tenure of 20 years and 11 months was the longest among the Court&#x27;s inaugural members. In January 1796, he was nominated by President George Washington to become the Court&#x27;s Chief Justice; though confirmed, he declined the appointment. He was the last judge in the United States to wear a full wig (Court dress).

==Early life and education==
Cushing was born in Scituate, Massachusetts Bay, on March 1, 1732. The Cushing family had a long history in the area, settling Hingham in 1638. Cushing&#x27;s father, John Cushing (1695–1778), was a provincial magistrate who in 1747 became an associate justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, the province&#x27;s high court. William Cushing&#x27;s grandfather John Cushing (1662–1737/38) was also a superior court judge and member of the governor&#x27;s council.

Cushing&#x27;s mother, Mary Cotton Cushing, was a daughter of Josiah Cotton (1679/80–1756). They were descended from Rev. John Cotton, the great 17th century Puritan theologian. Josiah Cotton and Richard Fitzgerald, a teacher at a local Latin school, were responsible for young Cushing&#x27;s early education.

Cushing graduated from Harvard College in 1751 and became a member of the bar of Boston in 1755. After briefly practicing law in Scituate, he moved to Pownalborough (present-day Dresden, Maine, then part of Massachusetts), and became the first practicing attorney in the province&#x27;s eastern district (as Maine was then known). In 1762 he was called to become a barrister, again the first in Maine. He practiced law until 1772, when he was appointed by Governor Thomas Hutchinson to replace his father (who had resigned) on the Superior Court bench.

==Career==
Not long after his tenure on the Massachusetts bench began, a controversy arose over revelations that court judges were to be paid by crown funds from London rather than by an appropriation of the provincial assembly. Cushing did not express any opinion on the matter, but declined the crown payment in preference to a provincial appropriation.

After the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress (which exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control over the province outside besieged Boston), sought to reorganize the courts to remove the trappings of British sovereignty. Consequently, it essentially dissolved the Superior Court and reformed it in November 1775. Of all its justices, Cushing was the only one retained.

The congress offered the seat of Chief Justice first to John Adams, but he never sat, and resigned the post in 1776. The provincial congress appointed Cushing to be the court&#x27;s first sitting Chief Justice in 1777. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1780). He would sit as Massachusetts Chief Justice until 1789, during which period the court ruled in 1783 that slavery was irreconcilable with the new state constitution, and it was ended in the state.

===Massachusetts chief justice===
In 1783, Cushing presided over a series of cases involving Quock Walker, a slave who filed a freedom suit based on the language of the new state constitution. In &quot;Commonwealth v. Jennison&quot;, Cushing stated the following principles, in his charge to the jury:

This was taken to mean that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution ratified in 1779, and that slavery was therefore ended in the state. The case relied on a 1781 freedom suit brought by slave Elizabeth Freeman, also known as Mum Bett, on the same grounds; a Massachusetts county court ruled in her favor in 1781.

During Shays&#x27; Rebellion (1786–87), Cushing ensured that court sessions continued, despite the aggressive protests of the armed rebels, and later presided over their trials. A year later, in 1788, he served as vice president of the Massachusetts convention, which narrowly ratified the United States Constitution.

===U.S. Supreme Court===
On September 24, 1789, President George Washington nominated Cushing for one of the five associate justice positions on the newly established Supreme Court. His appointment (along with those of: John Blair Jr.; Robert H. Harrison; John Rutledge; and James Wilson; plus that of John Jay for Chief Justice) was confirmed by the Senate two days later. Cushing&#x27;s service on the Court officially began February 2, 1790, when he took the Judicial oath. He generally held a nationalist view typically in line with the views of the Federalist Party, and often disagreed with Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republicans. His two most important decisions were probably &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; and &quot;Ware v. Hylton&quot;, which held that treaties made under the Constitution supersede state law. Though he served on the Court for two decades, only 19 of his decisions appear in the &quot;United States Reports&quot;.

Cushing administered the oath of office at Washington&#x27;s second inauguration on March 4, 1793. This was the first inauguration to take place in Philadelphia (then the nation&#x27;s capital). While a justice, Cushing ran as the Federalist nominee in the 1794 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, losing in a landslide to incumbent Samuel Adams.

When Chief Justice John Jay resigned from the Court in June 1795, during a long Senate recess, Washington appointed John Rutledge as the new chief justice by a recess appointment. On December 15, 1795, during the Senate&#x27;s next session, it rejected Rutledge&#x27;s nomination. Washington subsequently nominated Cushing on January 26, 1796; the Senate confirmed the nomination the following day.

Cushing received his commission on January 27, but returned it to Washington on February 2, declining appointment. An error in the rough minutes of the Court on February 3 and 4, 1796, lists Cushing as Chief Justice, although this entry was later crossed out. This error can be explained by the text of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which allowed for the Court to hear cases with a quorum of only four justices; that is, the Chief Justice need not always be present for the Court to conduct business. As Cushing was the most senior associate justice present on those dates, he would have been expected to serve as the presiding justice, directing the Court&#x27;s business.

Washington then nominated Oliver Ellsworth to be chief justice, transmitting the nomination to the Senate in a March 3 message stating that Ellsworth would replace &quot;William Cushing, resigned.&quot; Subsequent histories of the Court have not counted Cushing as chief justice, but instead report that he declined the appointment. Had Cushing accepted promotion to chief justice and then resigned, he would have had to leave the Court entirely; accepting the appointment would have implicitly required Cushing to resign his place as associate justice. That he continued on the Court as an associate justice for years afterward lends weight to the assertion that Cushing declined promotion. Additionally, Cushing&#x27;s February 2 letter explicitly stated his return of the commission for chief justice, and his desire to retain his seat as associate justice.

==Later life and death==
In 1810, Cushing died in his hometown of Scituate, Massachusetts. He is buried in a small cemetery there which is also a state park.

<doc id="440333" wikidata="Q1004599" url="?curid=440333" title="Cheat (game)">
<text>Cheat (also known as Bullshit or I Doubt It) is a card game where the players aim to get rid of all of their cards. It is a game of deception, with cards being played face-down and players being permitted to lie about the cards they have played. A challenge is usually made by players calling out the name of the game, and the loser of a challenge has to pick up every card played so far. Cheat is classed as a party game. As with many card games, cheat has an oral tradition and so people are taught the game under different names.

== Rules ==
One pack of 52 cards is used for four or fewer players; games with five or more players generally combine two 52-card packs. The cards are shuffled and dealt as evenly as possible among the players, with no cards left. Depending on the number of players, some may end up with one card more or less than the others. Players may look at their hands.

The player who sits to the dealer&#x27;s left (clockwise) usually takes the first turn and calls aces. The second player does the same and calls twos. Play continues like this, increasing rank each time, with aces following kings. As players call the rank, they discard one or more cards face down, and declare the number of cards discarded. Players may lie by including cards that are not of the rank required for that turn.

If any player thinks another player is lying, they can call the player out by shouting &quot;Cheat&quot; (or &quot;Bluff&quot;, &quot;I doubt it&quot;, etc.). This stops the play, revealing the cards in question to all players. If the accused player was lying, they must take the whole pile of cards into their hands. If that player was right about the cards they played, the caller must take the pile into their hand. However, once the next player has placed cards, it is too late to call out any previous players.

The game ends when one player runs out of cards, at which point that player wins.

== Variants ==

*A common British variant allows a player to pass their turn if they do not wish to lie or if all the cards of the required rank have clearly been previously played. 
* Some variants allow a rank above &quot;or&quot; below the previous rank to be called. Others allow the current rank to be repeated or progress down through ranks instead of up.
* Some variants allow only a single card to be discarded during a turn.
* In some variations, a player may also lie about the &quot;number&quot; of cards they are playing, if they feel confident that other players will not notice the discrepancy. This is challenged and revealed in the usual manner.
* In some variations, all cards (not just the ones in question) are publicly revealed after a challenge, providing information about which players lied about their cards.
* In another variant, players must continue placing cards of the same rank until someone calls &quot;Cheat&quot; or everyone decides to pass a turn.

== International variants ==
The game is commonly known as &quot;Cheat&quot; in Britain and &quot;Bullshit&quot; in the United States.

=== &quot;Mogeln&quot; ===
The German and Austrian variant is for four or more players and is variously known as Mogeln (&quot;cheat&quot;), Schwindeln (&quot;swindle&quot;), Lügen (&quot;lie&quot;) or Zweifeln (&quot;doubting&quot;). In Austrian Vorarlberg it is also Lüga. A 52-card pack is used (two packs with more players) and each player is dealt the same number of cards, any surplus being dealt face down to the table. The player who has the Ace of Hearts leads by placing it face down on the table (on the surplus cards if any). The player to the left follows and names their discard as the Two of Hearts and so on up to the King. Then the next suit is started. Any player may play a card other than the correct one in the sequence, but if their opponents suspect the player of cheating, they call &quot;gemogelt!&quot; (&quot;cheated!&quot;). The card is checked and if it is the wrong card, the offending player has to pick up the entire stack. If it is the right card, the challenger has to pick up the stack. The winner is the first to shed all their cards; the loser is the last one left holding any cards.

===&quot;Verish&#x27; Ne Verish&quot;&#x27;===
The Russian game Verish&#x27; Ne Verish&#x27; (&quot;Trust, don&#x27;t trust&quot;)—described by David Parlett as &quot;an ingenious cross between Cheat and Old Maid&quot;—is also known as Russian Bluff, Chinese Bluff or simply as Cheat.

The game is played with 36 cards (two or three players) or 52 (four or more). One card is removed at random before the game and set aside face-down, and the remainder are dealt between players (even if this results in players having differently sized hands of cards).

The core of the game is played in the same manner as Cheat, except that the rank does not change as play proceeds around the table: every player must call the same rank.

Whenever players pick up cards due to a bluff being called, they may – if they wish – reveal four of the same rank from their hand, and discard them.

In some variants, if the player does not have any of the rank in their hand, they may call &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; and the next player takes their turn. If every player passes, the cards on the table are removed from the game, and the last player begins the next round.

===Canadian/Spanish Bluff===

Similar to Russian Bluff, it is a version used by at least some in Canada and known in Spain. The rules are rather strict and, while it is a variation, it is not open to much variation itself. It is also known in English as Fourshit (single deck) and Eightshit (double deck), the game involves a few important changes to the standard rules. Usually two decks are used instead of one so that there are 8 of every card as well as four jokers (Jokers are optional), though one deck may be used if desired. Not all ranks are used; the players can arbitrarily choose which ranks to use in the deck and, if using two decks, should use one card for each player plus two or three more. Four players may choose to use 6, 8, 10, J, Q, K, A or may just as easily choose 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, J, K, or any other cards. This can be a useful way to make use of decks with missing cards as those ranks can be removed. The four jokers are considered wild and may represent any card in the game.

The first player can be chosen by any means. The Spanish variation calls for a bidding war to see who has the highest card. The winner of the challenge is the first player. In Canada, a version is the first player to be dealt a Jack face up, and then the cards are re-dealt face down.

The first player will make a &quot;claim&quot; of any rank of cards and an amount of their choice. In this version each player in turn must play as many cards as they wish of the same rank. The rank played never goes up, down nor changes in any way. If the first player plays kings, all subsequent players must also play kings for that round (it is non-incremental). Jokers represent the card of the rank being played in each round, and allow a legal claim of up to 11 of one card (seven naturals and four jokers). A player may play more cards than they claim to play though hiding cards under the table or up the sleeve is not allowed. After any challenge, the winner begins a new round by making a claim of any amount of any card rank.

If at any point a player picks up cards and has all eight natural cards of a certain rank, they declare this out loud and remove them from the game. If a player fails to do this and later leads a round with this rank, they automatically lose the game.

Once a player has played all their cards, they are out of that particular hand. Play continues until there are only two players (at which point some cards have probably been removed from the game). The players continue playing until there is a loser. The object of the game is usually not so much to win, but not be the loser. The loser is usually penalised by the winners either in having the dishonour of losing, or having to perform a forfeit.

=== Chinese Liar ===
In the Fujian province, a version of the game known as 吹牛 (&quot;bragging&quot;) or 说谎 (&quot;lying&quot;) is played with no restriction on the rank that may be called each turn, and simply requiring that each set is claimed to be of the same number. On any given turn, a player may &quot;pass&quot; instead of playing. If all players pass consecutively, then the face-down stack of played cards is taken out of the game until the next bluff is called. The player who previously called a rank then begins play again.

===Sweden===
In Sweden the game is known as &quot;bluffstopp&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;bluff&quot; (&quot;bluff&quot;) and &quot;stoppspel&quot; (&quot;shedding game&quot;). Players are given six (or seven) cards at the start of the game, and the remainder make a pile. Players are restricted to follow suit, and play a higher rank, but are allowed to bluff. If a player is revealed to be bluffing, or a player fails to call or a bluff, the player draws three cards from the pile.

Additional rules and players to play more than one card in secret, and drop cards in their lap. But if this is discovered, the player must draw three or even six cards.

<doc id="440338" wikidata="Q1996518" url="?curid=440338" title="Earl of Salisbury">
<text>Earl of Salisbury is a title that has been created several times in English and British history. It has a complex history and is now a subsidiary title to the marquessate of Salisbury.

==Background==
The title was first created for Patrick de Salisbury in the middle twelfth century. In 1196 the title passed to Patrick’s granddaughter, Ela, who married 
William Longespée, an illegitimate son of Henry II the same year. Ela was predeceased by husband, son and grandson, and was succeeded by her great-granddaughter, Margaret Longespée. Margaret married Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, and their daughter Alice eventually became Countess of Salisbury, in 1310, and of Lincoln, in 1311. Alice had married Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in 1294. When the Earl of Lancaster lost his titles and was executed for treason in 1322, the Countess surrendered all of her titles to the King, and the titles lapsed.

The title was created for a second time in 1337 for William Montacute of the noble House of Montagu. This line ended in the sole heiress, Alice Montacute, and her husband Richard Neville took up the earldom &#x27;by right of his wife&#x27;.

After Richard&#x27;s death at the Battle of Barnet, in 1471 , the title was granted in 1472 to George, Duke of Clarence, who was married to Richard&#x27;s eldest daughter. When the Duke of Clarence was executed in 1478 for treason (supposedly by being drowned in a vat of Malmsey wine), the title was forfeit. It was then granted to Edward of Middleham (who was his nephew via the Duke&#x27;s brother Richard), who died in 1484 at the age of 10.

It was restored to two of George of Clarence&#x27;s children: to his son Edward in 1485 until his execution for treason in 1499, and to Edward&#x27;s sister, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, in 1513 until she was also executed, and the title again forfeited, in 1539.

In 1605 the title was given to Robert Cecil, a close advisor to James I. Cecil was a son of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s chief advisor, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, and half-brother to Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter. In 1789 James Cecil, the 7th Earl, was created the Marquess of Salisbury by George III.

==Titleholders==
===First creation (1145)===
* Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury (c. 1122-1168)

* Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury (1407–1462)
** Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury &quot;jure uxoris&quot;

===Restoration of second or third creation (1512)===

* Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury (1473–1541) (restored or created 1512; forfeit 1539), only sister of the above; sources differ on whether the Earldom of Salisbury restored to her was her father&#x27;s (the third creation) or her grandfather&#x27;s (second).

The Brudenell family descends from Sir Robert Brudenell, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1520 to 1530. His great-grandson, Sir Thomas Brudenell, was created a Baronet in the Baronetage of England, styled &quot;of Deene in the County of Northampton&quot;, on 29 June 1611. On 26 February 1628, he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Brudenell, of Stanton Wyvill in the County of Leicester. On 20 April 1661, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Cardigan, also in the Peerage of England. On his death, the titles passed to his son, Robert, the 2nd Earl, and on the 2nd Earl&#x27;s death to his grandson, George, the 3rd Earl, the 2nd Earl&#x27;s only son, Francis, Lord Brudenell, having predeceased his father.

The 3rd Earl&#x27;s eldest son, George, the 4th Earl, married Lady Mary Montagu, daughter of John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, and he succeeded to the Montagu estates on his father-in-law&#x27;s death in 1749, including the Lordship of Bowland. He assumed the same year by Royal licence the surname of Montagu in lieu of Brudenell. In 1766, he was created Marquess of Monthermer and Duke of Montagu in the Peerage of Great Britain, revivals of the titles which had become extinct on his father-in-law&#x27;s death in 1749. Montagu&#x27;s only son and heir, John Montagu, Marquess of Monthermer, had already been created Baron Montagu, of Boughton in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1762, a revival of another title held by his maternal grandfather. However, Lord Monthermer died childless in 1770, predeceasing his father. The barony of Montagu died with him. In 1786, the Duke of Montagu was also created Baron Montagu, of Boughton in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with remainder to the younger sons of his daughter, Lady Elizabeth Montagu, wife of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. On the Duke&#x27;s death in 1780, the marquessate and dukedom became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of Montagu according to the special remainder by his grandson, Henry Scott (see Baron Montagu of Boughton for further history of this title; see also Duke of Montagu).

The earldom, barony of Brudenell and baronetcy passed to the Duke&#x27;s younger brother, James, the 5th Earl, who already on 17 October 1780 had been created Baron Brudenell, of Deene in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of Great Britain, in his own right. However, he died childless in 1811 when the barony of 1780 became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his nephew, Robert, the 6th Earl, only son of Robert Brudenell, third son of the 3rd Earl. The 6th Earl&#x27;s only son, James, 7th Earl, gained fame for his role in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. He was childless and on his death in 1868 the titles were inherited by his second cousin, George, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, grandson of Thomas Brudenell, the fourth and youngest son of the 3rd Earl. Thomas had succeeded his maternal uncle, the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury and 4th Earl of Elgin, in 1747 as Baron Bruce, of Tottenham in the County of Wilts, had in 1766 assumed the surname &quot;Brudenell-Bruce&quot;, and had in 1776 been created Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of Great Britain. The 1st Earl of Ailesbury was succeeded by his son, Charles, the 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, who in 1821 had been created Viscount Savernake, of Savernake Forest in the County of Wilts, Earl Bruce, of Whorlton in the County of York, and Marquess of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury and 8th Earl of Cardigan. For further history of the titles, see Marquess of Ailesbury.

The Earldom remains united with the Marquessate of Ailesbury; and indeed, since the descendants of the 1st Earl of Ailesbury are the only remaining descendants of the 1st Earl of Cardigan, the titles will never be separated. The Earldom remains visible, however, as it is used as a courtesy title by the heirs apparent to the Marquessate.

The family seat Deene Park was not united with the marquessate but was passed down to Commodore Lord Robert Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, the second surviving son of the 3rd Marquess. Lord Robert&#x27;s son George inherited the family seat along with the family&#x27;s remaining estates in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire and reverted the family name back to &quot;Brudenell&quot; by Royal Licence. Deene Park is currently the residence of George&#x27;s grandson Robert Brudenell.

<doc id="440345" wikidata="Q1075628" url="?curid=440345" title="Duke of Albemarle">
<text>The Dukedom of Albemarle () has been created twice in the Peerage of England, each time ending in extinction. Additionally, the title was created a third time by James II in exile and a fourth time by his son the Old Pretender, in the Jacobite peerage. The name &quot;Albemarle&quot; is derived from the Latinised form of the French commune of in Normandy ( meaning &#x27;White Marl&#x27;, marl being a type of fertile soil), other forms being &quot;Aubemarle&quot; and &quot;Aumerle&quot;. It arose in connection with the ancient Norman Counts of Aumale of Aumale in Normandy. 

==Dukes of Albemarle (Aumale), first creation (1397)==
*Edward of Norwich, Duke of Aumale (Albemarle) (1373–1415), grandson of Edward III, was deprived of this dukedom in 1399. He later succeeded his father as Duke of York.

==Dukes of Albemarle, second creation (1660)==

:&quot;also Earl of Torrington, Baron Monck of Potheridge, Beauchamp and Teyes (England, 7 July 1660)&quot;
*George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608–1670) was rewarded with his peerages for his part in the Restoration.
*Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (1653–1688), only son of the 1st Duke, died childless.

==Dukes of Albemarle, first Jacobite creation (1696)==
:&quot;also &quot;Earl of Rochford&quot; and &quot;Baron Romney&quot; (Jacobite, 1696)&quot;
* Henry FitzJames, &quot;1st Duke of Albemarle&quot; (1673–1702), illegitimate son of James II was created a peer by his father in exile.

==Dukes of Albemarle, second Jacobite creation (1722)==

:&quot;also &quot;Marquess Monck and Fitzhemon&quot;, &quot;Earl of Bath&quot;, &quot;Viscount Bevil&quot; (Jacobite, 1722), Baron Lansdowne (Great Britain, 1712) and &quot;Baron Lansdown of Bideford&quot; (Jacobite, 1722)&quot;
* George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne, &quot;1st Duke of Albemarle&quot; (1666–1735), a notable Tory, was made a Jacobite peer by The Old Pretender, which creation was not recognised within the Kingdom of Great Britain.
* Bernard Granville, &quot;2nd Duke of Albemarle&quot; (1700 – 2 July 1776), nephew of Lord Lansdowne, allegedly succeeded his uncle in said Jacobite peerage. Never married.

<text>:&quot;See also Earl of Winchilsea&quot;

Earl of Nottingham is a title that has been created seven times in the Peerage of England. It was first created for John de Mowbray in 1377, at the coronation of Richard II. As this creation could only pass to his legitimate heirs, it went extinct on his death in 1383. It was re-created for his younger brother Thomas de Mowbray in the same year, however. This branch of the family became Dukes of Norfolk, and the title would descend with them until John de Mowbray died without male heirs in 1476.

The third creation was for Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, son of Edward IV and one of the Princes in the Tower. Richard was imprisoned by his uncle Richard III (then Lord Protector), disappearing shortly after, presumed murdered.

The earldom was briefly recreated in 1483 for the 4th time for William Berkeley, who later became Marquess of Berkeley. Then in 1525, the earldom was recreated for the 5th time for Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset and illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Both died childless within ten years of being granted the title.

The sixth creation was for Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral for Elizabeth I and James VI and I. He was commander of the English navy against the Spanish Armada, and a notable statesman in both reigns. His descendants held the earldom until 1681.

The current, seventh, creation was made in 1681 for Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, who died one year later. Before being created earl he was the Attorney General and Lord Chancellor, and played an active part in the aftermath of the Popish Plot. His son Daniel Finch inherited the Earldom of Winchilsea in 1729. The second earl was a prominent politician, serving as Lord President of the Council, Secretary of State for the Northern and Southern Departments, and First Lord of the Admiralty.

For subsequent family history, see &quot;Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham.&quot;

The title is currently held by Daniel Finch-Hatton, 17th Earl of Winchilsea and 12th Earl of Nottingham.

<text>Wine Country is a region of California, in the northern San Francisco Bay Area, known worldwide as a premier wine-growing region. The region is famed for its wineries, its cuisine, Michelin star restaurants, boutique hotels, luxury resorts, historic architecture, and culture. Viticulture and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the Spanish missionaries from Mission San Francisco Solano established the first vineyards in 1812.

There are over 1,700 wineries in the North Bay (according to Alcoholic Beverage Control of California), mostly located in the area&#x27;s valleys, including Napa Valley in Napa County, and the Sonoma Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Bennett Valley, and Russian River Valley in Sonoma County. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder AVAs. Cities and towns associated with the Wine Country include Santa Rosa, Healdsburg, Sonoma, Kenwood, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Guerneville, Windsor, Geyserville, and Cloverdale in Sonoma County; Napa, Yountville, Rutherford, St. Helena and Calistoga in Napa County; and Hopland and Ukiah in Mendocino County. Wine is also an important part of the economy in nearby Lake, Solano, and Yolo counties.

==Appellations==
Wine Country is generally regarded as the combined counties of Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Solano, and western parts of Yolo County. These counties contain the following American Viticultural Areas (AVAs):
*in Sonoma County: Alexander Valley, Bennett Valley, Chalk Hill, Dry Creek Valley, Green Valley, Knight&#x27;s Valley, Los Carneros, Northern Sonoma, Petaluma Gap, Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak, Rockpile, Russian River Valley, Sonoma Coast, Sonoma Mountain, Sonoma Valley and West Sonoma Coast.
*in Napa County: Atlas Peak, Chiles Valley, Crystal Springs, Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Oak Knoll District, Spring Mountain District, Wild Horse Valley, Los Carneros, Mount Veeder, Napa Valley, Oakville, Rutherford, Saint Helena, Calistoga, Stags Leap District and Yountville.
*in Mendocino County: Comptche, Eagle Peak, Anderson Valley, Cole Ranch, Covelo, Dos Rios, McDowell Valley, Redwood Valley, Yorkville Highlands, Mendocino, Mendocino Ridge and Potter Valley.
*in Lake County: Big Valley District, Clear Lake, Guenoc Valley, High Valley, Kelsey Bench, Long Valley, Red Hills, and Upper Lake Valley.
*in Solano County: Suisun Valley and Green Valley.

The six-county North Coast AVA overlaps with the Wine Country as defined here and also includes Marin County. In addition, the names of the counties themselves are legal for use as appellation names.

==History==

The earliest prehistory of the Wine Country involves habitation by several Native American tribes from approximately 8000 BC. The principal tribes living in this region included the Pomo, Coast Miwok, Wappo and Patwin, whose early peoples practiced certain forms of agriculture, but probably not involving the cultivation of grapes. During the Mexican Colonial period and after, European settlers brought in more intensive agriculture to the Wine Country, including growing grapes and wine production. Some of the historical events that led to the establishment of California as a state transpired in the Wine Country. In particular, the town of Sonoma is known as the birthplace of American California. Agoston Haraszthy is credited as one of the forefathers of the California wine industry in Sonoma by his planting of grapes in the lower Arroyo Seco Creek watershed of Sonoma County.

In 2017, many portions of California&#x27;s Wine Country were heavily devastated by wildfires, including the October 2017 Northern California wildfires.

Founded in 1880, the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology is the most famous and established school for research and education in winemaking in the Northern California region and the United States. It has contributed greatly to Northern California’s growth and establishment as a wine producing region.

==Ecology==

A diversity of aquatic and terrestrial organisms populate the Wine Country and its riparian zones. Winter-run Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tsawytscha&quot;), Delta smelt (&quot;Hypomesus transpacificus&quot;) and steelhead (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) are the most prominent fishes. Researchers have studied anadromous fish-movements extensively in Sonoma Creek and in the Napa River as well as in the Laguna de Santa Rosa - not only in the mainstems, but in many of the tributaries. These investigations have demonstrated a historical decline in spawning and habitat value for these species, primarily due to sedimentation and secondarily to removal of riparian vegetation since the 19th century.

A variety of salamanders, snakes and frogs are also present in the Wine Country. The federally listed as threatened California red-legged frog is present in the northern reach draining the south slopes of Annadel State Park. Several endangered species (mostly associated with the Napa Sonoma Marsh) present include Ridgway&#x27;s rail (&quot;Rallus obsoletus&quot;), California black rail (&quot;Laterallus jamaicensis&quot;), California brown pelican (&quot;Pelicanus occudentalis&quot;), California freshwater shrimp (&quot;Syncaris pacifica&quot;), salt marsh harvest mouse (&quot;Reithrodontomys raviventris&quot; ), Suisun shrew (&quot;Sorex ornatus sinuosus&quot;), Sacramento splittail (&quot;Pogonichtys macrolepidotus&quot;). The above are endangered species with the exception of the splittail, steelhead and black rail, which are federally designated as threatened.

Upland ecosystems drained include mixed California oak woodland, chaparral and savannah woodland. In these upland reaches one finds plentiful black-tailed deer, coyote, skunk, raccoon, opossum, wild turkey, turkey vulture, red-tailed hawk and occasionally bobcat and mountain lion. Prominent higher elevation trees include: Coast live oak, Garry oak, Pacific madrone, California buckeye, Douglas fir, whereas valley oak is prevalent on the Wine Country valley floors.

==Tourism==
The Wine Country has undergone a boom in tourism. In 1975 there were only 25 Napa Valley wineries; today there are well over 800 wineries in Napa and Sonoma Counties. Tourists come to the region not only for wine tasting, but also for hiking, bicycling, hot air ballooning, and historic sites, as well as the extensive culinary choices.

Numerous notable chefs and restaurateurs are present in the Wine Country, including Thomas Keller, John Ash, and Sondra Bernstein. Besides the obvious winery attractions, the Wine Country is known for the Sonoma County coastline along the Pacific Ocean, the Russian River valley, redwoods, hot spring baths, petrified forests and other natural areas.

The Wine Country tourism boom has its downside, exemplified by traffic congestion on State Route 29, particularly on summer weekends, when the number of tourists often exceeds the carrying capacity of the road. The Napa Valley is also experiencing pressures for increased urbanization and roadway upgrades. There have also been issues related to regulating home sharing. After a boom in residents renting rooms in private homes, the city government of Napa was forced to require any Napa Airbnb properties to register.

<text>The mineral petzite, Ag3AuTe2, is a soft, steel-gray telluride mineral generally deposited by hydrothermal activity. It forms isometric crystals, and is usually associated with rare tellurium and gold minerals, often with silver, mercury, and copper.

The name comes from chemist W. Petz, who first analyzed the mineral from the type locality in Săcărâmb, Transylvania, Romania in 1845. It was described by Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger in 1845 and dedicated to W. Petz who had carried out the first analyses.

It occurs with other tellurides in vein gold deposits. It is commonly associated with native gold, hessite, sylvanite, krennerite, calaverite, altaite, montbrayite, melonite,
frohbergite, tetradymite, rickardite, vulcanite and pyrite.

Petzite forms together with uytenbogaardtite (Ag3AuS2) and fischesserite (Ag3AuSe2) the uytenbogaardtite group.

<doc id="440355" wikidata="Q2189033" url="?curid=440355" title="Erector Set">
<text>Erector Set (trademark styled as &quot;ERECTOR&quot;) was a brand of metal toy construction sets which were originally patented by Alfred Carlton Gilbert and first sold by his company, the Mysto Manufacturing Company of New Haven, Connecticut, in 1913. In 1916, the company was reorganized as the A. C. Gilbert Company. The brand continued its independent existence under various corporate ownerships until 1990, when Meccano bought the Erector brand and consolidated its worldwide marketing with its own brand. The coverage here focuses on the historical legacy of the classic Erector Set; for current developments under the &quot;Erector by Meccano&quot; brand name, see the Meccano article.

Basic Erector parts included various metal beams with regularly spaced holes for assembly using nuts and bolts. A frequently promoted patented feature was the ability to fabricate a strong but lightweight hollow structural girder from four long flat pieces of stamped sheet steel, held together by bolts and nuts (US Patent 1,066,809). Flat or curved pieces of sheet metal in various shapes and colors could be added to the structural skeleton. Hardened steel rods and screw clamps allowed the construction of hinges and the transmission of mechanical power via rotating parts such as pulleys, gears, wheels, and levers.

Unlike some earlier wooden construction sets, Erector could be used both for static structures and for dynamic structures incorporating mechanical linkages and other moving components. Modular, standardized construction sets like Erector provided the ability to build a model, then take it apart and build something else, over and over again. Both AC-powered electric motors and battery-powered DC motors became available, usually equipped with gears to increase their torque and effective mechanical power. Later sets added miniature light bulbs and simple switches to control electrical power.
Erector is a versatile constructional medium. In addition to building models, it is used to prototype new ideas and designs.

==History==

Erector was first envisioned by Alfred Carlton Gilbert (A.C. Gilbert) in 1911, as he rode the train from New Haven to New York City. This section of track was being converted to electrical power, and Gilbert watched as steel girders were erected to carry the power lines, inspiring him to develop the toy. Gilbert was a skilled magician and manufactured magic tricks and magic sets with his existing company the &quot;Mysto Manufacturing Company&quot;. The first Erector set was made there in 1913, called &quot;The Erector / Structural Steel and Electro-Mechanical Builder&quot;, and labeled as &quot;Educational, Instructive and Amusing&quot;. The toy was first introduced and sold to the public in 1913 at the Toy Fair held at the Broadway Central Hotel in New York City.

Erector quickly became the most popular construction toy in the United States, most likely because it was the only construction set at the time to contain a motor. In 1914, the name was changed to &quot;The Mysto Erector, The Toy That Resembles Structural Steel&quot;. In 1916, the company was reorganized and became the A.C. Gilbert Company. The product was renamed &quot;Gilbert Erector, The Toy Like Structural Steel&quot;. In 1924, more changes occurred, as the entire Erector system was completely overhauled to include over 70 types of parts. Erector was now called &quot;The New Erector, The World’s Greatest Toy&quot;.

Through 1932, Erector was sold in wooden boxes, but 1933 through 1962 the sets would be sold in colorful boxes made of painted steel. Early boxes were colored red, green, or blue; by the 1950s all set boxes were painted red. As the company grew, the area around the Gilbert factory became known as &quot;Erector Square&quot;.

A.C. Gilbert died in 1961, and the company went into decline, filing for bankruptcy in 1967. The product was redesigned, adding many plastic parts, but the &quot;clunky&quot; looking models failed to compete with the new, more-realistic scale plastic models coming onto the market. The Gabriel company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, bought the Erector brand name and continued to market the recently redesigned system, though by the mid-1970s most plastic parts had been removed (or replaced by laminated fiberboard, for panels) as a savings measure due to the oil crisis. Sales were slow, and by the 1980s the trademark Erector was acquired by Ideal Toys and then Tyco Toys. In 1990, Meccano bought the Erector brand. The two brands are now sold under the Meccano brand name, with the Erector Set being marketed as &quot;Erector by Meccano&quot;, having the same parts as Meccano.

In 2002, a movie based on A.C. Gilbert&#x27;s life called &quot;The Man Who Saved Christmas&quot; was made for television. It focused on Gilbert&#x27;s successful appeal to the Council of National Defense to reject a proposal to ban toy production in favor of wartime related materials during World War I.

An extensive collection of A.C. Gilbert Company scientific and educational children&#x27;s toys is housed at the Eli Whitney Museum, in Hamden, Connecticut.

==Applications==
Over the years, Erector Sets have been used to prototype a variety of devices, including: 
*In 1949, an Erector set was used to build the precursor to the modern artificial heart by William Sewell and Dr. William Glenn of the Yale School of Medicine. The external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour.
*In the 1970s, information theory pioneer Claude Shannon constructed a bounce-juggling machine from an Erector set.
*In the late 1980s, with an Erector Set, various old toys, and bits of jewelry, Jack Kevorkian jerry-rigged a machine he called the Thanatron (later renamed to the Mercitron). Three bottles were suspended from a rickety beam, one filled with a saline solution to open a patient&#x27;s veins, another with barbiturates for sedation, and a third with potassium chloride to stop the heart. After Kevorkian connected the patient to an IV, he or she would pull a chain on the device to start the lethal medications flowing. He called it his “Rube Goldberg suicide device.”
*In the late 1990s, engineer Mark Sumner used Erector to create a working model for &quot;Soarin’”, an attraction at Disney’s California Adventure in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot near Orlando, Florida.

In 1990, Meccano S.A. built a giant Ferris wheel in France. It was modelled after the original 1893 Ferris Wheel built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition at Chicago and was shipped to the United States to promote &quot;Erector by Meccano&quot; after Meccano S.A. had bought out the Erector brand name and began selling Erector by Meccano sets in the U.S. It went on display in New York City, after which it was purchased by Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! and put on display in their St. Augustine, Florida museum. The model, the largest in size at the time, is high, weighs , was made from 19,507 pieces, 50,560 nuts and bolts, and took 1,239 hours to construct. At this mass and size, some deviation from Erector by Meccano-only parts was a necessity, to prevent it collapsing (mainly in the structural spokes). The largest model by mass would certainly be in contention, but some models have topped .

<text>The Gold Country (also known as [[Mother lode|Mother Lode]] Country) is a historic region in the northern portion of the U.S. state of California, that is primarily on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. It is famed for the mineral deposits and gold mines that attracted waves of immigrants, known as the 49ers, during the 1849 California gold rush.

==History==
When gold was first discovered in 1848, many people came from all over the world to find gold. The migration into California also brought diseases and violence. There were 500 mining camps of which 300 are still undocumented. There was $400 million in gold mined between 1849 and 1855. In 1942 most of the mines shut down due to World War II. The transportation in Gold Country grew rapidly due to the Gold Rush. The first railroad in California ran through Gold Country. There were 250 different stage coach companies formed by 1860.

===Major events by county===
* Amador County – At the time of the Gold Rush the Kennedy Mine was the deepest in the world at 5,919 feet. Argonaut Mine was active from 1850 to 1942. In 1922, there was a fire in the area and 47 men were trapped in the mine and died. This mine was shut down due to World War II.
* Butte County – Cherokee was hydraulic-mined from 1860 to 1870. Cherokee was the first place to find diamonds in the United States in 1864. In Oroville a Chinese temple was established in 1863. The Chinese worked on the railroads and mining the area.
* Calaveras County – This county was known for the biggest gold nugget found in the United States. Weighing 195 pounds, the nugget was found in Carson Hill. In Copperopolis, $72 million worth of copper was found. Many of the copper mines in this area supplied the Union armies needs in the Civil War. In 1856 Mitchler Hotel was built. Black Bart stayed in this hotel numerous times.
* El Dorado County – This county is the key to the Gold Country. This is where gold was discovered in 1848 by James Marshall at Sutter&#x27;s Mill. The 13.8 lb Fricot Nugget was found at Spanish Dry Diggings. Sutter&#x27;s Fort was destroyed by all the people that came here during the Gold Rush.
* Mariposa County – Located in the southern portion of Hwy 49. This county is known for the Ghirardelli Factory dated to 1855–1858. One of the mines in Mariposa County was the Princetown Mine, which pulled out $5 million in gold.
* Nevada County – This county had the most gold out of all of Gold County pulled out of it totaling $440 million worth. Holbrooke Hotel is one of the oldest hotels still operating in Gold Country. It was built in 1851. Empire Mine was a well known mine in the area, which is now a state park. This mine extends 200 miles underground. This mine was still in operation after the war. $100 million worth of gold was extracted from this mine. Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad was constructed in 1876. This railroad allowed faster travel between Grass Valley and Nevada City. It was shut down in 1942. In 1851 in North Bloomfield many mines were producing high volumes of gold, but died out by 1853. Malakoff Diggings was known for its booming hydraulic mining.
* Placer County – Colfax was known for a main station for supplies from the Central Pacific Railroad. Many of the area was known for quartz. About $2 million in quartz was found. Placer County was known for the robber &quot;Rattlesnake Dick&quot; in 1850.
* Plumas County – Gold was first found in this county at Rabbit Creek. $60 million in gold was found in the La Porte area. John Bidwell first discovered gold in the Feather River. Spanish Ranch had over $100 million worth of gold come out of it. In Crescent Mill they found a gold vein 20 feet thick.

* Sierra County – Allegheny was known for a 163-pound gold nugget. The mine was shut down during the war but then was opened back up in 1965. This mine is still mined occasionally today. In 1992 $70,000 was mined out of it. In 1849 gold was first found in the Yuba river in Downieville. The tale of a 427-pound nugget found near there is unverified. Hydraulic mining was used at Howland Flat and Poker Flat in the 1850s. $700,000 worth of gold came out of Poker Flat alone.
* Tuolumne County – Knights Ferry had the largest covered bridge on the west coast dating back to 1862. In Jamestown they found a 75-pound golden nugget. Sierra Railroad House was built in 1897. It was a popular site for filming movies. Eagle Shawmut Mine had $7.4 million mined out of it.
* Yuba County – This county was known for dredging the rivers, mills, hydraulic mining and its many little towns. Most of the towns were built around trails. They provided hotels, stores, and bars for the newcomers. They had one of the largest dredgers ever, in the Yuba River at one point. It dredged 4.8 million ounces of gold. Black Bart was known in this area for robbing the Wells Fargo stagecoaches coming from La Porte. Colgate Powerhouse went into use for the first time in 1899. It supplied power to Sacramento and Oroville. One of the most famous towns in Yuba County was Camptonville. Gold was first discovered in this town in 1850. The area under the town was so rich in gold that they moved the town to get to the gold. Marysville was a transportation hub for gold to be shipped out to San Francisco. Millions of dollars in gold came through Marysville, one of the biggest cities in California at the time.

==Geology==
The Gold Country lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, reaching down to the Sacramento Valley. The oldest geology can be found along the easternmost portions of this region, closer to the Sierra Nevada summits, which formed 100 million years ago. It consists of ancient sea floor and portions of islands which were added onto the western edge of North America during the late Paleozoic, about 275 million years ago. The western sections of the Mother Lode are significantly younger, from the mid-Mesozoic about 150 million years ago, and also consist of material that was solidified on the ocean floor to the continental edge. Massive intrusions of granite forced their way into these formations. After ten miles of overlying material was eroded over the last 70 million years, these intrusions became visible throughout the Sierra Nevada. Over the last 50 million years, rivers and volcanoes deposited materials; these built up in thick layers found atop many of the high ridges of the Sierra Nevada foothills.

==Climate==
This part of California has a Mediterranean climate like much of Italy and Spain, making wine grapes and vineyards one of the region&#x27;s primary crops and industry. Over 100 wineries are found throughout the Gold Country. Winters are cool and wet with occasional snowfall, especially in the higher elevations of the eastern reaches up the slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Winter temperatures range from the upper twenties to mid-fifties. Summers are dry and hot, with long stretches that reach triple digits. The average annual precipitation is around . Many dams were built in the Sierra Nevada to hold water. People in California depend on the water that comes from the Sierra Nevada mountains.

==Transportation==
California State Route 49 is the primary north–south highway through the region, passing through many historic mining communities. Major east–west highways include Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 50.

Two Amtrak routes run through the area. The eastern terminus of the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; is in Auburn. The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; stops in Colfax.

<text>The Mur () or Mura (; ; ; Prekmurje Slovene: &quot;Müra&quot; or &quot;Möra&quot;) is a river in Central Europe rising in the Hohe Tauern national park of the Central Eastern Alps in Austria with its source at above sea level. It is a tributary of the Drava and subsequently the Danube.

The Mur&#x27;s total length is around . About 326 km are within the interior of Austria; 95 km flow in and around Slovenia (67 km along the borders with Austria and Croatia, 28 km inside Slovenia), and the rest forms the border between Croatia and Hungary. The largest city on the river is Graz, Austria. Its drainage basin covers an area of .

Tributaries of the Mur include the Mürz, the Sulm, the Ščavnica, the Ledava and the Trnava.

==Etymology==
The river was attested as &quot;Maura&quot; in AD 799, &quot;Muora&quot; in 890, &quot;Mura&quot; in 1259, &quot;Mvr&quot; and &quot;Mver&quot; in 1310, and &quot;Muer&quot; in 1354. The name is probably of Slavic origin, nominalized from the adjective *&quot;murъ&quot; &#x27;dark&#x27;, meaning &#x27;dark water&#x27;.

==River course==
The river rises in a remote valley within the Lungau region of the Austrian state of Salzburg. The river flows eastwards through Tamsweg before crossing the border into the state of Styria.

Between Tamsweg and Unzmarkt-Frauenburg the river flows through a rural mountain valley and is closely paralleled by the long narrow gauge Murtalbahn railway. From Unzmarkt the river continues in an easterly direction through the industrial towns of Leoben and Bruck an der Mur. At Bruck an der Mur the Mürz joins the Mur, which turns sharply south to flow through the city of Graz.

The river flows through the centre of Graz, passing underneath the Schloßberg and by the historic Inner City. As a result of being the European Capital of Culture for 2003, an artificial island known as the Murinsel was constructed in the middle of the river. Once heavily polluted by several paper mills on the shore and by the ironworks around Leoben, the water quality has improved since the 1980s and the river is now seen as an asset to the city.

From Graz the river continues to flow south, past the town of Leibnitz to its nearby confluence with the Sulm, where it adopts a more easterly course. Near Spielfeld, the river forms the border between Austria and Slovenia, a role it retains until just after the twin towns of Bad Radkersburg and Gornja Radgona, where it passes fully into Slovenia.

In Slovenia it passes the towns of Radenci, and Veržej. The river gives its name to the Slovenian region of Prekmurje (literally &#x27;across the Mur&#x27;) and the Croatian region of Međimurje (literally &#x27;between the Mur&#x27;). Cable ferries and ship mills are still found in this area.

In the upper Međimurje area, in the western part of the region, the Mur floods and changes its course rather often, moving slowly toward the north on its left. Here, the biggest forest along the river, the Murščak, is located between Domašinec and Donji Hrašćan (derived from Croatian &quot;hrast&quot; &#x27;oak&#x27;). After receiving its last significant tributary Trnava, the river ends near Legrad in Koprivnica-Križevci county, Croatia, where it flows into the river Drava.

==Exploitation==

Since the 4th century BC, there have been reports of floating mills powered by the streams of the river. The ancient technology was adopted later by arriving Slavs and then by Magyars. Several decades ago, in the 1920s and 1930s, many of these mills were still operating along the river. At least one of the old mills, the Babič Mill () near Veržej, Slovenia, continues to operate to this day.

The Mur is known to carry small quantities of gold, not enough to be suitable for exploitation today, but this was a focus of activity for many people since ancient times. Organized research and exploitation of gold and other local resources was encouraged for the first time in 1772.

In Austria, several hydroelectric dams have been constructed for the production of electricity.

In 2017, a hydroelectric dam was under construction in Puntigam, a few km south of the Graz city centre. The plan includes a massive sewage pipe between the city centre and the new dam, necessitating the felling of thousands of trees. The project is controversial and environmental groups are resisting it. Both environmental impact and economic studies have found the project to be neither ecologically nor economically viable. Additional hydroelectric plants are planned for Slovenia.

==Monitoring==
The hydrological parameters of the Mur are regularly monitored in Croatia at Mursko Središće.

<doc id="440359" wikidata="Q503301" url="?curid=440359" title="Salton Sea">
<text>The Salton Sea is a shallow, landlocked, highly saline endorheic lake in Riverside and Imperial counties in Southern California. It lies on the San Andreas Fault within the Salton Trough, which stretches to the Gulf of California in Mexico. The lake is about at its widest and longest. A 2023 report put the surface area at 318 square miles (823.6 km2). The Salton Sea became a resort destination in the 20th century, but saw die-offs of fish and birds in the 1980s due to contamination from farm runoff, and clouds of toxic dust in the current century as evaporation exposed parts of the lake bed.

Over millions of years, the Colorado River had flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited alluvium (soil), creating fertile farmland, building up the terrain, and constantly moving its main course and river delta. For thousands of years, the river alternately flowed into the valley or diverted around it, creating either a salt lake called Lake Cahuilla or a dry desert basin, respectively. When the river diverted around the valley, the lake dried completely, as it did around 1580. Hundreds of archaeological sites have been found in this region, indicating possibly long-term Native American villages and temporary camps.

The modern lake was formed from an inflow of water from the Colorado River in 1905. Beginning in 1900, an irrigation canal was dug from the Colorado River to provide water to the Imperial Valley for farming. Water from spring floods broke through a canal head-gate, diverting a portion of the river flow into the Salton Basin for two years before repairs were completed. The water in the formerly dry lake bed created the modern lake.

During the early 20th century, the lake would have dried up, except that farmers used generous amounts of Colorado River water for irrigation and let the excess flow into the lake. In the 1950s and into the 1960s, the area became a resort destination, and communities grew with hotels and vacation homes. Birdwatching was also popular as the wetlands were a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway. In the 1970s, scientists issued warnings that the lake would continue to shrink and become more inhospitable to wildlife. In the 1980s, contamination from farm runoff promoted the outbreak and spread of wildlife diseases. Massive die-offs of the avian populations have occurred, especially after the loss of several species of fish on which they depend. Salinity rose so high that large fish kills occurred, often blighting the beaches of the sea with their carcasses. Tourism was drastically reduced.

After 1999, the lake began to shrink as local agriculture used the water more efficiently, so less runoff flowed into the lake. As the lake bed became exposed, the winds sent clouds of toxic dust into nearby communities. The state is mainly responsible for fixing the problems. California lawmakers pledged to fund air-quality management projects in conjunction with the signing of the 2003 agreement to send more water to coastal cities. Local, state and federal bodies all had found minimal success dealing with the dust, dying wildlife, and other problems for which warnings had been issued decades before. In 2017, the Salton Sea Management Program was developed by the state. The Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians partnered with the state to restore shallow wetlands along the northern edge of the sea in 2018. Construction began in 2021 on a habitat restoration and dust suppression project.

==History==
===Before the modern era===
The Gulf of California would extend as far north as the city of Indio, some northwest of its current limits, were it not for the delta created by the Colorado River. Over three million years, through all of the Pleistocene, the river&#x27;s delta expanded until it cut off the northern part of the gulf. Since then, the Colorado River has alternated between emptying into the basin, creating a freshwater lake, and emptying into the gulf, leaving the lake to dry and turn to desert. Wave-cut shorelines at various elevations record a repeated cycle of filling and drying over hundreds of thousands of years. The most recent freshwater lake was Lake Cahuilla, also known as the Blake Sea after American professor and geologist William Phipps Blake. It covered over , six times the area of the Salton Sea.

Archaeological sites and radiocarbon dates indicate that the lake was filled three or four times over the last 1,300 years. When full, the lake would attract Native Americans to its shores. Hundreds of sites have been found, some possibly long-term villages and others temporary camps. The occupants ate at least four species of fish (two of which were razorback sucker and bonytail chub), birds (particularly the coot), black-tailed jackrabbit, black-tailed cottontail rabbit, and sometimes deer and bighorn sheep. Among the plants they used were bulrush, cattail, mesquite, and saltbush. The Cahuilla people have an oral memory of the last lake, which existed in the 17th century and dried up soon after 1700.

Throughout the Spanish period of California&#x27;s history, the area was referred to as the &quot;Colorado Desert&quot; after the Colorado River. In a railroad survey completed in 1855, it was called &quot;the Valley of the Ancient Lake&quot;. On several old maps from the Library of Congress, it has been found labeled &quot;Cahuilla Valley&quot; (after the local Indian tribe) and &quot;Cabazon Valley&quot; (after a local Indian chief – Chief Cabazon). &quot;Salt Creek&quot; first appeared on a map in 1867, and &quot;Salton Station&quot; is on a railroad map from 1900, although this place had existed as a rail stop since the late 1870s. Until the advent of the modern sea, the Salton Sink was the site of a major salt-mining operation.

===Modern formation===

In 1900, under Governor James Budd, the California Development Company began construction of irrigation canals to divert water from the Colorado River into the Salton Sink, a dry lake bed. After construction of these irrigation canals, the Salton Sink became fertile, allowing farmers to plant crops.

Within two years, the Alamo Canal became filled with silt from the Colorado River. Engineers tried to alleviate the blockages to no avail. Imperial Valley farmers, under considerable financial stress, pressured the California Development Company to resolve the problem. Engineer Charles Rockwood, faced with bankruptcy and &quot;after mature deliberation&quot;, directed the construction of a breach in the bank of the Colorado River approximately south of the existing wooden headgates (the Chaffey Gate).

The breach, known as the Lower Mexican Intake and constructed without headgates and without the permission of the Mexican authorities, allowed the Colorado River to flow unimpeded into the canal and then to Imperial Valley farms. Rockwood&#x27;s action in ordering the breach was later described as a &quot;blunder so serious as to be practically criminal.&quot;

In 1905, heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the Colorado River to swell, overrunning the third intake cut into the bank of the river and sending the flood into the Alamo Canal. The resulting flood poured down the canal and down two formerly dry arroyos, the New River in the west and the Alamo River in the east, each about long. Over about two years, these two newly created rivers carried the entire volume of the Colorado River into the Salton Sink.

The Southern Pacific Railroad tried to stop the flooding by dumping earth into the canal&#x27;s headgates area, but the effort was not fast enough, and the river eroded deeper and deeper into the dry desert sand of the Imperial Valley. A large waterfall formed as a result and began cutting rapidly upstream along the path of the Alamo Canal that now was occupied by the Colorado. This waterfall was initially high but grew to high before the flow through the breach was stopped. Originally, the waterfall was feared to recede upstream to the true main path of the Colorado, becoming up to high, when it would be practically impossible to stop the flow.

As the basin filled, the town of Salton, a Southern Pacific Railroad siding, the New Liverpool Salt Company facility and miniature railroad, and Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation were submerged. Established in 1876, nearly half of the reservation was eventually flooded as the Indigenous people packed their belongings and headed into the mountains. The influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea. On February 11, 1907, the breach was finally closed after substantial intervention by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company.

===Agriculture, tourism and wildlife proliferate===
In the 1920s, agriculture had boomed in the valley as the Imperial Irrigation District delivered large quantities of Colorado River water to irrigate the crops. The lake would have dried up naturally, but with flood irrigation being commonly used, plenty of water ran off the farms into the lake and kept it full. The district holds senior rights to water from the Colorado River according to Doctrine of Prior Appropriation, which states that whoever first puts a quantity of water from a given source to beneficial use gains the right to use that quantity of water from that source in future.&lt;ref name=&quot;TNY 2015/05/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, a wildlife refuge was established on some wetlands along the edge of the lake that had attracted many birds. The fish flourished in the lake and provided a source of food for massive populations of migratory birds. Birdwatchers flocked to this new refuge in the middle of a desert.

The continuing intermittent flooding of the Imperial Valley from the Colorado River ended with the construction of Hoover Dam. Imperial Dam, built in 1938, serves as a desilting dam for water entering the irrigation canals.

In the 1950s and into the 1960s, the communities expanded as the area&#x27;s reputation as a resort destination and sport fishery grew. Hotels and yacht clubs were built on the shore along with homes and schools. Resorts in communities like Bombay Beach hosted entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys and Bing Crosby. Yacht clubs held parties at night and golf courses provided recreation. Many people came for boating activities such as water skiing and fishing as stocked fish proliferated. Lakeshore communities grew as vacation homes were built. More than 1.5 million visitors visited annually at the peak.

===Catastrophic decline===
In the 1970s, scientists issued warnings about the changes coming to this lake with no outlet. Studies that started in the 1960s found a complex problem for which any remediation would be expensive. The Imperial Valley has about of farmland for which flood irrigation is typical. Water from the Colorado River is diverted near Yuma, Arizona, into the All-American Canal. The canal runs west along the Mexican border and then north into of irrigation channels that crisscross the farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPPC 2015/06/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity carries the agricultural runoff downhill through the New and Alamo rivers to the lake. The water is full of salts, selenium, and fertilizers (mainly nitrates). As it drains through the soil, the water leaches out ancient salt deposits that also raise the salinity. Evaporation in the desert heat further concentrates the salt. The transformation of the lake made it increasingly inhospitable to wildlife. By the late 1970s, fish started dying off and bird populations declined.

In the late 1970s, a series of heavy tropical storms caused the water level to rapidly rise and flood its banks. The surrounding towns and businesses were severely damaged, many beyond repair. In 1976, Hurricane Kathleen inundated the lakeshore communities and put Bombay Beach completely underwater. Tourism was drastically reduced, and many of the resorts and associated infrastructure were abandoned. The state began to issue odor advisories as the lake began to stink.

In the 1990s, the shores were littered with dead fish as the lake had gotten so salty that large die-offs occurred. Fertilizers in the runoff caused massive blooms of algae. When storms churned the lake, botulism spread among the dying tilapia, which were eaten by the birds. During a four-month long period in 1996, 14,000 birds died from eating the fish, nearly 10,000 of which were pelicans. The carcasses were burned in an incinerator 24 hours per day for weeks. The resulting news coverage conveyed a simplified story that implied the lake was a toxic catastrophe filled with water that could be deadly.

In 1995, Congressman Sonny Bono advocated for attention to the problems. His wife and some politicians took up the cause as a form of tribute to Bono after his death in a 1998 skiing accident. Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Salton Sea Reclamation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-372). In 1999, the lake began to recede dramatically. The dropping water level stranded many of the remaining boat docks, residences, and businesses. Water-management priorities were changing including diverting water from agricultural areas to cities. The U.S. Department of the Interior prepared a draft Environmental Impact Report in compliance with the Reclamation Act and working in partnership with the Salton Sea Authority. A Strategic Science Plan and the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Alternatives Appraisal Report were also added to the voluminous studies of the lake. Before the legislative and scientific recommendations were implemented, priorities shifted away from activities at the lake after the September 11 attacks in 2001.

In 2003, the Imperial Irrigation District signed the largest agriculture-to-urban water transfer agreement in US history. Much of its water allocation would go to communities along the California coast at a profit. With a 45-year term, the Quantification Settlement Agreement was a means for the San Diego County Water Authority and other districts to obtain additional water for the growing communities they serve. Local agriculture became more efficient at using water which resulted in the shoreline retreating as less run-off flowed into the lake. Farmers installed sprinklers to replace flood irrigation and used soil measurement devices that tell them when to water. As the Salton Sea shrank, it became saltier than ocean water. The California State Legislature, by legislation enacted in 2003 and 2004, directed the secretary of the California Resources Agency to prepare a restoration plan for the Salton Sea ecosystem, and an Environmental Impact Report. The Salton Sea Authority had a consultant study the alternatives and in 2004 issued their preferred alternative. After receiving comments from other agencies, they approved a new report in 2006. They hoped the reports would influence the state as it prepared the proposal mandated by the legislature.

The state released an $8.9-billion proposal in 2007 that involved building a horseshoe-shaped outer lake, a berm crossing the center of the lake and an extensive system of dikes, channels and pumps. Due to their concerns about the impact on the lake, the district only approved the water transfer agreement after Governor Gray Davis had signed the 2003 legislation known as the Salton Sea Restoration Act. It stated that it was the &quot;intent of the Legislature that the State of California undertake the restoration of the Salton Sea ecosystem and the permanent protection of the wildlife dependent on that ecosystem&quot;. The restoration plan was not implemented as state lawmakers found it too expensive and the Great Recession hit the economy. Repeated delays and dwindling public interest precluded any real change.

===Exposed lakebed impacts air quality===
The lake continued to dry up, exposing more lake bed known as playa, and sending nearby communities clouds of toxic dust. A haze incorporating pesticide plumes, exhaust fumes, factory emissions, and the vaporized dust from the lake regularly hangs over the communities in the valley. With a dense blend of ozone and particulate matter, Imperial County became known for some of the worst air quality in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verg 2018/6/6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Coachella communities have disproportionately higher rates of asthma and respiratory complications because of high concentrations of contaminants in the air. Over 20% of the children in the region have asthma (with the national rate being less than 10%). Scientists are studying how much of this is caused by the Salton Sea dust and what is actually in the windblown particles. Ten schools in the Imperial Valley use green, yellow, and red flags signaling air quality for the many children who have asthma. Green means they join their friends on the playground, whereas red means they stay inside all day. Parents can also receive emailed alerts from the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District. Local activists ask if this is an issue of environmental justice, since the area most impacted is 85% Latinos.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPBS 2021/mar/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some 650,000 people, many who are farmworkers, live where there is significant exposure to the dust. The public health impacts of continuing not to meet federal air quality standards include the treatment of child and adult asthma, cardiac disease, lung cancer, and increased mortality rates. Lower concentrations of the wind-borne dust travel all the way into Southern California and Arizona. Residents in the Los Angeles Basin, some away, complained about the odor that drifted their way in 2012, after the biomass on the sea bottom was churned by a storm.

During the first 15 years after the sale of the Imperial water to San Diego County, the Imperial Irrigation District has been required to put water into the Salton Sea to compensate for the loss of agricultural runoff needed to replenish the sea. As the 2017 deadline for ending the additional mitigation water approached, the district, along with Imperial County, petitioned the California State Water Resources Control Board in 2014 with a demand for state action to fulfill its obligation after years of delays and unfulfilled plans. Pacific Institute, an environmental think tank, was warning that the lack of replenishment water was leading to a &quot;period of very rapid deterioration.&quot; The rapidly shrinking sea was a &quot;looming environmental and public health crisis&quot;. With the increased shrinkage, dust storms would increase and the rotten-egg smell would reach the coastal cities more frequently.

About , or about 10%, of Imperial Valley&#x27;s arable farmland was temporarily fallowed to meet the reductions in the water transfer agreement. Since the most recent creation of the lake, local farms in the Imperial Valley have produced alfalfa, wheat, and vegetables such as carrots and Brussels sprouts. , the most widely planted crop was alfalfa, followed by bermuda grass and sudan grass. A third of the hay produced here was exported to China, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Japan. Most of exported hay feeds dairy cows, while Japan uses it for Kobe beef production.

On January 1, 2018, 40% less water began flowing into the sea as the 15-year mitigation period ended per the 2003 water transfer agreement. A court decision also forced the Imperial Irrigation District to end a program that had allowed it to equally distribute and cap the amount of water its members receive. Although it had been shrinking for years, this began to lower the water level significantly. As the shore recedes, at least of playa will be exposed by 2045, with additional dust becoming wind blown as the exposed playa dries out. A vertical drop of one foot in the water level can expose thousands of feet of horizontal playa. The state is mainly responsible, as California lawmakers pledged to fund air-quality management projects to mitigate impacts from the 2003 water transfer agreement. Over the years, local, state and federal bodies have found minimal success dealing with the dust from the exposed playa. To reduce wind-borne dust, the district has a program known as vegetation enhancement and surface roughening, which includes plowing furrows on newly exposed playa within property owned by the district.

Fugitive dust, consisting of very small particles suspended in the air, is being studied to distinguish between playa dust and desert emissions that are primarily made up of mineral dust from soil. The Imperial County Air Quality Management District, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and the University of California at Riverside School of Medicine along with the environmental justice group Comite Civico Del Valle are using mobile and stationary air quality monitoring units in the effort to protect the health of the nearby residents.

==Management programs==
The Salton Sea Task Force was formed by the state in 2015 by Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s administration. The Natural Resources Agency released the Salton Sea Management Program (SSMP) in March 2017. The SSMP proposed constructing of habitat restoration and dust suppression projects on lakebed areas that have been, or will be, exposed at the Salton Sea by the year 2028. This would improve conditions for residents and wildlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2020/01/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The initial 10-year plan will cover less than half of the dry lakebed that researchers say will be exposed during that time. The state initially budgeted $80.5 million to begin designing the wetlands without a commitment that the program will ever be fully funded. The projected cost to design and construct the improvements is $383 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2017/03/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was no longer on restoring the lake but presenting a feasible plan with a budget that legislators would gradually fund over the ten-year period. The 10-year plan will not fix everything so state and local officials continue to seek ways to deal with the problems. Salton Sea Management Program Monitoring and Adaptive Management Implementation Plan is being developed that will prioritize and phase-in implementation of the 2013 USGS Salton Sea Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment Plan.

The first state-funded project was the Torres-Martinez Wetland Project, in which the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians partnered with the state to restore shallow wetlands along the northern edge of the sea that was destroyed by a massive storm in 2012. This prototype project was completed in April 2018.

In November 2019, an emergency was declared because of the &quot;heavily polluted New River, which empties into the Salton Sea&quot;. The Imperial County Board of Supervisors were hoping that this would accelerate the restoration projects by enabling the state to obtain federal funding. Nearly all the state&#x27;s funding comes from bond measures for the Salton Sea projects. Since 2000, California voters have approved five bond measures .

In February 2020, the California Natural Resources Agency finished the &quot;Bruchard Road Dust Suppression Project&quot; which, although only , was the first dust suppression project to be completed under the Salton Sea Management Program: Phase 1: 10 Year Plan (August 2018). Construction began on the ambitious Species Conservation Habitat (SCH) Project in January 2021 on the small delta of the New River. The project is building ponds and wetlands on both sides of the mouth of this highly polluted river on the southern bank of the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2021/01/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Water from the Salton Sea will be combined with the river water to control salinity and naturally occurring selenium. While creating a dust reducing wetlands, the blended water will achieve the proper conditions for the desert pupfish and other aquatic life. Federal government said in November 2022, it will spend $250 million over four years for the project. In October 2024, expanding the SCH project by was announced with the allocation of $70 million in federal funding for improving drought infrastructure.

===Water importation review===
Many concepts have been proposed on how to deal with the problems. The idea of importing seawater from the Pacific Ocean or the Sea of Cortez in Mexico has been around for a long time. The area&#x27;s plentiful geothermal power could be used to desalinate the water. Around 2004, Aqua Genesis Ltd proposed such a project that would sell the nonsaline water. Their proposal involved the construction of over of pipes and tunneling that would have provided of water to Southern California coastal cities each year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has a subsidiary that already operates 10 geothermal plants in the area, and was developing a seawater desalination proposal.

In 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency requested proposals to increase waterflow to the sea to reduce dust and dust-borne toxins. The 11 proposals ranged in cost from $300 million to several billion dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2018/04/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a 2020 research report stated that the cost of &quot;transferring water from agricultural users to the Salton Sea&quot; would be lower and achievable using existing infrastructure.

The aqueduct proposal, and others, hung on the outcome of a feasibility study. After a yearlong review, in 2022 a state-appointed panel of experts rejected the idea &quot;based on its high cost, environmental damage, minimal benefits to Mexico&quot; and other factors, recommending instead that fresh water be diverted to the sea. However, the Colorado River &quot;is facing an unprecedented water crisis due to prolonged drought, climate change and an overallocation of its resources&quot;.

==Ecology==
===Salinity===

The water of the Salton Sea has a salinity of 44 grams of salt per liter, greater than that of the Pacific Ocean (35 g/L). The lack of an outflow means the Salton Sea does not have a natural stabilization system; it is very dynamic. Fluctuations in the water level caused by variations in agricultural runoff, the ancient salt deposits in the lake bed, and the relatively high salinity of the inflow feeding the sea are all causing increasing salinity. The concentration has been increasing at a rate of about 3% per year. About 3.6 million tonnes of salt are deposited in the valley each year. An undated report on the University of California: Imperial County website provides these specifics: &quot;Salton Sea salinity is about 44,000 mg/L, that is about 4.4% salt. The amount of salts that is deposited in the Imperial Valley agricultural land with irrigation water is about 4 million tons of salts annually. To maintain crop productivities, equal amount of salts must be leached from the root zone&quot;.

Fertilizer runoffs have resulted in eutrophication, with large algal blooms and elevated bacterial levels. By the 1970s, the runoff which was full of salty chemicals led to a warning that the salinity of the lake would no longer sustain wildlife. Both the hypersalinity and the presence of contaminants in the Salton Sea triggered massive die-offs in the fish and avian populations; salt water carries less oxygen than fresh water, which was further depleted by algal blooms and by extreme temperatures during the summer.

===Fish population===

The desert pupfish is the only native fish species in the sea and is a federally listed endangered species. The desert pupfish, notable for its ability to withstand the rising salinity of the Salton Sea, can survive salinities ranging from freshwater to twice as salty as seawater. The pupfish have adapted to the Imperial Irrigation District’s drains, which funnel water runoff from farms into the Salton Sea.

The body was initially a freshwater lake and was stocked with tilapia, gulf croaker, orangemouth corvina, and sargo, which sustained an important sport fishery and provided food for birds. By the 1960s, its rising salinity had begun to jeopardize some of these species. A September 2019 report stated that 20 years earlier, &quot;there were some 100 million fish in the Sea. Now, more than 97% of those fish are gone&quot;. It is now too saline for most species of fish. Massive fish kills involve the oxygen-depleting combination of summer sun and salt. The fish suffocate as salt water carries less oxygen than fresh water. Dead fish wash up in mass quantities on the beaches.

Introduced tilapia (hybrid Mozambique × Wami) can tolerate the high salinity levels and pollution. As of 2014, other fresh and brackish water fish species lived in the rivers and canals that fed the Salton Sea, including redbelly tilapia, threadfin shad, carp, red shiner, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, mosquitofish, and sailfin molly.

Tilapia populations have reached such low volumes such that the fish-eating birds in the area cannot be sustained anymore. Scientists have approximated that if the sea&#x27;s salinity reaches levels of 70 parts per thousand (more likely to occur than not due to the end of mitigation flows at the start of 2018), there will not be any species of fish left that will be able to survive in the sea&#x27;s main body. As the decline of tilapia populations continues, there has been an immense proliferation of the water boatman population which do serve as feed for &quot;a limited number of aquatic and shorebird species&quot;. A direct concern of the potential eradication of fish species from the sea include mosquito production, which is usually abundant in high salinity salt marshes but have been low because of the presence of fish. There have been worries about this potential outcome as mosquitoes in warm regions have been known to &quot;act as vectors of West Nile virus, Western equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis&quot;.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Salton Sea based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species. As of 2018, all species were considered acceptable for all populations.

===Avian population===
The Salton Sea has been termed a &quot;crown jewel of avian biodiversity&quot; by Milt Friend of the Salton Sea Science Office. It hosts &quot;the most diverse and probably most significant populations of bird life in the continental United States, rivaled only by Big Bend, Texas;&quot; over 400 species have been documented. The Salton Sea is also a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway. A December 2018 report by the National Geographic Society stated: &quot;Nearly all of California&#x27;s population of eared grebes, for example, stop over at the lake, and at least a third of all the white pelicans living in North America ...&quot; The report expressed concern about the reducing input of water into the Sea and the increasing salinity. &quot;Without that extra water, the lake&#x27;s shrinking will start to accelerate—making it saltier, smaller, less welcoming to the birds that rely on it during migration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG 2018/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the hypersalinity and presence of contaminants in the Salton Sea triggered massive die-offs in the fish and avian populations and the contamination promoted the outbreak and spread of diseases such as avian cholera. In turn, the loss of several species of fish that the avian population depended on for food increased their risk of starvation, exacerbating their decline. Birdwatchers in 2017 reported that most of the American white pelicans, double-crested cormorants, and eared grebes have disappeared.

The Salton Sea is notable as the only part of the United States to host a significant population of Yellow-footed gulls, a species otherwise endemic to the Gulf of California. Most of these gulls are only present in the summer months.

===Vegetation===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, the area roughly within of the sandy shoreline of the Salton Sea would have a saltbush/greasewood (&quot;40&quot;) vegetation type and a Great Basin shrubland (&quot;7&quot;) vegetation form.

==Geography==

This saline, endorheic rift lake on the San Andreas Fault at the southern end of the U.S. state of California lies between and within the Imperial and Coachella valleys, all of which lie within the larger Salton Trough, a pull-apart basin that stretches to the Gulf of California in Mexico. The lake occupies the lowest elevations of the trough, known as the Salton Sink, where the lake surface is below sea level as of January 2018. The deepest point of the lake is only higher than the lowest point of Death Valley.

The Salton Sea is about at its widest and longest, though it varies in dimensions and area with fluctuations in agricultural runoff and rainfall. A 2023 report puts surface area at 318 square miles. The New, Whitewater, and Alamo rivers, combined with agricultural runoff, are the primary sources that feed the lake. The Salton Sea is the largest lake in California by surface area.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2019/03/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual inflow is less than , which is enough to maintain a maximum depth of and a total volume of about . Due to changes in water apportionments agreed upon for the Colorado River under the Quantification Settlement Agreement of 2003, the surface area of the sea had been expected to decrease by 60% between 2013 and 2021.

===Ownership ===
The land under the lake is a patchwork of ownership spread across three primary entities: the federal government (mostly the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Land Management), the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Salton Sea has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone is 9b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 28.5 °F (−1.9 °C). The temperature of the surface water changes with the seasonally varying air temperature. Winter surface water can reach temperatures as low as and summer surface water highs can reach .
==Geology==
===Earthquakes and tectonic setting===

The Salton Sea and surrounding basin sits over the San Andreas Fault, San Jacinto Fault, Imperial Fault Zone, and a &quot;stepover fault&quot; shear zone system. Geologists have determined that previous flooding episodes from the Colorado River have been linked to earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault. Sonar and other instruments were used to map the Salton Sea&#x27;s underwater faults during the study. During the period when the basin was filled by Lake Cahuilla, a much larger inland sea, earthquakes higher than magnitude 7 occurred roughly every 180 years, the last one occurring within decades of 1700. Computer models suggest the normal faults in the area are most vulnerable to deviatoric stress loading by filling in of water. Currently, a risk still exists for an earthquake of magnitude 7 to 8. Simulations also showed, in the Los Angeles area, shaking and thus damage would be more severe for a San Andreas earthquake that propagated along the fault from the south, rather than from the north. Such an earthquake also raises the risk for soil liquefaction in the Imperial Valley region.

The effective drainage divide that separates the Salton Sea from the Gulf of California is about in elevation and is located near Delta, northeastern Baja California State, Mexico, south-southeast of Mexicali. Past sea level rise may partially be responsible for the salinity of the lake, while potential future changes in sea levels could occur. However, other factors such as hydrothermal vents, diffusion of salt from minerals and sediment, including concentrated brine, and evaporites are another contributor to salinity, as is the recent lowering of lake levels raising the salinity, though sedimentary records show the lake surface elevation reached levels above world sea level in the 1500s.

===Satellite calibration===
The Salton Sea is used to calibrate sensors on imaging satellites such as Landsat.

===Heat and minerals===

Evidence of geothermal activity is visible. The Salton Buttes are volcanoes in the geothermal field of the same name. Mudpots and mud volcanoes are found on the eastern side of the Salton Sea, including the mobile Niland Geyser.

The area is used for geothermal electricity generation, with plants located along the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea in Imperial County.

The geothermal activity below the Salton Sea loosens up lithium that can be mined. Due to increased demand for lithium, which is crucial for electric-vehicle battery production, the Salton Sea area is attracting attention, and the extraction of lithium is expected to boost the local economy. The California Energy Commission estimates the Salton Sea might produce 600k metric tons of lithium carbonate () per year, of a reserve of 3.4 million tonnes. A vast reserve of lithium near the Salton Sea amounts to roughly one third of the global supply. Several groups have advocated using the newfound interest in the Salton Sea to facilitate restoration efforts.

The Salton Sea geothermal brine reservoir is located at depths of approximately below ground and contains fluids at temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 380 °C. Among valuable minerals the brine contains lithium (202 ppm ± 20%, i.e. more than in the Dead Sea, which is 30–40 ppm), rubidium (110 ppm ± 47%), caesium (19.8 ppm ± 15%), bromine (91 ppm ± 31% vs 5000 ppm in the Dead Sea). The lake also comprises chloride, sodium, calcium, potassium and other low-value minerals, that are difficult to separate. All these minerals add up to the total salinity of 24.3 ± 2.8%.

==Communities==
The US Navy conducted a preliminary inspection of the Salton Sea in January 1940, and the Salton Sea Test Base (SSTB, run by Sandia Labs) was initially commissioned as the Naval Auxiliary Air Station Salton Sea, in October 1942. The SSTB, just to the southeast of Salton City, originally functioned as an operational and training base for seaplanes. Additional activities at the base included experimental testing of solid-fuel plane-launched rockets, jet-assist take-off testing, aeroballistic testing of inert atomic weapon test units at land and marine target areas, training bombing at marine targets, testing of the effects of long-term storage on atomic weapons, testing of the Project Mercury space capsule parachute landing systems, parachute training and testing, and military training exercises. The base was abandoned in 1978.

The Salton Sea had some success as a resort area, with Salton City, Salton Sea Beach, and Desert Shores, on the western shore and Desert Beach, North Shore, and Bombay Beach, built on the eastern shore in the 1950s. Due to the increasing salinity and pollution of the lake over the years from agricultural runoff and other sources, the communities substantially shrank in size, or have been abandoned. The smell of the lake, combined with the stench of the decaying fish, also contributed to the decline of the tourist industry around the Salton Sea. The US Geological Survey describes the smell as &quot;objectionable&quot;, &quot;noxious&quot;, &quot;unique&quot;, and &quot;pervasive&quot;.

===Arts and culture===
A 2020 article provided this comment about the settlements around the Salton Sea: Since 2011, Bombay Beach and its surrounds have been reinvented as a destination for desert art. It&#x27;s not alone in that distinction – south of the city lie the towns of Niland and Slab City, other areas that have attracted artists and led to creations like East Jesus and Salvation Mountain.

Some people are visiting the Salton Sea and the surrounding settlements to explore the abandoned structures and see the squatter settlement of Slab City. The town of Niland is southeast of the sea, with a population of 1,006. In late June 2020, a fire in Niland caused a great deal of damage, displacing 112 people; by that time, the estimated population had diminished to 500.

The population of Bombay Beach declined for years and the buildings were rotting away, but some people had moved into the settlement. A news item in April 2018 stated that it was &quot;enjoying a rebirth of sorts with an influx of artists, intellectuals and hipsters who have turned it into a bohemian playground&quot;. Many of the derelict structures and empty lots in the small settlement have been converted into elaborate art installations, including a large collection of elaborate sculptures built on the ruins of the former waterfront south of the dike. The 2016 dystopian film The Bad Batch used the area as a filming location for its surreal wasteland setting.

The roads and house foundations around the Salton Sea are starting to fail due to increased seismic activity and soil erosion. Bridges on Highway 86 are routinely separating from the roads and dangerously uneven pavement is constantly needing to be addressed. Deadly accidents are increasing as a result of road conditions and the influx of sandstorms in the area.

==Recreation==
The Salton Sea State Recreation Area offers hunting, fishing, swimming, and camping to visitors on the northeastern side of the sea.

===Powerboat racing===
&quot;Low barometric pressure and greater water density make the Salton Sea the fastest body of water in the world for speedboat racing,&quot; according to an article in the January–February 1950 issue of &quot;National Motorist&quot; magazine. (This statement, however, erroneously conflates low barometric pressure with low altitude, when in fact the opposite is true, and the extremely low altitude of the region provides &quot;higher&quot; barometric pressure, beneficial for internal combustion engines) &quot;The low altitude was thought to be ideal for carburetion and there was talk that this was the &#x27;fastest body of water in the world.&#x27;&quot; Beginning in the late 1920s, these properties have made the Salton Sea attractive as a venue for such races.

Although these natural advantages were at first attacked as unfair by other courses, by the mid 1930s the Salton Sea racing organization was backed by the National Power Boat Association and attracting some of the best boats and drivers in the US. Races were held at Desert Beach annually between 1941 and 1951 and subsequently at other beaches, ultimately on the west side of the Sea.

From 1961 through 1965, the Sea hosted the Salton City 500, a marathon endurance race which attracted drivers as notable as Mickey Thompson and astronaut Gordon Cooper.

After a lengthy hiatus, in 2008 racing returned when new world records were set by a sprint boat at the Salton Sea Speed Week.

<text>Francis Philip Fleming (September 28, 1841December 20, 1908) was an American Democratic politician who served as the 15th governor of Florida from 1889 to 1893. A Confederate soldier and lawyer before Governor, Fleming&#x27;s &quot;racist record is undisputed&quot;.

==Biography==
Fleming was born September 28, 1841, in Panama Park (now part of Jacksonville), Duval County, Florida. He spent his early years with his parents, Lewis Fleming and his second wife Margaret Seton, on their St. Johns River plantation, &quot;Hibernia&quot;. The plantation narrowly escaped destruction at the hands of the Independent Battalion, Massachusetts Cavalry in mid-April 1864 when Colonel Guy V. Henry, a relative of the Fleming family, ordered it spared.

During the American Civil War, Fleming served the Confederate cause by enlisting as a private in the 2nd Florida Regiment and received a battlefield promotion to first lieutenant, and subsequently to the rank of captain. After being wounded, Fleming returned to Florida and actively enlisted new volunteers, commanding a volunteer company at the Battle of Natural Bridge at St. Marks on March 6, 1865. By the end of the war, Fleming had served under four generals: John Magruder, Joseph Johnston, John Bell Hood, and Robert E. Lee.

After the war, Francis Fleming studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1868, becoming a partner in the firm of Fleming and Daniel, later Fleming and Fleming. In 1871, he married Floride Lydia Pearson, the daughter of Florida Supreme Court justice Bird M. Pearson. Together the couple had three children: Francis Philip Jr., Elizabeth Fleming, and Charles Seton.

Francis P. Fleming authored a book memorializing his brother, titled &quot;The Florida Troops/A Memoir of Captain C. Seton Fleming C.S.A.&quot;, originally published by Times-Union Publishing House, Jacksonville, Florida, 1884. Its preface includes: &quot;The preparation of the following pages was not commenced with the design of publication; but for the purpose of collecting and preserving in manuscript form, a brief memoir of one, in whose life was combined all the elements of true nobility, with that daring heroism which characterized his service as a soldier, during the most eventful period of this country&#x27;s history, which I felt might be read with profit and pleasure by kindred of another generation.&quot; Original copies are quite rare.

Fleming later entered politics, and became the fifteenth Governor of Florida on January 8, 1889, serving until January 3, 1893, the sole term provided by state law at that time. Notable events during Fleming&#x27;s term include:
* The creation of a state Board of Health to stop a yellow fever epidemic that was sweeping the state;
* The repeal of the Florida Railroad Commission, at the urging of railroad baron Henry Flagler;
* The start of a reorganization of higher education institutions;
* Adjustment of state revenues;
* The Farmers&#x27; Alliance movement;
* The 1891 reelection dispute of Senator Wilkinson Call.

Fleming later advocated adding a red saltire or diagonal cross, a Confederate war flag symbol, to the Florida flag, in order to distinguish it from a flag of surrender (the flag at that time was a white flag with the Florida seal in the center). This proposal was adopted in 1900 by a statewide whites-only referendum. Fleming also began the tradition of having an official portrait painted and hung in the Florida State Capitol.

After he left office, Fleming served on the board of trustees of the new Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home. On December 20, 1908, Fleming died following a long illness. He is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Jacksonville.

==Facts==
Fleming was the son of Lewis Fleming (1798–1862) and his second wife, Margaret Seton. He was the great-grandson of Francis Philip Fatio, a Swiss-born planter in Florida in both the British and Spanish colonial periods.

Fleming Island, Florida (an un-incorporated community in between Orange Park and Green Cove Springs in Clay County, Florida, was part of the Fleming family&#x27;s Spanish Land Grants. The area has since retained the name Fleming Island.

The former governor and his wife, Floride, are buried in The Old City Cemetery, Jacksonville, Florida.

University Athletic Field, the original football facility at the University of Florida (UF), was renamed &quot;Fleming Field&quot; after a 1915 renovation at the urging of the late governor&#x27;s son, Francis P. Fleming Jr., who served on the university&#x27;s Board of Control and was a UF alumnus. The venue was replaced by much larger Florida Field in 1930, but the grassy area to the north of the current stadium is still known as Fleming Field.

<text>Sea spiders are marine arthropods of the class Pycnogonida, hence they are also called ]]pycnogonids(; named after &quot;[[Pycnogonum]]&quot;, the [[type genus]]; with the suffix&#x27;). The class include the only now-living order Pantopoda ( ‘all feet’), alongside a few fossil species which could trace back to the early or mid Paleozoic. They are cosmopolitan, found in oceans around the world. The over 1,300 known species have leg spans ranging from to over . Most are toward the smaller end of this range in relatively shallow depths; however, they can grow to be quite large in Antarctic and deep waters.

Despite their name and brief resemblance, &quot;sea spiders&quot; are not spiders, nor even arachnids. While some literature around the 2000s suggests they may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, their traditional classification as a member of chelicerates alongside horseshoe crabs and arachnids has regained wide support in subsequent studies.

== Morphology ==

Many sea spiders are recognised by their enormous walking legs in contrast to a reduced body region, resulting into the so-called &quot;all legs&quot; or &quot;no body&quot; appearance. The body segments (somites) are generally interpreted as three main sections (tagma): cephalon (head, aka cephalosoma), trunk (aka thorax) and abdomen. However, the definition of cephalon and trunk might differ between literature (see text), and some studies might follow a prosoma (=cephalon+trunk)–opisthosoma (=abdomen) definition, aligning to the tagmosis of other chelicerates. The exoskeleton of the body is tube-like, lacking the dorsoventral division (tergite and sternite) seen in most other arthropods.

The cephalon is formed by the fusion of ocular somite and four anterior segments behind it (somite 1–4). It consists of an anterior proboscis, a dorsal ocular tubercle with eyes, and up to four pairs of appendages (chelifores, palps, s and first walking legs). Although some literature might consider the segment carrying the first walking leg (somite 4) to be part of the trunk, it is completely fused to the remaining head section to form a single cephalic tagma. The proboscis has three-fold symmetry, terminating with a typically Y-shaped mouth (vertical slit in Austrodecidae). It usually has fairly limited dorsoventral and lateral movement. However In those species that have reduced chelifores and palps, the proboscis is well developed and flexible, often equipped with numerous sensory bristles and strong rasping ridges around the mouth. The proboscis is unique to pycnogonids, and its exact homology with other arthropod mouthparts is enigmatic, as well as its relationship with the absence of labrum (preoral upper lip of ocular somite) in pycnogonid itself. The ocular tubercle has up to two pairs of simple eyes (ocelli) on it, though sometimes the eyes can be reduced or missing, especially among species living in the deep oceans. All of the eyes are median eyes in origin, homologous to the median ocelli of other arthropods, while the lateral eyes (e.g. compound eyes) found in most other arthropods are completely absent.

In adult pycnogonids, the chelifores (aka cheliphore), palps and ovigers (aka ovigerous legs) are variably reduced or absent, depending on taxa and sometimes sex. Nymphonidae is the only family where all of three pairs are always functional. The ovigers can be reduced or missing in females, but are present in almost all males. In a functional condition, the chelifores terminate with a pincer (chela) formed by two segments (podomeres), like the chelicerae of most other chelicerates. The scape (peduncle) behind the pincer is usually unsegmented, but could be bisegmented in some species, resulting into a total of three or four chelifore segments. The palps and ovigers have up to 9 and 10 segments respectively, but can have fewer even when in a functional condition. The palps are rather featureless and never have claws in adult Pantopoda, while the ovigers may or may not possess a terminal claw and rows of specialised spines on its curved distal segments (strigilis). The chelifores are used for feeding and the palps are used for sensing and manipulating food items, while the ovigers are used for cleaning themselves, with the additional function of carrying offspring in males. 


The leg-bearing somites (somite 4 and all trunk somites, the alternatively defined &quot;trunk/thorax&quot;) are either segmented or fused to each other, carrying the walking legs via a series of lateral processes (lateral tubular extension of the somites). In most species, the legs are much larger than the body in both length and volume, only being shorter and more slender than the body in Rhynchothoracidae. Each leg is typically composed of eight tubular segments, commonly known as coxa 1, 2 and 3, femur, tibia 1 and 2, tarsus, and propodus. This terminology, with three coxae, no trochanter, and using the term &quot;propodus&quot;, is unusual for arthropods. However, based on muscular system and serial homology to the podomeres of other chelicerates, they are most likely coxa (=coxa 1), trochanter (=coxa 2), prefemur/basifemur (=coxa 3), postfemur/telofemur (=femur), patella (=tibia 1), tibia (tibia 2) and two tarsomeres (=tarsus and propodus) in origin. The leg segmentation of Paleozoic taxa is a bit different, noticeably they have annulated coxa 1 and are further divided into two types: one with flattened distal (femur and beyond) segments and first leg pair with one less segment than the other leg pairs (e.g. &quot;Palaeoisopus&quot;, &quot;Haliestes&quot;), and another one with an immobile joint between the apparently fourth and fifth segment which altogether might represent a divided femur (e.g. &quot;Palaeopantopus&quot;, &quot;Flagellopantopus&quot;). Each leg terminates with a main claw (aka pretarsus/apotele, the true terminal segment), which may or may not have a pair of auxiliary claws on its base. Most of the joints move vertically, except the joint between coxa 1–2 (coxa-trochanter joint) which provide lateral mobility (promotor-remotor motion), and the joint between tarsus and propodus did not have muscles, just like the subdivided tarsus of other arthropods. There are usually eight (four pairs) legs in total, but a few species have five to six pairs. These are known as polymerous (i.e., extra-legged) species, which are distributed among six genera in the families Pycnogonidae (five pairs in &quot;Pentapycnon&quot;), Colossendeidae (five pairs in &quot;Decolopoda&quot; and &quot;Pentacolossendeis&quot;, six pairs in &quot;Dodecolopoda&quot;) and Nymphonidae (five pairs in &quot;Pentanymphon&quot;, six pairs in &quot;Sexanymphon&quot;).

Several alternatives had been proposed for the position homology of pycnogonid appendages, such as chelifores being protocerebral/homologous to the labrum (see text) or ovigers being duplicated palps. Conclusively, the classic, morphology-based one-by-one alingment to the prosomal appendages of other chelicerates was confirm by both neuroanatomic and genetic evidences. Noticeably, the order of pycnogonid leg pairs are mismatched to those of other chelicerates, starting from the ovigers which are homologous to the first leg pair of arachnids. While the fourth walking leg pair was considered aligned to the variably reduced first opisthosomal segment (somite 7, also counted as part of the prosoma based on different studies and/or taxa) of euchelicerates, the origin of the additional fifth and sixth leg pairs in the polymerous species are still enigmatic. Together with the cephalic position of the first walking legs, the anterior and posterior boundary of pycnogonid leg pairs are not aligned to those of euchelicerate prosoma and opisthosoma, nor the cephalon and trunk of pycnogonid itself.

The abdomen (aka trunk end) does not have any appendages. In Pantopoda it is also called the anal tubercle, which is always unsegmented, highly reduced and almost vestigial, simply terminated by the anus. It is consider to be a remnant of opisthosoma/trunk of other chelicerates, but it is unknown which somite (s) it actually aligned to. So far only Paleozoic species have segmented abdomens (at least up to four segments, presumably somite 8–11 which aligned to opisthosomal segment 2–5 of euchelicerates), with some of them even terminated by a long telson (tail).

== Internal anatomy and physiology ==

A striking feature of pycnogonid anatomy is the distribution of their digestive and reproductive systems. The pharynx inside the proboscis is lined by dense setae, which is possibly related to their feeding behaviour. A pair of gonads (ovaries in female, testes in male) is located dorsally in relation to the digestive tract, but the majority of these organs are branched diverticula throughout the legs because the body is too small to accommodate all of them alone. The midgut diverticula are very long, usually reaching beyond the femur (variably down to tibia 2, tarsus or propodus) of each leg, except in Rhynchothoracidae where they only reach coxa 1. Some species have additional branches (in some &quot;Pycnogonum&quot;) or irregular pouches (in &quot;Endeis&quot;) on the diverticula. There is also a pair of anterior diverticula which corresponds to the chelifores or is inserted into the proboscis in some chelifores-less species. The palps and ovigers never contain diverticula, although some might possess a pair of small diverticula near the bases of these appendages. The gonad diverticula (pedal gonad) reach each femur and open via a gonopore located at coxa 2. The structure and number of the gonopores might differ between sexes (e.g. larger in female, variably absent at the anterior legs of some male). In males, the femur or both femur and tibia possess cement glands.

Pycnogonids do not require a traditional respiratory system (e.g. gills). Instead, gasses are absorbed by the legs via the non-calcareous, porous exoskeleton and transferred through the body by diffusion. The morphology of pycnogonid creates an efficient surface-area-to-volume ratio for respiration to occur through direct diffusion. Oxygen is absorbed by the legs and is transported via the hemolymph to the rest of the body with an open circulatory system. The small, long, thin pycnogonid heart beats vigorously at 90 to 180 beats per minute, creating substantial blood pressure. The beating of the heart drives circulation in the trunk and in the part of the legs closest to the trunk, but is not important for the circulation in the rest of the legs. Hemolymph circulation in the legs is mostly driven by the peristaltic movement of the gut diverticula that extend into every leg, a process called gut peristalsis. In the case of taxa without a heart (e.g. Pycnogonidae), the whole circulatory system is presumed to be solely maintained by gut peristalsis. 

The central nervous system of pycnogonid largely retains a segmented ladder-like structure. It consists of a dorsal brain (supraesophageal ganglion) and a pair of ventral nerve cords, intercepted by the esophagus. The former is a fusion of the first and second brain segments (cerebral ganglia)—protocererum and deutocerebrum—corresponding to the eyes/ocular somite and chelifores/somite 1 respectively. The whole section was rotated during pycnogonid evolution, as the protocerebrum went upward and the deutocerebrum shifted forward. The third commissure is established inferior to the esophagus. This third brain segment, or tritocerebrum (corresponding to the palps/somite 2), is fused to the oviger/somite 3 ganglia instead, which is followed up by the final ovigeral somata in the protonymphon larva of &quot;Pycnogonum litorale&quot;. A series of leg ganglia (somite 4 and so on) develop as molts progress, with incorporation of the first leg ganglia into the subesophageal ganglia in certain taxa. The leg ganglia might shift anteriorly or even cluster together, but are never highly fused into the ring-like synganglion of other chelicerates. The abdominal ganglia are vestigal, absorbed by the preceding leg ganglia during juvenile development.

==Distribution and ecology==

Sea spiders live in many different oceanic regions of the world, from Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific coast of the United States, to the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean Sea, to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as , and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the algae that are found along shorelines.

Sea spiders are benthic in general, usually walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs, but they also capable of swimming by using an umbrella pulsing motion, and some Paleozoic species with flatten legs might even have a nektonic lifestyle. Sea spiders are mostly carnivorous predators or scavengers that feed on soft-bodied invertebrates such as cnidarians, sponges, polychaetes, and bryozoans, by inserting their proboscis into targeted prey item. Although they are known to feed on sea anemones, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a parasite rather than a predator of sea anemones. A few species such as &quot;Nymphonella tapetis&quot; are specialised endoparasites of bivalve mollusks.

Not much is known about the primary predators of sea spiders, if any. At least some species have obvious defensive methods such as amputating and regenerating body parts, or making itself unpleasant meal via high level of ecdysteroids (ecdysis hormone). On the other hand, sea spiders are known to be infected by parasitic gastropod mollusks or hitch‐rided by sessile animals such as goose barnacles, which may negatively affect their locomotion and respiratory efficiency.

=== Reproduction and development ===
All sea spiders have separate sexes, except the only known hermaphroditic species &quot;Ascorhynchus corderoi&quot; and some extremely rare gynandromorph cases. Among all extant families, the Colossendeidae and Austrodecidae are the only two that still lack any observations on their reproductive behaviour and life cycle. Reproduction involves external fertilisation when male and female stack together (usually male on top), exuding sperm and eggs from the gonopores of their respective leg coxae. After fertilisation, males glue the egg cluster with cement glands and using their ovigers (the oviger-lacking &quot;Nulloviger&quot; using only the ventral body wall) to take care of the laid eggs and young.
In most cases, the offsprings hatch as a distinct larval stage known as protonymphon. It has a blind gut and the body consists of a cephalon and its first three pairs of cephalic appendages only: the chelifores, palps and ovigers. In this stage, the chelifores usually have attachment glands, while the palps and ovigers are subequal, three-segmented appendages known as palpal and ovigeral larval limbs. When the larvae moult into the postlarval stage, they undergo transitional metamorphosis: the leg-bearing segments develop and the three pairs of cephalic appendages further develop or reduce. The postlarva eventually metamorphoses into a juvenile that looks like a miniature adult, which will continue to moult into an adult with a fixed number of walking legs. In Pycnogonidae, the ovigers are reduced in juveniles but reappear in oviger-bearing adult males. 

These kind of &quot;head-only&quot; larvae and its anamorphic metamorphosis resemble crustacean nauplius larvae and megacheiran larvae, all together might reflects how the larvae of a common ancestor of all arthropods developed: starting its life as a tiny animal with a few head appendages, while new body segments and appendages were gradually added as it was growing.

Further details of the postembryonic developments of sea spiders vary, but their categorization might differ between literatures. As of the 2010s, there are five types identified as follows:

The type 1 (typical protonymphon) is the most common and possibly an ancestral one. When the type 2 and 5 (attaching larva) hatches it immediately attaches itself to the ovigers of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence. The type 3 (atypical protonymphon) have limited observations. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. The type 4 (encysted larva) is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile.

==Taxonomy==
===Phylogenetic position===
Sea spiders had been interpreted as some kind of arachnids or crustaceans in historical studies. However, after the concept of Chelicerata being established in 20th century, sea spiders have long been considered part of the subphylum, alongside euchelicerate taxa such as Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, ticks, harvestmen and other lesser-known orders).

A competing hypothesis around 2000s proposes that Pycnogonida belong to their own lineage, sister to the lineage lead to other extant arthropods (i.e. euchelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans and hexapods, collectively known as Cormogonida). This Cormogonida hypothesis was first indicated by early phylogenomic analysis aroud that time, followed by another study suggest that the sea spider&#x27;s chelifores are not positionally homologous to the chelicerae of euchelicerates (originated from the deutocerebral segment/somite 1), as was previously supposed. Instead, the chelifore nerves were thought to be innervated by the protocerebrum, the first segment of the arthropod brain which corresponded to the ocular somite, bearing the eyes and labrum. This condition of having paired protocerebral appendages is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in other panarthropods such as onychophoran (primary antennae) and contestably in Cambrian stem-group arthropods like radiodonts (frontal appendages), which was taken as evidence that Pycnogonida may be basal than all other living arthropods, since the protocerebral appendages were thought to be reduced and fused into a labrum in the last common ancestor of crown-group arthropods, and pycnogonids did not have a labrum coexist with the chelifores. If that&#x27;s true, it would have meant the sea spiders are the last surviving (and highly modified) members of an ancient, basal arthropods that originated in Cambrian oceans. However, the basis of this hypothesis was immediately refuted by subsequent studies using Hox gene expression patterns, demonstrated the developmental homology between chelicerae and chelifores, with chelifore nerves innervated by a deuterocerebrum that has been rotated forwards, which was misinterpreted as protocerebrum by the aforementioned study.
Since 2010s, the chelicerate affinity of Pycnogonida regain wide support as the sister group of Euchelicerata. Under the basis of phylogenomics, this is one of the only stable topology of chelicerate interrelationships in contrast to the uncertain relationship of many euchelicerate taxa (e.g. poorly resolved position of arachnid orders other than tetrapulmonates and scorpions; non-monophyly of Arachnida in respect to Xiphosura). This is consistent with the chelifore-chelicera homology, as well as other morphological similarities and differences between pycnogonids and euchelicerates. However, due to pycnogonid&#x27;s highly modified anatomy and lack of intermediate fossils, their evolutional origin and relationship with the basal fossil chelicerates (such as habeliids and &quot;Mollisonia&quot;) are still difficult to compare and interpret.

===Interrelationship===

The class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are split into over 80 genera. All extant genera are considered part of the single order Pantopoda, which was subdivided into 11 families. Historically there are only 9 families, with species of nowadays Ascorhynchidae placed under Ammotheidae and Pallenopsidae under Callipallenidae. Both were eventually separated after they are considered distinct from the once-belonged families.

Phylogenomic analysis of extant sea spiders was able to establish a backbone tree for Pantopoda, revealing some consistent relationship such as the basal position of Austrodecidae, monophyly of some major branches (later redefined as superfamilies) and the paraphyly of Callipallenidae in respect to Nymphonidae. The topology also suggest Pantopoda undergoing multiple times of cephalic appendage reduction/reappearance and polymerous species acquisition, contray to previous hypothesis on pantopod evolution (cephalic appendages were thought to be progressively reduced along the branches, and polymerus condition were though to be ancestral). On the other hand, the position of Ascorhynchidae and &quot;Nymphonella&quot; are less certain across multiple results.

The position of Paleozoic pycnogonids are poorly examined, but most, if not, all of them most likely represent members of stem-group basal than Pantopoda (crown-group Pycnogonida), especially those with segmented abdomen, a feature that was most likely ancestral and reduce in the Pantopoda lineage. While some phylogenetic analysis placing them within Pantopoda, this result is questionable as they have low support values and based on outdated interpretation of the fossil taxa.

According to the World Register of Marine Species, the Class Pycnogonida is subdivided as follows (with subsequent updates on fossil taxa after Sabroux et al. (2023, 2024)):

==Fossil record==

The fossil record of pycnogonids is scant, represented only by a handful of fossil sites with exceptional preservation (Lagerstätte). While most of them are discovered from Paleozoic era, unambiguous evidence of crown-group (Pantopoda) only restricted to Mesozoic era.

The earliest fossils are &quot;Cambropycnogon&quot; discovered from the Cambrian &#x27;Orsten&#x27; of Sweden ( 500 Ma). So far only its protonymphon larvae had been described, featuring some traits unknown from other pycnogonids such as paired anterior projections, gnathobasic larval limbs and annulated terminal appendages. Due to its distinct morphology, some studies have argued that this genus is not a pycnogonid at all.

Ordovician pycnogonids are only known by &quot;Palaeomarachne&quot; (ca. 450 Ma), a genus found in William Lake Provincial Park, Manitoba and described in 2013. It only preserve possible moults of the fragmental body segments, with one showing an apparently segmented head region. However, just like &quot;Cambropycnogon&quot;, its pycnogonid affinity was questioned by some studies as well.

The Silurian Coalbrookdale Formation of England (&quot;Haliestes&quot;, ca. 425 Ma) and the Devonian Hunsrück Slate of Germany (&quot;Flagellopantopus&quot;, &quot;Palaeopantopus&quot;, &quot;Palaeoisopus&quot;, &quot;Palaeothea&quot; and &quot;Pentapantopus&quot;, ca. 400 Ma) include unambigious fossil pycnogonids with exceptional preservation. The latter is by far the most diverse community of fossil pycnogonids in terms of both species number and morphology. Some of them are significant in that they possess something never seen in pantopods: annulated coxae, flatten swimming legs, segmented abdomen and elongated telson. These provide some clues on the evolution of sea spider bodyplan before the arose and diversification of Pantopoda.

Fossil of Mesozoic pycnogonids are even rare, and so far all of them are Jurassic pantopods. Historically there are two genus (&quot;Pentapalaeopycnon&quot; and &quot;Pycnogonites&quot;) from the Solnhofen Limestone (ca. 150 Ma) of Germany being described as such, which are in fact misidentified phyllosoma larvae of decapod crustaceans. The actual first report of Mesozoic pycnogonids was described by researchers from the University of Lyon in 2007, discovering 3 new genus (&quot;Palaeopycnogonides&quot;, &quot;Colossopantopodus&quot; and &quot;Palaeoendeis&quot;) from La Voulte-sur-Rhône of Jurassic La Voulte Lagerstätte (ca. 160 Ma), south-east France. The discovery fill in an enormous fossil gap in the record between Devonian and extant sea spiders. In 2019, a new species of &quot;Colossopantopodus&quot; and a specimen possibly belong to the extant genus &quot;Eurycyde&quot; were discovered from the aforementioned Solnhofen limestone.

<text>Moi dix Mois (lit. &quot;Me Ten Months&quot; in French) is a Japanese visual kei gothic metal band, founded in 2002 by Mana after Malice Mizer paused activities. The guitarist and sole songwriter has been the only constant member in a series of lineup changes, and the band&#x27;s material is released on his own record label .

==History==
March 19, 2002, approximately three months after Malice Mizer announced their indefinite hiatus, Mana announced the formation of his solo project, Moi dix Mois. Their first single, &quot;Dialogue Symphonie&quot;, was released October 19 of the same year.

Moi dix Mois played their first concerts outside Japan in March 2005 in Munich, Germany and Paris, France as part of their Invite to Immorality Tour. After the tour&#x27;s final show on April 24, 2005 in Tokyo, singer Juka left the band.

A new phase of the band began on March 1, 2006, when they released the album, &quot;Beyond the Gate&quot;. This featured a new vocalist named Seth. Before the album was released, Mana indicated that the sound would be the beginning of a renewed direction for the band, possibly more integrated towards electronic music. After the announcement of the &quot;Beyond the Gate&quot; release was made, Seth was revealed as the new vocalist, and it was announced that Kazuno (bass) and Tohru (drums) were both leaving the group.

In June 2006, Moi dix Mois headlined the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig, Germany. They then returned to touring in Japan. A prospective five city tour in the United States was scheduled for July 2006, but cancelled due to the band citing &quot;differences in policies&quot; with the tour organizer; however, Mana did make a U.S. appearance at the 2006 Anime Expo in Anaheim, CA on July 1, where he announced that Moi dix Mois was planning to tour America sometime &quot;within the calendar year&quot;. However, this US tour did not materialize in 2006.

On March 28, 2007, they released their fourth album, &quot;Dixanadu&quot;, the first with the current lineup. On December 27, 2008, Moi dix Mois held the Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~, where they played a session gig along with Mana&#x27;s fellow Malice Mizer guitarist Közi.

They performed at Anime Expo 2009, the largest anime convention in North America, on July 2 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Also in July they went on a short two-gig coupling tour with Közi called Deep Sanctuary, playing on the 17 in Osaka and the 19 in Tokyo. At the V-Rock Festival &#x27;09 on October 24, Moi Dix Mois played two new songs, &quot;Dead Scape&quot; and &quot;The Sect&quot;, and a new version of &quot;The Prophet&quot;.

In July 2010, they went on another tour with Közi, titled Deep Sanctuary II, this time with Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki as a special guest at Akasaka Blitz on the 17. This was the first time in 9 years that the three Malice Mizer members were on stage together. Moi dix Mois&#x27; fifth album, &quot;D+Sect&quot;, was released on December 15, 2010.

On August 27, 2011, Mana announced that Moi dix Mois will be releasing a compilation album as part of their 10th anniversary celebration. The album is composed of re-recordings of older songs, from the group&#x27;s first two albums, by the current line-up. Fans requested which songs were chosen through Mana&#x27;s blog. The album, titled &quot;Reprise&quot;, was released on July 11, 2012 and includes the new song &quot;Je l&#x27;aime&quot;. On April 7, 2012, Moi dix Mois performed at Sakura-Con 2012 in Seattle, Washington.

To celebrate their tenth anniversary, Moi dix Mois held a special concert at Shinjuku Blaze on March 20, 2013. At the end, former members Juka, Kazuno and Tohru reunited with Mana for a one-off performance of the group&#x27;s original lineup.

On May 19, 2014, guitarist K was found dead at his home by relatives. A memorial concert was held on September 15 where Moi dix Mois performed, including the new song &quot;Beast Side&quot; that was composed in memory of the guitarist. His replacement, Ryux formerly from the band Omega Dripp, was announced by Mana on December 3.

In 2023, the band teamed up with Versailles, D and Matenrou Opera for the four-date Japanese Visual Metal tour between September 22 and October 2. The four bands collaborated on the song &quot;Kyōsōkyoku ~Tanbinaru Kettō~&quot;, which was released as a single credited to the JVM Roses Blood Symphony.

==Member history==
Moi dix Mois has experienced numerous lineup changes, with leader and guitarist Mana the only constant member. Vocalist Juka and bassist Kazuno were employed from Moi dix Mois&#x27; conception, with Tohru originally a support drummer. Tohru officially joined with the release of &quot;Shadows Temple&quot; in May 2004. K was introduced as guitarist and &quot;death vocalist&quot; with the Dis Inferno III event in December 2004.

At the end of the Invite to Immorality Tour on April 24, 2005, Juka announced that he would be leaving. A year later, Kazuno and Tohru left with the release of &quot;Beyond the Gate&quot;. At the same time, Seth was announced as being added to the project as their new vocalist.

Sugiya and Hayato provided live support until the release of &quot;Lamentful Miss&quot;, which included them for the first time as full members. After K&#x27;s death in 2014, he was replaced by Ryux.

The current lineup consists of:
* Mana – guitars, keyboards, programming
* Seth – vocals
* Sugiya – bass
* Hayato – drums
* Ryux – guitars

<doc id="440371" wikidata="Q4952096" url="?curid=440371" title="Boy Meets Boy (TV series)">
<text>Boy Meets Boy is an American reality television series broadcast by Bravo. The series ran for six episodes from July 29 to September 2, 2003. It starred human resources manager James Getzlaff, who searched for a partner among a group of fifteen men. Getzleff engaged in one-on-one dates and group activities with the men; however, it was revealed to him in the fourth episode that half of the men were actually straight. Getzlaff typically eliminated three men from the competition at the end of each episode. If the final man in the competition was gay, he and Getzlaff won a monetary reward and a vacation to New Zealand. Conversely, if the final man was straight, he alone won a monetary reward. The series was hosted by English television presenter Dani Behr.

The series premiered to high ratings and became Bravo&#x27;s second highest-rated show. It was paired with &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; as part of the network&#x27;s gay programming block. It received a mixed reception from television critics. Many critics believed it was dull, although some praised the then-innovative format of a same-sex dating show. The inclusion of covert straight contestants was heavily criticized by critics and audiences, in which many claimed it was cruel to Getzlaff and homophobic. The series was protested by several conservative Christian organizations for its perceived positive representation of LGBTQ people. It received a nomination in the Outstanding Reality Program category at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards.

&quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; was the first same-sex dating show. Despite its brief run, the series inspired a wave of LGBTQ-related reality television shows throughout the 2000s. It bolstered the entertainment careers of Getzlaff and contestants such as Dan Wells. In the years that followed its conclusion, Bravo repeatedly expressed interest in producing a second season or spin-off. Numerous publications have cited it as either one of the worst or most controversial reality television series of all time due to the inclusion of covert straight contestants in a same-sex dating show. In 2022, &quot;Time&quot; regarded the series&#x27; first and only season as one of the most influential reality television seasons of all time.

==Format==

Set in Palm Springs, California, the series depicted James Getzlaff, a 32-year-old human resources manager, selecting a partner among a group of fifteen men (referred to as &quot;mates&quot;). The fifteen men were required to move into a house together, in which they went on one-on-one dates with Getzlaff and competed in a variety of group activities. At the end of each episode, Getzlaff eliminated three men from the competition. In determining which men to send home, Getzlaff consulted with his longtime friend Andra Stasko, a married straight woman. Toward the end of the series, Getzlaff was informed that the group of men actually consisted of both gay and straight men. If the man Getzlaff chose at the end of the competition was gay, the two would win a vacation to New Zealand and Getzlaff would receive a $25,000 reward. Conversely, if Getzlaff chose a straight man, the straight man alone would win the $25,000 reward while Getzlaff would receive a &quot;very small&quot; cash reward. English television personality Dani Behr served as the host of the series.

==Production==
===Conception and development===
According to executive producer Douglas Ross, &quot;[w]e very specifically designed this show to challenge the viewer&#x27;s preconceived notions about what it means to be gay and straight. We really wanted it to be an exploration of sexual politics and not sex.&quot; While the producers were interested in exploring &quot;sociological issues&quot;, the twist of some contestants being straight was implemented in an effort for the series to reach broader audiences. In order to protect the identities of which suitors were gay and straight, any physicality between Getzlaff and suitors beyond kissing was forbidden.

===Casting===
Over 500 men from San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego were interviewed for a role in the series. Producers informed gay contestants that they were cast for a gay dating show, while straight contestants were told that it was a reality game show. Producers sought straight men who were interested in confronting stereotypes, specifically those who had &quot;important people in their lives—a relative, a college roommate, etc.—who happened to be gay&quot;. According to executive producer Douglas Ross, producers additionally wanted straight contestants who could obscure their sexual orientation without relying on LGBT stereotypes. Straight contestants were required to fabricate gay dating histories and they had to be willing to kiss another man.

Bravo President Jeff Gaspin acknowledged that the show had potential to break or reaffirm stereotypes; however, he claimed that the show would &quot;treat these men no differently than women were treated on &quot;The Bachelor&quot;.&quot;

Straight contestant Dan Wells was sought out by Gaspin, who knew of Wells due to his prior win in the 2001 reality television series &quot;Lost&quot;. Speaking on his casting in &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot;, Wells explained: &quot;it wasn’t tough to act gay . . . You learn as you go and you watch how the gay men were acting and behaving and so forth, and you roll with the vibe of the situation. It’s a deep Method acting experience.&quot;

Getzlaff originally interviewed for the role of a mate; however, producers ultimately offered him the leading role instead. As leading man, Getzlaff was required to have a &quot;best female friend&quot; to offer him guidance as he eliminated mates. Getzlaff selected his friend Andra Stasko, a straight married woman; Stasko claimed that she participated in the series to be supportive of Getzlaff coming out.

All of the mates were unpaid for their appearance on the show.

===Filming===
The series was filmed in Palm Springs, California, over a period of ten days in May 2003. During the filming process, Getzlaff and Behr and the mates remained at separate houses in Rancho Mirage, California.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast history and release==
&quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; premiered on July 29, 2003, in the United States on Bravo at 9:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST). The series aired alongside &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; as part of the network&#x27;s gay programming block.

The series was released on DVD on May 25, 2004. The three-disc release featured all six episodes of &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; in addition to cast interviews, behind-the-scene featurettes, casting reels, a drag performance by Miss Coco Peru, an unaired opening sequence, cast biographies, and a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; segment about the contestants. In March 2006, the series was released for streaming on OutzoneTV.com, an LGBT-targeted broadband channel created by Bravo and PlanetOut.

==Reception==
===Television viewership and ratings===
The series premiered to 1.6 million viewers, with approximately one million viewers in the 25-54 demographic.

The series finale drew in 1.62 million viewers, which, at the time, was Bravo&#x27;s second highest-rated show ever.

===Critical response===
The show received a mixed reception from television critics; their response was summarized as &quot;fearfully dull&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

A staff writer for ABC News believed the concept of &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; was &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, although they criticized the fourth episode&#x27;s twist as a ploy by producers to increase the series&#x27; ratings. Lawrence Donegan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; believed it was noteworthy &quot;that a respected network such as Bravo is willing to broadcast a series focused entirely on the theme of gay romance&quot;.

Steve Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; believed the show was boring, in which he claimed that &quot;It proves a gay reality dating show can be every bit as tedious as its straight counterparts.&quot;

Some critics compared the series to the unaired 1995 &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; episode &quot;Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
&quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; was the first same-sex dating show. Despite its short-lived run, the series was responsible for a wave of LGBT-related reality television series in the mid-2000s, including &quot;Playing It Straight&quot;, &quot;Gay, Straight or Taken?&quot;, and &quot;Straight Dates by Gay Mates&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Time&quot; cited the first and only season of &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; as one of the most influential reality television seasons of all time. In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; cited &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; as one of the worst reality television series of all time; a staff writer for the publication claimed that the series was &quot;[c]ruel, offensive, and worst of all, boring.&quot;

The series launched the entertainment career of Getzlaff, who subsequently starred in the off-Broadway production &quot;My Big Gay Italian Wedding&quot; and the comedy film &quot;Another Gay Movie&quot;.

Following his appearance on the show, contestant Jason Tiner was discharged from the United States Navy for violating the military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy.

===Awards and nominations===
==Potential second season==
&quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; creator Doug Ross held out hope for a second season. He acknowledged that the popularity of season one would make it practically impossible for another season with the same twist but also said that he has come up with another twist which Bravo executives thought was fun. Speaking in 2007, Bravo executive Frances Berwick pointed to public knowledge of the twist as a stumbling block to a second season, noting the difficulty Bravo had selling the series overseas because of international press reports on the twist. On the possibility of a season two with a new twist, Berwick said, &quot;What Bravo does best is to do things first and to really sort of shake up people&#x27;s preconceptions and notions about things. And we would accept many different formats [for a &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot;-type show]. I&#x27;m not saying that they wouldn&#x27;t be as good, because you can always come up with something else. [But] until we find the perfect way to do it...&quot; Berwick also suggested that at the time a series as gay-specific as &quot;Boy Meets Boy&quot; might not have fit into Bravo&#x27;s overall programming strategy. &quot;It has to feel like it&#x27;s broad enough, and multidimensional enough to work for our incredibly smart audience.&quot;

Supervising producer Kirk Marcolina expressed interest in producing another season focused on women. In 2004, television producer Craig Zadan claimed that a second season did not materialize due to a lack of advertisers.

<doc id="440372" wikidata="Q5598634" url="?curid=440372" title="Great American Desert">
<text>The term Great American Desert was used in the 19th century to describe the part of North America east of the Rocky Mountains to approximately the 100th meridian. It can be traced to Stephen H. Long&#x27;s 1820 scientific expedition which put the Great American Desert on the map.

Today the area is usually referred to as the High Plains, and the original term is sometimes used to describe the arid region of North America, which includes parts of northwestern Mexico and the American southwest.

==The concept of &quot;desert&quot;==
The meaning of the term &quot;desert&quot; has varied through time and across cultures. The term was sometimes used to describe any uninhabited or treeless land, whether or not it was arid, and sometimes to refer to hot and arid lands, evoking images of sandy wastelands. European colonists believed that treeless lands were not good for agriculture, thus the term desert also had the connotation of &quot;unfit for farming.&quot;

The High Plains region is mostly semi-arid grassland and steppe. Today much of the region supports agriculture through the use of aquifer water irrigation, but in the 19th century, the area&#x27;s relative lack of water and wood made it seem unfit for settler farming.

==Description==
When the region was obtained by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, President Jefferson wrote of the &quot;immense and trackless deserts&quot; of the region. Zebulon Pike wrote &quot;these vast plains of the western hemisphere, may become in time equally celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa&quot;. His map included a comment in the region, &quot;not a stick of timber&quot;. In 1823, Major Stephen Long, a government surveyor and leader of the next official exploration expedition, produced a map labeling the area as the &quot;Great American Desert.&quot; In the report that accompanied the map, the party&#x27;s geographer Edwin James wrote of the region:

I do not hesitate in giving the opinion, that it is almost wholly unfit for cultivation, and of course, uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture for their subsistence. Although tracts of fertile land considerably extensive are occasionally to be met with, yet the scarcity of wood and water, almost uniformly prevalent, will prove an insuperable obstacle in the way of settling the country.

These perceptions were echoed by Washington Irving, who wrote in 1836 &quot;The region, which resembles one of the ancient steppes of Asia, has not inaptly been termed The Great American Desert. It spreads forth into undulating and treeless plains and desolate sandy wastes, wearisome to the eye in their extent and monotony.&quot; Descriptions such as Irving&#x27;s led some geography textbooks of the time to show sand dunes and camels in the area of what is now Kansas and Nebraska.

While many other travelers reported similar conditions and conclusions, there were problems in the interpretation and the use of the word &quot;desert&quot;, as descriptions of the American High Plains almost always included comments about &quot;Innumerable Herds of Buffaloes&quot;, which was written on Pike&#x27;s map just above &quot;not a stick of timber&quot;. The giant herds and teeming wildlife of the Great Plains were well known by the time the term Great American Desert came into common use, undermining the idea of a wasteland; however, the relevant concept inherent in the reports of the region was that it could not be farmed, something the reports generally agreed on. By the middle of the 19th century, as settlers migrated across the plains to Oregon and California, the wasteland connotation of &quot;desert&quot; was seen to be false, but the sense of the region as uninhabitable remained until irrigation and railroad transportation made up for the lack of surface water and wood.

==Settlement and development==
The region&#x27;s relative lack of water and wood affected the development of the United States. Settlers heading westward often attempted to pass through the region as quickly as possible, on the way to what was considered to be better land farther west. These early settlers gave telling names to the various streams of the region, such as &quot;Sweet water Creek&quot; or &quot;Poison Creek&quot;. Because it was not considered desirable, the area became one of the last strongholds of independent American Indians. Railroad interests seeking rights-of-way through the region also benefited from the popular belief that the land was commercially valueless.

By the mid-19th century, people had begun settling in the region despite its poor reputation. The local inhabitants came to realize the area was at the time well suited for farming, due in part to the fact that large portions of the region sit atop one of the world&#x27;s largest groundwater reservoirs, the Ogallala Aquifer. Experts of the era proposed theories that maintained the earlier reports had been accurate and the climate had changed. Some even credited the settlers themselves as having caused the change by planting crops and trees. The slogan &quot;rain follows the plow&quot; described this belief, which today is discredited.

Whether the agricultural productivity of the region in modern times can continue for much longer is in doubt. It has been demonstrated that while there is an abundant amount of fossil water in the Ogallala Aquifer, it is slow to replenish itself, with most of the water in the aquifer having been there since the last ice age. Some current estimates predict the usefulness of the aquifer for agriculture to lessen and become useless, perhaps as soon as the early parts of the mid-21st century, leading some farmers to turn away from aquifer-irrigated agriculture.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887) by Arthur Conan Doyle contains a reference to a &quot;desert&quot; in the center of North America: In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
*In Chapters 20 and 27 of &quot;Roughing It&quot; (1872), Mark Twain refers to the Great American Desert, but he is applying the term to the Forty Mile Desert of Nevada&#x27;s Lahontan Valley.

<doc id="440374" wikidata="Q5326240" url="?curid=440374" title="Earl of Coventry">
<text>Earl of Coventry is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. The first creation for the Villiers family was created in 1623 and took its name from the city of Coventry. It became extinct in 1687. A decade later, the second creation was for the Coventry family and is still extant.

==History==
===Earls of Coventry, first creation (1623)===
The earldom of Coventry was created for the first time in 1623, in the Peerage of England, in favour of George Villiers, 1st Marquess of Buckingham. He was made Duke of Buckingham at the same time. The title became extinct in 1687 upon the death of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.

===Earls of Coventry, second creation (1697)===
The earldom of Coventry was created a second time in 1697, again in the Peerage of England, in favour of Thomas Coventry, 5th Baron Coventry.

The Coventry family descends from John Coventry who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1426. His descendant Sir Thomas Coventry was a noted early 17th-century lawyer and politician. He served as Solicitor General, as Attorney General and as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. In 1628 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Coventry, of Aylesborough in the County of Worcester. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, the second Baron. He represented Droitwich and Worcester in the House of Commons.

His eldest son, the third Baron, served as Custos Rotulorum of Worcestershire. His son, the fourth Baron, died unmarried and was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Droitwich, Camelford and Warwick. In 1697 he was made Viscount Deerhurst, of the hundred of Deerhurst in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Coventry, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to 1) the heirs male of his deceased uncle the Hon. Francis Coventry (1612–1680), failing which to 2) his three second cousins William Coventry, Thomas Coventry and Henry Coventry, grandsons of his deceased great-uncle Walter Coventry (d. 1640), younger brother of the first Baron Coventry. The titles were in the Peerage of England.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was &quot;Custos Rotulorum&quot; of Worcestershire. His son, the third Earl, died as a child and was succeeded by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He had no sons and on his death in 1719 the barony of Coventry became extinct. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom according to the special remainders by his second cousin once removed William Coventry, the fifth Earl. He was the grandson of Walter Coventry, youngest brother of the first Baron. Lord Coventry had earlier represented Bridport in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Bridport and for Worcestershire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire.
His son from his first marriage, the seventh Earl, was also Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He represented Worcester in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his grandson, the ninth Earl, who held the title for 87 years. He was the son of George William Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1808–1838). Lord Coventry was a Conservative politician and held office under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and as Master of the Buckhounds. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was succeeded by his grandson, the tenth Earl, the son of George William Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1865–1927), eldest son of the ninth Earl. Lord Coventry was killed in action in the Battle of Wytschaete on 27 May 1940, during the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force to Dunkirk. He is buried in the cemetery at Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée.

He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl, who had a varied career. Despite four marriages, he died in 2002 without a surviving son, as his heir, Edward George William Oscar Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1957–1997) had died before him. He was succeeded by his 89-year-old first cousin once removed, the twelfth Earl, the second but eldest surviving son of Colonel the Hon. Charles John Coventry, second son of the ninth Earl. He had one daughter but no sons, and the direct male line of descent from the eighth Earl failed upon his death in 2004. He was succeeded by a distant kinsman, the thirteenth and (as of 2022) present holder of the titles. He is the great-great-grandson of the Hon. William James Coventry, the younger son of the seventh Earl. The new Lord Coventry then lived in Canada and now lives in Hampton, Greater London. He is one of the sons of Commander Cecil Dick Bluett Coventry and was educated at Prince of Wales School, Nairobi. In 1965, he married Gillian Frances Randall, by whom he has one daughter, Lady Diana Elizabeth Sherwood Coventry (born 1980).

The heir presumptive is a nephew, David Duncan Sherwood Coventry (born 1973).

==Other notable members of the family==

Several other members of the Coventry family may be mentioned. The Hon. Henry Coventry (1618–1686), a son from the second marriage of the first Baron, was one of two Members of Parliament for Droitwich. Another son from the second marriage of the first Baron, Sir William Coventry (d. 1686), represented Great Yarmouth in the House of Commons and became an influential politician. Sir John Coventry (c. 1636–1685), son of the Hon. John Coventry, a son of the second marriage of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. Thomas Henry Coventry, Viscount Deerhurst (1721–1744), eldest son and heir apparent of the fifth Earl, briefly represented Bridport in Parliament before his premature death.

==Ancestral seat==
The ancestral seat of the Coventry family is Croome Court, near Pershore in Worcestershire. Croome Court was sold in 1949 and the family moved to the smaller, half-timbered, somewhat confusingly named Earls Croome Court on the estate, while still retaining most of the Coventry agricultural and forestry estate. Earls Croome Court remained as the seat of the family until 2007, when it was sold by Rachel, Countess of Coventry, the widow of the 11th Earl who died in 2002. The park at Croome Court was handed over to the National Trust in 1996 but the house itself remains private and is now owned by the Croome Heritage Trust. The National Trust now leases the house and opens it to the public.

<text>Jarome Arthur-Leigh Adekunle Tig Junior Elvis Iginla (; born July 1, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger. He played over 1,500 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Pittsburgh Penguins, Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche, and Los Angeles Kings between 1996 and 2017. He is widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation.

In junior, Iginla was a member of two Memorial Cup winning teams with the Kamloops Blazers and was named the Western Hockey League (WHL) Player of the Year in 1996. He was selected 11th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft but was traded to Calgary before making his NHL debut. Nicknamed &quot;Iggy&quot;, he led the NHL in goals and points in 2001–02, and won the Lester B. Pearson Award as its most valuable player as voted by the players. In 2003–04, Iginla led the league in goals for the second time and captained the Flames to the Stanley Cup Finals, leading the playoffs in goals.

A six-time NHL All-Star, Iginla is the Flames&#x27; all-time leader in goals, points, and games played, and is second in assists to Al MacInnis. Iginla scored 50 goals in a season on two occasions and is one of seven players in NHL history to score 30 goals in 11 consecutive seasons. He is one of 20 players in NHL history to score over 600 goals and is one of 34 players to record 1,300 points in his career. He is a past winner of the Mark Messier Leadership Award and has been recognized by both the Flames and the league for his community work; while a member of the Flames, Iginla donated $2,000 to the children&#x27;s charity Kidsport for every goal he scored. His number 12 was retired by the Flames during a pre-game ceremony on March 2, 2019.

Internationally, Iginla has represented Canada on numerous occasions. He was a member of championship teams at the 1996 World Junior and 1997 World Championships as well as the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He is a three-time Olympian and two-time gold medal winner, including at the 2002 Winter Olympics where he helped lead Canada to its first Olympic hockey championship in 50 years.

Iginla was selected for the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2020, during his first year of eligibility. Iginla is the fourth Black player inducted after Grant Fuhr, women&#x27;s hockey pioneer Angela James, and Willie O&#x27;Ree.

==Early life==
Iginla was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and raised in the adjoining city of St. Albert. His father, a lawyer, was originally from Nigeria and changed his first name from Adekunle to Elvis when he arrived in Canada. His surname means &quot;big tree&quot; in Yoruba, his father&#x27;s native language. Iginla&#x27;s mother, Susan Schuchard, is originally from Oregon, and has worked as a massage therapist and music teacher. Iginla was raised by his single mother, with support from his grandparents, after his parents divorced when he was two years old.

In addition to hockey, Iginla played baseball as a young man and was the catcher on the Canadian national junior team. Before hockey, baseball was Iginla&#x27;s favourite sport and his earliest sports memories were of attending amateur baseball tournaments in Western Canada. He played baseball until he was about 17 years old and later in life told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that he had hoped to become a two-sport professional athlete like Bo Jackson.

Iginla credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not have had the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather&#x27;s support. Iginla grew up admiring other Black hockey players, including Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the right wing. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the Alberta Midget Hockey League in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87 points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
Iginla played three years with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). As a 16-year-old in 1993–94, he recorded six goals and 29  points in 48 regular season games before playing an additional 19 in the playoffs. The Blazers captured both the league title and the 1994 Memorial Cup, Canada&#x27;s national junior championship. In reference to the Blazers&#x27; dominance of the league at the time (they had won their third WHL title in five seasons), Iginla described the expectations of success as being similar to those placed on the Montreal Canadiens, the NHL&#x27;s most successful franchise: &quot;When you put on a Blazers jersey, it&#x27;s like putting on the Canadiens&#x27;. You&#x27;ve got to perform.&quot;

Iginla scored 33 goals and 71 points in 1994–95, his first full WHL season. The Blazers repeated as league champions, earning a trip to the 1995 Memorial Cup. Iginla scored five goals in the tournament to lead the Blazers to a second consecutive national championship. He received the George Parsons Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player of the tournament.

The Dallas Stars selected Iginla with their first pick, 11th overall, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft; however, on December 20, 1995, they traded him to the Calgary Flames, along with Corey Millen, for the rights to forward Joe Nieuwendyk, who was then in a contract dispute with the Flames.

In his final season in Kamloops in 1995–96, Iginla finished fourth in the league scoring 136 points, including 63 goals in 63 games played, and was awarded the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most outstanding player. The Blazers were upset in the Western Conference Final by the Spokane Chiefs, but Iginla still finished fourth in playoff scoring, recording 29 points in 16 games. His performance during the season earned him an invitation to play for Team Canada at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Boston, where he led the tournament in scoring with 12 points and helped Canada to its fourth consecutive gold medal.

===Calgary Flames===
Iginla made his NHL debut in the 1996 playoffs, as he was signed to a contract and flown to Calgary immediately after his junior season ended in Kamloops. He appeared in two games for the Flames in their series against the Chicago Blackhawks. In doing so, he became the first 18-year-old to play for the Flames since Dan Quinn in 1983. In his first NHL game, Iginla assisted on a Theoren Fleury goal to record his first point; he scored his first goal in his second game. He remained with the Flames, and played his first NHL season in 1996–97. He earned a spot on that year&#x27;s NHL All-Rookie Team and finished as the runner-up to Bryan Berard in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year after leading all first-year players in scoring with 50 points.

By his third season, 1998–99, Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28. His success complicated negotiations for a new contract, as he and the Flames struggled to agree on a new deal following the season. Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, Iginla agreed to attend training camp without a contract and purchased his insurance as the team would not have been responsible financially if he suffered an injury. 

He remained without a contract at the start of the 1999–2000 season and missed the first three games as a holdout before signing a three-year deal worth US$4.9 million, plus bonuses. He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63). 

He then topped both marks in 2000–01 by recording 31 goals and 71 points.

After participating in Canada&#x27;s Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in 2001–02 when he registered 52 goals and 96  points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status. He earned the Art Ross and Maurice Richard trophies as the NHL&#x27;s leading point and goal scorer, respectively. It marked the first time since 1980 that the Art Ross was not won by either Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, or Jaromir Jagr. He was also awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award as the league&#x27;s most valuable player as voted by his peers, and was a nominee for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender José Théodore in voting points, but received fewer first-place votes than Théodore. However, one voter rumoured to be from Quebec—Théodore and the Canadiens&#x27; home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot. As a result of the controversy that followed, the Professional Hockey Writers Association changed the rules on how its members voted for the award to prevent a recurrence.

There were fears Iginla would again hold out after his contract expired following the season. They were unfounded, however, as he signed a two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively. Iginla fell back to 67 points in 2002–03 as injuries, including a lingering finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play. His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames for the fourth time in five seasons. Despite his offensive contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames franchise history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla&#x27;s experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. &quot;He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he&#x27;d been there a long time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Finals that year so it worked out pretty well.&quot; Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour. Iginla responded to being named captain by capturing his second Rocket Richard Trophy, sharing the goal-scoring title with Ilya Kovalchuk and Rick Nash with 41  goals. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs as the sixth seed in the West, the team&#x27;s first playoff appearance in eight years. Iginla led all playoff scorers with 13 goals as he captained the Flames to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 15 years. The Flames were unable to defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning, however, falling to the Eastern Conference champions in seven games after initially holding a 3–2 series lead. A dejected Iginla sat in the Flames locker room after game seven and was met by his father, who told his son that &quot;I&#x27;m proud of you. All of Canada is proud of you.&quot;

While he was hailed as the best player in the world following his performance in the playoffs, Iginla spent the 2004–05 NHL lock-out focused on improving his game further. Following the lock-out, he was named as one of six player representatives on the newly created NHL competition committee, with a mandate to suggest recommendations for ways to improve the game. He held this position until early 2008.

On December 7, 2006, Iginla reached career milestones when he scored his 300th career goal and 600th career point against the Minnesota Wild. He was expected to play in the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas; however, he missed the game with a knee injury. The injury kept him out of 12 games in 2006–07. He nevertheless scored 94 points, including a career-high 55 assists.

The 2007–08 season saw Iginla post his second career 50-goal season, adding 48 assists for a career-high 98 points, good for third overall in the league. He was voted to the starting line-up of the 2008 NHL All-Star Game along with teammate Dion Phaneuf, and was named captain of the Western All-Star team. He broke the Flames&#x27; franchise record for games played when he played his 804th career game on November 29, 2007, against the Anaheim Ducks. He also broke Theoren Fleury&#x27;s franchise record for goals when he scored his 365th on March 10, 2008, against the St. Louis Blues. Iginla was nominated as a Hart Trophy finalist for league most valuable player for the third time, though he again did not win the award. During the season, he signed a five-year contract extension with the Flames at $7 million per season.

Iginla continued his pursuit of Fleury&#x27;s franchise record of 830 points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first-period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career-high five points in a New Year&#x27;s Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four-point games. In January, he was named to the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames&#x27; all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. He finished the season with 35 goals and 89 points, but a disappointing playoff performance that resulted in the Flames getting defeated in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks in six games led to questions of whether he had been playing with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.

Iginla reached 900 career points in a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Edmonton Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. The Flames struggled in the 2009–10 campaign, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2003, missing the 2010 playoffs by five points. Iginla accepted responsibility for the team&#x27;s failure, admitting that finishing around 70 points for the season was &quot;not enough&quot;. The Flames&#x27; declining fortunes and Iginla&#x27;s season led to increasing questions on whether he could be traded from the team with whom he has played his entire NHL career. Iginla, who would have to approve any trade the team attempts to make due to a no-movement clause in his contract, expressed that he did not wish to leave Calgary, but would accommodate a trade if the Flames wished to do so. Former Flames&#x27; general manager Craig Button argued against trading Iginla, blaming a lack of complementary players for both Iginla and Calgary&#x27;s failures: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing easier in hockey than to be able to shut down one player. And the Calgary Flames, I would argue, have made it really easy for teams to shut down Jarome.&quot; The Flames publicly stated that they had no plans to trade him.

Iginla struggled offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling to the bottom of the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on a goal by Jay Bouwmeester in a 6–5 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced a week and a half later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother. Iginla scored his 30th goal of the season on a penalty shot against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators on March 6, and in doing so became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons. A month later, he scored his 1,000th career point, notching the game-winning goal against Jaroslav Halák of the St. Louis Blues in a 3–2 win on April 1. He ended the season with 43 goals and assists for 86 points in all 82 games as the Flames as a team improved compared to the previous year as they narrowly missed the playoffs, only missing by three points in the standings. His 43 goals was the most on the team and third in the league overall only behind the 45 goals from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning and the 50 goals from Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks.

Iginla scored his 500th goal on January 7, 2012, against Niklas Bäckström of the Minnesota Wild in a 3–1 victory. He was the 42nd player in league history to achieve the feat, and the 15th to do so with one organization. Midway through the 2011–12 season, Iginla was named an All-Star for the seventh time in his career (the sixth played), representing the Flames at the 2012 All-Star Game. Iginla scored his 30th goal of the 2011–12 season in a 3–2 win against goaltender Antti Niemi of the San Jose Sharks on March 13, 2012. He is the seventh player in league history to score 30 goals in 11 consecutive seasons.

===Pittsburgh and Boston===
 Playing the final year of his contract in 2012–13 and with the team languishing near the bottom of the NHL standings, speculation about Iginla&#x27;s future in Calgary was again raised as April 3, 2013, trade deadline neared. National media outlets reported that Iginla, who had a clause in his contract preventing the Flames from moving him to another team without his permission, had given the organization a list of four teams he would be willing to accept a trade with: the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings, Boston Bruins, or Pittsburgh Penguins. Those four teams had won the last four championships and all four would go on to make the conference finals that season. The Bruins were considered the leading contender to acquire Iginla&#x27;s services, and after he was held out of the line-up of Calgary&#x27;s March 27, 2013, game against the Colorado Avalanche, it was reported that a trade between the two teams had been completed. Instead, Iginla&#x27;s 16-year career in Calgary ended when he was sent to the Penguins in exchange for Pittsburgh&#x27;s first round selection at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and college prospects Kenny Agostino and Ben Hanowski. Iginla stated that playing with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin played a factor in his decision to move to the Penguins. The Bruins and Penguins met in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite having the top-scoring offence in the league, the Penguins lost the series without winning a game. Iginla, along with Crosby, Malkin, James Neal and Kris Letang, registered a combined 0 points in the series. Iginla was moved to the third line after a 6–1 game 2 loss. Bruins forward Milan Lucic said after the series that Iginla&#x27;s spurning of Boston ignited the series sweep: &quot;When a guy chooses another team over your team, it does light a little bit of a fire underneath you.&quot;

As a free agent following the season, Iginla chose to go to Boston and signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Bruins. He required nine games before scoring his first goal as a Bruin, as part of a 2–1 win over the San Jose Sharks, but later settled in on Boston&#x27;s first line with Milan Lucic and David Krejčí. He made his first return to Calgary on December 10, 2013, where the fans greeted him with a long standing ovation prior to the game as the Flames played a video tribute. Following the contest, a 2–1 Bruins victory, Iginla was named the game&#x27;s third star and took two laps around the rink to more cheers from the crowd. He recorded his 600th career assist on a Milan Lucic goal in a 3–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on February 4, 2014.

===Colorado and Los Angeles===

Salary cap constraints prevented the Bruins from re-signing Iginla. Consequently, he left the team as a free agent and signed a three-year, $16 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche. The Avalanche disappointed in 2014–15; by mid-February, they stood in last place in the Central Division, though Iginla himself was among the team&#x27;s leading scorers. He led the team with 29 goals, however, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the playoffs. On January 4, 2016, Iginla became the 19th player in NHL history to score 600 career goals. His milestone marker came in a 4–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. On December 10, 2016, Iginla played in his 1,500th NHL game, a 10–1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens. He is the 16th player to reach this milestone.

On March 1, 2017, Iginla was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for a 2018 conditional fourth-round pick. He chose to wear the number 88, as number 12 was already taken by Marián Gáborík. As a 10-year-old, Iginla had purchased a Kings jersey and placed his name and the number 88 on the back after Wayne Gretzky was traded to the team. Kings general manager Dean Lombardi hoped a fresh start for Iginla would ignite him after playing for a struggling team in Colorado.

Iginla was not re-signed by the Kings for the 2017–18 season. It was reported that he had hip surgery in the autumn of 2017, but that he hoped to make a return to the NHL when interviewed during a practice that he took part in with the Providence Bruins in February 2018.

On July 30, 2018, Iginla announced his retirement.

On June 24, 2020, Iginla was selected for the Hockey Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility.

==International play==




Iginla first represented Canada at the 1994 Nations Cup, an unsanctioned tournament for players under the age of 18. He led Canada in scoring with five goals and nine points as it won the gold medal. Two years later, he joined the national junior team at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He led the tournament in scoring with five goals and 12  points as Canada won its fourth consecutive gold medal. He was named an all-star and the tournament&#x27;s top forward. One year later, Iginla played in his first tournament with the senior team, competing at the 1997 World Championships as a 19-year-old, the youngest player on the team. He recorded two goals and three assists in 11 games as Canada won the gold medal.

A late invitation to join Team Canada&#x27;s summer camp in preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics helped Iginla emerge as a star player. He was so surprised by the invitation he initially thought one of his Calgary Flames teammates were playing a prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the United States, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50  years. With this win, Iginla became the first Black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey as an alternate captain, playing on a line with Joe Sakic and Mario Lemieux. Canada won the gold medal.

Iginla participated in his second Olympics and was an alternate captain at the 2006 Turin games, recording three points in six games. The Canadians were unable to defend their 2002 gold medal, losing to Russia in the quarter-finals. Named an alternate captain once again for the 2010 team in Vancouver, he opened the tournament with a hat trick against Norway. He finished as the tournament leader with five goals, and assisted on Sidney Crosby&#x27;s overtime winning goal in the gold medal final against the United States.

==Playing style==
In his prime, Iginla was considered to be one of the NHL&#x27;s most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He was one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla&#x27;s lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.

The abuse he faced at the hands of opponents early in his NHL career prompted Iginla&#x27;s coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter&#x27;s arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla was most effective when he had room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. &quot;You&#x27;ve got a power forward who does it all,&quot; said Craig Conroy. &quot;I mean, he&#x27;ll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it&#x27;s not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done.&quot; His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, &quot;he&#x27;ll run you over. Or he&#x27;ll fight somebody. And then he&#x27;ll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you&#x27;d want a guy to do.&quot;

Iginla recorded several Gordie Howe hat tricks – a fight, a goal and an assist in the same game – and as it is not an official statistic, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with Tampa Bay Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates. Iginla suffered injuries as a result of his fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin of the Dallas Stars. Iginla&#x27;s truculent style of play gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry. In 2008 during a ceremonial handshake initiated by Iginla to Trevor Linden in his last game, Linden told Iginla he was the best player in the game at that time.

He commands the respect of his peers and has been known to stand up to the coaching staff to defend a fellow player. Former teammate Andrew Ference — a former Bruins player himself, before Iginla&#x27;s arrival on the Boston team&#x27;s roster — once described following Iginla as like &quot;following a friend.&quot; Preferring to lead by example, Iginla is not regarded as a vocal captain. He likes to speak with players individually and tries to ensure that all of his teammates are comfortable. He was named the recipient of the Mark Messier Leadership Award in 2009.

==Personal life==
Iginla married his high school sweetheart, Kara, and the couple have three children: daughter Jade and sons Tij and Joe. They had been dating since they were in grade eight. Jade attended and played hockey for Shattuck-Saint Mary&#x27;s and Kelowna&#x27;s RINK Hockey Academy, before attending Brown University and playing for the Brown Bears in the NCAA. Internationally, she has represented Canada at the under-18 level. Tij currently plays for the Kelowna Rockets and was the first-ever draft selection for the Utah Hockey Club, after he was drafted sixth overall in the 2024 NHL Entry Draft. Joe plays hockey for Kelowna’s RINK Hockey Academy, with Jarome as his head coach, and was taken by the Edmonton Oil Kings in the first round of the 2023 WHL Bantam Draft.

Iginla has four paternal half-siblings; two brothers, Jason and Stephen, and two sisters, Theresa and Elizabeth. Theresa played for the University of Saskatchewan Huskies women&#x27;s hockey team for three seasons from 2004 to 2007. Jarome is an avid golfer and a regular participant in the Calgary Flames Celebrity Charity Golf Classic.

Iginla is a Christian. He has spoken about his faith in Jesus by saying, “I believe He died for us, and I believe He’s there for us and we can lean on Him. And I do.”

Iginla is well known for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager Craig Button described Iginla as being grounded: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He&#x27;s confident in his abilities. He&#x27;s self-assured. He&#x27;s genuine. He&#x27;s a better person than he is a player, and we all know what kind of player he is.&quot; In 2002, while in Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympic Games, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.

Since 2002, he has operated the Jarome Iginla Hockey School in Calgary as a non-profit organization, donating proceeds to the Diabetes Research Association. In 2004, he was awarded the NHL Foundation Player Award for his community service and the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in recognition of his humanitarian contributions. Iginla supports many charities. In 2000, he began donating $1,000 per goal he scored to KidSport, a figure he doubled to $2,000 in 2005. Between 2000 and 2013, he donated more than $700,000 from this initiative.

Iginla is a part owner of the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League, for whom he played during his junior hockey days. He purchased a minority share in the franchise, along with fellow NHL players Shane Doan, Mark Recchi and Darryl Sydor, in October 2007. He is also an ambassador with the NHL Diversity program, which supports youth hockey organizations that offer economically disadvantaged children the opportunity to play. Since 2008, he has been a hockey spokesperson for Scotiabank, appearing in commercials and at events supporting its grassroots hockey programs, as well as for Samsung Canada.

He was the cover athlete and spokesperson for the EA Sports video game NHL 2003.

Since retiring, Iginla has resided in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and Lake Country, British Columbia.

<text>Surf-N-Burn is a 1997 surf-rock album by the Blue Stingrays. Its tracks express a variety of moods, from the secret agent intrigue of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (a cover of the theme from the James Bond film of the same name), to the soft surfing themes &quot;Surfer&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Green Sea&quot;, to the beach-shack rave-ups (complete with audience noise) &quot;Monsoon&quot; and &quot;Super Hero&quot;, all in the styles of the early surf-rockers.

This disc&#x27;s liner notes tell a fictitious story of origins of the Blue Stingrays—claiming they formed in 1959 and were among both the earliest and most influential surf-rockers; who, after tiring of the exploitation of surf culture, moved to a small South Pacific island. Completing the retro feel, this album was also released as an LP (by Epitone/Epitaph). In reality, the Blue Stingrays was a side project for members of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. 
A blue guitar pick stamped with the Stingrays&#x27; logo was included with the CD.

<text>Schwarz Stein is a Japanese visual kei electronic music duo formed by Hora (洞) and Kaya (迦夜) in 2001 (as &quot;Rudolf Steiner&quot;), who disbanded in 2004 and rebanded in 2014.

==Biography==

===History===
During its first three years of activity, the group consisted of Kaya on vocals (ex-Isola) and Hora (ex-Velvet Eden) as keyboardist and programmer. The two originally worked together under the alias Rudolf Steiner until their signing to ex-Malice Mizer guitarist Mana&#x27;s record label Midi:Nette. Upon their &#x27;re-formation&#x27;, Mana discarded the name Rudolf Steiner and christened the duo &quot;Schwarz Stein&quot; (pseudo-German for &quot;Black Stone&quot;).

Prior to their name change, two demo tapes (&quot;Queen of Decadence&quot; and &quot;Perfect Garden&quot;) had been released. A re-worked version of &quot;Perfect Garden&quot; was later created as their Midi:Nette debut single. Schwarz Stein went on to release their first full album &quot;New Vogue Children&quot; in June 2003, the single &quot;Current&quot; in November of the same year, and then their final album &quot;Artificial Hallucination&quot; in February 2004. They opened for Moi dix Mois on several occasions, played at various events, and also made a number solo appearances as well.

Following their last performance on March 29, 2004, Schwarz Stein officially disbanded due to creative differences between its two members. The band was briefly reunited for the &quot;Dis Inferno III: Last Year Party&quot; event on December 15, 2004, hosted by their former label Midi:Nette.

A collaboration CD, &quot;another cell&quot;, was released in April 2006, limited to 1000 copies and only available for order through Kaya&#x27;s official site. This limited edition CD features re-mixed/re-worked versions of Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Kuro Ageha&quot; as well as two songs from Hora&#x27;s first CD &quot;Inner Universe&quot;, making up three of the eight total tracks.

In April 2011, both members announced on their respective web sites that Schwarz Stein would reunite for a single show on July 31 at Takadanobaba Area, to celebrate their 10th anniversary of working together. Tickets were also made available to overseas fans via CD Japan. A new mini-album, &quot;Recurrence of Hallucination&quot;, was also announced. After the live DVD of the show was released entitled &quot;Recurrence of Hallucination -LIVE-&quot; via Hora&#x27;s website

In February 2014, at his final Gothic Elements tour concert in Shibuya, Kaya announced Schwarz Stein would regroup, with their first live performance and a new single in March.

<text>Shane Albert Doan (born October 10, 1976) is a Canadian ice hockey executive and former player currently serving as an assistant to Brad Treliving for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Doan spent the entirety of his 21-season NHL career with the Arizona Coyotes franchise, beginning with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1995 before playing in Arizona for two decades. He was the last remaining player active in the NHL from the original Winnipeg Jets franchise before he announced his retirement in the summer of 2017.

Doan led the Phoenix Coyotes in scoring in every season between 2003 and 2011. In December 2015, Doan became the Coyotes franchise&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer. He was also the longest-serving NHL captain until his retirement, serving in that capacity for the Coyotes from 2003 to 2017; which gave him the nickname, Captain Coyote among fans. Doan never won the Stanley Cup, coming closest when his Phoenix Coyotes lost to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2012 Western Conference Final.

In international competition, Doan represented Canada and won five medals (two gold, three silver) at the World Championships. He helped Canada win the World Cup championship in 2004 and was also a member of Canada&#x27;s 2006 Winter Olympic team.

The Coyotes retired Doan&#x27;s jersey number prior to a game against the current Winnipeg Jets on February 24, 2019. He subsequently joined the Coyotes front office on January 11, 2021.

==Playing career==

===Kamloops Blazers===

Doan began his career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Kamloops Blazers in 1992, and spent three seasons with the team. He won the Memorial Cup with the Blazers in 1994 and 1995. He had his most successful season with the team during the 1994–95 season, when he recorded 94 points, helping the team win the Memorial Cup for a second straight year, and was also awarded the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the tournament&#x27;s MVP. Doan loved his time in Kamloops, and returns there in summer months.

===Winnipeg Jets/Arizona Coyotes===
Doan was drafted by the Winnipeg Jets in the first round, seventh overall, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He was the Jets&#x27; final first-round pick to play in the NHL prior to the franchise moving to Phoenix. He immediately made the transition from major junior to the NHL in 1995–96 and tallied 17 points in his rookie season with the Jets. He scored his first NHL goal against Ed Belfour of the Chicago Blackhawks, and later scored the overtime goal to win the game 6–5. Perhaps Doan&#x27;s most memorable moment as a Jet was his seventh and final goal as a Jet, which came on April 12, 1996, during the team&#x27;s last regular season home game, where he scored the game-winning goal against the Los Angeles Kings in the second period to make the score 4–2 for Winnipeg. The game would finish 5–3 and the win clinched a playoff spot for the Jets. In the playoffs, the Jets were matched up against the first seeded Detroit Red Wings and lost in six games.
After the Jets relocated to Phoenix and became the Coyotes the following season, Doan&#x27;s points total did not improve greatly until the 1999–2000 season, when he scored 26 goals (the first of nine consecutive 20-goal seasons for Doan). After the departure of team captain Teppo Numminen, Doan assumed the captaincy in 2003–04 and scored which were then career-highs in all statistical categories with 27 goals, 41 assists and 68 points. During the season, Doan was selected to play in his first NHL All-Star Game in 2004. He then hit the 30-goal mark for the first time in his career the following season to go with 36 assists and 66 points.

On December 13, 2005, during a game against the Montreal Canadiens, he was involved in a controversy concerning discriminatory remarks made towards French-speaking referees. Liberal MP Denis Coderre then asked to remove Doan from the Canadian team taking part in the Olympic Games. Wayne Gretzky, being the owner and head coach of the Coyotes as well as the director of the Olympic committee, decided to leave his protégé in training. In January 2006, Doan, who denied having made the remarks toward the referees, sued Coderre for defamation, then in April 2007 Coderre sued Doan in return, also for defamation. In August 2010, the two parties decided to settle the matter amicably at which Doan admitted these comments were made by a Coyotes player on the ice.

Late in the 2006–07 season, Doan agreed to a five-year, $22.75 million contract extension with the Coyotes on February 14, 2007. He responded the following season with his best season to date when he led the Coyotes in scoring in 2007–08 with 28 goals and a career-high 50 assists for 78 points. In 2008–09, Doan was selected to the 2009 NHL All-Star Game and won the inaugural elimination shootout segment of the skills competition, outlasting Marc Savard of the Boston Bruins in the seventh round. He completed that season with his second-straight 70-point season and a career-high 31 goals.

On October 18, 2010, Doan was suspended for three games for a hit on Dan Sexton of the Anaheim Ducks the night previous. The NHL&#x27;s disciplinarian, Colin Campbell, ruled that the hit was &quot;a late hit from the blind side to the head of an unsuspecting opponent&quot;, violating the NHL&#x27;s ban on blindside hits to the head. It was the first suspension of Doan&#x27;s career.

Doan had a successful and memorable 2011–12 season for the Coyotes, leading his team to their most successful regular season to date, as the Coyotes finished third in the Western Conference and won their first division title. Also that season, he scored 50 points (22 goals and 28 assists) and his first NHL hat-trick, on January 7, 2012, at 19:59 of the third period in the 1,161st game of his NHL career. Doan would also lead the Coyotes to their most successful playoff performance, contributing nine points to lead the Coyotes to their first and second playoff series victories over the Chicago Blackhawks in six games and the Nashville Predators in five, respectively, as well as the team&#x27;s first ever conference final appearance, where they would lose in five games to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Los Angeles Kings.

On September 14, 2012, Doan agreed to a four-year, $21.2 million contract extension with the Coyotes. As of the start of the 2014–15 season, Doan was the all-time leader in games played with the Jets/Coyotes franchise, and by scoring two goals and an assist in the February 12, 2016, game against the Calgary Flames, he moved into first place all-time in points for the Jets/Coyotes franchise with 931.

On December 29, 2015, Doan recorded his second career hat trick in a 7–5 loss against the Chicago Blackhawks. With this accomplishment, Doan became the 15th player ever to record two hat tricks after turning 35. He also tied Dale Hawerchuk&#x27;s franchise record for all-time goals scored. On December 31, 2015, Doan scored twice against the Winnipeg Jets to become the all-time leading goal scorer for the Winnipeg/Phoenix/Arizona franchise with 381 goals.

On July 12, 2016, Doan agreed to a one-year, $5 million contract with the Coyotes. As of the start of the 2016–17 season, Doan is the longest-serving captain in the NHL, having been named Coyotes captain prior to the 2003–04 season, is tenth in points among active NHL players, and is two points away from surpassing Dale Hawerchuk in all-time Jets/Coyotes points. Entering the season, he is 96th in all-time NHL points. On June 19, 2017, it was announced the Coyotes were parting ways with Doan, leaving him unprotected in 2017 NHL Expansion Draft and opting not to re-sign him for the 2017–18 season. The Coyotes left a standing offer to Doan to remain with the team in a non-playing role.

On August 30, 2017, Doan officially announced his retirement from the NHL. He became the first and only player to have his jersey number retired by the Coyotes (all other numbers that would never be worn by anyone else throughout the rest of the team&#x27;s existence were only considered honored by the team instead of retired), with the team raising his No. 19 to the rafters at the Gila River Arena (now Desert Diamond Arena) prior to a game against the current rendition of the Winnipeg Jets on February 24, 2019. After the Coyotes moved out in 2022, the banner was intended to be thrown away. Instead, an arena worker recovered Doan&#x27;s jersey banner and returned it to Doan himself after the Coyotes&#x27; final NHL home game in April 2024. The franchise would subsequently relocate to Utah in the offseason. Doan&#x27;s Coyotes banner is currently held at the Ice Den in Scottsdale, Arizona following the Coyotes&#x27; departure.

== Executive career ==
On October 10, 2007, Doan purchased a minority share in the Kamloops Blazers, along with fellow NHL players Jarome Iginla, Mark Recchi, and Darryl Sydor, as well as future Dallas Stars owner Tom Gaglardi.

On January 11, 2021, the Coyotes hired Doan in an executive capacity as the team&#x27;s chief hockey development officer. He served in that capacity for the next two seasons before being hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs as Special Advisor to the General Manager, on June 9, 2023.

Doan has also served in various capacities with Team Canada, first starting as a consultant for the 2019 World Championship before being named general manager for the 2021 Channel One Cup (where he also acted as assistant coach), 2022 Olympics, 2022 World Championships, and 2022 Spengler Cup. He has also served as an assistant general manager for the 2019 Spengler Cup, and 2021 and 2023 World Championships.

==International play==
Doan made his international debut for Canada at the 1999 World Championships in Norway and finished fourth with the team. He then won his first gold medal four years later at the 2003 World Championships in Finland. Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Doan competed in the 2004 World Cup and scored the game-winning goal in the finals against Finland to win the championship. Doan had also been named to Canada&#x27;s 2004 World Championship team several months earlier, but could not attend due to injury.

In 2005, Doan was named an alternate captain for Canada and helped lead the team to a silver medal at the World Championships in Austria. Two years later, he was promoted to team captain at the 2007 World Championships in Moscow. During the tournament, he scored the game-winning goal in a 4–2 preliminary round victory over Norway, then scored a hat-trick in a span of 6:25 in a 6–3 qualification round victory over Belarus. Canada went undefeated en route to a 4–2 gold medal game victory over Finland in the final. He remained captain for the 2008 World Championships and won his second silver, losing to Russia in the gold medal game.

===Controversy===
When Doan was selected for the 2006 Olympics, Canadian Liberal Member of Parliament Denis Coderre wrote a letter to Hockey Canada president Bob Nicholson asking him to remove Doan from the team unless Doan apologized for an alleged slur of French-Canadians he used on December 13, 2005, against a Quebecer referee during a game against the Montreal Canadiens. In January 2006, Doan filed a lawsuit against Coderre for defamation, seeking $250,000 in damages and promising to contribute any damage awards to charity. Coderre filed a counter-suit in April 2007, seeking $45,000 in damages.

When Doan was selected as captain on the 2007 Canadian national men&#x27;s hockey team, a Canadian Official Languages parliamentary committee demanded Hockey Canada appear before the committee to explain its decision to name Doan as captain in light of the aforementioned alleged comment. Doan&#x27;s selection was maintained, citing that an NHL investigation had cleared him of any wrongdoing.

Prior to Doan&#x27;s trial, set to take place in September 2010, he and Coderre agreed to an out of court settlement, stating that the Superior Court of Montreal could put its resources to better use if the matter was settled. Doan stated in the settlement that another player on the ice did utter the racial comments. The settlement also stated Coderre was wrong.

==Personal life==
Doan was born on October 10, 1976, in Halkirk, Alberta, to Bernie and Bernice Doan. His father, Bernie Doan (born June 27, 1951), was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the sixth round, 80th overall, of the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft and briefly played professionally during the 1971–72 season with the Kansas City Blues and Toledo Hornets. His parents ran a Christian summer camp in Halkirk called Circle Square Ranch. Growing up in a religious family, Doan continues to be a practising Christian; he writes the Bible verse Romans on his hockey sticks.

Doan and his wife Andrea have four children and reside in Scottsdale, Arizona. The family spends their summers in Kamloops where Doan played junior hockey and met his wife. His son Josh currently plays for the Utah Hockey Club, but was drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2nd round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.

Doan is a second cousin of Carey Price, a goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens, and also a first cousin of Keaton Ellerby, who last played for the Sheffield Steelers of the Elite Ice Hockey League, and Catriona Le May Doan, a two-time Olympic gold medallist in speed skating through marriage to her husband Bart Doan.

In April 2011, Doan, along with his brother Brook, were the &quot;prey&quot; on the television series &quot;Mantracker&quot;, successfully completing it.

Doan served as a pallbearer at the funeral service of American politician John McCain in Arizona.

<text>Pavel Valeryevich Datsyuk (, ; born 20 July 1978) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player. He was nicknamed the &quot;Magic Man&quot;, honoring his incredible stickhandling and creativity with the puck. From 2001 to 2016, he played for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). In 2017, Datsyuk was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history, and was the only active player outside of the NHL at the time of announcement. 

Datsyuk won the Stanley Cup in 2002 and 2008 with the Red Wings, and the Gagarin Cup in 2017 with SKA Saint Petersburg. He was part of the Russia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the Olympic Games in 2002, 2006, 2010 and was team captain in 2014 and 2018. With his gold medal win at the 2018 Olympics, Datsyuk joined the Triple Gold Club.

Datsyuk won the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 NHL season. He also won four consecutive Lady Byng Memorial Trophies, from 2006 to 2009, awarded for performance and sportsmanship. He was nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player following the 2008–09 season. Datsyuk is well known for his elite defensive play and game-changing offensive skills. He was also a leading player for the Russian hockey team at multiple Olympics and World Cups. Datsyuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early years==
Datsyuk was born in Sverdlovsk of the Soviet Union. His parents have called him by his short name &quot;Pasha&quot; from an early age. His childhood had more than its fair share of difficulties, especially at the age of 16, when his mother died.
While Datsyuk displayed above-average hockey skills, he was often overlooked by scouts because of his smaller size. He began playing for the farm club of Dynamo Yekaterinburg in the mid-1990s, though he seemed headed for an undistinguished career until noted Olympic trainer Vladimir Krikunov began coaching the team.

The boy &quot;with the twitchy walk&quot; caught the eye of Krikunov, but not on the ice. Instead, Datsyuk excelled on the soccer field, where his anticipation, vision and intelligence were more apparent. Under Krikunov, Datsyuk evolved into a particularly efficient two-way player, and he began to draw wider attention among Russian hockey fans. Despite his early successes, however, he went undrafted in the 1996 and 1997 NHL drafts.

==Playing career==

===Early play in Russia===
Datsyuk was first noticed by Detroit Red Wings Director of European Scouting Håkan Andersson in the summer of 1997–98. Andersson was in Moscow to scout defenceman Dmitri Kalinin, but the one who caught his eye was Datsyuk, described as &quot;this little guy on the other team.&quot; Andersson made another trip to see Datsyuk and would have gone a third time, though his flight was canceled due to a storm. A scout from the Calgary Flames was scheduled to fly on the plane as well, and as a result of the storm Andersson believes he was the only NHL scout to have seen Datsyuk play prior to the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, when the Red Wings drafted him 171st overall. Despite being selected in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, Datsyuk continued to play for Dynamo Yekaterinburg through 2000, when he then played for AK Bars Kazan during the 2000-01 season. During the 2000-01 season for AK Bars Kazan, he recorded 42 games played, 9 goals, and 17 assists.

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–2016)===

====2001–2006: Early years, first Stanley Cup title====
When Datsyuk began his NHL career for the Red Wings, he was mentored by compatriot stars Igor Larionov and Sergei Fedorov, as well as Detroit captain Steve Yzerman. He was put on a line with Brett Hull and Boyd Devereaux and had a moderately productive first year. The length and difficulty of the NHL season forced him to sit out a number of games at the end of the year in preparation for the 2002 playoffs. After the Red Wings won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions, Datsyuk contributed three goals and three assists to the Red Wings&#x27; 2002 Stanley Cup run.

Expectations were high for Datsyuk&#x27;s second season, particularly with the addition of another highly touted prospect to the team, Henrik Zetterberg. Zetterberg replaced Boyd Devereaux on the Datsyuk–Hull line, and the famous version of the &quot;Two Kids and an Old Goat Line&quot; was born. He played only 64 games due to a knee injury but ended up with 51 points for the season. His playoff performance was disappointing, however, the same as the entire Red Wings team; Detroit was swept by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the first round of the 2003 playoffs, and Datsyuk was held pointless within the four games played.

The departure of Sergei Fedorov in the 2003 off-season made room for Datsyuk to rise to prominence on the Red Wings. He took full advantage of his elevated ice time, where his playmaking skills earned him a spot in the 2004 NHL All-Star Game. Datsyuk finished the 2003–04 season with 30 goals and 38 assists for 68 points in 75 games as the Red Wings won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. In the 2004 playoffs, he had no goals and six assists through 12 games before Detroit was eliminated in the second round by the Calgary Flames.

Datsyuk became a restricted free agent during the 2004–05 off-season but could not reach a deal with the Red Wings despite repeated statements by his agent, Gary Greenstin, indicating his desire to stay in Detroit. He chose not to take the salary dispute to arbitration, and instead played with Dynamo Moscow during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. On 4 September 2005, Datsyuk then signed a one-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Russian Superleague (RSL), where Dynamo Moscow matched the offer two days later, retaining the player.

On 19 September 2005, the day the arbitration committee of the RSL was set to determine which club had Datsyuk&#x27;s rights, Datsyuk agreed to a two-year deal with the Red Wings for a total of US$7.8 million. During the 2005–06 season, which saw the Red Wings win another Presidents&#x27; Trophy, Datsyuk&#x27;s high level of play, combined with his sportsmanship (just 22 penalty minutes for the entire season), won him the Lady Byng Trophy, the first of four consecutive awards. Datsyuk also earned a spot on the Russian national team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

====2006–2013: Ascent to stardom, Selke trophies, second Stanley Cup championship====
During the 2006–07 season, Datsyuk debuted Reebok&#x27;s new hockey stick, with holes bored into the shaft to make it more aerodynamic, dubbed the 9KO. He completed the season matching his previous campaign&#x27;s total of 87 points. Prior to the beginning of the 2007 playoffs, on 6 April 2007, Datsyuk signed a seven-year, US$46.9 million contract extension with the Red Wings. He then helped Detroit to another lengthy playoff run as they advanced to the Western Conference Finals against the second-seeded eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks, who defeated the Red Wings in six games. He contributed 16 points (eight goals and assists) in all 18 games during the run.

In 2007–08, Datsyuk was voted by NHL fans, along with teammates Nicklas Lidström and Henrik Zetterberg, to start for the Western Conference in the 2008 All-Star Game at Philips Arena in Atlanta on January 27, 2008. He went on to have a career year, scoring a team-high 97 points (31 goals, 66 assists) in all 82 games while also leading all Red Wings forwards in blocked shots. In leading the team in scoring, he joined Ted Lindsay, Gordie Howe and Steve Yzerman as the only players in franchise history to do so in three consecutive seasons. The Red Wings would as a team would also go on to win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. Entering into the 2008 playoffs, Datsyuk scored his first career NHL hat-trick on 12 May, in a 5–2 win over the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, en route to a meeting in the Finals with the Pittsburgh Penguins. In Game 6 of the series, Datsyuk recorded two assists on goals by Henrik Zetterberg and Brian Rafalski in a 3–2 win to win the series in six games and clinch the team&#x27;s 11th Stanley Cup title and its fourth title in 11 years and second for Datsyuk himself. Having led the NHL in 2007–08 with a plus-minus of +41 and 144 takeaways (58 more than Mike Modano&#x27;s second-best total of 86), Datsyuk was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the League&#x27; best defensive forward. With just 20 penalty minutes, he also won the Lady Byng Trophy. In voting for the Selke, Datsyuk received 537 points (43 first place votes) while John Madden of the New Jersey Devils received 447 points and Datsyuk&#x27;s linemate Henrik Zetterberg received 425 points. In voting for the Lady Byng, Datsyuk received 985 points (75 first place votes). In addition, Datsyuk became the first NHL player to win the Lady Byng three consecutive times in over 70 years, since Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won from 1933 to 1935. Datsyuk, Anze Kopitar, and Ron Francis are the only players to have been awarded both the Selke and Lady Byng trophies during their careers.

Datsyuk was selected to his third NHL All-Star Game in 2009, but due to a hip injury, he did not participate. However, as per a newly formed League policy stating players must demonstrate injury by missing at least one game prior to the All-Star Game, Datsyuk was suspended one game, along with teammate Nicklas Lidström, for not attending. On 13 February 2009, Datsyuk played in his 500th NHL game in a 3–2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets and recorded an assist in the game on a Nicklas Lidström goal. Datsyuk finished the 2008–09 season with 97 points (32 goals and 65 assists) in 81 games, matching his career high from the previous season. He also won the Frank J. Selke Trophy, beating out Philadelphia Flyers center Mike Richards and Vancouver Canucks center Ryan Kesler, and won the Lady Byng for the fourth consecutive season. Datsyuk also received a nomination for the Best NHL Player Award at the ESPYs, but lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; center and captain Sidney Crosby. In the 2009 playoffs, Datsyuk and the Red Wings would reach the Stanley Cup Finals for a second consecutive season against the Pittsburgh Penguins and third time under Datsyuk&#x27;s career which would see the Red Wings fall to the Penguins in seven games, one win short from a second consecutive Stanley Cup championship and third altogether.

Datsyuk finished with his lowest end-of-season point total since the lockout in the 2009–10 season, scoring 70 points in 80 games for his third straight Selke Trophy. As a result of early season injuries to sniper Johan Franzén, center Valtteri Filppula and defenceman Niklas Kronwall, the Red Wings struggled to find consistency. However, a strong finish escalated the team from ninth place in the Western Conference in February to fifth place. Datsyuk scored the first two goals in Game 7 of the first round against the fourth seeded Phoenix Coyotes, including a breakaway deke on Ilya Bryzgalov, that sent the Wings to the second round for the fourth consecutive playoff season. The Red Wings, however, lost in five games to the top-seeded San Jose Sharks.

Datsyuk achieved a Gordie Howe hat trick on the opening night of the 2010–11 season on October 8, 2010, against the Anaheim Ducks with a goal, an assist and a fight, which came against Corey Perry. On 22 December, Datsyuk suffered a broken wrist in a game against the Vancouver Canucks as a result of a collision with Canucks&#x27; winger 
Mikael Samuelsson, causing him to miss the next 19 games. Despite an injury-shortened year, Datsyuk was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for the fourth straight season, which ultimately went to Vancouver Canucks&#x27; center Ryan Kesler. After recording 23 goals, 36 assists and 59 points in 56 games in the regular season, Datsyuk was yet again impressive in the 2011 playoffs, leading his team with 15 points (four goals, 11 assists) in all 11 games. After sweeping the sixth-seeded Phoenix Coyotes in the first round, the Red Wings fell behind 3–0 to the second-seeded San Jose Sharks in the second round (which also happened the previous year), Datsyuk almost led his team back from the deficit to win the series; a Game 5-winning assist to Tomas Holmström&#x27;s goal, a Game 6-winning assist to Valtteri Filppula&#x27;s goal and a Game 7 late backhand goal on Sharks&#x27; goaltender Antti Niemi highlighted Datsyuk&#x27;s heroics in an eventual losing effort. 

During the entirety of the 2011 pre-season, Datsyuk wore jersey number 24 as a tribute to former teammate Ruslan Salei, who perished on 7 September 2011, in the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, along with 43 others until switching back to his usual number 13 for the 2011–12 season. Datsyuk was an early-season candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the League MVP, until a knee injury in February 2012 forced the Red Wings into a slump. The team dropped from first place in the Western Conference in February to fifth place at the end of the season, where they drew the fourth-seeded Nashville Predators in the first round of the 2012 playoffs, losing the series in five games. Datsyuk finished the season with 67 points (19 goals, 48 assists) in 70 games for the season followed by one goals, two assists and three points in all five playoff games, and was also named to the 2012 NHL All-Star Game in Ottawa. Datsyuk was also named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for the fifth straight season which was eventually awarded to Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron.

As the NHL entered its second lockout in eight years in 2012–13, Datsyuk followed other prominent NHL players, such as Washington Capitals winger and captain Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburgh Penguins center Evgeni Malkin, in playing overseas while the lockout was in effect; he signed with CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on 16 September 2012. Datsyuk tallied 36 points in 31 games. When play for the NHL resumed in January 2013 for a 48 game-shortened regular season, Datsyuk returned to the Red Wings and managed to score 15 goals, 34 assists for 49 points in 47 games. Datysuk was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for the sixth straight year, ultimately ceding the award to Chicago Blackhawks center and captain Jonathan Toews. Detroit as a team finished as the seventh seed ad as a result would take on the second-seeded Anaheim Ducks in the first round where they would upset them in seven games (recovering from a 3–2 series deficit along the way) and make it back to the second round of the 2013 playoffs where they were defeated by the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning and eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in seven games via an overtime goal in game seven by Blackhawks defenceman Brent Seabrook. The Red Wings lost the series despite having a 3–1 series lead.

He shared the league lead with five goals and tied for second overall with seven points in four games to help lead the Red Wings to seven out of a possible eight standings points.

He was the last remaining member of the Wings&#x27; 2002 Stanley Cup Championship team.

On 24 June 2016, the Red Wings traded Datsyuk&#x27;s contract to the Arizona Coyotes along with the 16th overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for the 20th overall pick, the 53rd overall pick, and Joe Vitale in order for the Red Wings to clear salary cap space.
