<text>In computer science, iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search (IDS or IDDFS) is a state space/graph search strategy in which a depth-limited version of depth-first search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. IDDFS is optimal, meaning that it finds the shallowest goal. Since it visits all the nodes in the search tree down to depth formula_1 before visiting any nodes at depth formula_2, the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively the same as in breadth-first search. However, IDDFS uses much less memory.

== Algorithm for directed graphs==
The following pseudocode shows IDDFS implemented in terms of a recursive depth-limited DFS (called DLS) for directed graphs. This implementation of IDDFS does not account for already-visited nodes.

 function IDDFS(root) is
 for depth from 0 to ∞ do
 found, remaining ← DLS(root, depth)
 if found ≠ null then
 return found
 else if not remaining then
 return null
 function DLS(node, depth) is
 if depth = 0 then
 if node is a goal then
 return (node, true)
 else
 return (null, true) &quot;(Not found, but may have children)&quot;
 else if depth &gt; 0 then
 any_remaining ← false
 foreach child of node do
 found, remaining ← DLS(child, depth−1)
 if found ≠ null then
 return (found, true) 
 if remaining then
 any_remaining ← true &quot;(At least one node found at depth, let IDDFS deepen)&quot;
 return (null, any_remaining)

If the goal node is found by DLS, IDDFS will return it without looking deeper. Otherwise, if at least one node exists at that level of depth, the &quot;remaining&quot; flag will let IDDFS continue.

2-tuples are useful as return value to signal IDDFS to continue deepening or stop, in case tree depth and goal membership are unknown &quot;a priori&quot;. Another solution could use sentinel values instead to represent &quot;not found&quot; or &quot;remaining level&quot; results.

== Properties ==
IDDFS achieves breadth-first search&#x27;s completeness (when the branching factor is finite) using depth-first search&#x27;s space-efficiency. If a solution exists, it will find a solution path with the fewest arcs.

Iterative deepening visits states multiple times, and it may seem wasteful. However, if IDDFS explores a search tree to depth formula_1, most of the total effort is in exploring the states at depth formula_1. Relative to the number of states at depth formula_1, the cost of repeatedly visiting the states above this depth is always small.

The main advantage of IDDFS in game tree searching is that the earlier searches tend to improve the commonly used heuristics, such as the killer heuristic and alpha–beta pruning, so that a more accurate estimate of the score of various nodes at the final depth search can occur, and the search completes more quickly since it is done in a better order. For example, alpha–beta pruning is most efficient if it searches the best moves first.

A second advantage is the responsiveness of the algorithm. Because early iterations use small values for formula_1, they execute extremely quickly. This allows the algorithm to supply early indications of the result almost immediately, followed by refinements as formula_1 increases. When used in an interactive setting, such as in a chess-playing program, this facility allows the program to play at any time with the current best move found in the search it has completed so far. This can be phrased as each depth of the search &quot;co&quot;recursively producing a better approximation of the solution, though the work done at each step is recursive. This is not possible with a traditional depth-first search, which does not produce intermediate results.

== Asymptotic analysis ==

=== Time complexity ===

The time complexity of IDDFS in a (well-balanced) tree works out to be the same as breadth-first search, i.e. formula_8, where formula_9 is the branching factor and formula_1 is the depth of the goal.

==== Proof ====

In an iterative deepening search, the nodes at depth formula_1 are expanded once, those at depth formula_12 are expanded twice, and so on up to the root of the search tree, which is
expanded formula_13 times. So the total number of expansions in an iterative deepening search is

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the number of expansions at depth formula_1, formula_17 is the number of expansions at depth formula_12, and so on. Factoring out formula_15 gives

:formula_20

Now let formula_21. Then we have

:formula_22

This is less than the infinite series

:formula_23

which converges to

:formula_24, for formula_25

That is, we have

formula_26, for formula_25

Since formula_28 or formula_29 is a constant independent of formula_1 (the depth), if formula_31 (i.e., if the branching factor is greater than 1), the running time of the depth-first iterative deepening search is formula_32.

==== Example ====

For formula_33 and formula_34 the number is

: formula_35

All together, an iterative deepening search from depth formula_36 all the way down to depth formula_1 expands only about formula_38 more nodes than a single breadth-first or depth-limited search to depth formula_1, when formula_40.

The higher the branching factor, the lower the overhead of repeatedly expanded states, but even when the branching factor is 2, iterative deepening search only takes about twice as long as a complete breadth-first search. This means that the time complexity of iterative deepening is still formula_32.

=== Space complexity ===

The space complexity of IDDFS is formula_42, where formula_1 is the depth of the goal.

==== Proof ====

Since IDDFS, at any point, is engaged in a depth-first search, it need only store a stack of nodes which represents the branch of the tree it is expanding. Since it finds a solution of optimal length, the maximum depth of this stack is formula_1, and hence the maximum amount of space is formula_42.

In general, iterative deepening is the preferred search method when there is a large search space and the depth of the solution is not known.

==Example==
For the following graph:

a depth-first search starting at A, assuming that the left edges in the shown graph are chosen before right edges, and assuming the search remembers previously-visited nodes and will not repeat them (since this is a small graph), will visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G. The edges traversed in this search form a Trémaux tree, a structure with important applications in graph theory.

Performing the same search without remembering previously visited nodes results in visiting nodes in the order A, B, D, F, E, A, B, D, F, E, etc. forever, caught in the A, B, D, F, E cycle and never reaching C or G.

Iterative deepening prevents this loop and will reach the following nodes on the following depths, assuming it proceeds left-to-right as above:

*0: A
*1: A, B, C, E
(Iterative deepening has now seen C, when a conventional depth-first search did not.)
*2: A, B, D, F, C, G, E, F
(It still sees C, but that it came later. Also it sees E via a different path, and loops back to F twice.)
*3: A, B, D, F, E, C, G, E, F, B

For this graph, as more depth is added, the two cycles &quot;ABFE&quot; and &quot;AEFB&quot; will simply get longer before the algorithm gives up and tries another branch.

== Related algorithms ==

Similar to iterative deepening is a search strategy called iterative lengthening search that works with increasing path-cost limits instead of depth-limits. It expands nodes in the order of increasing path cost; therefore the first goal it encounters is the one with the cheapest path cost. But iterative lengthening incurs substantial overhead that makes it less useful than iterative deepening.

Iterative deepening A* is a best-first search that performs iterative deepening based on &quot;&quot;-values similar to the ones computed in the A* algorithm.

=== Bidirectional IDDFS ===
IDDFS has a bidirectional counterpart, which alternates two searches: one starting from the source node and moving along the directed arcs, and another one starting from the target node and proceeding along the directed arcs in opposite direction (from the arc&#x27;s head node to the arc&#x27;s tail node). The search process first checks that the source node and the target node are same, and if so, returns the trivial path consisting of a single source/target node. Otherwise, the forward search process expands the child nodes of the source node (set formula_46), the backward search process expands the parent nodes of the target node (set formula_47), and it is checked whether formula_46 and formula_47 intersect. If so, a shortest path is found. Otherwise, the search depth is incremented and the same computation takes place.

One limitation of the algorithm is that the shortest path consisting of an odd number of arcs will not be detected. Suppose we have a shortest path formula_50 When the depth will reach two hops along the arcs, the forward search will proceed from formula_51 to formula_52, and the backward search will proceed from formula_52 to formula_51. Pictorially, the search frontiers will go through each other, and instead a suboptimal path consisting of an even number of arcs will be returned. This is illustrated in the below diagrams:

What comes to space complexity, the algorithm colors the deepest nodes in the forward search process in order to detect existence of the middle node where the two search processes meet.

Additional difficulty of applying bidirectional IDDFS is that if the source and the target nodes are in different strongly connected components, say, formula_55, if there is no arc leaving formula_56 and entering formula_57, the search will never terminate.

==== Time and space complexities ====

The running time of bidirectional IDDFS is given by

and the space complexity is given by

where formula_58 is the number of nodes in the shortest formula_59-path. Since the running time complexity of iterative deepening depth-first search is formula_60, the speedup is roughly

{1-b}}{2\frac{1 - b^{n/2 + 1}}{1-b}} = \frac{1-b^{n+1}}{2(1 - b^{n/2 + 1})} = \frac{b^{n+1} - 1}{2(b^{n/2+1} - 1)} \approx \frac{b^{n+1}}{2b^{n/2+1}} = \Theta(b^{n/2}).&lt;/math&gt;

==== Pseudocode ====

 function Build-Path(s, μ, B) is
 π ← Find-Shortest-Path(s, μ) &quot;(Recursively compute the path to the relay node)&quot;
 remove the last node from π
 return π formula_61 B &quot;(Append the backward search stack)&quot;

 function Depth-Limited-Search-Forward(u, Δ, F) is
 if Δ = 0 then
 F ← F formula_62 {u} &quot;(Mark the node)&quot;
 return
 foreach child of u do
 Depth-Limited-Search-Forward(child, Δ − 1, F)

 function Depth-Limited-Search-Backward(u, Δ, B, F) is
 prepend u to B
 if Δ = 0 then
 if u in F then
 return u &quot;(Reached the marked node, use it as a relay node)&quot;
 remove the head node of B
 return null
 foreach parent of u do
 μ ← Depth-Limited-Search-Backward(parent, Δ − 1, B, F)
 if μ formula_63 null then
 return μ
 remove the head node of B
 return null

 function Find-Shortest-Path(s, t) is
 if s = t then
 return &lt;s&gt;
 F, B, Δ ← ∅, ∅, 0
 forever do
 Depth-Limited-Search-Forward(s, Δ, F)
 foreach δ = Δ, Δ + 1 do
 μ ← Depth-Limited-Search-Backward(t, δ, B, F)
 if μ formula_63 null then
 return Build-Path(s, μ, B) &quot;(Found a relay node)&quot;
 F, Δ ← ∅, Δ + 1

<doc id="433329" wikidata="Q371692" url="?curid=433329" title="Blob (Marvel Comics)">
<text>The Blob (Frederick J. &quot;Fred&quot; Dukes) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the X-Men. A mutant originally depicted as a morbidly obese circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable when he so desires. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the demeanor of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime on his own, and as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Freedom Force.

In live-action, Fred Dukes appeared in &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009), played by Kevin Durand. &quot;Giant&quot; Gustav Claude Ouimet had a cameo as Blob in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016) and Mike Waters had a cameo as the character in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024).

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #3 (January 1964).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Born in Lubbock, Texas, Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a circus sideshow under the name &quot;The Blob&quot;. His act was that he could remain stationary when others tried to move him. He is detected and contacted by Charles Xavier via Cyclops, who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the X-Mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an ice block around his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier&#x27;s invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the X-Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, as he plans to get technology from the X-Men and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device which will allow him to erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the X-Mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts Marvel Girl and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer&#x27;s tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone&#x27;s minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.

===Joining the Brotherhood===
The mutant Magneto soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob&#x27;s safety after he is hit by explosives which were launched at the X-Men. He goes back to the Circus. He teams up with Unus due to the alien Lucifer, who soon becomes his confidant. They disguise themselves as X-Men and commit crimes. The Blob also serves as a member of Factor Three. He briefly works as an operative for the Secret Empire, where he fights the Beast. With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights Professor X and the Defenders. He is reverted to infancy by Alpha the Ultimate Mutant. The Blob is later returned to adulthood, and fights the Champions of Los Angeles.

He later winds up in prison, but is freed by Mystique to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood. He becomes part of the plot to assassinate Senator Kelly, the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;. He also battles the Avengers as a member of the Brotherhood. With Unus, he battles the Hulk. With the Brotherhood, he battles the X-Men once more. He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks Spider-Man and the Black Cat.

He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored Freedom Force. On the team&#x27;s first mission, they help capture Magneto. They then battle the X-Men in San Francisco. Blob also participates in Freedom Force&#x27;s capture of the Avengers for the federal government. With Freedom Force, he attempts to capture Rusty Collins, then battles X-Factor. With Freedom Force, he battles the X-Men in San Francisco, and later assists in the attempt to arrest the X-Men in Dallas, battling the New Mutants in Dallas as well. He battles X-Factor again, and under Spiral&#x27;s orders, he and Pyro battle Daredevil in an attempt to capture a young mutant. He again attempts to arrest Rusty Collins, fighting the New Mutants again. He joins Avalanche and Pyro in attacking Avengers headquarters. With Freedom Force, he finally captures Rusty Collins and fellow New Mutant Skids. He helps to capture Cable, but is defeated by Cable and then by Sunspot during an attempt to recapture Cable. With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the Vault.

After Freedom Force&#x27;s dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by Toad and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves.

The psychic entity Onslaught later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities (in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to that of Phat). During this time, the Blob fights the various members of X-Force and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, Sabretooth, and the daughter of the original Mastermind.

When Exodus recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes&#x27; already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist Sean Garrison. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the New Mutants and the Hellions. He is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===Post M-Day===
Due to the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s depowering of 90% of Earth&#x27;s mutants, the Blob is one of the thousands to lose their power, though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit suicide, but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists.

Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the Thunderbolts and is seen in the Folding Castle&#x27;s Detention Quadrant.

Blob later resurfaces as a member of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking Mutant Town in defiance of the Decimation. After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and Wolfsbane) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.

Through unknown means, Dukes loses the excess skin and his fortunes turn in his favor. Now known as Freddie Dukes, he has become a weight-loss guru in Japan, and is to star in an upcoming movie filmed in San Francisco made by Kingo Sunen. He is also seen with Magneto and the High Evolutionary.

In the miniseries &quot;Magneto: Not a Hero&quot;, Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that these actually are clones created by Joseph.

In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #16, Fred Dukes is working with Mystique in Genosha and is once again shown as heavily obese and appears to have his powers restored. Mystique has supplied him with Mutant Growth Hormones (MGH) extracted from Dazzler.

Blob was later seen on Krakoa. He and Anole become the co-owners and bartenders of the tiki bar called Green Lagoon.

==Powers and abilities==
The Blob&#x27;s mutant physiology grants him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury. The Blob&#x27;s elastic, blubbery skin is difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine&#x27;s claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him.

He could also alter his personal mono-directional gravity field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy), although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob&#x27;s feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob&#x27;s speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.

The Blob&#x27;s superhuman strength greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the Thing. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.

The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.

Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, a large amount of alcohol is required.

==Reception==
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Blob 9th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===
Blob appears briefly in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; as a test subject that Henry McCoy was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that Apocalypse signed to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.

McCoy considered Blob&#x27;s mutation useless and sought to enhance his powers which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy&#x27;s rescue, but Dukes proved to be too much even for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting because moments later the head of the pens, Havok&#x27;s older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.

When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, the Blob was a member of Sinister&#x27;s team known as Sinister Six. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes&#x27; new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the Silver Samurai receiving a double dose. Quicksilver attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until Rogue stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six&#x27;s defeat, Blob managed to escape.

Later he&#x27;s seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane Weapon X. It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined Archangel&#x27;s quest to become the new heir of Apocalypse. He&#x27;s seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of Psylocke.

In the &quot;Final Execution Saga&quot; story line in &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;, Fredrick is part of a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Daken with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new Apocalypse. During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after Nightcrawler from the Age of Apocalypse universe betrays the team, to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live shark into Fredrick&#x27;s stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within.

===Age of X-Man===
In the alternate universe created by Nate Grey in &quot;Age of X-Man,&quot; Blob is the leader of the X-Tremists. This version of Fred Dukes is a dramatic departure from previous representations; he is &quot;soft-hearted, bookish, kind and gentle&quot;. Blob has romantic feelings for his teammate Betsy Braddock. According to &quot;X-Tremists&quot; writer Leah Williams, &quot;My hope in removing the villainy aspects of his character for X-tremists was to make people confront how they feel about fatness in general by utilizing an intriguing aspect of AoX: there is no bodily prejudice.&quot;

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In the second volume of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;, Blob is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.

===&quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot;===
Deadpool&#x27;s search for Cable across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of &quot;an age of Apocalypse&quot; (not to be confused with the X-Men story arc of the same name). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.

===House of M===
Put in an internment camp after Bolivar Trask&#x27;s rise to power in the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, he was freed in Magneto&#x27;s first major raid on US soil. After being freed, he first took his mutant name, &quot;Blob&quot; and was instrumental in the destruction of several Sentinels. He then joined Magneto&#x27;s mutant group. Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the Marauders. It was later revealed that Dukes is also a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood.

===&quot;Marvel Noir&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; reality, Eric Magnus is Chief of Detectives and Fred appears as a member of his Brotherhood, a cabal of bent policemen. He is initially partnered with rookie Detective Peter Magnus, and later with Detective Mortimer Toynbee.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
Blob appears twice in the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Toad and Rhino. He is later seen as a zombie fighting the X-Men.

===Planet X===
In the pages of &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;, the Blob is an enforcer on the alternate universe (Earth-13133) when the Apocalypse Twins skew the time lines and create a mutant utopia called &quot;Planet X&quot;.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The &quot;Ultimate Universe&quot; version of Blob, real name Franklin Dukes, is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. His powers are similar to that of his Earth-616 counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the &quot;Weapon X&quot; saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who cyber-seduces the X-Man Beast—leading to the discovery of Magneto&#x27;s survival and to the &quot;Ultimate War&quot; saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the Weapon X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men. In &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, the Blob is seen eating the Wasp, proving the cannibalistic claims are true. However, Hank Pym grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob&#x27;s head off in return.

It was revealed that Blob was Liz Allan&#x27;s estranged genetic father after she discovered her own mutant abilities. He had impregnated Liz&#x27;s mother while working for a circus sideshow. It was also shown that the Blob fathered a son (Theodore &quot;Tubby Teddy&quot; Allan) by an unknown woman. Teddy is in high school and has his father&#x27;s same bulky appearance and similar abilities, as he was shot at point blank range and merely said &quot;It tickles&quot;. He later joins Quicksilver&#x27;s new Brotherhood as the new iteration of Blob.

<text>The Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia (), commonly known as the Georgian Orthodox Church or the Orthodox Church of Georgia, is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox church in full communion with the other churches of Eastern Orthodoxy. It is Georgia&#x27;s dominant religious institution, and a majority of Georgian people are members. The Orthodox Church of Georgia is one of the oldest churches in the world. It asserts apostolic foundation, and that its historical roots can be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Andrew the Apostle in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD, respectively. As in similar autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian churches, the church&#x27;s highest governing body is the holy synod of bishops. The church is headed by the Patriarch of All Georgia, Ilia II, who was elected in 1977.

Eastern Orthodox Christianity was the state religion throughout most of Georgia&#x27;s history until 1921, when the country, having declared independence from Russia in 1918, was conquered by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Georgia, becoming part of the Soviet Union. The current Constitution of Georgia recognizes the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the country&#x27;s history, but also stipulates the independence of the church from the state. Government relations are further defined and regulated by the Concordat of 2002.

The Georgian Orthodox Church is the most trusted institution in Georgia. According to a 2013 survey, 95% respondents had a favorable opinion of its work. It is highly influential in the public sphere and is considered Georgia&#x27;s most influential institution.

==History==

===Origins===

====Traditions regarding Christianity&#x27;s first appearance in Iberia and Colchis====
According to Georgian Orthodox Church tradition, the first preacher of the Gospel in Colchis and Iberia (modern-day Western and Eastern Georgia) was the apostle Andrew, &quot;the First-called&quot;. According to the official church account, Andrew preached across Georgia, carrying with him an &quot;acheiropoieta&quot; of the Virgin Mary (an icon believed to be created &quot;not by human hand&quot;), and founded Christian communities believed to be the direct ancestors of the church. However, modern historiography considers this account mythical, and the fruit of a late tradition, derived from 9th-century Byzantine legends about the travels of St. Andrew in eastern Christendom. Similar traditions regarding Saint Andrew exist in Ukraine, Cyprus and Romania. Other apostles claimed by the church to have preached in Georgia include Simon the Canaanite (better known in the West as Simon the Zealot), said to have been buried near Sokhumi, in the village of Anakopia, and Saint Matthias, said to have preached in the southwest of Georgia, and to have been buried in Gonio, a village not far from Batumi. The church also claims the presence in Georgia of the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus, coming north from Armenia..

====Conversion of Iberia====


The propagation of Christianity in present-day Georgia before the 4th century is still poorly known. The first documented event in this process is the preaching of Saint Nino and its consequences, although exact dates are still debated. Saint Nino, honored as Equal to the Apostles, was according to tradition the daughter of a Roman general from Cappadocia. She preached in the Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia (also known as Kartli) in the first half of the 4th century, and her intercession eventually led to the conversion of King Mirian III, his wife Queen (later Saint) Nana and their family. Cyril Toumanoff dates the conversion of Mirian to 334, his official baptism and subsequent adoption of Christianity as the official religion of Iberia to 337. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of Mithras, pagan beliefs, and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Georgia. However, they now started to gradually decline, even despite Zoroastrianism becoming a second established religion of Iberia after the Peace of Acilisene in 378, and more precisely by the mid-fifth century.

The royal baptism and organization of the church were accomplished by priests sent from Constantinople by Constantine the Great. Conversion of the people of Iberia proceeded quickly in the plains, but pagan beliefs long subsisted in mountain regions. The western Kingdom of Lazica was politically and culturally distinct from Iberia at that time, and culturally more integrated into the Roman Empire; some of its cities already had bishops by the time of the First Council of Nicea (325).

===Expansion and transformation of the church===
The conversion of Iberia marked only the beginnings of the formation of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the following centuries, different processes took place that shaped the church, and gave it, by the beginning of the 11th century, the main characteristics that it has retained until now. Those processes concern the institutional status of the church inside Eastern Christianity, its evolution into a national church with authority over all of Georgia, and the dogmatic evolution of the church.

====Autocephaly====

In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Church of Iberia was strictly subordinated to the Apostolic See of Antioch: all of her bishops were consecrated in Antioch before being sent to Iberia. Around 480, &quot;[i]n an attempt to secure K&#x27;art&#x27;velian support and to acknowledge local support of the empire, the Byzantine government recognized – and perhaps itself instigated – the change in status of the K&#x27;art&#x27;velian chief prelate from archbishop to catholicos&quot;.

&quot;According to the Antiochene canonist and patriarch Theodore Balsamon (1140–95), &#x27;When the Lord Peter was the Holy Patriarch of the great and godly city of Antioch, the Synod decided to make the Church of Iberia autocephalous.&#x27; The patriarch he refers to must be Peter the Fuller (ca. 488). Even so, the church in Iberia did not gain complete independence from the mother church of Antioch.&quot; The church remained subordinate to the Antiochian Church; the Catholicos could appoint local bishops, but until the 740s, his own election had to be confirmed by the synod of the Church of Antioch, and even after the 8th century, annual payments were made to the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. &quot;This situation of continuing canonical dependence was altered after the 11th century, when the catholicos of Mtskheta spread out his jurisdiction over western Georgia. Since then, the head of the Autocephalous Church of Georgia has been the catholicos-patriarch of all Georgia, and the church has been fully independent in its domestic and foreign affairs, with the exception of the period between 1811 and 1917. Melchisedek I (1010–33) was the first catholicos-patriarch of all Georgia.&quot;

However, other sources state that the autocephaly was given to the Church at other dates. Ronald Roberson gives 467 for the year the Church became autocephalous. The &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; states that the autocephaly of the Church &quot;was probably granted by the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno (474–491) with the consent of the patriarch of Antioch, Peter the Fuller.&quot; Other sources indicate 484 for the year the Church became autocephalous. Rapp states that &quot;Fully-fledged autocephaly [of the Georgian Church] would not be achieved [...] until the Arab conquest or later.&quot;

====Territorial expansion and birth of a national church====

At the beginnings of the church history, what is now Georgia was not unified yet politically, and would not be until the beginnings of the 11th century. The western half of the country, mostly constituted of the kingdom of Lazica, or Egrisi, was under much stronger influence of the Byzantine Empire than eastern Iberia, where Byzantine, Armenian and Persian influences coexisted. Such division was reflected in major differences in the development of Christianity.

In the east, from the conversion of Mirian, the church developed under the protection of the kings of Iberia, or Kartli. A major factor in the development of the church in Iberia was the introduction of the Georgian alphabet. The impulse for a script adapted to the language of the local people stemmed from efforts to evangelize the population. A similar dynamic led to the creation of the Armenian alphabet. The exact origin of the script is still debated, but must have happened in the second half of the 4th century or the early 5th century. The introduction of monasticism, and its tremendous development, in Iberia in the 6th century encouraged both foreign cultural inputs and the development of local written works. From that moment, together with translations of the Bible, ecclesiastical literature in Georgian was produced in Iberia, most prominently biographies of saints, such as the &quot;Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik&quot; and the &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Abo&quot;. Many of the saints from the first centuries of the church were not ethnic Georgians (Shushanik was an Armenian princess, Abo an Arab), showing that the church had not yet acquired a strictly national character.

This changed only during the 7th century, after the wide political and cultural changes brought about by the Muslim conquests. This new menace for local culture, religion, and autonomy, and the difficulties to maintain constant contact with other Christian communities, led to a drastic cultural change inside the church, which became for the first time ethnically focused: it evolved into a &quot;Kartvelian Church&quot;. The bishops and Catholicos were now all ethnic Georgians, as were the saints whose &quot;Lives&quot; were written from that period.

In the western half of Georgia, ancient Colchis, which had remained under stronger Roman influence, local churches were under jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and were culturally and linguistically Hellenistic. Bishops from the port cities took part in ecumenical councils, from the Council of Nicea (325) together with those from the Byzantine territories. From the 6th century, those churches, whose language remained Greek, were headed by a metropolitan in Phasis. The integration of the Black sea coastal regions into what came to be known as Georgia was a long process. A first step came with the Arab invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries, which mostly affected Iberia. Refugees, among them noblemen such as Archil of Kakheti, took shelter in the West, either in Abkhazia or Tao-Klarjeti, and brought there their culture. Such movements led to the progressive merge of western and eastern churches under the latter, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared. The western Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicos of Mtskheta by the end of the 9th century. Political unification under the Bagrationi dynasty consolidated this evolution by the end of the 10th century: in a single, unified Kingdom of Georgia, there would be a unified Georgian Church.

====Relations with the Armenian and Byzantine churches====
During the first centuries of Christianity, the South Caucasus was culturally much more united than in later periods, and constant interactions between what would become the Georgian and Armenian churches shaped both of them. The Armenian Church was founded two decades earlier, and, during the 4th century, was larger and more influential than the Church in Iberia. As such, it exerted strong influence in the early doctrine of the church. The influence of the Church of Jerusalem was also strong, especially in liturgy. The Georgian-Armenian ecclesial relationship would be tested after the Council of Chalcedon (451), whose christological conclusions were rejected by the Armenian Church and important portions of the Church of Antioch, as well as the Coptic Church based in Alexandria.

At first, the &quot;Catholicoi&quot; of Iberia chose the anti-Chalcedonian camp together with the Armenians, even though diversity of opinions was always present among the clergy, and tolerated by the hierarchy. The king of Iberia, Vakhtang Gorgasali, who sought an alliance with Byzantium against the Persians, accepted the Henotikon, a compromise put forward by the Byzantine Emperor Zeno in 482. Such conciliation was attempted again at the First Council of Dvin in 506, and the status quo was preserved during the 6th century.

Around 600 however, tensions flared between the Armenian Apostolic Church and the church in Iberia, as the Armenian Church attempted to assert prominence in the Caucasus, in both hierarchical and doctrinal matters, whereas the Catholicos of Mtskheta, Kirion I, leaned towards the Byzantine, Chalcedonian side of the debate, as Iberia was once again seeking imperial support against the Sassanid Empire, who had abolished the Kingdom in 580. The Third Council of Dvin, in 607, sanctioned the rupture with the Armenian Church.

The following centuries confirmed the Byzantine orientation of the Georgian Church, and its estrangement from the Armenian Church. Confessional disputes remained impossible to overcome, and were a staple of theological literature in both areas. The integration of western and eastern Georgian churches from the 9th century also sealed the Orthodox nature of the Georgian Church, as Byzantine liturgy and cultural forms spread to the detriment of traditional Oriental practice.

===Georgian Church during the Golden Age of Georgia===

Between the 11th and the early 13th centuries, Georgia experienced a political, economical and cultural golden age, as the Bagrationi dynasty managed to unite western and eastern halves of the country into a single kingdom. To accomplish that goal, kings relied much on the prestige of the Church, and enrolled its political support by giving it many economical advantages, immunity from taxes and large appanages. At the same time, the kings, most notably David the Builder (1089–1125), used state power to interfere in church affairs. In 1103, he summoned the council of Ruisi-Urbnisi, which condemned Armenian Miaphysitism in stronger terms than ever before, and gave unprecedented power, second only to the Patriarch, to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families.

===Cultural influence of Christianity in Medieval Georgia===

During the Middle Ages, Christianity was the central element of Georgian culture. The development of a written Georgian culture was made possible by the creation of the Georgian alphabet for evangelization purposes. Monasticism played a major role in the following cultural transformation. It started in Georgia in the 6th century, when Assyrian ascetic monks, known as the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers, settled in Iberia and founded a series of monasteries, most notably David Gareja. They were soon joined by local monks, which led to the creation of significant works of hagiographic literature in Georgian, such as the &quot;Life of Saint Nino&quot; and the &quot;Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik&quot;. The golden age of Georgian monasticism lasted from the 9th to the 11th century. During that period, Georgian monasteries were founded outside the country, most notably on Mount Sinai, Mount Athos (the Iviron monastery, where the Theotokos Iverskaya icon is still located), and in Palestine. The most prominent figure in the history of Georgian monasticism is judged to be Gregory of Khandzta (759–861), who founded numerous communities in Tao-Klarjeti.
Specific forms of art were developed in Georgia for religious purposes. Among them, calligraphy, polyphonic church singing, cloisonné enamel icons, such as the Khakhuli triptych, and the &quot;Georgian cross-dome style&quot; of architecture, which characterizes most medieval Georgian churches. The most celebrated examples of Georgian religious architecture of the time include the Gelati Monastery and Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi, the Ikalto Monastery complex and Academy, and the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta.

Outstanding Georgian representatives of Christian culture include Peter the Iberian (Petre Iberieli, 5th century), Euthymius of Athos (Ekvtime Atoneli, 955–1028), George of Athos (Giorgi Atoneli, 1009–1065), Arsen Ikaltoeli (11th century), and Ephrem Mtsire, (11th century). Philosophy flourished between the 11th and 13th century, especially at the Academy of Gelati Monastery, where Ioane Petritsi attempted a synthesis of Christian, aristotelician and neoplatonic thought.

===Division of the church (13th–18th centuries)===
The Mongol invasions in the 13th century and Tamerlane in the 14–15th century greatly disrupted Georgian Christianity. The political unity of the country was broken several times, and definitely in the 1460s. Churches and monasteries were targeted by the invaders, as they hosted many treasures. As a result of those devastations, many fell into disrepair or were abandoned. In the western half of Georgia, the Catholicate of Abkhazia was established following the Mongol rule. It seceded from the Mtskheta see as the Kingdom disintegrated, and the western Catholicos thereafter assumed the title of Patriarch. This rival seat, based first in Pitsunda, then at the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi, subsisted until 1795. During those times, contacts with the Catholic Church increased, first as a way to liberate itself from meddling by the Byzantine Church, then to find stronger allies against invaders. Between 1328 and the early 16th century, a Catholic bishop had his see in Tbilisi to foster those contacts. However, formal reunion with Rome never happened, and the church remained faithful to Eastern Orthodoxy.

In the next centuries, Georgia, weakened and fragmented, fell under the domination of the Ottoman and successive Persian (Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar) Empires: mostly, the Ottomans ruled the West of the country, the Persians the East, while generally allowing autonomous Georgian kingdoms to subsist under their control. With the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Georgian Christians had lost their traditional recourse against Muslims, and were left to themselves.

New martyrs were canonized by the church after each invasion, most notably Queen Ketevan of Kakheti, who was tortured to death in 1624 for refusing to renounce Christianity on the orders of Abbas I of Persia (Shah-Abbas). Not all members of the royal families of Kartli and Kakheti were so faithful to the church, though. Many of them, to gain Persian favor, and win the throne over their brothers, converted to Islam, or feigned to, such as David XI of Kartli (Daud Khan). Other noblemen, such as Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, left the weakened local church for Catholicism, as missionaries were bringing the printing press and western culture to Georgia around 1700. Only the emergence of a strong Orthodox power, the Russian Empire, could reinforce during the 18th century the status and prestige of the Church among the elites, and the shared Orthodoxy was a potent factor in the calls for Russian intervention in the Caucasus, to liberate Georgia from Muslim domination.

===Under Russian and Soviet rule===

In 1801, the Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti (Eastern Georgia) was occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire. On 18 July 1811, the autocephalous status of the Georgian Church was abolished by the Russian authorities, despite strong opposition in Georgia, and the Georgian Church was subjected to the synodical rule of the Russian Orthodox Church. From 1817, the metropolitan bishop, or exarch, in charge of the church was an ethnic Russian, with no knowledge of the Georgian language and culture. The Georgian liturgy was suppressed and replaced with Church Slavonic, ancient frescoes were whitewashed from the walls of many churches, and publication of religious literature in Georgian heavily censored. The 19th century was a time of decline and disaffection, as the church buildings often fell into disrepair, and the trust of people in the institution was diminished by its Russification and corruption. Calls for autocephaly became heard again only after the intellectual national revival that started in the 1870s; the local clergy made such calls during the 1905 revolution, before being repressed again.

Following the overthrow of the Tsar Nicholas II in March 1917, Georgia&#x27;s bishops unilaterally restored the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church on 25 March 1917. These changes were not accepted by the Russian Orthodox Church. After the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, the Georgian Orthodox Church was subjected to intense harassment. Hundreds of churches were closed by the atheist government and hundreds of monks were killed during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges. The independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church was finally recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church on 31 October 1943: this move was ordered by Stalin as part of the war-time more tolerant policy towards Christianity in the Soviet Union. New anti-religious campaigns took place after the war, especially under Nikita Khrushchev. Corruption and infiltration by the security organs were also plaguing the church. First signs of revival can be seen from the 1970s, when Eduard Shevardnadze, then secretary of the Georgian SSR&#x27;s Communist Party, adopted a more tolerant stance, and new Patriarch Ilia II could from 1977 renovate derelict churches, and even build new ones. At the same time, nationalist dissidents such as Zviad Gamsakhurdia emphasized the Christian nature of their struggle against Communist power, and developed relations with Church officials that would come to fruition after 1989.

===Present-day status===

On 25 January 1990, the Patriarch of Constantinople recognized and approved the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church (which had in practice been exercised or at least claimed since the 5th century) as well as the Patriarchal honour of the Catholicos. Georgia&#x27;s subsequent independence in 1991 saw a major revival in the fortunes of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

The special role of the church in the history of the country is recognized in the Article 9 of the Constitution of Georgia; its status and relations with the state were further defined in the Constitutional Agreement, or Concordat, signed by President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Patriarch Ilia II on 14 October 2002. The Concordat notably recognizes church ownership of all churches and monasteries, and grants it a special consultative role in government, especially in matters of education.

Many churches and monasteries have been rebuilt or renovated since independence, often with help from the state or wealthy individuals. The church has enjoyed good relations with all three Presidents of Georgia since independence was restored. However, tensions subsist within the Church itself regarding its participation in the ecumenical movement, which Patriarch Ilia II had endorsed (he served as head of the World Council of Churches between 1977 and 1983). Opposition to ecumenism was fueled by fears of massive proselytizing by Protestant denominations in Georgia. In 1997, faced with open dissension from leading monks, Ilia II rescinded church participation in international ecumenical organizations, though he stopped short of denouncing ecumenism as &quot;heresy&quot;. Opposition against Protestant missionary activity has remained strong in contemporary Georgia, and even led to episodes of violence. Separatism in Abkhazia has also affected the church: the Eparchy of Sukhumi, regrouping Abkhaz clergy, proclaimed in 2009 its secession from the Georgian Orthodox Church to form a new Abkhazian Orthodox Church; this move remained however unrecognized by any other orthodox authorities, including the Russian Orthodox Church. The relations with the neighboring Armenian Apostolic Church have also been uneasy since independence, notably due to various conflicts about church ownership in both countries. 83.9% of Georgia&#x27;s population identified themselves as Orthodox in the 2002 census. In 2002, it was reported that there were 35 eparchies (dioceses) and about 600 churches within the Georgian Orthodox Church, served by 730 priests. The Georgian Orthodox Church has around 3,600,000 members within Georgia (no sources attempt to count members among the Georgian diaspora).

==Structure==

===Holy Synod===
The Georgian Orthodox Church is managed by the Holy Synod, headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. The Holy Synod is the collective body of bishops of the church. In addition to the Patriarch, the Synod comprises 38 members, including 25 metropolitan bishops, 5 archbishops and 7 simple bishops. As of 2012, the following bishops are members of the Holy Synod, in such hierarchical order:

<text>Louella Rose Oettinger, (August 6, 1881 – December 9, 1972) known professionally as Louella Parsons, was an American gossip columnist and a screenwriter. At her peak, her columns were read by 20 million people in 700 newspapers worldwide.

She was the first writer of a dedicated column on motion pictures in the United States, writing one in 1914 for the &quot;Chicago Record-Herald&quot;. She later started a similar column for the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot;, being lured away by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot; in 1924 because she had championed Hearst&#x27;s mistress Marion Davies. She subsequently became an influential figure in Hollywood and remained the unchallenged &quot;Queen of Hollywood gossip&quot; until the arrival of the flamboyant Hedda Hopper, with whom she feuded for years.

==Early life==
Parsons was born Louella Rose Oettinger in Freeport, Illinois, the daughter of Helen (nee; Stine) and Joshua Oettinger. Her father was of German Jewish descent, as was her maternal grandfather, while her maternal grandmother, Jeanette Wilcox, was of Irish origin. During her childhood, her parents attended an Episcopal church. She had two brothers, Edwin and Fred, and a sister, Rae. In 1890, her widowed mother married John H. Edwards. They lived in Dixon, Illinois.

Parsons decided to become a writer or a reporter during high school. At her 1901 high school graduation, she gave a foretelling speech, titled &quot;Great Men&quot;, after which her principal announced that she would become a great writer.

After high school, Parsons enrolled in a teacher&#x27;s course at a local Dixon college. She received a financial contribution from a distant German relative. While still in college, Parsons obtained her first newspaper job as a part-time writer for the &quot;Dixon Star&quot;. In 1902, she became the first female journalist in Dixon, where she gossiped about Dixon social circles, making a step towards her Hollywood career.

She and her first husband, John Parsons, moved to Burlington, Iowa. Her only child, Harriet (1906–1983), who grew up to become a film producer, was born there. While in Burlington, Parsons saw her first motion picture, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903).

When her marriage broke up, Parsons moved to Chicago. In 1912, she had her first taste of the movie industry working for George K. Spoor as a scenario writer at the Essanay Company in Chicago, selling her first script for $25. Her daughter, Harriet, was billed as &quot;Baby Parsons&quot; in several movies, which included &quot;The Magic Wand&quot; (1912), written by Louella Parsons. She also wrote a book titled &quot;How to Write for the Movies&quot;.

==Career==
===Hearst Corporation===
In 1914, Parsons began writing the first movie gossip column in the United States for the &quot;Chicago Record Herald&quot;. William Randolph Hearst bought that newspaper in 1918 and Parsons was out of a job, as Hearst had not yet discovered that movies and movie personalities were news. Parsons then moved to New York City and started working for the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot; writing a similar movie column, which attracted the attention of Hearst after he saw her interview of his mistress and protégé Marion Davies. Parsons had encouraged readers to &quot;give this girl a chance&quot; while the majority of critics disparaged Davies. Parsons showered the former chorus girl with praise which led to a friendship between the two women and led to an offer from Hearst in 1923 for her to become the $200-a-week motion-picture editor of his &quot;New York American&quot;. Her perpetual praise of Davies did not go unnoticed by others as well. The phrase &quot;Marion never looked lovelier&quot; became a standard in her column and a tongue-in-cheek cultural catchphrase.

There was persistent speculation that Parsons was elevated to her position as the Hearst chain&#x27;s lead gossip columnist because of a scandal about which she did &quot;not&quot; write. In 1924, director Thomas Ince died after being carried off Hearst&#x27;s yacht, allegedly to be hospitalized for indigestion. Many Hearst newspapers falsely claimed that Ince had not been aboard the boat at all and had fallen ill at the newspaper mogul&#x27;s home. Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s secretary reported seeing a bullet hole in Ince&#x27;s head when he was removed from the yacht. Rumors proliferated that Chaplin was having an affair with Hearst&#x27;s mistress Davies, and that an attempt to shoot Chaplin may have caused Ince&#x27;s death. Allegedly, Parsons was also aboard the yacht that night but she ignored the story in her columns. The official cause of death was listed as heart failure.

===New York Newspaper Women&#x27;s Club===
Parsons was a founding member of the New York Newspaper Women&#x27;s Club, and was elected president of the organization for one term in 1925.

===Syndication===
In 1925, Parsons contracted tuberculosis and was told she had six months to live. She spent a year in Palm Springs, California, which led to it being a popular resort for Hollywood movie stars. She moved to Arizona for the dry climate, then to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay. With the disease in remission, she went back to work, and Hearst suggested she become a syndicated Hollywood columnist for his newspapers. As she and the publishing mogul developed an ironclad relationship, her &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; column came to appear in over seven hundred newspapers the world over, with a readership of more than 20 million, and Parsons gradually became one of the most powerful voices in the movie business with her daily allotment of gossip.

===Radio program===
Beginning in 1928, she hosted a weekly radio program featuring movie star interviews that was sponsored by SunKist. A similar program in 1931 was sponsored by Charis Foundation Garment. In 1934, she signed a contract with the Campbell&#x27;s Soup Company and began hosting a program titled &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot;, which showcased stars in scenes from their upcoming movies. The stars appeared for free which did not please rival broadcasters or all of the stars but they did not complain in case of reprisals. Her opening line of the show was &quot;My first exclusive of tonight is...&quot;, which became feared. The show was cancelled after the Screen Actors Guild demanded payment for its members. Warner Bros. paid her $50,000 to appear in a filmed version in 1937, but the film flopped.

===&quot;First Lady of Hollywood&quot;===

Parsons saw herself as the social and moral arbiter of Hollywood and many feared her disfavor more than that of movie critics.

Parsons had informants in studio corridors, hairdressers&#x27; salons, and lawyers&#x27; and doctors&#x27; offices. Her husband Harry Martin was a urologist and Hollywood physician, and it was thought that he passed on information he learned in his position as a studio doctor. She worked from her Beverly Hills home with a staff consisting of a secretary, her assistant reviewer (Dorothy Manners, who worked with Parsons for thirty years), a &quot;leg&quot; man who gathered news, and a female reporter who covered the cafés. She had three telephones in her office. She also had former silent-movie stars on her payroll to help them financially.

She considered the biggest scoop of her career to be the divorce of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford, at that time the most famous couple in Hollywood. Parsons had learned of the split from Pickford herself, who had made the mistake of counting on the columnist&#x27;s discretion. Parsons sat on the story for six weeks, hoping that they would reconcile and concerned that the news might damage the film industry, but published once she heard that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; had also gotten the story.
When she received a tip that Clark Gable was divorcing his second wife Ria, Parsons essentially held Mrs. Gable hostage at her home until she was sure that her story was speeding across the wire ahead of any other service.

Her unofficial title &#x27;Queen of Hollywood&#x27; was challenged in 1938 by newcomer Hedda Hopper, to whom she was initially friendly and helpful. However, they came to be fierce rivals.

Parsons also appeared in many cameo spots in movies, including &quot;Without Reservations&quot; (1946), and &quot;Starlift&quot; (1951).

===Writing style===
In contrast to her arch-rival Hedda Hopper, who was notorious for her column&#x27;s crass tone, Parsons&#x27; writing style was often described as &quot;sweetness and light&quot; or &quot;gooey&quot;. She received criticism for her casual chatty tone and casual regard for dates and places. She countered that &quot;the best gossip&quot; is informal and that the speed at which she needed to complete her daily column did not allow for much rewriting or polishing. She stated that she would rather get the word out than potentially disappoint her readers.

She became known in Hollywood for assuming an air of goofy vagueness in order to snap up material without people suspecting she was listening or otherwise letting their guard down.

===Decline===
After the death of Hearst in 1951 and with the rise of stars becoming producers, Parsons&#x27;s influence diminished. She began to show signs of physical deterioration and when the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; folded in 1962 her column was switched to the Hearst afternoon paper, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot;. This meant she lost an edge to Hopper&#x27;s appearances in the morning &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

She continued her column until December 1965 when it was taken over by her assistant, Dorothy Manners, who had already been writing the column for more than a year.

==Feud with Hedda Hopper==
When Hedda had initially come to Hollywood, she and Parsons had a mutually beneficial arrangement. Hopper was then a moderately successful actress, and according to Parson&#x27;s successor, Dorothy Manners, &quot;if anything happened on a set—if a star and leading man were having an affair—Hedda would give Louella a call.&quot; In return, Hedda was guaranteed a few lines of copy under Louella&#x27;s increasingly influential byline.

After MGM canceled her contract, Hopper struggled to maintain her career as an actress. She was offered a position as a Hollywood columnist by the Esquire Feature Syndicate due to a recommendation by Andy Hervey of MGM&#x27;s publicity department.

One of the first papers to pick up &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot; was the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, a morning paper like Louella&#x27;s &quot;Examiner&quot;. Hopper first publicly scooped Parsons with the divorce of the president&#x27;s son Jimmy Roosevelt (a Goldwyn employee), who was involved with a Mayo Clinic nurse, from his wife, Betsey. The story became front-page news across the country.

===&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;===
When rumors began to surface that Orson Welles debut film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was inspired by Hearst&#x27;s life, Parsons lunched with the director and believed his evasions and denials. Hopper arrived uninvited to an early screening of the film and wrote a scathing critique, calling it a &quot;vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man&quot;. As a result, Hearst sent Parsons a letter complaining that he had learned about &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; from Hopper and not her.

On the warpath, Parsons then demanded a private screening of the film and threatened RKO chief George J. Schaefer on Hearst&#x27;s behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague but powerful threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10, Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. Horrified by what she saw, Louella rushed out of the studio screening room to cable Hearst, who telegraphed back the terse message &quot;Stop Citizen Kane&quot;. Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released &quot;Kane&quot;. She also warned other studio heads that she would expose the private lives of people throughout the industry and reveal long-suppressed scandalous information.

When Schaefer—who had also been threatened by Hearst with legal action—announced that &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was scheduled to premiere in February 1941 at Radio City Music Hall, Parsons contacted the manager of Radio City Music Hall and advised him that exhibiting the film would result in a press blackout. The premiere was canceled. Other exhibitors were fearful of being sued by Hearst and refused to show the film. As a result, despite support from Hearst adversaries as Henry Luce, on release overall the film lost money. Parsons was by no means alone in her campaign against &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; but Welles never quite recovered his position in Hollywood afterward.

===Ingrid Bergman===
In the early 1950s, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; ran on its front page, above Parsons&#x27;s byline: &quot;Ingrid Bergman Baby Due in Three Months at Rome&quot;. Bergman had left her husband, neurologist Peter Lindström, to live in Italy with director Roberto Rossellini but the news that she might be pregnant was met with some skepticism. Bergman was well known for the angelic role of Sister Benedict in &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;.

Hopper, who had been a public supporter of Bergman, had believed the actress&#x27; denial of the pregnancy, and printed a fervent repudiation of the rumor. However, Bergman was indeed pregnant and Hopper, enraged at being scooped, launched a PR campaign decrying Bergman for being pregnant out of wedlock and carrying a married man&#x27;s child. Parsons had allegedly received the tip from Howard Hughes who was incensed at Bergman for being unable to shoot a film for him as promised.

===Reaction===
Reportedly, whereas Hopper was more inclined to see their much-publicized antagonism as funny and good for business, Parsons took it personally and saw Hopper as a rival in every possible way. Hopper also referred to Parsons&#x27; husband, Harry &quot;Doc&quot; Martin, as &quot;that goddamn clap doctor&quot;, which infuriated Parsons.

It has been suggested that Hopper was set up as a columnist by Louis B. Mayer (with the blessing of other studio chiefs) to offset Louella&#x27;s monopolistic power. Gossip columnist Liz Smith, stated that: &quot;The studios created both of them. And they thought they could control both of them. But they became Frankenstein monsters escaped from the labs.&quot; Hopper and Parsons had a combined readership of 75 million in a country of 160 million.

==Memoirs==
Parsons&#x27; memoir &quot;The Gay Illiterate&quot; (1944), published by Doubleday, Doran and Company, became a bestseller. It was followed by a second volume in 1961, &quot;Tell It to Louella&quot;, published by G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.

In her personal histories, she expunged significant bits of her history in order to align her life with the Catholicism she began to practice in middle age. She alleged that her first husband died on a transport ship on the way home from World War I, leaving her a widow instead of a divorced single mother. Her second marriage to Jack McCaffrey and eventual divorce is omitted.

==Personal life==
Parsons was married three times. First, to real estate developer and broker John Dement Parsons, whom she married in 1905. From this union, they had one daughter named Harriet who was born on August 23, 1906, in Burlington City, Des Moines County, Iowa. Parsons divorced John in 1914. A year later, she married second husband John McCaffrey Jr. in 1915. The couple later divorced.

She pursued singing as a hobby, and took voice lessons with Estelle Liebling, the voice teacher of Beverly Sills.

Her third marriage was to Los Angeles surgeon Dr. Harry Martin (whom she called &quot;Docky&quot;) in 1930; Martin served in the Army Medical Corps during World War I and World War II. His specialty was venereal diseases and he advanced to the post of Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s chief medical officer. He was also known as a heavy drinker. They remained married until Martin&#x27;s death on June 24, 1951.

After Martin&#x27;s death she dated songwriter Jimmy McHugh, a fellow Catholic who introduced her to many of the new teenage musical sensations of the time, including Elvis Presley. The couple were a fixture at parties, premieres, and such nightspots as Dino&#x27;s Lodge on Sunset Strip.

Harriet would later follow her mother&#x27;s passion for writing, and would find employment as a writer for a popular California magazine. She also became one of the few female producers in the Hollywood studio system although she still struggled in this role despite the influence of her powerful mother.

==Later years and death==
After her retirement, Parsons lived in a nursing home where she died of arteriosclerosis on December 9, 1972, at the age of 91. Her funeral mass was attended by individuals from the movie industry with whom she had maintained genuine friendships. A convert to Roman Catholicism, she was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Parsons has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, one for motion pictures at 6418 Hollywood Boulevard and one for radio at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Richard Sylvan (13 December 1935 – 16 June 1996) was a New Zealand–born philosopher, logician, and environmentalist.

== Biography ==
Sylvan was born Francis Richard Routley in Levin, New Zealand, and his early work is cited with this surname. He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now Victoria University of Wellington), and then Princeton University, before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the University of Sydney. From 1971 until his death in Bali, Indonesia, he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS) at the Australian National University in Canberra.

Sylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist Val Routley (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982. After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (née Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name &quot;Sylvan&quot; (an English word meaning &quot;of the forest&quot;) to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to environmentalism.

He died on 16 June 1996 of a massive heart attack.

== Work in logic and metaphysics ==
Sylvan was instrumental in the development and study of relevance logic. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers Nuel Belnap and Alan Ross Anderson. Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into semantics for a large number of logical systems.

Their work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley&#x27;s work had a particular influence on Graham Priest, a well-known proponent of non-classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic. Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on dialetheism, the view that some contradictions are true. Not long after meeting Priest, and then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.

Sylvan&#x27;s studies ranged over a variety of topics in logic and the philosophy of logic. He wrote important papers on free logic, general modal logic, and natural deduction systems. However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository).

From early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated Meinong-inspired ontology (which he called &quot;noneism&quot;), first presented in his 1966 paper, &quot;Some Things Do Not Exist.&quot; After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, &quot;Exploring Meinong&#x27;s Jungle and Beyond&quot;. The view—also defended in recent years by Priest—utilizes a modal theory including &quot;impossible worlds&quot; to deal with supposed objects, like the &quot;round square.&quot; Sylvan&#x27;s formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong&#x27;s original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.

==Environmental ethics and politics==
Outside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of environmental ethics (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by Arne Næss). In his important 1973 paper &quot;Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?&quot;, he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of deep ecology, but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain. Further, Sylvan spoke of supporting &quot;regulated markets without capitalism.&quot;

Beginning in the 1970s, Sylvan published several other notable articles and books on environmental ethics and issues, and he co-authored the 1994 book &quot;The Greening of Ethics&quot; with David Bennett. From his work in environmental ethics, Sylvan took an interest in anarchism, contributing an often-cited entry on the subject to &quot;A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy&quot;.

Over 170 boxes of Sylvan&#x27;s papers can be accessed from the Fryer Library collection of The University of Queensland Library.

<text>Jason David Frank (September 4, 1973 – November 19, 2022) was an American actor and mixed martial artist, best known for his role as Tommy Oliver in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; television franchise.

== Early life ==
Frank was born in Covina, California on September 4, 1973. Frank had an older brother named Erik Frank, who appeared in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; as Tommy Oliver&#x27;s long-lost brother David Trueheart.

In 1992, Frank was a contestant on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Modeling life ===
Frank was a child model for the company called Olive Productions during the 1980s.

=== Power Rangers ===
Frank was cast in the role of Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. The role was set for 14 episodes, but due to the character&#x27;s popularity he was brought back as the White Ranger and the team&#x27;s new leader.

Frank was a huge fan of professional wrestling and Vince McMahon wanted him and the other Power Rangers cast members to appear on WWF programming to promote &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; for a few months. McMahon wanted Frank to referee the casket match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna at Survivor Series but Haim Saban refused to allow the Power Rangers franchise on WWF television and Frank was replaced by Chuck Norris for the casket match.

Frank was supposed to be the lead character Adam Steele in &quot;VR Troopers&quot; (originally called &quot;Cybertron&quot;) and shot a pilot episode before being called back to &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. According to Frank and Brad Hawkins, Hawkins&#x27; character was originally going to replace Tommy Oliver as the White Ranger in &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. However, due to Tommy Oliver&#x27;s popularity with &quot;Power Rangers&quot; fans, Frank was brought back, with Tommy Oliver becoming the White Ranger. Hawkins would then take over the role of Ryan Steele on &quot;VR Troopers,&quot; who was originally named Adam Steele. After three seasons, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; transitioned into &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; to match the annual change of the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series. Frank&#x27;s character became the Red Zeo Ranger, also called Zeo Ranger V.

The following year in &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, his character became the first Red Turbo Ranger. During mid-season, Frank and his fellow cast members Johnny Yong Bosch, Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland agreed to leave and were replaced.

After leaving the series in 1997, in 2002 Frank returned to &quot;Power Rangers&quot; as the Red Zeo Ranger for the special 10th-anniversary episode, entitled &quot;Forever Red&quot;, of &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force.&quot; This episode brought back ten former Red Rangers and reunited him with Austin St. John.

He then reprised his role in 2004 in &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot; as the Black Dino Ranger, which he stated was a favor to Douglas Sloan. While portraying this role, Frank wore long-sleeved shirts to cover the tattoos on his arms, which was also the case in &quot;Forever Red&quot;. He joked that Saban and Disney are &quot;both the same, they&#x27;re cheap&quot;, but that he was impressed with the production crew for &quot;Dino Thunder&quot;.

Frank reprised his role as Tommy Oliver and the Green Ranger in the season finale of &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot;. Frank expressed interest in developing a Green Ranger solo series or feature film after an encounter with Stan Lee at a comic book convention.

Frank had a cameo role in the 2017 film &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, as a citizen of Angel Grove, alongside fellow &quot;Power Rangers&quot; actress Amy Jo Johnson. In 2018, he reprised his role as Tommy in episode 10 of &quot;Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel&quot; for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. In August 2022, Frank revealed that he had retired from the franchise.

=== &quot;Bat in the Sun: Super Power Beatdown&quot; ===

On November 7, 2013, Frank appeared on &quot;Super Power Beatdown&quot; as the White Ranger taking on Scorpion from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. He appeared again on May 5, 2015, as the Green Ranger, and fought Ryu from &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. After success with the &quot;Super Power Beatdown&quot; series, Bat in the Sun began developing a web reality series of Frank, titled &quot;My Morphing Life&quot;. In 2015, the show began airing a second season.

=== &quot;Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe&quot; ===
In 2016, Frank was cast in the web series &quot;Ninjak vs. the Valiant Universe&quot;, based on the Valiant Universe, as Bloodshot. The series was released in 2018 to positive reception from fans. Frank was considered as superior to Vin Diesel&#x27;s incarnation of the character in 2020. Valiant paid tribute to Frank on their Twitter after his death.

=== &quot;New Era – Legend of the White Dragon&quot; ===

The film &quot;Legend of the White Dragon&quot; launched on Kickstarter in 2020. Initially, it was going to be a mini-series or fan film, but its popularity caused it to develop into a full-feature film. The film includes past &quot;Power Rangers&quot; performers, such as Frank, Jason Faunt, and Ciara Hanna. Other cast members include Mark Dacascos, Michael Madsen, Andrew Byron Bachelor, and Jenna Frank. The movie wrapped in 2021, and is currently in post-production. It was set to release in March 2023, but after Frank&#x27;s death in 2022, the film was rescheduled to be released in September 2024. As of 18, 2025, there has been no set date for the film&#x27;s release.

=== Fighting and martial arts ===
Frank had knowledge of many different styles of martial arts, including Shōtōkan, Wadō-ryū, Taekwondo, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and Aikido. He modified the most practical applications with his own philosophies to create his own blend of American Karate in 1994, &quot;Toso Kune Do&quot; (, ). On June 28, 2003, he was inducted into the World Karate Union Hall of Fame. Frank appeared at the Arnold Classic on February 29, 2008, in Columbus, Ohio. &quot;Toso Kune Do&quot; is still taught at his &quot;Rising Sun Karate&quot; dojo in Houston, TX.

Frank was temporarily a Guinness World Record holder in January 2013, as he successfully broke the existing record for the most 1 inch pine boards broken during freefall. The previous record was only two boards broken, but Frank attempted to break eight and successfully broke seven in his record breaking attempt. His record was eclipsed only a few months later in May 2013 by current Guinness World Record holder Daniel McKay, who broke twelve boards during his attempt.

=== Mixed martial arts ===

On August 21, 2009, Frank officially announced his signing with SuckerPunch Entertainment, a sports marketing and management company specializing in MMA. He began training with UFC lightweight Melvin Guillard.

Frank made his much-anticipated MMA debut for the United States Amateur Combat Association at the company&#x27;s first event &quot;Lonestar Beatdown: Houston&quot; on January 30, 2010, at the Houston Arena Theatre. He defeated Jonathon &quot;the Mack Truck&quot; Mack in the first round by omoplata submission. Frank fought in his second fight at Lonestar Beatdown: Dallas on February 19 in Arlington, Texas. His opponent was Chris Rose, who made his ring entrance wearing a &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; robe. Frank defeated Rose in round 1 with a TKO.

On May 8, 2010, he fought for the Texas Rage in the Cage Amateur Association &quot;Cage Rage 7&quot; in State Farm Arena in Hidalgo, Texas. His opponent was James Willis, who he defeated via KO with a rising knee within 23 seconds of the first round starting.

Frank was scheduled to make his debut with Ultimate Warrior Challenge at their upcoming event on May 22 against James &quot;Ray&quot; Handy Jr. in a light heavyweight bout.

On May 21, Frank announced on his official Facebook fan page that James Handy was injured and Carlos Horn would replace him, changing the fight to a heavyweight bout. Frank defeated Horn in the first round by an armbar submission.
Since turning pro, Frank expressed interest in signing a deal with Strikeforce and potentially fighting Herschel Walker.

Frank announced on his Facebook fan page that he was scheduled to make his professional debut on August 4, 2010, in Houston at &quot;Puro Combate #1.&quot; He fought at heavyweight, with his opponent being Jose Roberto Vasquez. Frank won his pro MMA debut with a time of 0:46 in the first round by a Rear Naked Choke Submission.

Frank was scheduled for a light heavyweight bout on December 9, 2010, at Puro Combate 3. The fight was canceled on December 8, due to his opponent not being medically cleared. He was then scheduled to face Shawn Machado on July 22, 2011, at Legacy FC 7, but due to a possible biceps tear, the fight was cancelled.

=== Power Rangers 30th Anniversary Reunion ===

On January 17, 2023, the first footage of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; was released on YouTube, showing the original Green Ranger. This prompted speculation that Frank was reprising the role again, and that his denials on social media were part of a disinformation campaign. On March 6, the YouTube channel &quot;MrWeenieProductions&quot; posted audio recorded from a livestream from the &quot;Bat in the Sun&quot; channel, run by a friend of Frank&#x27;s. This friend had stated that Frank declined to participate in the reunion due to an alleged history of lies, broken promises, and uncredited idea theft by Hasbro and Saban.

== Personal life ==
Frank began attending a Christian church after the death of his brother Erik. He married his first wife, Shawna, in 1994, and they had three children together before divorcing in 2001. In 2003, he married his second wife, Tammie, and they had one daughter. In 2022, Tammie filed for divorce, though she and Frank were attempting to reconcile at the time of his death.

In 2017, he was targeted by a man named Matthew Sterling while attending Phoenix Comicon. Police were able to arrest Sterling before he got near Frank, after being tipped off due to social media threats made by Sterling. Sterling was later committed to years at the Arizona State Hospital.

=== Death ===

On November 19, 2022, Frank was found dead by suicide in a hotel in Houston, Texas. His wife Tammie, who was also staying at the hotel, subsequently explained that Frank had been struggling with depression and other mental-health issues. Several of Frank&#x27;s former co-stars—including Amy Jo Johnson, Austin St. John, David Yost, Walter Emanuel Jones and Steve Cardenas—posted tributes to Frank.

<text>Alqosh (, , , alternatively spelled Alkosh, Alqoš, or Alqush) is a town in the Nineveh Plains of northern Iraq, a sub-district of the Tel Kaif District situated 45 km north of the city of Mosul.

The inhabitants of Alqosh are Assyrians who since the 18th century now mostly adhere to the Chaldean Catholic Church.
During the Iron Age, the Alqosh plain appears to have been home to the small regional kingdom of Qumāne, but was subsequently annexed by Assyria.

== Landmarks ==
The town of Alqosh is set at the foot of a mountain known as &quot;ṭūrəd-‘Alquš&quot; meaning “the mountain of Alqosh”. In the vicinity, there are the &quot;kahfa/kāfa smōqa&quot; (the red cave)&quot;, guppəd&quot;-&quot;naṭōpa&quot; (the cave of dripping), &quot;guppəd-māya&quot; (the cave of water), &quot;guppəd-saṭāna&quot; (the cave of Satan), &quot;guppa mgurəgma&quot; (the thundering cave), and a valley &quot;šwīṯəd-ganāwe&quot; (the bed of thieves) at the foot of Alqosh mountain. 

Behind the mountain there is also the site of Bezqin, known in Classical Syriac sources as ܒܙܩܝܢ &quot;bizqīn&quot; and pronounced by modern Alqosh as &quot;bisqin&quot;, containing the remains of an orchard and a Syriac Orthodox monastery, which may have originally been part of the Church of the East, and containing springs. After the Simele Massacre this was left and came to be ruined by vandals, and most of the ancient trees cut down or burnt.

== Christianity ==
The Assyrian people had gradually converted from Mesopotamian Religion to Eastern Rite Christianity between the 1st and 5th centuries AD. The importance of Alqosh for the Assyrian Church of the East arose from its proximity to the Rabban Hormizd Monastery, named after its seventh-century founder Rabban Hormizd (&quot;Rabban&quot; means &quot;monk&quot;), who is venerated as a saint in the churches descended from the Assyrian Church of the East.

The monastery, built on the mountain slope, was a centre of learning for the Church of the East not far from another centre but of the Syriac Orthodox Church. It was the burial place of the patriarchs of the Church of the East from the late fifteenth century and was their seat from the time of Shimun VI (1503–1538) until the end of the series of patriarchs known as the Eliya line. Isolated and cut off by snow from Alqosh in winter, it never became their permanent residence, and its line of patriarchs is commonly described as the Mosul line or as resident in Alqosh.

In the schism of 1552, the abbot of the monastery, Yohannan Sulaqa, was elected irregularly to the post of patriarch by several bishops who were dissatisfied with the restriction of patriarchal succession to members of a single family. By tradition, a patriarch could be ordained only by someone of archiepiscopal (metropolitan) rank, a rank to which only members of that one family were promoted. For that reason, Sulaqa travelled to Rome, where, presented as the new patriarch-elect, he entered communion with the Catholic Church, was ordained by the Pope, and recognized as patriarch of the &quot;Church of Mosul and Athura&quot;. He and his successors (who eventually formally broke communion with Rome) took up residence further east. This schism gave rise to the Chaldean Catholic Church, in opposition to what historians call the traditionalist wing of the Church of the East, that which officially adopted the name Assyrian Church of the East.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the &quot;legitimist&quot; Alqosh patriarchal line from which Sulaqa broke away in 1552, drew closer to Rome, especially during the 58-year reign of Eliya XI/XII Denkha (1722−1778), who sent several letters to Rome, some with professions of faith in line with Catholic teaching, but no formal papal recognition followed. However, it was a member of the family from whom the &quot;legitimate&quot; traditionalist patriarchs were chosen, Yohannan Hormizd (1760–1838) who, having considered himself a Catholic since 1778, was chosen as patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830.

== Association with the Prophet Nahum ==
Austen Henry Layard, who visited the area in 1847, reported that by &quot;a very ancient tradition&quot; the village contains the tomb of the prophet Nahum, whose Old Testament book begins with: &quot;An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.&quot; While Jerome located the birthplace of Nahum in Galilee, Layard considered the Alqosh tradition had some weight in spite of the lack of inscriptions or ancient remains. Iraqi Jews made pilgrimage to the site during Shavuot, and &quot;He who has not made the pilgrimage to Nahum&#x27;s tomb has not yet known real pleasure&quot; was a common saying. When Jews were expelled from Iraq or voluntarily emigrated to Israel in 1948, the Jewish custodian entrusted the care of the building to a local Chaldean Catholic. A survey conducted in 2017 determined that the structure was in danger of collapse, and in the following year work began on stabilizing it.

==Attacks==
* 1401 – the town was attacked and sacked by Timur (Tamerlane).
* 1508 – Alqosh was attacked by Pasha of Baghdad Bar Yak (Murad Bey).
* 1831 – the Soran Emirate attacked Alqosh, killing nearly 300 villagers.
* 1828 – Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadiya, approached Alqosh and set fire to the Rabban Hormizd Monastery.
* 1832 – Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz attacked Alqosh, killing over 600 of its inhabitants.
* 1840 – Resoul Beck, Mira Koor&#x27;s brother, repeated the attack.
* 1843 – the Rabban Hormizd Monastery was attacked by the Kurds, and 1000 manuscripts may have been destroyed.
* 2014 – The Islamic State came close to Alqosh, and almost all of the people fled; however, many men and youths did not leave Alqosh due to a desire to protect their town. ISIL failed to take the town after the intervention of the Peshmerga and local Assyrian militia known as Dwekh Nawsha.
==Demographics==
According to a CAPNI Organization report in January 2023, the residents of the Alqosh town were all Assyrian Christians, whereas in the broader Alqosh subdistrict, Yazidis made up 80% of the population.

In March 2020, Shlama Foundation reported that the town had a population of 4,567: 1,015 families of Chaldean Catholic denomination, the remainder being Assyrian Church of the East and Syriac Orthodox.

According to the Unrepresented Nations &amp; Peoples Organization, most of the inhabitants are Assyrians, with a smaller percentage of Yazidis. In 1913, the town of Alqosh, was according to Joseph Tfinkdji inhabited by 7,000 Chaldean Catholics. Many have emigrated since the 1970s. It is estimated that at least 40,000 &quot;Alqushnaye&quot; immigrants and their 2nd and 3rd generation descendants now live in the cities of Detroit, Michigan, the western suburb of Fairfield in Sydney, Australia and San Diego, California.

In February 2010, the attacks against Assyrian people in northern Iraq forced 4,300 to flee from Mosul to the Nineveh Plains. A report by the United Nations stated that 504 Assyrians at once migrated to Alqosh. Many Assyrians of all denominations from Mosul and Baghdad since the post-2003 Iraq war have fled to Alqosh for safety. The town&#x27;s population in 2020 is estimated to be roughly 4,600.

==Relations with KRG==
In 2014 the mayor of Alqosh, Faiz Jahwareh, was detained and replaced by KDP member Lara Zara, only to be reinstated after protests by Alqosh residents. Jahwareh was again detained and replaced by the KRG in July 2017 on the basis of corruption charges that were dismissed by the Iraqi Federal Court.

==Climate==
Alqosh has a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) with extremely hot and dry summers, and cool wet winters.

<text>A [[murder mystery]] game is a type of party game in which players investigate and solve fictitious murders. In many variations, a player secretly plays as a murderer while the others attempt to determine the murderer&#x27;s identity.

These games typically involve a group of 6 to 20 people.

==Origin==
The murder mystery fiction genre began in the first half of the 19th century. The party game wink murder dates back to the early 20th century and involves one player secretly selected as a murderer, who can &quot;kill&quot; other players by winking at them. A killed player must count to five before &quot;dying&quot;, and the murderer tries to avoid detection.

&quot;Jury Box,&quot; released in 1937, is considered the first murder mystery game. In this game, the players, acting as jurors, are given a murder scenario, evidence presented by the district attorney and defendant, two photographs of the crime scene, and ballot papers. After the players have made their decision as to who is guilty, the real solution is read out.

&quot;Cluedo&quot;, known as &quot;Clue&quot; in North America, was released in 1948 and is recognized as the first murder mystery board game[2]. In this game, players race to identify a killer.

The 1980s saw the introduction of role-playing murder mystery games in a &quot;How To Host&quot; boxed format. These early scenarios were generally simpler than modern games, with minimal acting directions and relied on the guests being comfortable ad-libbing responses to each other&#x27;s questions.

In 1986, Dimitry Davidoff created the party game &quot;Mafia&quot;, where players sit in a room and a number of secret mafia members conspire to &quot;murder&quot; innocent players during eyes-closed night phases. This led to a genre of social deduction games where players attempt to uncover a secret subgroup.

==Gameplay==

=== Dinner party games ===

Modern murder mystery games for dinner parties are often structured so that each guest is equally involved. Murder Mystery Dinner Party Game Kits can take the form of scripted games or interactive games. A player&#x27;s preference will be driven by how they want their party to progress:

* Scripted Games are where a small group of people sit around a table and play a planned out Murder Mystery.
* Interactive games are set up similar to parties, with the players having to find clues to figure out who the murderer is instead of scripts.
In scripted murder mystery games, the participants are told exactly what to say and when. They are often provided with introductory statements, questions to ask, answers to give, and occasionally some shared dialogue to break the ice. Character information often comes in booklets which are read from throughout the course of the evening, usually around a table in rounds with the sole purpose of solving the murder. These games gained popularity in the 1990s, particularly with the How to Host a Murder series. Scripted games allow no opportunity for ad-libbing; while players may portray their characters, their interactions are confined to the information furnished by the game.

In interactive murder mystery games, participants are provided with character backgrounds and confidential information. Unlike scripted games, these feature multiple subplots, and the goal extends beyond merely solving the murder. Typically, a dinner takes place during the event, but guests are not confined to sitting around a table; they are free to move about and engage with others at will. Participants are encouraged to interrogate, perform actions, or engage in activities with fellow guests, aiding them in solving the case or fulfilling their characters&#x27; individual objectives. Interactive games permit ad-libbing, allowing players to develop their characters in original directions. In some versions, the murderer is aware of their role from the outset, while in others, this information is revealed to everyone during the solution round.

The games for 6 to 20+ players usually takes over 2–3 hours and the players use their character booklets and clues (i.e., the game contents) to delve into the background of the murder using the questions, answers, hints, evidence, and clues provided. These are all designed to elicit more and more information about the murder until the players are in a good position to suggest who they believe the guilty party is.

More often than not, hosts invite players to attend the party dressed as, and ready to play the part of, one of the suspects listed in the game scenario. The scripted game is usually played over a three-course dinner party, whereas an interactive game can be played in a mix-and-mingle style format with finger foods, a buffet, or a sit-down dinner.

Interactive games are also used in team-building environments. Companies and church groups have found them to be a good resource for fostering good communication skills and building closer relationships among individuals. Organizers of the mystery can assign roles and characters based on their knowledge of the guests.

=== Large group murder mystery game ===

Because not everyone can take a role in a large group game, the role of &quot;suspect&quot; is usually given to actors, who learn scripts or ad lib a performance which will gradually reveal who the murderer is to the other guests. The actors are fully &quot;in the know&quot; about all aspects of the case.

The remaining guests will take on the role of detective and it will be their &quot;job&quot; to actively solve the case by examining evidence, finding clues, following and questioning suspects.

Large group events can be run in several ways including:
* In a single room with a staged theatrical performance.
* With actors acting &quot;in the round&quot; amongst the guests.
* In multiple rooms with clues scattered throughout the venue and suspects in different areas.
* As more traditional card games with clue cards given to the guests with chunks of information on each one.
* In video format with evidence being presented to teams after watching suspect videos. 
* In a combination of script and clue evidence.
Large group games are often played in a hired venue, a restaurant, a hotel, or at a workplace. They are often used for fundraisers, team building, and corporate events.

Live versions of murder mystery shows, in which guests attend commercial venues such as hotels as paying viewers, are sometimes classified as dinner theater or mystery dinners, rather than murder mystery games.

However, there are interactive games that were created for large groups of over 200 guests. Typically, these events are hosted like the other format of interactive games, but some characters in the game are expanded into teams to allow for everyone in the group to have a role.

===&quot;Jubensha&quot;===
Murder-mystery games known as &quot;jubensha&quot; () became popular in China in the late 2010s, where players meet around a table and read through a script to deduce who among them is the murderer. Some venues offer &quot;immersive &quot;jubensha&quot;&quot; games where players dress in costume, and venue staff perform the roles of NPCs (non-player characters.) The games draw inspiration from Western murder mystery evenings.

By early 2022, there were more than 30,000 &quot;jubensha&quot; venues in China.

==Versions==

Murder mystery games come in several different versions:

* Scripted or turn-based games work by releasing information throughout the game. As the game progresses, each character learns something new about the plot and their involvement. Each turn, players ask specific questions or perhaps read from a script. These are popularly played around the table at a dinner party.
* Interactive murder mystery games provide players with details of their character from the start, but it is up to the character to determine how they solve the murder. Often players have other objectives – such as to be the richest player at the end of the game. Most people will have their secrets that have nothing to do with the murder. This provides even more reasons for players to interact with each other. These games are better suited to buffets or finger food as generally, everyone needs to be able to mingle and also to talk to others without being overheard. Some are done during a sit-down dinner as long as time is provided afterward for guests to move about and mingle.
* Video-based or online interactive mystery games will use video to provide the back story of the crime and may provide witness testimonials or show evidence to allow guests to solve the case in a more &quot;game&quot; style format. These are often played individually, and occasionally in larger groups, on the internet.
* Murder mysteries can be played on internet forums, the organizer privately notifies the murderer to let them know and they must try to blame someone else on the thread. At the end of a round, the organizer reveals the murderer.
* Variants may involve changing the nature of the crime (especially if younger players are involved), allowing some participants to know certain facts in advance (even the identity of the murderer), or having &#x27;plot twists&#x27; of unexpected events to occur, to help or hinder the investigation, as needed. Games may contain scavenger hunts, puzzles, and problems to solve.

== In popular culture ==
Ngaio Marsh’s 1934 murder mystery &quot;A Man Lay Dead&quot; is set during a murder-mystery party in an English country house in which one of the guest is actually murdered with a dagger.
In the 1973 mystery film &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;, characters play a game where they are assigned secret roles, and which leads to a possible murder. The script was based on a murder mystery game its writer Stephen Sondheim had created for friends after college, where he &quot;told each person to think of a way to kill one of the others over the weekend we would be spending together in the country&quot;.

The 1985 comedy mystery film &quot;Clue&quot; is based on the board game of the same name. The movie follows six guests who are invited to a mansion, where they become suspects in a murder investigation. The film was released with multiple endings, offering different solutions to the crime.

The 2022 film &quot;Glass Onion&quot; opens with a technology billionaire inviting friends and influencers to a remote island to play a murder mystery game.

<text>East Staffordshire is a local government district with borough status in Staffordshire, England. The council is based in Burton upon Trent. The borough also contains the town of Uttoxeter and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Lichfield, Stafford, Staffordshire Moorlands, Derbyshire Dales and South Derbyshire.

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Burton upon Trent County Borough
*Tutbury Rural District
*Uttoxeter Rural District
*Uttoxeter Urban District

The new district was named East Staffordshire, reflecting its position within the wider county. The district received borough status in 1992, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

Since 2011, East Staffordshire Borough Council has been a member of the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership. In 2020, East Staffordshire also joined the Stoke and Staffordshire Local Enterprise Partnership.

==Governance==

===Premises===
The council is based at Burton upon Trent Town Hall. The building was originally built in 1878 as the St Paul&#x27;s Institute and Liberal Club, before being given to the old Burton upon Trent Borough Council in 1891 and subsequently converted to become a town hall. Significant extensions were added in 1894 and 1939.

<text>2C-E is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and documented in his book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;. Like the other substances in its family, it produces sensory and cognitive effects in its physical reactions with living organisms.

==Properties==
2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine is a colorless oil. Crystalline forms are obtained as the amine salt by reacting the free base with a mineral acid, typically hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Shulgin does not report an exact boiling point for the free base, stating only that during one synthesis the fraction boiling between 90 and 100 °C at 0.25 mmHg pressure was collected and converted to the hydrochloride salt. Shulgin reports the melting point of the hydrochloride salt as 208.5–210.5 °C.

==Effects==

According to Shulgin, the duration of 2C-E&#x27;s effects is generally between six and ten hours for an average dose, with the plateau lasting between three and six hours.

2C-E&#x27;s effects are often described as &quot;neutral&quot;, in comparison with other psychedelic chemicals and even other 2C-x related molecules. In &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin states:
:&quot;Here is another of the magical half-dozen. The range is purposefully broad. At 10 milligrams there have been some pretty rich +++ experiences, and yet I have had the report from one young lady of a 30 milligram trial that was very frightening. My first experience with 2C-E was really profound, and it is the substance of a chapter within the story. Several people have said, about 2C-E, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I like it, since it isn&#x27;t that much fun. But I intend to explore it again.&quot; There is something here that will reward the experimenter. Someday, the full character of 2C-E will be understood, but for the moment, let it rest as being a difficult and worth-while material. A very much worth-while material.&quot;

===Adverse effects===
Adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations. At least two deaths have been attributed to a 2C-E overdose.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===Australia===
In Queensland, 2C-E was added to the &#x27;Dangerous Drugs&#x27; list of the &#x27;Drugs Misuse Act 1986&#x27; by the &#x27;Drugs Misuse Amendment Act 2008&#x27;. Making it illegal to produce, supply or possess.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-E is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===China===
As of October 2015, 2C-E is a controlled substance in China.

===Denmark===
2C-E is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances.

===Finland===
Scheduled in &quot;government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market&quot;.

===Germany===
2C-E is an Anlage I controlled drug.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has a catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that would make 2C-I, 2C-E, DOI, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine Schedule 3 compounds in New Zealand.

=== Portugal ===
Portugal has decriminalized possession of all recreational drugs in quantities no more than a ten-day supply of that substance. However production and distribution (buying/selling) are a criminal offense.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry classified 2C-E as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-etylfenetylamin (2C-E), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===UK===
In the United Kingdom, 2C-E is a Class A controlled substance. The UK has the strictest laws in the EU on designer drugs. The Misuse Of Drugs Act was amended in 2002 to include a &quot;catch most&quot; clause outlawing every drug, and possible future drug, from the LSD (ergoline) and MDMA (phenethylamine) chemical families (including 2C-E). The amendment is a near verbatim quote from the books of the American biochemist Alexander Shulgin, who obtained a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Shulgin, a former research chemist at the Dow Chemical Company, re-discovered the synthesis for MDMA in 1976 and published the syntheses for more than 200 phenethylamine compounds of his own invention, and 55 tryptamine compounds many of which were also his own invention. The Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public&#x27;s access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.

===United States===
As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-E is a Schedule I substance under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.

<doc id="433376" wikidata="Q1764796" url="?curid=433376" title="Franklin's ground squirrel">
<text>Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel (Poliocitellus franklinii) is a species of squirrel native to North America, and the only member of the genus Poliocitellus. Due to the destruction of prairie, the populations of Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel have dwindled, approaching levels of concern. Its decline in the eastern portion of its range is mostly attributed to habitat fragmentation.

==Taxonomy==
Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel was first described by Joseph Sabine in 1822, who named it in honor of the British Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. It was formerly placed in the large ground squirrel genus &quot;Spermophilus&quot;, in its own subgenus, &quot;Poliocitellus&quot;, but since DNA sequencing of the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; gene has shown &quot;Spermophilus&quot; to be paraphyletic it is now placed in its own genus. Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel is suggested to be sister to a clade containing not only the Mohave, round-tailed, spotted, and Perote ground squirrels (genus &quot;Xerospermophilus&quot;), but the prairie dogs as well. There are no commonly recognized subspecies.

==Description==

Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel is a typically sized squirrel, with adults measuring from in total length, including the tail. Males weigh about in the spring, and up to in the fall. In comparison, females are significantly lighter, and put on proportionally less weight through the year, being about in the spring, and up to in the fall. The fur is brownish grey marked with both light and dark speckles, and fades to yellowish white on the animal&#x27;s underside. The tail is darker, almost blackish in color, while the head is a relatively solid grey.

In many respects, Franklin&#x27;s squirrel closely resembles the common eastern grey squirrel. However, it has a shorter, less bushy tail, shorter ears, longer claws, and a patch of slightly yellowish fur on the rump, which the eastern grey lacks. Other local squirrels with which it might be confused include Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel, which is more built, and has a longer tail, and the Columbian ground squirrel, which has noticeably reddish fur.

The squirrel has a number of scent glands. There are small glands at the corners of the mouth, which appear to be used when greeting other members of the same species, and a number of glands running from the shoulders down to the pelvis, which may be used to mark burrows. The largest glands, however, are the three anal glands, one above the anus, and one either side. These produce a musky scent during the mating season, and are found in both sexes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel is found from central Alberta to southern Manitoba in Canada, and in the United States from North Dakota and Minnesota as far south as northern Kansas to northwestern Indiana. Within this region, it inhabits tallgrass prairies where there is dense vegetation cover, often along the boundaries of woodland or marsh.
==Biology==
Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel is omnivorous, feeding mainly on vegetation in the spring and late summer, but with meat and eggs forming a significant proportion of their diet in the early summer. In the spring, they feed on roots, new shoots, and grasses, shifting to leaves and flowers, and then to fruit and seeds as the year progresses. Plants eaten include dandelion, stinging nettle, red-berried elder, white clover, and wild peas, as well as garden vegetables. Animal material consumed ranges from insects to eggs, small rodents, fish and frogs, up to rabbits and even fully-grown mallards.

The squirrel hibernates from about August to April, although this varies between individuals. Males typically enter hibernation earlier than females, and adults earlier than young-of-the-year, which need more time to build up fat reserves. Badgers are the main predators of Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrels, although they are also eaten by coyotes, foxes, weasels, hawks, and snakes.

The mating season begins as soon as the squirrels emerge from their burrows in the spring, and continues until June, during which time pairs may often share a burrow. Gestation lasts 28 days. Litters may be of anything from two to thirteen pups, with eight being average. The young are born naked and blind, with their eyes only opening after 18 to 20 days. They are weaned by 30 days of age. Females do not become sexually mature until their second year, but can live for four to five years, while males typically do not survive beyond the age of two.

==Behavior==
Franklin&#x27;s ground squirrel is diurnal, spending the night in burrows, typically built on steep slopes. The burrows are about in diameter, and extend on average below ground. They consist of a single nesting chamber lined with dried plant matter, and a number of side tunnels leading to food storage areas and latrines. Burrows typically have two or three entrances.

Each burrow is home to only one or two squirrels during the spring and summer, when the animals are generally antisocial. In North Dakota, males have an average home range of and females , although the home ranges of individual squirrels do overlap, and population densities can range from . In the winter, several individuals can share the same burrow.

<doc id="433377" wikidata="Q849740" url="?curid=433377" title="The Scout Association">
<text>The Scout Association is the largest Scouting organisation in the United Kingdom. Following the rapid development of the Scout Movement from 1907, The Scout Association was formed in 1910 and incorporated in 1912 by a royal charter under its previous name of The Boy Scouts Association. It is a founding member organisation of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. 

The organisation is the largest national Scout organisation in Europe, representing 35% of the participants of the European Scout Region. , the organisation claimed to provide activities to 444,682 infants to youths (aged 4–18) in the UK, with 83,792 direct adult leaders but 68,974 adults in &quot;governance&quot;, &quot;support&quot; and other roles, including Network members, which is more than one adult for every 3 children under 18. The organisation&#x27;s participation declined 22% from 464,700 in 2018 and has not recovered despite commencing a programme for even younger children.

Its programmes include Squirrels (aged 4–6), Beavers (aged 6–8), Cubs (aged 8–), Scouts (aged –14), Explorer Scouts (aged 14–18) and adult Network members (aged 18–25).

The organisation&#x27;s current aim is to provide &quot;fun, adventure and skills for life and give young people the opportunity to enjoy new adventures, experience outdoors and take part in a range of creative, community and international activities, interact with others, make new friends, gain confidence and have the opportunity to reach their full potential&quot;.

==Admission practices==
Membership is open to male and female participants, of all abilities, and of any religion including people outside any faith.

Gender

From 1912 to 1967, the organisation was called The &quot;Boy&quot; Scouts Association, and until 1976 only boys were admitted to its programmes. In 1910, Baden-Powell created an entirely separate organisation with a different name, the Girl Guides for girls. From December 1916, following the introduction of the organisation&#x27;s Wolf Cubs programme for 8 to 10 year olds, in which Vera Barclay played a pivotal role, the organisation permitted women to take on limited volunteer roles, working with the younger boys. In 1976, girls were allowed to join the organisation&#x27;s Venture Scouts for 16 to 20 year-olds. In 1991, the admission of girls to all the organisation&#x27;s programmes became optional. Since 2007, this has been compulsory. , girls made up 71% of all new members, with approximately 2.5 girls for every boy. Girls also made up 27% of all the organisation&#x27;s participants, with a total of 99,989 female participants, aged between 6 and 25. 69,460 adult women were involved in volunteer roles (being more than 1 adult female for every 2 female young people).

The organisation&#x27;s programmes are open to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other (LGBTQA+) young people and adults.

Religion

The organisation&#x27;s programmes are open to those of any religion or without a faith. There are variations of the organisation&#x27;s Scout Promise to accommodate all religions or beliefs. While originally requiring a promise of &quot;Duty to God&quot;, following criticism, in October 2013, the organisation announced that an alternative version of the promise would be available from January 2014 to admit those without a pronounced faith.

Disability

The organisation is open to all abilities. Flexibility is built-in to badge and award requirements for those with special needs. Some counties and areas have a specialist commissioner or adviser to support inclusion. Robert Baden-Powell was keen to allow young people with disabilities to take part in Scouting. The disabled branch (later called Extension Scouting) was formed in 1926. However, in more recent years, emphasis has been placed on integrating young people with disabilities into mainstream Groups. After the Second World War, specialist Agoonoree camps were run to cater for those unable to camp with their own Scout Groups, with some still running today.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
 For the origins of Boy Scouts and the Scout Movement, before the formation of The Scout Association, see Scouting.

The organisation was formed in 1910, in order to provide a national body in the United Kingdom which could organise and support the rapidly growing number of Scout patrols and troops, which had already formed spontaneously following the publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; and &quot;The Scout&quot; magazine in 1908. It was also the wish of Robert Baden-Powell to separate control of the Scout Movement from his book&#x27;s publisher. It was felt it was not given the status it deserved, as the publisher C. Arthur Pearson controlled much of Scouts.

===1910–1920: growth===
The organisation grew and spread to much of the British Empire. In 1910, the organisation approved special uniforms for Sea Scouts and formally adopted use of the name in 1912. On 4 January 1912, the organisation was incorporated throughout the British Empire by Royal charter for &quot;the purpose of instructing boys of all classes in the principles of discipline loyalty and good citizenship&quot;.

The organisation&#x27;s programme was originally just for boys aged between 11 and 18. However, many girls and younger boys wanted to join in. In 1910, a separate organisation, the Girl Guides were created by Baden-Powell and his sister, Agnes, to provide a more &quot;proper&quot; programme of activities. In 1916, the organisation launched its Wolf Cubs, for boys aged 8 to 11. In 1918, the organisation launched its Rovers for those over 18 who had grown out of being Scouts but wanted to be remain connected.

During the First World War, more than 50,000 Scouts participated in some form of war work on the home front. Scout buglers sounded the &quot;all clear&quot; after air raids or air strike, others helped in hospitals and made up aid parcels; Sea Scouts assisted the Coastguard in watching the vulnerable East coast.

In 1920, the organisation organised the first World Jamboree, held in Olympia, London, together with an international conference for leaders which led to the formation, in 1922, of the International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement now called the World Organization of the Scout Movement, of which the organisation was a founding member.

&quot;The Boy Scouts Headquarters Gazette&quot; was first published in July 1909, as a publication for adult Scouters and administrators, alongside &quot;The Scout&quot;, a magazine for youths which had been launched in April 1908.

===1920–1967===
In 1929, the organisation hosted the 3rd World Scout Jamboree at Arrowe Park in Cheshire; some 56,000 Scouts from 35 countries attended, making it the largest World Scout Jamboree to date. The first &quot;Gang Show&quot;, produced by Ralph Reader, opened at the Scala Theatre in London in October 1932. Following the outbreak of World War II, over 50,000 Scouts trained under the National War Service scheme. Tasks undertaken included police messengers and stretcher bearers. In January 1941, the organisation launched its Air Scout branch, allowing Scout Troops to specialise in activities related to aircraft and flying.

The organisation continued to be headed by Baden-Powell, as its Chief Scout and chairman for life until he retired to Kenya in 1938 where he died on 8 January 1941. The organisation then appointed Lord Somers as its Chief Scout.

Starting in 1944, the Scout International Relief Service (SIRS) sent teams of Rovers and Scouters to continental Europe to provide humanitarian aid; ten SIRS teams worked at the recently relieved Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. After years of trial schemes, in 1946, the organisation launched its Senior Scout programme for Boy Scouts aged fifteen to eighteen years to form separate patrols or troops, with age appropriate activities and badges. Scouts were prominent in their support of the 1948 Summer Olympics, playing leading roles in the open and closing ceremonies at Wembley Stadium and the sailing events at Torbay. The first Bob a Job Week took place in April 1949, in which Scouts did small tasks for the public in return for a &quot;bob&quot; - colloquial name for the shilling coin (5 new pence) - to raise funds for the organisation and for C. Arthur Pearson&#x27;s fund for the blind. Over the organisation&#x27;s history, some boys had been challenged to justify their enrolment because of their own or even their parents&#x27; religious or political beliefs. In the early 1950s, some Boy Scouts were dismissed or marginalized in their Scout Groups due to their involvement with the Young Communist League or related communist activities – the most high-profile case being that of Paul Garland from Bristol in 1954 which resulted in media reports and a debate in the House of Lords, where the organisation&#x27;s Chief Scout, Lord Rowallan, defended the organisation&#x27;s political and religious discrimination based on foreign communist regimes&#x27; antipathy to Scout organisations and the organisation&#x27;s policy and Scout Promise requiring adherence to an organised religion and not accepting atheists. The matter was withdrawn without a division, and it took 60 more years for the organisation to change its discriminatory policy and accept atheists.

In 1957, to commemorate fifty years of Scouting and the centenary of Baden-Powell&#x27;s birth, the organisation hosted the 9th World Scout Jamboree, which took place at Sutton Park in Birmingham.

===1967–2001===

The organisation&#x27;s programmes went largely unchanged until it underwent a major review in the 1960s. The Chief Scouts&#x27; Advance Party was formed in 1964 and was sent to survey the organisation to see why participation was falling. Their report was published in 1966 and changes were implemented later that year and throughout 1967. As a result, the word &quot;boy&quot; was dropped from the organisation&#x27;s name which was changed to &quot;The Scout Association&quot; and major changes were made to the age sections and their respective programmes. The youngest section were now named Cubs, the Boy Scout section was renamed simply as the Scout section and the Senior Scouts and Rovers sections were replaced with Venture Scouts for 16- to 20-year-olds. The uniform were also changed with the inclusion of optional long trousers, as opposed to the compulsory wearing of shorts, and the wearing of a Beret instead of the Campaign hat.

The Advance Party Report was not welcomed by all involved and a rival report, &quot;A Boy Scout Black Paper&quot;, was produced in 1970 by The Scout Action Group. This provided alternative proposals for the development of the organisation and asked for groups that wished to continue to follow Baden-Powell&#x27;s original scheme to be permitted to do so. The rejection of these proposals resulted in the formation of the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association.

Several developments were made over the following years, including the admission of girls, initially restricted to the Venture Scouts section in 1976, but from 1991 junior sections were allowed to become mixed as well, starting in Bradford, West Yorkshire and working its way throughout the UK. Parents of children involved with the organisation in Northern Ireland also began to organise activities for children who were too young for Cubs. Initially, only the leaders of these activities, nicknamed Beavers, were registered and organisation officials, with the children participating not being enrolled by the organisation until it formally adopted the programme in 1986. In the late 1990s, a Muslim Scout Fellowship was formed, which by the end of 2007, had assisted the establishment of 13 Muslim Scout Groups in England and Wales.

Despite these and other changes, the organisation&#x27;s enrolments fell into a decline through the 1990s. This spurred a major review into the causes of the decline in 1999.

===2001–2014===

The organisation found itself competing for young people&#x27;s time against many other extracurricular activities and schools themselves which were increasingly venturing into the same types of activities. In addition, adult leaders became concerned with the growing litigation culture in the UK and the negative stereotype as being old fashioned.
To keep up with trends and appeal to audience new generation, a new uniform, designed by Meg Andrew, was launched in 2001. The uniform included a variety of bold colours, with the younger sections wearing sweatshirts and activity trousers.

In 2002 the organisation launched its new vision towards 2012, which heralded another period of change. The Venture Scouts programme was discontinued and two new sections were introduced: Scout Network for 18- to 25-year-olds, as well as Explorer Scouts for 14- to 18-year-olds. A new programme was introduced, complete with a new range of badges and awards covering a wider variety of topics such as Public Relations and Information Technology, developing practical and employability skills. The new badges drew mixed reactions from several public figures, with some praising the organisation for &quot;moving with the times&quot; and others feeling the changes went &quot;against the Scouting ethos of Baden-Powell&quot;.

Further changes took place in 2003 when the organisation&#x27;s Adult Training Scheme was relaunched to be more focused and targeted to the volunteers individual role as opposed to the more general training received before.

The organisation also began to change in its focus, with a renewed emphasis on outdoor adventure and it now offers over 200 fun and adventurous activities from abseiling and archery while also offering a wider range of development opportunities, from coding to music and drama. In 2004 the organisation appointed television presenter Peter Duncan as its Chief Scout, who was succeeded by adventurer Bear Grylls in July 2009. The organisation appointed its first UK Chief Commissioner, Wayne Bulpitt, on the same day, with a particular remit to support volunteers, grow and develop the organisation.

The organisation hosted several major events during this time including EuroJam in 2005, hosting 10,000 Scouts and Guides from 40 countries, the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007 as well as playing a major role in the centenary celebrations of Scouting that same year, with celebration events organised on Brownsea Island.

By 2010, census figures showed a strong upturn, with the organisation claiming its highest rate of growth in UK since 1972, with total claimed participation reaching just under half a million. In 2014, the organisation claimed an increase in youth enrolments of 100,000 in the ten years since 2004. In 2016 it claimed eleven years of consecutive growth and an increase in female enrolment, with 25% of participants now female in the 25 years since girls were first welcomed in 1976.

The organisation claims one of its biggest challenges is encouraging more adults to volunteer to reduce the number of young people on waiting lists (cited at around 40,000). However, by its reported figures (above) it has a high ratio of more than 1 adult volunteer to 4 participant young people (see above), and &quot;young people&quot; includes adults aged 18 to 25. The effort to attract new volunteers received a boost when the Duchess of Cambridge announced her intention to become a volunteer leader for the organisation with a Scout Group near her Anglesey home. In the decade up to 2014, the number of adult volunteers increased by 14,596 to a total of over 104,000.

===2014–present===
A new strategic plan entitled &quot;Scouting for All&quot; was launched in 2014, setting the organisation&#x27;s focus to 2018. It proposed four key areas of activity: growth, inclusivity, increasing youth involvement in planning and projects to improve their local area. As part of this, in 2014, the organisation introduced the role of its national youth commissioner. The organisation&#x27;s national youth commissioner works with its national leadership team; its chief executive, its Chief Scout, its chief commissioner and its chair of the board of trustees, to contribute to discussions on behalf of youths and ensuring key changes are subject to youth consultation. Counties and district units were encouraged to appoint their own youth commissioners for young people to have an opportunity to influence their activities.

In October 2015, as part of the commitment to developing community impact, the organisation launched a three-year community impact project called &quot;A Million Hands&quot; to mobilise half a million Scouts to support four social issues chosen by their young people. Its aim is to build real and lasting relationships in communities that will enable young people to continue taking &quot;social action&quot; long into the future. The project works in partnership with six key charities; Mind, Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, Leonard Cheshire Disability, Guide Dogs, Water Aid and Canal &amp; River Trust to support the four key issues of dementia, disability, mental wellbeing and resilience and clean water and sanitation.

Also in 2015, Dr Ann Limb was appointed chair of the organisation, the first woman to hold the post. Already Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), Limb was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to young people and philanthropy.

Throughout 2016, the organisation celebrated the centenary of its Cub section, named Cubs100. The centenary celebrations marked the launch of the fully developed Wolf Cub programme on 16 December 2016, 100 years after the first wolf cub section was launched. Adventurer Steve Backshall was appointed Cubs100 Ambassador to raise the profile of the anniversary year. A range of events took place throughout 2016, from adventure camps to locally organised &quot;promise parties&quot; on 16 December itself, at which Cubs renewed their promises. One promise party in Kings Lynn was attended by the Duchess of Cambridge.

In May 2018, the organisation announced a new &#x27;Skills For Life&#x27; strategy as its focus to 2023. Its objectives are similar (with the same outcomes of growth, inclusivity, youth shaped Scouting and community impact), however there is now more of a framework to develop and achieve the objectives. Alongside the new strategy launch, the organisation launched new branding to support the strategy and change the then 17-year-old logo. The major changes included a new typeface for documents and literature from the organisation, new colours with an updated corporate logo. This was introduced to the organisation on a two-year transition period.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the organisation&#x27;s face-to-face activities were suspended and weekly meetings had to be delivered through Zoom. To support this, the organisation launched an online package of activities called &quot;the Great Indoors&quot; and a national fund raising campaign called &quot;Hike to the Moon&quot; in aid of those affected by the crisis, as well as online briefings for adult leaders. Despite these initiatives, in May 2021 it was announced that enrolment numbers had fallen by over 100,000 (from 480,083 to 362,752), with the number of adult leaders falling from 156,000 in 2020 to just under 141,000, reported to be the largest drop in numbers since 1941. The financial situation of the association declined during the pandemic and in the aftermath, necessitating the selling of an activity centre and hostel and 150 staff being made redundant. Additionally, a recruitment campaign for 10,000 volunteer leaders was launched to replace volunteers who departed and build capacity for the high demand from young people. Despite the associations efforts, membership in the early years of the 2020s did not rise as quickly as they had expected, requiring further staff redundancies in April 2024 to cover missing membership fees.

Announced as part of the &quot;Skills For Life&quot; strategic plan in May 2018, from 2019 the organisation trialled an early years programme section. The name initially chosen for the pilots, involving children aged 4–6 years, was Hedgehogs and involved a programme funded by the Department for Education and delivered either as an organisation-led programme, a parent-led programme or a partner-led early years programme. The aim of the pilot was to explore early years provision with children of this age and determine whether this is a route the organisation should take. The organisation decided to proceed with the pilot and the phased roll out of the section over a period of years until it was in a position to introduce the section formally, now under the name Squirrels, in September 2021. The name was chosen after field testing in communities underrepresented in the organisation&#x27;s programmes, and because of the support of the Northern Ireland Squirrel Association that subsequently merged into the organisation after 25 years of independent operation alongside the organisation in Northern Ireland. The name is also recognised by many due to its links to the popular children&#x27;s programme &quot;Hey Duggee&quot;. Squirrels wear a red sweatshirt uniform and meet in Dreys organised within Scout groups. The initial 200 dreys were targeted to areas previously under-served by the organisation including diverse areas and those comprising a high number of low income households.

==Organisational structure==
The organisation consists of between just 300 and 500 members, called the &quot;council&quot; in its incorporating charter. The majority of the council are elected by the council itself with the council or its board also appointing all its officers and all commissioner members. Even those nominated by Scout Counties to the council require previous appointment to their positions or approval by the council&#x27;s board or officers appointed by the board.

The council elects a board (called the board of trustees and formerly called the committee of the council), which manages the organisation, determines its &quot;Policy, Organisation and Rules&quot; (POR), nominates members of the council and makes all appointments within the organisation.

===Patron, officers and paid staff===
The King is patron of the organisation. Its joint presidents are The Duke of Kent and The Princess of Wales.

The council elects the organisation&#x27;s Chief Scout. In September 2024, Bear Grylls, announced his resignation from the role. The organisation&#x27;s Chief Commissioner, currently Carl Hankinson, acts as its Deputy Chief Scout and appoints a team of commissioners who are responsible for programmes in their respective fields.

The board employ paid staff to implement their directions and policies. The chief executive, currently Aidan Jones (from October 2024), manages the work of the headquarters staff.

In 2014, the organisation created the roles of Youth Commissioner and Deputy Youth Commissioner to work with the national leadership team to advocate on behalf of youth participants.

In September 2024, it was announced that Dwayne Fields would succeed Grylls as Chief Scout.

===Geographic divisions===
The organisation is divided into national groupings for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. While the organisation in England is managed directly by the UK Headquarters, each of the other nations has its own organisation council and administration. Each of national divisions is further broken up into local Counties for England and Northern Ireland, Areas for Wales, Regions for Scotland and a Balliwick in the case of Guernsey, which in many cases follow the boundaries of ceremonial counties. The County, Area or Region is usually broken down further into a number of Scout Districts, which cover a town, some or all of a city, such as &quot;Bradford South&quot;, or a section of a larger region such as the New Forest. These districts are made up of several Scout Groups. Each County and District is a separate charity with its own trustee board, operating within a federation of charities under the auspices of The Scout Association&#x27;s Royal Charter.

===Scout Groups===
Scout Groups are local scout organisations registered with the organisation, and each Group is also a separate charity with a trustee board, operating within a federation of charities under the auspices of the Royal Charter. Some Groups are direct descendants of the original Scout Patrols and Scout Troops. Groups can consist of one or more Squirrel Dreys, Beaver Colonies, Cub Packs, and Scout Troops and may also have one or more Scout Active Support Units, or an Explorer Scout Unit attached to it. Scout Groups only manage the first three sections, with Explorer Scouts and Scout Networks managed by the Scout District.

Scout Groups are led by volunteers, with a volunteer Group Scout Leader, whose main role is handling communication between the local District and the Section Leaders. They also help to make sure that the Scout Group meets the minimum standard required by the organisation.

===Commissioners and committees===

At all levels, the organisation is managed by committees, referred to as trustee boards and previously as executive committees. The roles of committees are distinct from the roles of volunteers such as group and section leaders. Scout group committees include the group leader and section leaders.

All Scout adult volunteers, such as section leaders, are unpaid, There are around 120,000 adult volunteers. In addition to this number, the organisation employs 198 full-time and part-time staff to support the work of its adult volunteers. Senior volunteers in the organisation are called &#x27;Commissioners&#x27;. Every County/Area/Region and District is headed by a Commissioner who is responsible for ensuring the Districts/Groups under their jurisdiction meet the standards set by the organisation. They receive support from Growth and Development Officers in England, who are employed by the Regional Services Team and deployed locally to help support the organisation&#x27;s objectives. Commissioners in the other nations receive support from Field Commissioners, employed and directed differently. District Commissioners report to the County/Area/Regional Commissioner, who in turn report to the UK Chief Commissioner.

==Sections==
===Core sections===
The organisation has six age programmes to cater for youth aged between 4 and 25 years of age:
The core five sections (Squirrels to Explorers) are each led by a section leader and aided by assistant leaders, sectional assistants, parent helpers and young leaders, who are Explorer Scouts trained in leadership techniques. Scout Networks are mainly participant-led but are assisted by a Network Commissioner who ensures that the Network is working within the movement&#x27;s &quot;Policy, Organisation and Rules&quot;. In addition to adult leadership, the organisation encourages its participants themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior Patrol Leader, usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, and Explorers are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.

===Air and Sea Scouts===
Some Scout Groups offer special Scouting programmes called Air Scouts and Sea Scouts. Both programmes follow the same core programme in all sections but can add more aeronautical or nautical emphasis, with some Scout Troops or Explorer Scout Units choosing to seek to be recognised by the Royal Air Force or Royal Navy. In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% (101 Groups) are Royal Navy recognised, whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF. The number of Troops or Units that can be recognised in either scheme is strictly limited and recognition is only awarded to those which meet the requirements and pass an inspection by a service officer. Recognised Troops or Units are inspected biennially and only retain their recognised status if they have continued to meet the required standards.

===Adult roles and appointments===
The organisation&#x27;s Patron was the late Queen Elizabeth II. The organisation&#x27;s current joint presidents are the Duke of Kent and Princess of Wales.

Supporting these are the officials of the organisation&#x27;s headquarters, including the organisation&#x27;s Chief Scout, who is honorary head of the organisation and its public face, and its chief commissioner, who is in charge of the volunteers in the organisation and of the other commissioners. There are commissioners for the nations, regions, counties, areas and districts, all of whom are assisted by deputies and assistant commissioners who can oversee and advise on a particular area of responsibility – for example an assistant district commissioner for Beavers particularly ensures that that section in the district is abiding to the organisation&#x27;s rules. The final managerial role in the organisation is that of the Group Scout Leader and their deputy, who are both in charge of a local Scout group. All of these roles are uniformed and for those volunteer roles from County level downwards training is required in the basic values of the organisation, safety and child protection (safeguarding), inclusion and advanced managerial skills to achieve their Wood Badge.

At the local sectional level, a section is run by one or more lead volunteer(s), who are in overall charge of the section, and by assistant leaders, who assist the lead volunteer in their role. These roles are uniformed and also require training to achieve their Wood Badge, although their training content consists of the basic values of the organisation, inclusion, camping and Scout skills and administration. They are also required to complete First Aid, safety and child protection training every three years.

Supporting leaders are the uniformed role of Sectional Assistant and the non-uniformed role of Occasional Helper. The Sectional Assistant has to complete basic training consisting of the values of the organisation, safety and child protection only while an occasional helper is a non-uniformed role and requires only to have a criminal records check by the Disclosure and Barring Service. In addition, there are Young Leaders who must complete training in child protection and safety and then have the option to complete further modules on topics that mirror the adult training programme.

Adults can also join Scout Active Support Units that provide a variety of services to the organisation at group, district, county/area or national level. These units allow adults to support organisation&#x27;s activities without having the full-time commitment of a leadership role.

==Safety and safeguarding==
Safeguarding guidance is issued in the form of a &quot;yellow card&quot;, which all adults within the movement must follow. The yellow card was revised in January 2024 with a requirement that any safeguarding concern must now be reported directly to the organisation&#x27;s head office. Other coloured cards cover safety (the purple card), young leaders (the orange card) and the use of alcohol (the green card). For safety reasons the association has specifically ruled that certain activities are not permitted at any scouting event: banana boating, bungee jumping, hitch hiking, knife throwing, archery tag and trotti biking.

==Programme, badges and awards==

===Programme history===
The youth programme has been developed and expanded from Baden-Powell&#x27;s original Scout training scheme, which aimed to encourage personal achievement and provide a framework for the activities of the Scout Troop. In the Boy Scout section, this consisted of the award of badges for Tenderfoot, Second and First Class Scout and finally King&#x27;s Scout, which were earned by passing tests in a wide variety of skills associated with the outdoors, health and good citizenship. With the creation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, a similar system was devised, the awards being Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star, and an award called the Leaping Wolf was added later which required Cubs to move up to the Scout Troop. In parallel with this scheme, Cubs and Scouts were able to earn Proficiency Badges for specific skills and hobbies, an idea that Baden-Powell probably copied from Ernest Thompson Seton. The test requirements for Baden-Powell&#x27;s scheme were revised in 1944 and again in 1958 without altering the basic structure.

The 1966 Advance Party Report recommended a wholly new Progressive Training Scheme; for Cubs the Bronze, Silver and Gold Arrows, for Scouts the Scout Standard, Advanced Scout Standard and Chief Scout&#x27;s Award and for the new Venture Scout Section, the Venture Award and the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award which focused on long-term service and commitment as well as the completion of an expedition lasting four days and fifty miles. These changes were implemented in October 1967. From then on, the programme has been subject to regular revision; the Scout standards were replaced in 1984 by the Scout Award, Pathfinder Award and Explorer Award with a fully revised Chief Scout&#x27;s Award. The Cub arrows were replaced in 1991 with the Cub Award, Adventure Award and Adventure Crest Award. All these awards were replaced following the introduction of the Programme Review in February 2002. A new concept called the Balanced Programme replaced the previous scheme. Challenge Awards could be earned by participating in activities in various Programme Zones such as outdoors, fitness, community or international. Earning a certain number of Challenge Awards and the completion of a personal challenge led to the Bronze Chief Scout&#x27;s Award for Beavers, Silver for Cubs and Gold for Scouts. Proficiency Badges were revised and renamed Activity Badges. In 2015, the programme was revised again following consultation within the organisation, the changes being called the Programme Refresh.

===Award scheme===
The previous Programme Zones have been replaced by three themes, being &quot;outdoor and adventure&quot;, &quot;world&quot; and &quot;skills&quot;. It is recommended for all sections that about 50% of the programme be devoted to outdoor and adventure skills and activities. The structure of Challenge Badges and Chief Scout&#x27;s Awards has been retained but the content has been revised and made &quot;more challenging&quot;. Beavers have to earn six Challenge Badges to Gain the Bronze Chief Scout&#x27;s Award, Cubs seven for the Silver and Scouts nine for the Gold. The final three awards, The Chief Scout&#x27;s Platinum and Diamond Awards and The King&#x27;s Scout Award are available in the Explorer Scout and Scout Network sections. These three awards build on the requirements of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award at Bronze, Silver and Gold level respectively, consisting of a period of time volunteering in the local community, a prolonged physical activity, the advancement of a skill and the undertaking an expedition, allowing a participant to achieve both the DofE and the Scout award at the same time. In addition, these three awards do not have to be completed in order, and participants can skip straight to a specific award, although additional work is involved. Achieving The King&#x27;s Scout Award is seen as a significant event on a national scale; recipients of the award are invited to join the St George&#x27;s Day service at Windsor Castle the year after completing the scheme, and parade before The King or his representative, usually a member of the Royal Family.

===Awards for gallantry, meritorious conduct and good service===
The Cornwell Scout Badge may be awarded to youths who display &quot;pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance&quot;. Anyone registered with the organisation may be awarded the Gilt Cross or the Silver Cross for gallantry, or the Bronze Cross for &quot;special heroism or action in the face of extraordinary risk&quot;. The Chief Scout&#x27;s Commendation for Meritorious Conduct and the Medal of Meritorious Conduct may also be awarded to any registered participant. Adult leaders and supporters are awarded the Chief Scout&#x27;s Length of Service Award which marks the number of years of service in any role. More distinguished good service by an adult may be marked by the award of a Commendation Award (formerly known as a Commissioner&#x27;s Commendation Award), the Chief Scout&#x27;s Commendation for Good Service, the Award for Merit, the Silver Acorn or ultimately, the Silver Wolf, which is the unrestricted gift of the Chief Scout and is awarded for service of &quot;a most exceptional nature&quot;.

==Promise and law==
Variation of a Scout Promise are made by all participants of the organisation from the Scout section upwards, including leaders with variations for different faiths or for participants from other countries, whose allegiance is pledged to the country and not the monarch:

&lt;poem&gt;:On my honour, I promise that I will do my best,
:To do my duty to God and to The King,
:To help other people,
:And to keep the Scout Law.&lt;/poem&gt;

For Squirrels, Beavers and Cubs, a simpler promise is used: Cubs utilise the normal promise with the omission of the opening &#x27;On my honour&#x27; and a change in the final line &quot;to keep the Cub Law&quot;, while Beavers and Squirrels use a different promise altogether:

&lt;poem&gt;:I promise to do my best,
:To be kind and helpful,
:And to love God.&lt;/poem&gt;

In addition to the promise, there is a Scout Law which dictates what qualities a Scout should hold. The Scout Law is as follows:

:#A Scout is to be trusted.
:#A Scout is loyal.
:#A Scout is friendly and considerate.
:#A Scout belongs to the world-wide family of Scouts.
:#A Scout has courage in all difficulties.
:#A Scout makes good use of time and is careful of possessions and property.
:#A Scout has self-respect and respect for others.

This law is used for all sections except Cubs, Beavers and Squirrels. Beavers and Squirrels have no law. The Cub law is different again:

&lt;poem&gt;:Cubs always do their best,
:think of others before themselves
:and do a good turn every day.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Scout motto, used by the organisation as with many other Scouting organisations, is &#x27;Be Prepared&#x27;.

===Variations of the promise===
There are permitted variations to the original Scout Promise to accommodate those whose faith or national allegiance are different. The organisation expects that the phrases &quot;...duty to God&quot; and &quot;...to love God&quot; will be suitable for most faiths &quot;including Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims and Sikhs&quot;. Muslims who have difficulty with the phrase &quot;On my honour&quot; because of the Islamic proscription of swearing oaths, are able to say &quot;In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful...&quot; instead if they prefer. Also, &quot;...duty to Allah and to The King&quot; may be used. Hindus and Buddhists may promise &quot;...duty to my Dharma&quot;.

Foreign nationals resident in the United Kingdom are able to promise to do their &quot;...duty to God and to the country in which I am now living&quot;, although British subjects must include The King in their promise.

In 2012 the organisation reviewed its fundamentals and launched a consultation to ask its participants whether an alternative version of the Scout Promise should be developed for atheists and those unable to make the existing commitment. In 2013 it was announced that the consultation had led to the addition of an alternative promise for humanists and atheists. Taking effect on 1 January 2014, participants can choose to replace &quot;duty to God&quot; with &quot;to uphold our Scout values&quot;. The change has been welcomed by representatives of the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, the Free Churches Group and the British Humanist Association. The alternative promise takes the following form:

&lt;poem&gt;:On my honour, I promise that I will do my best,
:To uphold our Scout values, to do my duty to The King,
:To help other people,
:And to keep the Scout Law.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Uniform==
===History of uniform===
In &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Baden-Powell recommended a distinctive and practical uniform that was &quot;very like the uniform worn by my men when I commanded the South African Constabulary&quot;. This in turn, seems to have been derived from the dress adopted by Baden-Powell in the Second Matabele War of 1896, influenced by his friend and colleague, Frederick Russell Burnham. The original Boy Scout uniform consisted of a khaki shirt and shorts, a neckerchief or &quot;scarf&quot;, campaign hat and a Scout staff. At the formation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, Baden-Powell wanted to make the younger boys totally distinct from the older Boy Scouts; the result was a green woollen jersey, shorts, neckerchief and a green cricket cap with gold piping. In 1946, the new Senior Scout section were allowed to wear a maroon beret instead of the hat; a green beret became an option for the Boy Scout section in 1954.

In 1966, the Advance Party Report recommended a total redesign and modernisation of the uniform, commenting that there had been much criticism of &quot;the Boer War appearance of our uniforms&quot; and that the &quot;wearing of shorts by members of the Movement is one of the most damaging aspects of our present public image&quot;. Although the Cub uniform barely changed, retaining short trousers, the Scout section were to wear a long sleeved dark green shirt and long trousers in a brownish colour described as &quot;mushroom&quot;. Venture Scouts and male Scouters had identical khaki shirts and mushroom trousers, but the neckerchief was replaced by a tie, brown for Venture Scouts and green for Scouters. Female Scouters had a dark green dress and a cap similar to those worn by airline flight attendants at the time. These recommendations were accepted and implemented from October 1967.

Later amendments included khaki shirts for female Venture Scouts and Scouters, the abolition of all uniform headgear except Sea Scout caps and Air Scout berets, and black long trousers for Cubs as an option to shorts. A grey sweatshirt was introduced for the new Beavers section in 1986 and a dark green sweatshirt replaced the Cubs&#x27; knitted jersey. The uniforms of this era would feature on the organisation&#x27;s Coat of Arms, which features two bearers wearing uniforms of the pre-Advance Party Report and some that were current at the time of the award in 1969. Certificates with the design would remain in use until May 2021.

In 2001, following a consultation process within the organisation, a new range of uniforms designed by Meg Andrews was launched on Founder&#x27;s Day, 22 February.

This can be either their own tartan or the Scout tartan pattern; to be worn with a plain leather sporran, green knee-length socks and gartar tabs and black shoes. Participants in Northern Ireland or those entitled to do so by descent may wear a saffron kilt or skirt. This should be worn with a plain leather sporran; traditional coloured plain socks; black or brown shoes (all participants in a section should wear the same coloured socks and shoes). A tailored outer jacket may be worn with either kilt.

==Finances==
The organisation is a registered charity. The organisation&#x27;s finances are collected through a variety of ways. Participants pay for the organisation&#x27;s programmes through an annual capitation or registration fee, and subscriptions to the local group, paid termly, monthly or weekly depending on local preference. The registration fee pays for participant insurance and for the services and leader support provided by their district, country (or equivalent) and headquarters. The national registration fee for 2021–22, for all participants under 18, is £36.50 (or £36.00 for prompt payment by 23 April 2021), an increase of £7.50 compared to the 2020–21 fee. Of this, £1.50 is a reserved contribution ring-fenced to support any Groups who cannot access funding. Subs are used to pay for the day-to-day running of activities, pay for materials and to finance the section&#x27;s meeting place.

To lessen the burden on participants, many Groups undertake local fundraising and utilise additional methods of funding, such as Gift Aid. In addition, headquarters operates several other ventures open to those outside of the organisation, the profits of which are returned to the organisation.

===Scout Community Week===
Scout Community Week is a campaign of the organisation and its biggest national fundraising event. It is a revival and updated version of the earlier &quot;Bob-a-Job&quot; Week (started in 1949) and later &quot;Scout Job Week&quot; in which Scouts were paid small sums of money for completing usually domestic tasks for local residents. The modern Scout Community Week involves Scouts from all sections of the organisation taking part in community work in exchange for a donation to the group. Re-introduced in 2012, the event has attracted media attention.

===Commercial ventures===
The organisation operates several ventures that offer an enhancement to its programmes but also services consumers outside its programmes. The profits are returned to the organisation to subsidise the running of the Scout programme and to reduce the burden of financing on the participants themselves.

The Scout Adventures brand is run directly from within the organisation and is responsible for running a network of national activity centres open to the organisation&#x27;s participants and other organisations including schools and other youth groups. Its turnover and profits form part of the charitable activities of the organisation and contributed £4.9 million in the year up to 31 March 2020.

In addition, the organisation owns 100% of the following subsidiary companies which provide trading income to the organisation:
* Scout Shops Ltd trading as Scout Store sells the organisation&#x27;s uniforms, equipment and gifts online and on the high street by supplying local Scout shops run mostly by Scout Districts. In the year up to 31 March 2020, it had a turnover of £9.4 million with their taxable profits of £3 million returned to the organisation.
* World Scout Shop Ltd sells similar merchandise and gifts to the Scout Store but to a global market along with exclusive WOSM items. It was created in 2011 at the 22nd World Scout Jamboree in Sweden and uses the same infrastructure as the Scout Store. In the year up to 31 March 2020, it had a turnover of £500,000 with their taxable profits of £30,000 returned to the organisation.
* Scout Insurance Services Ltd trading as Unity Insurance Services is an insurance broker providing insurance solutions tailored to the movement and other charities and similar non-profit organisations including Girlguiding. In the year up to 31 March 2020, it had a turnover of £2.4 million and a pre-tax profit of £1.2 million.
* Scout Insurance (Guernsey) Ltd. acts as the insurance underwriters for the organisation and Unity and paid its net profit pre-tax of £200,000 as a dividend to the organisation.
* Scout Services Ltd. manages the organisation&#x27;s property, runs the conference centres located at Gilwell Park and 65 Queen&#x27;s Gate, and manages sponsorship and marketing for the organisation such as selling advertising space in the &quot;Scouting Magazine&quot;. In the year up to 31 March 2020, it had a turnover of £3.8 million and a pre-tax profit of £700,000. This subsidiary has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic as the organisation announced the cessation of the printed &quot;Scouting Magazine&quot;, the closure of the Gilwell Park conference centre and the selling of the 65 Queen&#x27;s Gate site.

Former commercial ventures include the Scout Holiday Homes Trust which operated ten properties across the UK catering for those with low incomes or disabilities between 1969 and 2011 when the assets were transferred to the independent Holiday Homes Trust which maintains some links with the Scouts.

==Campsites==

Across the country, over 900 campsites are owned by the organisation; usually they are owned and operated by a Scout District or County. These campsites are also used by others outside the organisation to gain additional income for the Scout county or district.

Twelve sites are branded and operated as Scout Adventure Centres, providing camping sites and affordable adventurous activities. These are Gilwell Park on the London/Essex border, Buddens in Dorset, Crawfordsburn in County Down, Downe in Kent, Fordell Firs in Fife, Great Tower in the Lake District, Hawkhirst in Northumberland, Lochgoilhead on Loch Lomond, Meggernie in Perthshire, Woodhouse Park in Gloucestershire, Youlbury in Oxfordshire and Yr Hafod in Snowdonia.

In addition to these sites, the organisation historically ran two conference centres, one within Gilwell Park, and another at a separate site in central London, Baden-Powell House. Baden-Powell House was an Association hostel which provided low-cost accommodation for central London trips. Both these facilities were closed in 2020 due to the financial pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Relations with other organisations==
===Girlguiding UK===
The Scout Association and Girlguiding UK are separate organisations but were both founded by Robert Baden-Powell and share similar aims and methods. Co-operation between the organisation and GirlGuiding UK is encouraged at all levels. &#x27;Joint Groups&#x27; of Scout and Guide units meeting separately in the same headquarters and operating under the same support structure are recognized and encouraged by both organisations. It is also possible to have a &#x27;Joint Unit&#x27;, which may consist of Rainbow Guides and Beavers, or Brownie Guides and Cubs, or Guides and Scouts. They meet together as a single unit, sharing leadership and facilities but individual participants wear the uniform and follow the training programme of the organisation that they belong to. Members of Girlguiding UK are invited to join the United Kingdom Scout Contingent to participate in the World Scout Jamborees every four years.

===The Scout Association in Ireland===

The Scout Association of Northern Ireland co-exists in the province with Scouting Ireland which is the World Organization of the Scout Movement recognized organisation for the Republic of Ireland. The two organisations have been increasingly working in partnership; they jointly run a project called &quot;Scoutlink&quot; which delivers citizenship and peace building programmes with a range of groups in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic.

===The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award===
The Scout Association is one of more than 2,600 &quot;Licensed Organisations&quot; that operate the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Scout participation in the scheme started in February 1959, having been unable to join the 1956 experimental launch due to the 1957 Golden Jubilee of Scouting events and the 1958 revision of the Scout badge programme.

==Notable former Scouts==

==Scout Association overseas==
===History===
Following the origin of Scouting, Scout organisations formed in many parts of the British Empire. Some of these organisations later became branches of The Boy Scouts Association after its formation. In other cases, The Boy Scouts Association started branches itself in parts of British Empire. The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s &quot;Headquarters&quot; in London was renamed &quot;Imperial Headquarters&quot; (IHQ). The Boy Scouts International Bureau was formed in 1920 and became fully functional under the International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement in 1922. Subsequently, The Boy Scouts Association branches in the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa were given the option of being &quot;separately represented&quot; with the Boy Scouts International Bureau, but chose instead to remain under IHQ control. Over time, many of the branches of The Scout Association became direct members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement; for instance, Scouts Canada in 1946 and The Scout Association of Hong Kong in 1977.

===Overseas branches===
The organisation has branches in the British overseas territories and Crown Dependencies, as well as some small independent nations.
Non-sovereign territories in which the organisation operates programmes include:

* Anguilla
* Bermuda
* Cayman Islands
* Falkland Islands (Groups are part of the British Scouting Overseas Area)
* Gibraltar

* Montserrat
* Saint Helena (Groups are part of the British Scouting Overseas Area)
* British Virgin Islands
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Isle of Man
Sovereign countries in which the organisation operates programmes, as they are without independent Scouting organisations, include:
* Saint Kitts and Nevis
* Tonga
* Tuvalu
* Vanuatu

=== British Scouting Overseas ===
The UK Scout programme is also offered to British citizens living outside of the United Kingdom via the British Scouting Overseas (BSO) Area. BSO has 4 Scout &quot;Districts&quot; in Southern Europe, Middle East, Northern Europe and Rest of the World, and a total of 55 Scout Groups, in 26 countries.

British Scouting Overseas was formed, on 1 April 2012, from an amalgamation of the British Groups Abroad and British Scouts in Western Europe Scout &quot;Areas&quot;. At that point, there were 5 districts in France &amp; Iberia, Middle East, Benelux &amp; Scandinavia, Germany and Rest of the World. Since that point, Benelux &amp; Scandinavia has merged with Germany, to create the Northern Europe district. In June 2021, France &amp; Iberia District transitioned into Southern Europe after the addition of a group in Italy.

<text>Das Lied von der Erde (The song of the Earth) is an orchestral work for two voices and orchestra written by Gustav Mahler between 1908 and 1909. Described as a symphony when published, it comprises six movements for a large orchestra and two singers as the soloist alternating in the movements. Mahler specified that the two singers should be a tenor and an alto, or else a tenor and a baritone if an alto is not available.

Mahler composed this work following the most painful period in his life, and the songs address themes such as those of living, parting and salvation. On the centenary of Mahler&#x27;s birth, the composer and prominent Mahler conductor Leonard Bernstein described &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; as Mahler&#x27;s &quot;greatest symphony&quot;. As with his later Symphony No. 9, Mahler did not live to hear &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; performed.

== History ==
===Composition===
Three disasters befell Mahler during the summer of 1907. Political maneuvering and antisemitism forced him to resign as Director of the Vienna Court Opera, his eldest daughter Maria died from scarlet fever and diphtheria, and Mahler himself was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. &quot;With one stroke&quot;, he wrote to his friend Bruno Walter, &quot;I have lost everything I have gained in terms of who I thought I was, and have to learn my first steps again like a newborn.&quot;

The same year saw the publication of Hans Bethge&#x27;s &quot;Die chinesische Flöte&quot;, a free rewriting of others&#x27; translations of classical Chinese poems. Mahler was captivated by the vision of earthly beauty and transience expressed in these verses and chose seven of the poems to set to music as &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. Mahler completed the work in 1909.

Mahler was aware of the so-called &quot;curse of the ninth&quot;, a superstition arising from the fact that no major composer since Beethoven had successfully completed more than nine symphonies: he had already written eight symphonies before composing &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. Fearing his subsequent demise, he decided to subtitle the work &quot;A Symphony for Tenor, Alto (or Baritone) Voice and Orchestra&quot;, rather than numbering it as a symphony. His next symphony, written for purely instrumental forces, was numbered his Ninth. That was indeed the last symphony he fully completed, because only portions of the Tenth had been fully orchestrated at the time of his death.

=== Reception ===
The first public performance was given on 20 November 1911 in the Tonhalle in Munich, sung by Sara Cahier and William Miller (both Americans) with Bruno Walter conducting. Mahler had died six months earlier, on 18 May. One of the earliest performances in London (possibly the first) occurred in January 1913 at the Queen&#x27;s Hall under conductor Henry Wood, where it was sung by Gervase Elwes and Doris Woodall. Wood reportedly thought that the work was &quot;excessively modern but very beautiful&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
Mahler had already included movements for voice and orchestra in his Second, Third, Fourth and Eighth Symphonies. However, &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; is the first complete integration of song cycle form with that of the symphony. The form was afterwards imitated by other composers, notably by Shostakovich and Zemlinsky. This new form has been termed a &quot;song-symphony&quot;, a hybrid of the two forms that had occupied most of Mahler&#x27;s creative life.

&quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; is scored for a large orchestra, consisting of the following:
;Woodwinds
:piccolo
:3 flutes
:4 clarinets (3 B, E and bass clarinet)

;Brass
:4 horns
:3 trumpets
:3 trombones

;Percussion
:bass drum
:cymbals
:triangle
:
:glockenspiel

;Keyboards

;Voices
:alto solo
:tenor solo

;Strings
:mandolin
:2 harps

:1st violins
:2nd violins
:violas
:cellos

Only in the first, fourth and sixth songs does the full orchestra play together. The celesta is only heard at the end of the finale, and only the first movement requires all three trumpets, with two playing in the fourth movement, one playing in the third and fifth, and none playing in the second and sixth. In many places the texture resembles chamber music, with only a few instruments being used at one time. The score calls for tenor and alto soloists. However, at the alto&#x27;s entry in the second movement, Mahler includes the note that &quot;if necessary, the alto part may be sung by a baritone&quot;. It remains doubtful whether Mahler&#x27;s comment regarding the second movement can be applied without hesitation to the fourth and sixth movements. Mahler also arranged the work for piano accompaniment. Another uncertainty concerns the third Lied; in the short score and the piano version Mahler considered an alternative setting with soprano instead of tenor.

== Movements ==

=== 1. &quot;Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde&quot; ===
The first movement, &quot;The Drinking Song of Earth&#x27;s Misery&quot; (in A minor), continually returns to the refrain, &quot;Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod&quot; (literally, &quot;Dark is life, is death&quot;), which is pitched a semitone higher on each successive appearance.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \set melismaBusyProperties = #&#x27;() \clef treble \key a \minor \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;flute&quot; g&#x27;2.( | d | bes | g | ees&#x27; | d) | bes | a | g } \addlyrics { Dun -- kel ist das Le -- ben, ist der Tod. } \midi{\tempo 4 = 180}&lt;/score&gt;
Like many drinking poems by Li Bai, the original poem &quot;Bei Ge Xing&quot; (The Song of Sorrow) () mixes drunken exaltation with a deep sadness. The singer&#x27;s part is notoriously demanding, since the tenor has to struggle at the top of his range against the power of the full orchestra. This gives the voice its shrill, piercing quality, and is consistent with Mahler&#x27;s practice of pushing instruments, including vocal cords, to their limits. According to musicologist Theodor W. Adorno, the tenor should here create the impression of a &quot;denatured voice in the Chinese (falsetto) style&quot;.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key a \minor \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; \partial 8*1 e8\ff | a2. | e4. d8 e a | e2. } \midi{\tempo 4 = 180}&lt;/score&gt;
The movement begins with a three-note horn call which recurs throughout the song, most notably at the climax in which the singer describes an ape calling &quot;into the sweet fragrance of life.&quot; The climax also marks the first of the three whole-tone passages that occur in the symphony.

=== 2. &quot;Der Einsame im Herbst&quot; ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.instrumentName = #&quot;Ob.&quot; \clef treble \key d \minor \time 3/2 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;oboe&quot; R1. | R1. | d&#x27;2( c1) | a4. d8 c2( a) | d4. a8 d2( a) | f4( bes) a1 } \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.instrumentName = #&quot;1.Vn&quot; \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \clef treble \key d \minor \time 3/2 d8(\pp e f g f g f e d e f g) | f( e d e f g a bes a g f g) | a( bes a g f e f g a g f e) | d( e f g a bes a g f e f g) | a( bes a g f g a g f e d e) | d( e f g f g f e d e f g) } » } \midi{\tempo 4 = 100}&lt;/score&gt;
&quot;The lonely one in Autumn&quot; (for alto, in D minor) is a much softer, less turbulent movement. Marked &quot;somewhat dragging and exhausted&quot;, it begins with a repetitive shuffling in the strings, followed by solo wind instruments. The lyrics, which are based on the first part of a Tang dynasty era poem by Qian Qi, lament the dying of flowers and the passing of beauty, as well as expressing an exhausted longing for sleep. The orchestration in this movement is sparse and chamber music-like, with long and independent contrapuntal lines.

=== 3. &quot;Von der Jugend&quot; ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key bes \major \time 2/2 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;flute&quot; f8(\p g bes c d f d c | bes g f g d4) } \midi{\tempo 4 = 190}&lt;/score&gt;

The third movement, &quot;Of Youth&quot; (for tenor, in B major), is the most obviously pentatonic and faux-Asian. The form is ternary, the third part being a greatly abbreviated revision of the first. It is also the shortest of the six movements, and can be considered a first scherzo.

=== 4. &quot;Von der Schönheit&quot; ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 2/4 \key g \major \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;flute&quot; \autoBeamOff r4 bes8 a | \time 3/4 d,4 g fis8 e | \time 4/4 g4 d } \addlyrics { Jun- ge Mäd- chen pflü- cken Blu- men, } \midi{\tempo 4 = 70}&lt;/score&gt;
The music of this movement, &quot;Of Beauty&quot; (for alto, in G major), is mostly soft and legato, meditating on the image of some &quot;young girls picking lotus flowers at the riverbank.&quot; Later in the movement there is a louder, more articulated section in the brass as the young men ride by on their horses. There is a long orchestral postlude to the sung passage, as the most beautiful of the young maidens looks longingly after the most handsome of the young men. The original text used in this movement derives from another poem by the Tang dynasty poet Li Bai, known as the &quot;Lotus-collecting Song&quot; (Chinese: 采莲曲) 

=== 5. &quot;Der Trunkene im Frühling&quot; ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \key a \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \clef treble \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; e\f \times 2/3 { d8\p-. b-. d-. } e4\f \times 2/3 { d8\p-. b-. d-. } | e4\fp fis16-. d-. b-. d-. e4\fp fis16-. d-. b-. d-. } \midi{\tempo 4 = 110}&lt;/score&gt;
The second scherzo of the work is provided by the fifth movement, &quot;The drunken man in Spring&quot; (for tenor, in A major). Like the first, it opens with a horn theme. In this movement Mahler uses an extensive variety of key signatures, which can change as often as every few measures. The middle section features a solo violin and solo flute, which represent the bird the singer describes.

=== 6. &quot;Der Abschied&quot; ===
The final movement, &quot;The Farewell&quot; (for alto, from C minor to C major), is nearly as long as the previous five movements combined. Its text is drawn from two different poems, both involving the theme of leave-taking. Mahler himself added the last lines. This final song is also notable for its text-painting, using a mandolin to represent the singer&#x27;s lute, imitating bird calls with woodwinds, and repeatedly switching between the major and minor modes to articulate sharp contrasts in the text.

The movement is divided into three major sections. In the first, the singer describes the nature around her as night falls. In the second, she is waiting for her friend to say a final farewell. A long orchestral interlude precedes the third section, which depicts the exchange between the two friends and fades off into silence.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key c \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;flute&quot; r8 c&#x27;-. c32(-&gt; d\&gt; c b\! c8\p~ c4) } \midi{\tempo 4 = 60}&lt;/score&gt;

Lines 1–3, 17–19, and 26–28 are all sung to the same music, with a pedal point in the low strings and soft strokes of the tam-tam; in the first two of these sections, a countermelody in the flute imitates the song of a bird, but the third of these sections is just the bare pedal point and tam-tam. The singer repeats the final word of the song, &quot;ewig&quot; (&quot;forever&quot;), like a mantra, accompanied by sustained chords in the orchestra, which features mandolin, harps, and celesta. &quot;Ewig&quot; is repeated as the music fades into silence, the final sixth chord &quot;printed on the atmosphere&quot; as Benjamin Britten asserted.

It is also worth noting that throughout &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; there is a persistent message that &quot;The earth will stay beautiful forever, but man cannot live for even a hundred years.&quot; At the end of &quot;Der Abschied,&quot; however, Mahler adds three original lines which repeat this, but purposefully omit the part saying that &quot;man must die&quot;. Conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein asserts that this ties in with the Eastern idea of Nirvana, in that the &quot;soul&quot; of the singer, as she or he dies, becomes one with the everlasting earth.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \set melismaBusyProperties = #&#x27;() \clef treble \key c \major \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;flute&quot; e2.~\pp | e~ | e( | d) | R | R | R | R | R | R \bar &quot;|.&quot; } \addlyrics { e - - wig! } \new PianoStaff \relative c&#x27; { \new Staff { \clef treble \key c \major \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot; \set Staff.midiMaximumVolume = #0.5 s2. | &lt;d g,&gt;2.~ | &lt;d g,&gt;~ | &lt;d g,&gt;~ | &lt;d g,&gt;~ | &lt;a&#x27; e&gt;~ | &lt;a e g,&gt;~ | &lt;a e g,&gt;~ &lt;a e&gt;~ | &lt;a e&gt;4 r r \bar &quot;|.&quot; } } { \new Staff { \clef bass \key c \major \time 3/4 \set Staff.midiMaximumVolume = #0.5 s2. | e~ | e~ | e~ | e | &lt;e g, c,&gt;~ | &lt;e g, c,&gt;~ | &lt;e g, c,&gt;~ | &lt;e g, c,&gt;~ | &lt;e g, c,&gt;4 r r \bar &quot;|.&quot; } } » } \midi{\tempo 4 = 160}&lt;/score&gt;

The last movement is very difficult to conduct because of its cadenza-like writing for voice and solo instruments, which often flows over the barlines. Mahler specifically instructed the movement to be played &quot;Ohne Rücksicht auf das Tempo&quot; (Without regard for the tempo). Bruno Walter related that Mahler showed him the score of this movement and asked about one passage, &quot;Can you think of a way of conducting that? Because I can&#x27;t.&quot; Mahler also hesitated to put the piece before the public because of its relentless negativity, unusual even for him. &quot;Won&#x27;t people go home and shoot themselves?&quot; he asked.

== Text ==

Mahler&#x27;s source for the text was Hans Bethge&#x27;s &quot;Die chinesische Flöte&quot; (1907). Bethge&#x27;s poems were free adaptations (&quot;Nachdichtungen&quot;) of classical Chinese poetry based on prior prose translations into German ( &quot;Chinesische Lyrik&quot;, 1905) and French (Marquis d&#x27;Hervey de Saint Denys&#x27; &quot;Poésies de l&#x27;époque des Thang&quot;, 1862 and Judith Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Livre de Jade&quot;, 1867/1902).

Four of the songs—&quot;Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde&quot;, &quot;Von der Jugend&quot;, &quot;Von der Schönheit&quot; and &quot;Der Trunkene im Frühling&quot;—were derived from poems written by Li Bai, the wandering poet of the Tang dynasty. &quot;Der Einsame im Herbst&quot; is based on a poem &quot;After Long Autumn Night&quot; by Qian Qi, another poet of the Tang dynasty. &quot;Der Abschied&quot; combines poems by Tang dynasty poets Meng Haoran and Wang Wei, with several additional lines by Mahler himself. These attributions have been a matter of some uncertainty, and around the turn of the 21st century, Chinese scholars extensively debated the sources of the songs following a performance of the work in China in 1998.

According to the musicologist Theodor W. Adorno, Mahler found in Chinese poetry what he had formerly sought after in the genre of German folk song: a mask or costume for the sense of rootlessness or &quot;otherness&quot; attending his identity as a Jew. This theme, and its influence upon Mahler&#x27;s tonality, has been further explored by John Sheinbaum. It has also been asserted that Mahler found in these poems an echo of his own increasing awareness of mortality.

The Universal Edition score of 1912 for &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; shows Mahler&#x27;s adapted text as follows.

===1. &quot;Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde&quot; (&quot;The Drinking Song of Earth&#x27;s Sorrow&quot;)===
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Schon winkt der Wein im gold&#x27;nen Pokale,
Doch trinkt noch nicht, erst sing&#x27; ich euch ein Lied!
Das Lied vom Kummer
Soll auflachend in die Seele euch klingen.
Wenn der Kummer naht,
Liegen wüst die Gärten der Seele,
Welkt hin und stirbt die Freude, der Gesang.
Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod.

Herr dieses Hauses!
Dein Keller birgt die Fülle des goldenen Weins!
Hier, diese Laute nenn&#x27; ich mein!
Die Laute schlagen und die Gläser leeren,
Das sind die Dinge, die zusammen passen.
Ein voller Becher Weins zur rechten Zeit
Ist mehr wert, als alle Reiche dieser Erde!
Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod!

Das Firmament blaut ewig und die Erde
Wird lange fest steh&#x27;n und aufblüh&#x27;n im Lenz.
Du aber, Mensch, wie lang lebst denn du?
Nicht hundert Jahre darfst du dich ergötzen
An all dem morschen Tande dieser Erde!

Seht dort hinab! Im Mondschein auf den Gräbern
Hockt eine wild-gespenstische Gestalt –
Ein Aff&#x27; ist&#x27;s! Hört ihr, wie sein Heulen
Hinausgellt in den süßen Duft des Lebens!

Jetzt nehmt den Wein! Jetzt ist es Zeit, Genossen!
Leert eure gold&#x27;nen Becher zu Grund!
Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod!&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;The wine beckons in golden goblets
but drink not yet; first I&#x27;ll sing you a song.
The song of sorrow
shall ring laughingly in your soul.
When the sorrow comes,
blasted lie the gardens of the soul,
wither and perish joy and singing.
Dark is life, dark is death!

Master of this house,
your cellar is full of golden wine!
Here, this lute I call mine.
The lute to strike and the glasses to drain,
these things go well together.
A full goblet of wine at the right time
is worth more than all the kingdoms of this earth.
Dark is life, dark is death!

The heavens are ever blue and the Earth
shall stand sure, and blossom in the spring.
But you O man, what long life have you?
Not a hundred years may you delight
in all the rotten baubles of this earth.

See down there! In the moonlight, on the graves
squats a wild ghostly shape;
an ape it is! Hear you his howl go out
in the sweet fragrance of life.

Now! Drink the wine! Now it is time comrades.
Drain your golden goblets to the last.
Dark is life, dark is death!&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Herbstnebel wallen bläulich überm See;
Vom Reif bezogen stehen alle Gräser;
Man meint, ein Künstler habe Staub von Jade
Über die feinen Blüten ausgestreut.

Der süße Duft der Blumen ist verflogen;
Ein kalter Wind beugt ihre Stengel nieder.
Bald werden die verwelkten, gold&#x27;nen Blätter
Der Lotosblüten auf dem Wasser zieh&#x27;n.

Mein Herz ist müde. Meine kleine Lampe
Erlosch mit Knistern, es gemahnt mich an den Schlaf.
Ich komm&#x27; zu dir, traute Ruhestätte!
Ja, gib mir Ruh&#x27;, ich hab&#x27; Erquickung not!

Ich weine viel in meinen Einsamkeiten.
Der Herbst in meinem Herzen währt zu lange.
Sonne der Liebe willst du nie mehr scheinen,
Um meine bittern Tränen mild aufzutrocknen?&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Autumn fog creeps bluishly over the lake.
Every blade of grass stands frosted.
As though an artist had jade-dust
over the fine flowers strewn.

The sweet fragrance of flower has passed;
A cold wind bows their stems low.
Soon will the wilted, golden petals
of lotus flowers upon the water float.

My heart is tired. My little lamp
expired with a crackle, minding me to sleep.
I come to you, trusted resting place.
Yes, give me rest, I have need of refreshment!

I weep often in my loneliness.
Autumn in my heart lingers too long.
Sun of love, will you no longer shine
Gently to dry up my bitter tears?&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Mitten in dem kleinen Teiche
Steht ein Pavillon aus grünem
Und aus weißem Porzellan.

Wie der Rücken eines Tigers
Wölbt die Brücke sich aus Jade
Zu dem Pavillon hinüber.

In dem Häuschen sitzen Freunde,
Schön gekleidet, trinken, plaudern.
Manche schreiben Verse nieder.

Ihre seidnen Ärmel gleiten
Rückwärts, ihre seidnen Mützen
Hocken lustig tief im Nacken.

Auf des kleinen Teiches stiller
Wasserfläche zeigt sich alles
Wunderlich im Spiegelbilde.

Alles auf dem Kopfe stehend
In dem Pavillon aus grünem
Und aus weißem Porzellan;

Wie ein Halbmond steht die Brücke,
Umgekehrt der Bogen. Freunde,
Schön gekleidet, trinken, plaudern.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;In the middle of the little pond
stands a pavilion of green

Like the back of a tiger
arches the jade bridge
over to the pavilion.

Friends sit in the little house
well dressed, drinking, chatting.
some writing verses.

Their silk sleeves glide
backwards, their silk caps
rest gaily at the napes of their necks.

On the small pond&#x27;s still
surface, everything shows
whimsical in mirror image.

Everything stands on its head
in the pavilion of green
and white porcelain.

Like a half-moon is the bridge
its arch upturned. Friends
well dressed, drinking, chatting.&lt;/poem&gt;

===4. &quot;Von der Schönheit&quot; (&quot;Of Beauty&quot;)===
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Junge Mädchen pflücken Blumen,
Pflücken Lotosblumen an dem Uferrande.
Zwischen Büschen und Blättern sitzen sie,
Sammeln Blüten in den Schoß und rufen
Sich einander Neckereien zu.

Gold&#x27;ne Sonne webt um die Gestalten,
Spiegelt sie im blanken Wasser wider,
Sonne spiegelt ihre schlanken Glieder,
Ihre süßen Augen wider,
Und der Zephir hebt mit Schmeichelkosen
Das Gewebe Ihrer Ärmel auf,
Führt den Zauber
Ihrer Wohlgerüche durch die Luft.

O sieh, was tummeln sich für schöne Knaben
Dort an dem Uferrand auf mut&#x27;gen Rossen?
Weithin glänzend wie die Sonnenstrahlen;
Schon zwischen dem Geäst der grünen Weiden
Trabt das jungfrische Volk einher!

Das Roß des einen wiehert fröhlich auf
Und scheut und saust dahin,
Über Blumen, Gräser wanken hin die Hufe,
Sie zerstampfen jäh im Sturm die hingesunk&#x27;nen Blüten,
Hei! Wie flattern im Taumel seine Mähnen,
Dampfen heiß die Nüstern!

Gold&#x27;ne Sonne webt um die Gestalten,
Spiegelt sie im blanken Wasser wider.
Und die schönste von den Jungfrau&#x27;n sendet
Lange Blicke ihm der Sehnsucht nach.
Ihre stolze Haltung ist nur Verstellung.
In dem Funkeln ihrer großen Augen,
In dem Dunkel ihres heißen Blicks
Schwingt klagend noch die Erregung ihres Herzens nach.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Young girls picking flowers,
Picking lotus flowers at the riverbank.
Amid bushes and leaves they sit,
gathering flowers in their laps and calling
one another in raillery.

Golden sun plays about their form
reflecting them in the clear water.
The sun reflects back their slender limbs,
their sweet eyes,
and the breeze teasing up
the warp of their sleeves,
directs the magic
of perfume through the air.

O see, what a tumult of handsome boys
there on the shore on their spirited horses.
Yonder shining like the sun&#x27;s rays
between the branches of green willows
trot along the bold companions.

The horse of one neighs happily on
and shies and rushes there,
hooves shaking down blooms, grass,
trampling wildly the fallen flowers.
Hei! How frenzied his mane flutters,
and hotly steam his nostrils!

Golden sun plays about their form
reflecting them in the clear water.
And the most beautiful of the maidens sends
long looks adoring at him.
Her proud pose is but a pretense;
in the flash of her big eyes,
in the darkness of her ardent gaze
beats longingly her burning heart.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Wenn nur ein Traum das Leben ist,
Warum denn Müh&#x27; und Plag&#x27;!?
Ich trinke, bis ich nicht mehr kann,
Den ganzen, lieben Tag!

Und wenn ich nicht mehr trinken kann,
Weil Kehl&#x27; und Seele voll,
So tauml&#x27; ich bis zu meiner Tür
Und schlafe wundervoll!

Was hör&#x27; ich beim Erwachen? Horch!
Ein Vogel singt im Baum.
Ich frag&#x27; ihn, ob schon Frühling sei,
Mir ist als wie im Traum.

Der Vogel zwitschert: Ja!
Der Lenz ist da, sei kommen über Nacht!
Aus tiefstem Schauen lauscht&#x27; ich auf,
Der Vogel singt und lacht!

Ich fülle mir den Becher neu
Und leer&#x27; ihn bis zum Grund
Und singe, bis der Mond erglänzt
Am schwarzen Firmament!

Und wenn ich nicht mehr singen kann,
So schlaf&#x27; ich wieder ein.
Was geht mich denn der Frühling an!?
Laßt mich betrunken sein!&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;If life is but a dream,
why work and worry?
I drink until I no more can,
the whole, blessed day!

And if I can drink no more
as throat and soul are full,
then I stagger to my door
and sleep wonderfully!

What do I hear on waking? Hark!
A bird sings in the tree.
I ask him if it&#x27;s spring already;
to me it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m in a dream.

The bird chirps Yes!
The spring is here, it came overnight!
From deep wonderment I listen;
the bird sings and laughs!

I fill my cup anew
and drink it to the bottom
and sing until the moon shines
in the black firmament!

And if I can not sing,
then I fall asleep again.
What to me is spring?
Let me be drunk!&lt;/poem&gt;

===6. &quot;Der Abschied&quot; (&quot;The Farewell&quot;)===
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Die Sonne scheidet hinter dem Gebirge.
In alle Täler steigt der Abend nieder
Mit seinen Schatten, die voll Kühlung sind.
O sieh! Wie eine Silberbarke schwebt
Der Mond am blauen Himmelssee herauf.
Ich spüre eines feinen Windes Weh&#x27;n
Hinter den dunklen Fichten!

Der Bach singt voller Wohllaut durch das Dunkel.
Die Blumen blassen im Dämmerschein.
Die Erde atmet voll von Ruh&#x27; und Schlaf.
Alle Sehnsucht will nun träumen,
Die müden Menschen geh&#x27;n heimwärts,
Um im Schlaf vergess&#x27;nes Glück
Und Jugend neu zu lernen!
Die Vögel hocken still in ihren Zweigen.
Die Welt schläft ein!

Es wehet kühl im Schatten meiner Fichten.
Ich stehe hier und harre meines Freundes;
Ich harre sein zum letzten Lebewohl.
Ich sehne mich, o Freund, an deiner Seite
Die Schönheit dieses Abends zu genießen.
Wo bleibst du? Du läßt mich lang allein!
Ich wandle auf und nieder mit meiner Laute
Auf Wegen, die von weichem Grase schwellen.
O Schönheit! O ewigen Liebens – Lebens – trunk&#x27;ne Welt!

Er stieg vom Pferd und reichte ihm den Trunk
Des Abschieds dar.
Er fragte ihn, wohin er führe 
Und auch warum es müßte sein.
Er sprach, seine Stimme war umflort. Du, mein Freund,
Mir war auf dieser Welt das Glück nicht hold!
Wohin ich geh&#x27;? Ich geh&#x27;, ich wand&#x27;re in die Berge.
Ich suche Ruhe für mein einsam Herz.
Ich wandle nach der Heimat, meiner Stätte.
Ich werde niemals in die Ferne schweifen.
Still ist mein Herz und harret seiner Stunde!
Die liebe Erde allüberall
Blüht auf im Lenz und grünt aufs neu!
Allüberall und ewig blauen licht die Fernen!
Ewig... ewig...&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;The sun departs behind the mountains.
In all the valleys the evening descends
with its shadow, full cooling.
O look! Like a silver boat sails
the moon in the watery blue heaven.
I sense the fine breeze stirring
behind the dark pines.

The brook sings out clear through the darkness.
The flowers pale in the twilight.
The earth breathes, in full rest and sleep.
All longing now becomes a dream.
Weary men traipse homeward
to sleep; forgotten happiness
and youth to rediscover.
The birds roost silent in their branches.
The world falls asleep.

It blows coolly in the shadows of my pines.
I stand here and wait for my friend;
I wait to bid him a last farewell.
I yearn, my friend, at your side
to enjoy the beauty of this evening.
Where are you? You leave me long alone!
I walk up and down with my lute
on paths swelling with soft grass.
O beauty! O eternal loving-and-life-bedrunken world!

He dismounted and handed him the drink
of farewell.
He asked him where he would go
and why must it be.
He spoke, his voice was quiet. Ah my friend,
Fortune was not kind to me in this world!
Where do I go? I go, I wander in the mountains.
I seek peace for my lonely heart.
I wander homeward, to my abode!
I&#x27;ll never wander far.
Still is my heart, awaiting its hour.
The dear earth everywhere
blossoms in spring and grows green anew!
Everywhere and forever blue is the horizon!
Forever ... Forever ...
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Two male soloists ===
For the first few decades after the work&#x27;s premiere, the option to perform it with two male soloists was little used. On one occasion, Bruno Walter tried it out and engaged Friedrich Weidemann, the baritone who had premiered &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; under Mahler&#x27;s own baton in 1905. However, Walter felt that tenor and baritone did not work as well as tenor and alto, and he never repeated the experiment. Following the pioneering recordings of the work by baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau under conductors Paul Kletzki and Leonard Bernstein, the use of baritones in this work has increased.

=== Other versions ===

==== Schoenberg and Riehn arrangement ====
Arnold Schoenberg began to arrange &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; for chamber orchestra, reducing the orchestral forces to string and wind quintets, and calling for piano, celesta and harmonium to supplement the harmonic texture. Three percussionists are also employed. Schoenberg never finished this project, but the arrangement was completed by Rainer Riehn in 1980.

The world premiere of this version was given on 14 August 2004 by the Chamber Orchestra Anglia at the British Library, conducted by Sharon Andrea Choa, with soloists Robynne Redmon and Warren Mok. It was performed again by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra on 22 July 2005, with mezzo Ning Liang and tenor Warren Mok, under the direction of Lan Shui.
* In 2004, the Octavian Society commissioned Glen Cortese to create two reductions of the work, one for a chamber ensemble of twenty instruments and one for a small orchestra with woodwinds and brass in pairs. Both these reductions are published in critical editions by Universal in Vienna.
* In 2020, a new arrangement for two soloists and a 15-piece chamber ensemble by Reinbert de Leeuw was recorded by the Belgian group Het Collectief with Lucile Richardot and Yves Saelens (Alpha Classics Alpha 633)

<doc id="433379" wikidata="Q4832938" url="?curid=433379" title="Aztec Bowl (game)">
<text>The Aztec Bowl is an NCAA-sanctioned college division/minor (prior to 1997); AFCA Division III (since 1997) Division II/III (since 2011) post-season bowl game that has been played intermittently since 1947. From 1947 to 1949 the event was called the Silver Bowl, and in 1950 the name was changed to the Aztec Bowl.

With but one exception, all of the games have been played at locations in Mexico; the exception was the 1957 game played in San Antonio, Texas. From 1997 to 2008, under sponsorship of the American Football Coaches Association, the bowl had featured a team of Division III All-Stars against a team of Mexican All-Stars. 360 Sports Events Division II/III All American Eagles took over sponsoring players, along with ONEFA in 2010.

Games played in 1970 and 1980 are considered junior college bowl games, and games played in 1947, 1948, 1952, and 1996 are considered military bowl games. No games were played in 1954–1956, 1958–1963, 1967–1969, 1972–1978, 1981–1983, 1985, and 1995. The games are traditionally played in mid-December.

Under the new format there were no games in 2008 and 2010 because of lack of sponsors. In 2011, the Aztec Bowl All-Star Game resumed play in Chihuahua, Mexico. *There was no game in 2013 because of venue issues in Mexico.

The Aztec Bowl has always been an International Bowl Game, however in 1997 the Aztec Bowl was re-formed into a Bowl Game between Small College All-Stars from the United States and Mexico, billed as Team USA vs. Team Mexico. It has become prestigious for Team USA or Team Mexico to win the Aztec Bowl, because they are trying to win it for their country.

<doc id="433380" wikidata="Q584027" url="?curid=433380" title="E. Roland Harriman">
<text>Edward Roland Noel &quot;Bunny&quot; Harriman (December 24, 1895 – February 16, 1978) was an American financier and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Harriman was born on December 24, 1895, in New York City. He was the youngest of five surviving children of Mary Williamson Averell and Edward Henry Harriman. Among his siblings was W. Averell Harriman, the financier and government official, four years his senior. Edward H. Harriman&#x27;s estate was substantial, variously estimated between $70 million and $100 million upon his death in 1909, leaving his wife and children well provided for.

Roland, whom friends and family sometimes called &quot;Bunny,&quot; was educated at Groton School, from which he graduated in 1913, and Yale University (B.A., 1917), where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was also a member of Skull and Bones with his classmate and friend Prescott Bush. During World War I he served for 10 months as an inspector with the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army Ordnance Department; stricken with pneumonia and influenza, he was honorably discharged in January 1919.
==Career==
After regaining his health in California, in November 1919, Harriman joined the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, a firm in which his brother W. Averell Harriman had an interest.

In 1922 Harriman joined W. A. Harriman Company, investment bankers in New York City, and in 1923 he became its vice president. In 1927 the two brothers formed the banking firm Harriman Brothers and Company. In 1931 the firm was merged with Brown Bros. &amp; Co., with Roland as vice president. Headquartered on Wall Street, Brown Brothers Harriman started with nine partners and about 200 employees, performing specialized banking services for customers, mainly medium-sized corporations; it was not a member of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

In 1968 Harriman and three other senior partners at Brown Brothers (Robert A. Lovett, secretary of defense under President Harry Truman; Prescott Bush, former senator from Connecticut; and Knight Woolley — all Yale men) moved &quot;upstairs,&quot; literally and figuratively, to make way for the younger partners, one of whom was Robert Roosa, former undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury. In 1975 a few years prior to Harriman&#x27;s death, there were 29 partners and approximately 1,000 employees.

Harriman served as the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad for 23 years.

===Union Bank===
Harriman was one of the seven directors of the Union Banking Corporation (along with Prescott Sheldon Bush, father of future U.S. president George H. W. Bush), which financed Fritz Thyssen a donor to the Nazi Party and whose assets were seized by the United States government during World War II under the Trading with the Enemy Act and Executive Order No. 9095.

==Personal life==
On April 12, 1917, he married Gladys Fries (1896–1983). They resided in Arden, New York and were listed in the Social Register. Together they had two children:
*Elizabeth Harriman, who was married to Alexander C. Northrop, then Maximillian Bliss, Jr.
*Phyllis Harriman, a landscape painter, who was married for several years to fellow artist Frank Herbert Mason

Harriman died on February 16, 1978, in Arden, New York, and his wife died in 1983, also in Arden, New York.

===Philanthropy===
With his wife, Harriman established the Irving Sherwood Wright professorship in geriatrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and provided funds for cardiovascular research at the hospital.

After World War II, Harriman joined the American Red Cross as a member of the board of governors in 1947 and helped reorganize it, serving as manager for the organization&#x27;s North Atlantic area from 1944 to 1946, as vice-president and national annual fund appeal chair in 1949, and was appointed its president by President Truman to succeed General George Marshall in 1950. President Dwight Eisenhower reappointed him president in 1953.

Harriman&#x27;s other philanthropic board memberships included that of the American Museum of Natural History, for which he was also treasurer. He was also the chairman of the U.S. Trotting Association. He was also president and chairman of the Boys&#x27; Club of New York.

<text>A one-liner is a joke that is delivered in a single line. A good one-liner is said to be – concise and meaningful. Comedians and actors use this comedic method as part of their performance, and many fictional characters are also known to deliver one-liners, including James Bond, who often makes pithy and laconic quips after disposing of a villain.

<text>Echium plantagineum, commonly known as purple viper&#x27;s-bugloss, Paterson&#x27;s curse or Salvation Jane, is a species of the genus &quot;Echium&quot; native to western and southern Europe (from southern England south to Iberia and east to the Crimea), northern Africa, and southwestern Asia (east to Georgia). It has also been introduced to Australia, South Africa, and United States, where it is an invasive weed. Due to a high concentration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, it is poisonous to grazing livestock, especially those with simple digestive systems, such as horses.

==Description==
&quot;Echium plantagineum&quot; is a winter annual plant growing to 20–60 cm tall, with rough, hairy, lanceolate leaves up to 14 cm long. The flowers are purple, 15–20 mm long, with all the stamens protruding, and borne on a branched spike.

==Taxonomy==
The Latin genus name comes from the Greek word &quot;ekhis&quot;, which means viper (a type of snake), possibly due to the seeds resembling a viper&#x27;s head or the forking at the end of the thin flower style resembles a viper&#x27;s tongue. The plant&#x27;s roots, when eaten with wine, are claimed to provide a folk cure for a snakebite.
The Latin specific epithet &quot;plantagineum&quot; refers to the leaves of the plant, which are similar to those of a plantain.

==Invasive species==


&quot;E. plantagineum&quot; has become an invasive species in Australia, where it is also known as Salvation Jane (particularly in South Australia), blueweed, Lady Campbell weed, Paterson&#x27;s curse and Riverina bluebell.

In the United States, the species has become naturalised in parts of California, Oregon, and some eastern states and areas such as northern Michigan. In Oregon, it has been declared a noxious weed.

==Toxicity==
&quot;E. plantagineum&quot; contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, so is poisonous to nonruminants. When eaten in large quantities, it causes reduced livestock weight, and death in severe cases, due to liver damage. Paterson&#x27;s curse can also kill horses, and irritate the udders of dairy cows and the skin of humans. After the 2003 Canberra bushfires, a large bloom of the plant occurred on the burned land, and many horses became ill and died from grazing on it. Because the alkaloids can also be found in the nectar of Paterson&#x27;s curse, the honey made from it should be blended with other honeys to dilute the toxins.

<text>Olivia Goldsmith (January 1, 1949 – January 15, 2004) was an American author, known for her first novel &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1992), which was adapted into the 1996 film of the same name.

==Biography==
She was born Randy Goldfield and grew up in Dumont, New Jersey, but changed her name to Justine Goldfield and later to Justine Rendal. She took up writing following a divorce in which she said her husband got almost everything (including her Jaguar and the country house).

A graduate of New York University, she was a partner at the management consultants Booz Allen Hamilton in New York prior to becoming a writer. Controversially, in late 1996 Goldsmith said, in response to an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reporter&#x27;s question, that her favorite event of 1996 was when Bob Dole fell off a stage during a campaign function. She also wrote several books for children, which were published under the name Justine Rendal.

==Death==
Goldsmith died as a result of complications (heart attack) from cosmetic surgery. Her final two books were published posthumously. The song &quot;Edith Wharton&#x27;s Figurines&quot; from Suzanne Vega&#x27;s 2007 studio album &quot;Beauty &amp; Crime&quot; is dedicated to Goldsmith. 

==Bibliography==
* &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1992), adapted into the film of the same name starring Diane Keaton, Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn in 1996.

After a friend (also a &quot;first wife&quot;) kills herself due to her ex-husband&#x27;s abuse, they decided to exact revenge on all four ex-husbands.
* &quot;Fashionably Late&quot; (1993) in which a young designer tries to handle her fashion house while dealing with her troubled marriage, adopting a child, and finding her birth mother.
* &quot;Flavor of the Month&quot; (1994), a satire of Hollywood following three stars of a hit TV show. One is a talented but plain actress who gets plastic surgery to look younger and beautiful; the second is a dirt-poor Southern girl fleeing an abusive father; the third is the spoiled child of actors.
* &quot;Marrying Mom&quot; (1996), in which three thirty-something New Yorkers try to get a husband for their widowed mother so she&#x27;ll stop interfering in their lives.

<doc id="433393" wikidata="Q2280708" url="?curid=433393" title="Kecksburg UFO incident">
<text>The Kecksburg UFO incident occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States, when a fireball was reported by citizens of six U.S. states and Canada over Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario. Astronomers said it was likely to have been a meteor bolide burning up in the atmosphere and descending at a steep angle. NASA released a statement in 2005 reporting that experts had examined fragments from the area and determined they were from a Soviet satellite, but that records of their findings were lost in 1987. NASA responded to court orders and Freedom of Information Act requests to search for the records. The incident gained wide notoriety in popular culture and ufology, with speculation ranging from extraterrestrial craft to debris from the Soviet space probe Kosmos 96, and is often called &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s Roswell&quot;.

== Initial reports ==
On the evening of December 9, 1965, a large, brilliant fireball was seen in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada as it streaked over the Detroit, Michigan–Windsor, Ontario area. Reports of hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, grass fires, and sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area were attributed to the fireball. Some people in the village of Kecksburg, about southeast of Pittsburgh, reported wisps of blue smoke, vibrations, and a &quot;thump&quot;, and also that something from the sky had crashed in the woods.

An early story in the &quot;Greensburg Tribune-Review&quot; stated the following: The area where the object landed was immediately sealed off on the order of U.S. Army and State Police officials, in anticipation of a &quot;close inspection&quot; of whatever may have fallen ... State Police officials there ordered the area roped off to await the expected arrival of both U.S. Army engineers and possibly, civilian scientists.

When state troopers and Air Force personnel searched the woods, they found &quot;absolutely nothing&quot;. A subsequent edition in the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; bore the headline &quot;Searchers Fail to Find Object&quot;.

Authorities discounted proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris and generally assumed it to be a meteor. Astronomer Paul Annear said the fireball was likely to have been a meteor entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Geophysicist George Wetherilo discounted speculations that it was debris from a satellite and agreed that the reports were probably due to a meteor. Astronomers William P. Bidelman and Fred Hess said it undoubtedly was a meteor bolide. A spokesman for the Department of Defense in Washington said first reports indicated the reported fireball was a natural phenomenon.

== Scientific articles ==
===&quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;===
Several articles were written about the fireball in science journals. The February 1966 issue of &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; reported that the fireball was seen over the Detroit-Windsor area at about 4:44 p.m. EST. The Federal Aviation Administration received 23 reports from aircraft pilots, starting at 4:44 p.m. A seismograph southwest of Detroit recorded shock waves created by the fireball as it passed through the atmosphere. The &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; article concluded that &quot;the path of the fireball extended roughly from northwest to southeast&quot; and ended &quot;in or near the western part of Lake Erie&quot;.

===&quot;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&quot;===
A 1967 article by two astronomers in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&quot; (JRASC) used the seismographic record to pinpoint the time of passage over the Detroit area to 4:43 p.m. In addition, they used photographs of the trail taken north of Detroit at two different locations to triangulate the trajectory of the object. They concluded that the fireball was descending at a steep angle, moving from the southwest to the northeast, and likely impacted on the northwestern shore of Lake Erie near Windsor, Ontario.

==NASA statements==
In December 2005, just before the 40th anniversary of the Kecksburg incident, NASA released a statement reporting that experts had examined metallic fragments from the area and determined they were from a Soviet satellite that re-entered the atmosphere and broke up, but records of their findings were lost in the 1980s.

Leslie Kean, described as &quot;an investigative reporter backed by the Sci-Fi Channel&quot;, reportedly &quot;sued NASA under the Freedom of Information Act&quot; for the lost NASA records. On October 26, 2007, NASA agreed to search for those records after being ordered by a court. During the hearing, Steve McConnell, NASA&#x27;s public liaison officer, testified that two boxes of papers from the time of the Kecksburg incident were missing. Loss of records is not a unique case for NASA; for example, the original tapes recorded during the televised Apollo 11 Moon landing were misplaced or reused.

In 2008, space writer James Oberg suggested that NASA was unlikely to possess any such documents since, in his view, it was highly likely that the supposed NASA team that investigated the site were in fact Air Force personnel who identified themselves as NASA personnel, something regularly done by military personnel in civilian clothes during the 1960s. He further suggested that Kean&#x27;s action was no more than a &quot;publicity stunt&quot; for the benefit of Kean&#x27;s employers.
According to John Ventre of MUFON and Shafton native Owen Eichler, their recent investigations have led them to speculate the object that reportedly landed in Kecksburg was &quot;a General Electric Mark 2 Re-entry Vehicle that had been launched by the Air Force as a spy satellite, but fell out of orbit&quot;, however, “we need confirmation from NASA or the Air Force&quot;.

More recent comments by NASA are less supportive of a link to a Soviet satellite:

== Television and film ==
* In 1990, the NBC television show &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; aired an episode partially devoted to the incident. The episode suggested an extraterrestrial craft had crashed. It quoted local residents at the time who said they had found an object in the woods shaped like an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle bearing writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs which was subsequently removed in a secret military operation. A prop from that show remains on display in the village.
* In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel aired a two-hour documentary, &quot;The New Roswell: Kecksburg Exposed&quot;, hosted by Bryant Gumbel. In it, Kecksburg resident John Hays says that as a 10-year-old boy, he saw a flat-bed truck emerging from the site near his house, carrying something &quot;the size of a VW”, an exact repetition of the claims he made in the first episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, season 3, in 1990.
* In 2008, an episode of the Discovery Channel series &quot;Nazi UFO Conspiracy&quot; suggested the incident was the recovery of an alleged Nazi UFO called &quot;Die Glocke&quot; (&quot;The Bell&quot;).
* In February 2009, the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;UFO Hunters&quot; suggested a military conspiracy and cover-up related to the incident.
* In 2011, the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; suggested the alleged Nazi secret weapon was recovered at Kecksburg, prompting a government conspiracy and cover-up.
* In 2014, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos with the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Aliens&quot; visited the supposed crash site, led by local UFO researcher Stan Gordon.
* On September 12, 2019, producer-director Cody Knotts premiered his film &quot;Kecksburg&quot;. It dramatizes the story of John Murphy, a reporter for local radio station WHJB who claimed to be the victim of a government conspiracy.
* Filmmaker Andrew Patterson has said that the plot of his 2019 film &quot;The Vast of Night&quot; was partially based on the Kecksburg incident.
* BBC Radio 4&#x27;s 2024 drama series, &quot;Limelight: The Skies Are Watching&quot;, uses the Kecksburg incident as its inspiration.

<text>Edward Henry Harriman (February 20, 1848 – September 9, 1909) was an American financier and railroad executive.

==Early life==
Harriman was born on February 20, 1848, in Hempstead, New York, the son of Orlando Harriman Sr., an Episcopal clergyman, and Cornelia Neilson. He had a brother, Orlando Harriman Jr. His great-grandfather, William Harriman, had emigrated from England in 1795 and became a successful businessman and trader.

As a young boy, Harriman spent a summer working at the Greenwood Iron Furnace in the area owned by the Robert Parker Parrott family that would become Harriman State Park. He quit school at age 14 to take a job as an errand boy on Wall Street in New York City. His uncle Oliver Harriman had earlier established a career there. By age 22, he was a member of the New York Stock Exchange.

==Career==
Harriman&#x27;s father-in-law was president of the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad Company, which aroused Harriman&#x27;s interest in upstate New York transportation. In 1881, at age 33, Harriman acquired the small, broken-down Lake Ontario Southern Railroad. He renamed it the Sodus Bay &amp; Southern, reorganized it, and sold it to the Pennsylvania Railroad at a considerable profit. This was the start of his career as a rebuilder of bankrupt railroads.
Harriman was nearly 50 years old when in 1897 he became a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. By May 1898, he was chairman of the executive committee, and from that time until his death, his word was the law on the Union Pacific system. In 1903, he assumed the office of president of the company. From 1901 to 1909, Harriman was also the president of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The vision of a unified UP/SP railroad was planted with Harriman. (The UP and SP were reunited on September 11, 1996, a month after the Surface Transportation Board approved their merger.)
At the time of his death Harriman controlled the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Saint Joseph and Grand Island, the Illinois Central, the Central of Georgia, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Wells Fargo Express Company. Estimates of his estate ranged from $150 million to $200 million. That fortune was left entirely to his wife.

He was keenly interested in eugenics.

===Harriman Alaska expedition===

In 1899, Harriman sponsored and accompanied a scientific expedition to catalog the flora and fauna of the Alaska coastline. Many prominent scientists and naturalists went on the expedition, aboard the luxuriously refitted steamer SS &quot;George W. Elder&quot;.

===Interest in ju-jitsu===
Harriman became interested in ju-jitsu after his two-month visit to Japan in 1905. When he returned to America, he brought with him a troupe of six Japanese ju-jitsu wrestlers, including the prominent judokas Tsunejiro Tomita and Mitsuyo Maeda. Among many performances, the troupe gave an exhibition that drew some 600 spectators in the Columbia University gymnasium on February 7, 1905.

==Personal life==
In 1879, Harriman married Mary Williamson Averell, daughter of William J. Averell, a banker in Ogdensburg, New York. Together they had six children:

* Mary Harriman (1881–1934), who married Charles Cary Rumsey (1879–1922), a sculptor, in 1910.
* Henry Neilson Harriman (1883–1888), who died young.
* Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966), who married Robert Livingston Gerry Sr. (1877–1957) in 1908.
* Carol Averell Harriman (1889–1948), who married Richard Penn Smith Jr. (1893–1929) in 1917. After his death, she married W. Plunket Stewart, who had previously been married and divorced from Elsie Cassatt, the daughter of Alexander Cassatt, in 1930.
* William Averell Harriman (1891-1986), the Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S. Truman, the 48th Governor of New York, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and U.S. Ambassador to Britain. He was married three times: First to Kitty Lanier Lawrance (from 1915 until their divorce in 1929), then Marie Norton Whitney (from 1930 until her death in 1970), then lastly Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (from 1971 until his death in 1986)
* Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895–1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896–1983) in 1917.

Harriman died on September 9, 1909, at his home, Arden, at 1:30 p.m. at age 61. Naturalist John Muir, who had joined him on the 1899 Alaska expedition, wrote in his eulogy of Harriman, &quot;In almost every way, he was a man to admire.&quot;

===Harriman estate===
In 1885, Harriman acquired &quot;Arden&quot;, the Parrott family estate in the Ramapo Highlands near Tuxedo, New York, for $52,500. The property had been a source of iron ore for the Parrott Brothers Iron Works. Over the next several years he purchased almost 40 nearby parcels of land, adding , and connected all of them with of bridle paths. His residence, Arden House, was completed just seven months before he died.

In the early 1900s, his sons W. Averell Harriman and E. Roland Harriman hired landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll to landscape many acres. In 1910, his widow donated to the state of New York for Harriman State Park. The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

==Legacy==
===Award===
*In 1913, his widow created the E. H. Harriman Award to recognize outstanding achievements in railway safety. The award has been presented on an annual basis since then.
*Stephen Birmingham writes in the book &quot;Our Crowd&quot; that &quot;Ned&quot; Harriman was considered one of the most disagreeable men of his period. The book quotes James Stillman of the National City Bank calling him &quot;not a safe man to do business with, yet the Illinois Central run by Harriman was one of the best-run and most profitable in the country.&quot;

===Namesakes===
*Harriman, New York
*The Union Pacific Harriman Dispatch Center in Omaha, Nebraska is named for Edward H. Harriman. 
*Harriman Glacier in Alaska&#x27;s Chugach National Forest, located in Whittier, Alaska, was named for him by the Harriman Alaska expedition
*Two post offices in Oregon were named for Harriman, including the one at Rocky Point, where he maintained a summer camp for several years.
*Financial and business publisher Harriman House is named after Harriman.
*The city of Sparks, Nevada, was known as Harriman during its early existence.
*Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York
*Harriman State Park in Island Park, Idaho

===Places built using funds donated from his sponsorship or estate===
*Harriman founded the Tompkins Square Boys&#x27; Club, now known as The Boys&#x27; Club of New York. The original club, founded in 1876, was located in the rented basement of the Wilson School in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, and began with three boys. Harriman&#x27;s idea for the club was to provide a place &quot;for the boys, so as to get them off the streets and teach them better manners.&quot; By 1901, the club had outgrown its space. Harriman purchased several lots on 10th and Avenue A, and a five-story clubhouse was completed in 1901.
*Inheritance taxes from Harriman&#x27;s estate, in the amount of $798,546 paid by his widow on March 1, 1911, to the State of Utah, helped fund the construction of the state&#x27;s capitol building.

==In popular culture==
* Harriman is the topic of a verse in the song &quot;The Yama Yama Man&quot; (1908) that concerns the war of succession with Stuyvesant Fish over the Illinois Central Railroad around 1906.
* Harriman is mentioned in the movie &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), as the commercial baron whose agents become the title characters&#x27; nemeses. In the film&#x27;s second train robbery, a railroad employee ascribes his refusal to cooperate with the robbery to his obligations to Harriman personally, and one of Butch and Sundance&#x27;s intimates describes Harriman&#x27;s hiring of famed outlaw-hunters to track down the gang&#x27;s leaders.
* In the movie &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), a railroad official named Pat Harrigan serves as a stand-in for Harriman.
* Harriman is a playable character in the video game series &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot;.
* Harriman is one of the several prominent industrial figures who serve as inspiration for Leviticus Cornwall in the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;.
* Science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein’s &quot;Future History&quot; stories feature a “robber baron” character named D.D. Harriman, a probable reference to E.H. Harriman.

<text>Kaniv (, ) is a city in Cherkasy Raion, Cherkasy Oblast, central Ukraine. The city rests on the Dnieper River, and is one of the main inland river ports on the Dnieper. It is an urban hromada of Ukraine. Population: 

Kaniv is a historical town that was founded in the 11th century by Kievan prince Yaroslav the Wise. The city is known today mostly for the burial site of Taras Shevchenko, the great Ukrainian poet and artist.

Picturesque and ancient, Kaniv was once one of the largest cities of Kievan Rus&#x27;. At that time, it was an outpost used for diplomatic meetings between Ruthenian princes and ambassadors of militant tribes. Later, in the 18th century, it became a popular destination for elderly Cossacks, who wanted to live out their days on the banks of the great Dnieper River, and on the Chernecha Mountain, where, according to legend, a monastery stood in the past. The mountain remains one of Kaniv&#x27;s most important places, attracting thousands of tourists to the city. Today it is most famous as a burial place of the celebrated Ukrainian poet and painter Taras Shevchenko, who is considered a founder of modern Ukrainian literature, which is located on Taras Hill overlooking the Dnieper. The Kaniv reserve is the oldest historical and cultural reserve in Ukraine. 

Industry in the city includes Kaniv hydroelectric power plant located on the Kaniv Reservoir on the Dnieper, fruit and vegetable, condiments factory, large milk and cheese factory, poultry processing.

==History==

The city&#x27;s date of establishment is unknown. It was first mentioned in the Paterikon of Caves Monastery in Kyiv of the 11th century where it is mentioned about relocation of icon painters from Constantinople during rule of Vsevolod of Kyiv. The first mentioning of Kaniv in chronicles is dated 9 June 1144 when the Grand Prince of Kyiv Vsevolod II founded the St. George&#x27;s Cathedral (later known as the Dormition Cathedral). In chronicles it is also mentioned that in 1149 the Grand Prince of Kyiv George the Long-Armed after conquering Kyiv appointed his son Gleb as a prince in Kaniv. The city was also mentioned later in chronicles often in relation to raids onto Cumans. Among the killed Ruthenian princes at the 1223 battle at Kalka River, there was mentioned Prince Svyatoslav of Kaniv.

Archaeological excavations indicated that earlier Slavic settlement already existed near Kaniv before the 10th century. Also, some documents indicate the existence of the Holy Dormition Kaniv monastery in the 11th century.

There is no definite information on the source and meaning of the city&#x27;s name; supposedly its name is derived from the personal nickname Kanya (&#x27;buzzard&#x27;). in his Toponymic dictionary of Ukraine says that the name is derived from Turkish word meaning the place of khan. There are other hypotheses on the city&#x27;s name.

From mid-12th century Kaniv became a big city and played prominent role in the Kievan Rus&#x27; (Ruthenian state) where it was a center of an apanage principality within the principality of Kyiv. Until the 13th century, the central part of Kaniv was so called &quot;Hellenic town&quot; located at the Moskovka Mountain.

According to popular historic sources, in 1239 the city was conquered and razed by the Mongols.

Kaniv has been mentioned in report of Giovanni da Pian del Carpine after his 1245 travel to the Mongol Empire. In the report the city is mentioned as a Tatars post. In the Middle Ages it was located on the Road from Varangians to Greeks. Initially part of Kievan Rus&#x27;, in the 1362 it was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 14th century, Grand Prince of Lithuania Vitautas built in Kaniv a castle that existed until 1768.

In 1431, it became part of the Lithuanian Kyiv Voivodeship. It was sacked by the Ottoman Turks in 1458. In 1569, Kaniv came under the rule of Poland, and it was also one of the centers of Cossack culture and military life. In 1600, it received the Magdeburg Rights, but the city&#x27;s prosperity was halted by successive plagues, fires, and Cossack unrest. Kaniów was a royal city of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. During The Deluge the town was captured by the forces of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1648.

In 1648-78, the city was center of the Kaniv Regiment, Cossack formation of which was established long before the Khmelnytsky Uprising as part of the Polish registered Cossacks formations. In 1662, the Right-Bank forces of Yuri Khmelnytsky, supported by Polish and Crimean Tatar troops, were defeated in the battle of Kaniv (1662) by the Russian forces of Grigory Romodanovsky and the Left-Bank Cossacks of Yakym Somko. In 1678, the Kaniv regiment was overran by Turks and its administration was transferred to Bohuslav. In 1768, it was captured by one of the leaders of the Koliyivschyna, Maksym Zalizniak. As an effect of a pogrom, most of the local szlachta and Jews were killed.

In 1775 Kaniv became a personal property of the King of Poland Stanisław August Poniatowski who, in 1777, gave it away to his nephew S.Poniatowski. In 1787, Kaniv was visited by Catherine II. She met there with Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski. Following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 the town with large parts of other territories came under the control of the Russian Empire. In 1800, Poniatowski sold bigger portion of the city to archimandrite of the Kaniv Monastery of Saint Basil the Great B.Fizikiewicz who in his turn bequeathed his property to the local school of the Order of Saint Basil the Great.

During the later stages of the Great War, on 11 May 1918, the town was the seat of the Battle of Kaniów, in which the forces of the 2nd Polish Corps and the Polish Legions under Józef Haller de Hallenburg failed to break through the Austro-German lines to the Russian side. During the Second World War, Kaniv was a site of an unsuccessful drop of Soviet paratroopers. 
In 1978, Oleksa Hirnyk burned himself to death, on a hill near Shevchenko&#x27;s tomb in protest of Russification. In 2007, he was honored as a Hero of Ukraine.

Rebuilt in 1966–70, since 1972 the Dormition Cathedral building was housing the newly established Kaniv folk art museum. After dissolution of the Soviet Union, the church was passed to the Easter Orthodox community of Moscow Patriarchate, while the museum was relocated to another former religious building that used to belong to the Ukrainian Order of Saint Basil the Great.

Until 18 July 2020, Kaniv was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to Kaniv Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four, the city was merged into Cherkasy Raion.

<text>The  (, &#x27;the King&#x27;s desk&#x27;), also known as Louis XV&#x27;s roll-top desk (), is the richly ornamented royal cylinder desk which was constructed at the end of Louis XV&#x27;s reign, and is now again in the Palace of Versailles.

==History==
The was probably started in 1760, when the commission was formally announced. Its first designer was Jean-François Oeben, the master cabinet maker of the royal arsenal. The first step in its construction was the fabrication of an extremely detailed miniature model in wax. The full-scale desk was finished in 1769 by his successor, Jean Henri Riesener, who had married Oeben&#x27;s widow. 

Made for the new at the Palace of Versailles, it was transferred to the Louvre Museum in Paris after the French Revolution, but has been returned to the Palace of Versailles in the 20th century where it stands again in the room where it was standing before the Revolution: the (&#x27;Inner study of the Private Apartments&#x27;), the famous study room where kings Louis XV and Louis XVI carried out their daily work, and where King Louis XVI decided to support the American insurgents in 1777. Secret diplomatic papers were kept inside the desk&#x27;s secret drawers, whose only key the king always carried with him.

==Description==
The desk is covered with intricate marquetry of a wide variety of fine woods. In an oval reserve at the center of its &quot;public&quot; side, away from the king himself, is the marquetry head of &quot;Silence&quot;, with forefinger to lips, a reminder of the discretion required in the king&#x27;s business. Gilt-bronze moldings of plaques, statuettes, miniature busts and vases, even integral scrolling gilt-bronze candle stands, further adorn the surfaces of the desk. The original design was to have a miniature bust of Louis XV on top, but it was replaced by Minerva after his death in 1770.

Riesener later executed a simplified second version of the for Pierre Gaspard Marie Grimod d&#x27;Orsay, comte d&#x27;Orsay; today this may be seen in the Wallace Collection in London. His copy was the first of a number of replicas that were produced from the 1870s onwards by leading cabinetmakers in Paris, including four examples by François Linke.

<text>Mudvayne is an American heavy metal band formed in Peoria, Illinois, in 1996. Known for their sonic experimentation, face and body paint, masks and uniforms, the band has sold over five million records worldwide. The group consists of lead guitarist Greg Tribbett, drummer Matthew McDonough, lead vocalist Chad Gray, bassist Ryan Martinie and live rhythm guitarist Marcus Rafferty. The band became popular in the late-1990s Peoria underground music scene, and they found success with the single &quot;Dig&quot; from their debut album &quot;L.D. 50&quot; (2000). After releasing four more albums and touring relentlessly for nearly a decade, Mudvayne went on hiatus in 2010. They reunited in 2021 and continue to perform live.

==History==

===Early days, &quot;Kill, I Oughtta&quot; and &quot;L.D. 50&quot; (1996–2001)===
Mudvayne, formed in 1996 in Peoria, Illinois, originally consisted of guitarist Greg Tribbett, drummer Matthew McDonough and bassist Shawn Barclay. The band&#x27;s lineup was finalized a matter of months later when Chad Gray, who was earning $40,000 a year in a factory, quit his day job to become its lead singer. In 1997, Mudvayne financed its debut EP, &quot;Kill, I Oughtta&quot;.

During the EP&#x27;s recording, Barclay was replaced by Ryan Martinie, former bassist for the progressive rock band Broken Altar. After self-distributing &quot;Kill, I Oughtta&quot;, Mudvayne adopted stage names and face paint.

Chuck Toler managed the band as they recorded their 2000 debut album &quot;L.D. 50&quot;. For the album, Mudvayne experimented with a ragged, dissonant sound; a sound collage, prepared for the album, was used as a series of interludes. &quot;L.D. 50&quot; was produced by the band and Garth Richardson, with executive production by Slipknot member Shawn Crahan and Slipknot manager Steve Richards.

&quot;L.D. 50&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart and No. 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The singles &quot;Dig&quot; and &quot;Death Blooms&quot; peaked at No. 33 and No. 32 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Although the album was praised, some critics found the band hard to take seriously.

To promote &quot;L.D. 50&quot;, Mudvayne played on the Tattoo the Earth tour with Nothingface, Slayer, Slipknot and Sevendust. Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell became friends with Mudvayne vocalist Chad Gray, and they explored the possibility of a supergroup. The following year, Nothingface again toured with Mudvayne; although plans for a supergroup continued, they were put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. Gray and Maxwell had discussed five names for the group, and Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell &quot;out of the blue&quot; to join it. Although Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles played on the group&#x27;s demo, the search for another drummer began.

===&quot;The End of All Things to Come&quot; and &quot;Lost and Found&quot; (2002–2005)===
In 2002, Mudvayne released &quot;The End of All Things to Come&quot;, which the band considers its &quot;black album&quot; due to its largely-black artwork. Isolation inspired the album&#x27;s songs. During its mixing, Gray and McDonough stopped at Bob&#x27;s Big Boy and Gray remembered overhearing someone &quot;say something like, &#x27; ... and he&#x27;s got to cut his own eye out&#x27;&quot;. When he asked McDonough if he heard the conversation McDonough said he hadn&#x27;t, and Gray thought it was someone discussing a scene from a screenplay.

The album expanded on &quot;L.D. 50&quot;, with a wider range of riffs, tempos, moods and vocals. Because of this experimentation, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called this album more &quot;user-friendly&quot; than its predecessor and it was one of 2002&#x27;s most acclaimed heavy-metal albums, it was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA in 2003. The music video for the single &quot;Not Falling&quot; demonstrated Mudvayne&#x27;s change in appearance from &quot;L.D. 50&quot;, with the musicians transformed into veined creatures with white, egg-colored bug eyes. In 2003, Mudvayne participated in the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica, and in September, Chad Gray appeared on V Shape Mind&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot;.

In January 2004, the band began work on its third album, produced by Dave Fortman. As for the previous album, Mudvayne withdrew to write songs; they moved into a house, writing the album in four months before recording began after the Summer Sanitarium tour ended. In February, Gray and Martinie expressed an interest in appearing on &quot;Within The Mind – In Homage to the Musical Legacy of Chuck Schuldiner&quot;, a tribute to the founder of the metal band Death, but the album was never produced.

In 2005, Chad Gray established independent record label Bullygoat Records and Bloodsimple&#x27;s debut album, &quot;A Cruel World&quot; (with a guest appearance by Gray), appeared in March. On April 12, Mudvayne released &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Happy?&quot;, featured complex guitar work and Gray described &quot;Choices&quot; as &quot;the eight-minute opus&quot;.

In August, former Mudvayne bassist Shawn Barclay released his band Sprung&#x27;s debut album, mastered by King&#x27;s X guitarist Ty Tabor. That month, rumors spread that Bullygoat Records would release &quot;We Pay Our Debt Sometimes: A Tribute to Alice in Chains&quot;, with performances by Mudvayne, Cold, Audioslave, Breaking Benjamin, Static-X and the surviving members of Alice in Chains. A spokesperson for Alice in Chains told the press that the band was unaware of any tribute album, and Mudvayne&#x27;s manager said that reports of the album were only rumors.

In September, the band met with director Darren Lynn Bousman, whose film &quot;Saw II&quot; was in production and would include &quot;Forget to Remember&quot; from &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Bousman showed them a scene of a man cutting his eye out of his skull to retrieve a key. When Gray told Bousman about the conversation at Bob&#x27;s Big Boy two years earlier, Bousman said he holds his production meetings at the restaurant and &quot;Saw II&quot; was based on a screenplay he wrote years earlier. Gray appeared briefly in the film, and the music video for &quot;Forget to Remember&quot; contained clips from &quot;Saw II&quot;.

===&quot;The New Game&quot; and &quot;Mudvayne&quot; (2006–2009)===
In 2006, Gray, Tribbett and Tom Maxwell were joined by former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul for the supergroup Hellyeah. On March 8, when Mudvayne and Korn performed at the KBPI Birthday Bash in Denver, Thornton waitress Nicole LaScalia was injured during Mudvayne&#x27;s set. Two years later, LaScalia filed a lawsuit against radio station owner Clear Channel Broadcasting, concert promoter Live Nation, the University of Denver and members of Mudvayne and Korn. During the summer, Gray, Tribbett, Maxwell and Paul recorded an album as Hellyeah. After a tour with Sevendust, Mudvayne released the 2007 retrospective &quot;By the People, for the People&quot; (compiled from selections chosen by fans on the band&#x27;s website). The album debuted at number 51 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling about 22,000 copies in its first week.

After Gray and Tribbett returned from touring with Hellyeah, Mudvayne began recording &quot;The New Game&quot; with Dave Fortman. After the album&#x27;s 2008 release, Fortman told MTV that it would be followed in six months by another full-length record.

For its self-titled fifth album, Mudvayne hoped to create a &quot;white album&quot;, describing its cover art. The album, printed with blacklight paint, was only visible under a black light (a light whose wavelength is primarily ultraviolet). &quot;Mudvayne&quot; was recorded in the summer of 2008 and released in 2009.

===Hiatus (2010–2021)===
In 2010, Mudvayne again paused to allow Gray and Tribbett to tour with Hellyeah, and, because of the supergroup&#x27;s album releases, the band would be on hiatus until at least 2014. With Hellyeah, Tribbett has recorded three albums: &quot;Hellyeah&quot;, &quot;Stampede&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. Gray has contributed to an additional fourth, fifth and sixth albums, &quot;Blood for Blood&quot;, &quot;Unden!able&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. In 2012, Ryan Martinie toured with Korn as a temporary replacement for bassist Reginald Arvizu, who remained at home during his wife&#x27;s pregnancy. The following year, Martinie played bass on Kurai&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Breaking the Broken&quot;, In 2014, Tribbett left Hellyeah.

===Reunion (2021–present)===

On April 19, 2021, Mudvayne announced that they had reunited and would play their first shows in 12 years in the fall, which included festival appearances at Inkcarceration Music &amp; Tattoo in Mansfield, Aftershock in Sacramento and Welcome to Rockville in Florida; concert promoter and festival organizer Danny Wimmer stated that these would be the band&#x27;s only live appearances for 2021. The band were previously scheduled to also appear at Louder Than Life in Louisville, before the performance was canceled on September 21 due to Gray and some staff members contracting COVID-19. The members of Mudvayne have reportedly discussed the possibility of new material. The band&#x27;s reunion resumed in the summer of 2022 with appearances at Upheaval Festival in Grand Rapids and Rock Fest in Cadott, followed by their first US tour in 13 years, which saw Mudvayne co-headline the Freaks on Parade tour with Rob Zombie. The tour&#x27;s stop in Tampa made headlines when during one show, Gray fell off the stage while performing the song &quot;Not Falling&quot;. Gray himself noted the irony, and joked it was &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;unbelievable&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==

Mudvayne is noted for its musical complexity, complex meters and polyrhythms. The band&#x27;s music contains what McDonough calls &quot;number symbolism&quot;, where certain riffs correspond to lyrical themes. Mudvayne has incorporated elements of death metal, jazz, jazz fusion, progressive rock, speed metal, thrash metal and world music.

Mudvayne&#x27;s influences include Tool, Pantera, King Crimson, Genesis, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Carcass, Deicide, Emperor, Miles Davis, Black Sabbath, Rush, Metallica, Slayer, Korn, and Deftones. Mudvayne have repeatedly expressed admiration for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and were influenced by the film during the recording of &quot;L.D. 50&quot;.

Although Mudvayne has described its style as &quot;math rock&quot; and &quot;math metal&quot;, drummer Matthew McDonough said in 2009: &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t know what &#x27;math metal&#x27; is. I made a joke early on in Mudvayne&#x27;s career that we used an abacus in writing. It seems I should be careful making jokes in interviews. I don&#x27;t really see Mudvayne as an innovator in anything.&quot; Music critics and journalists have categorized the band as alternative metal, nu metal, experimental metal, extreme metal, hard rock, heavy metal, math metal, groove metal, neo-progressive metal, neo-progressive rock, progressive rock, and progressive metal. Eli Enis of &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine wrote that the band &quot;wriggled between nu-metal, alt-metal, prog and hard rock in a way that remains completely unrivaled to this day. No one else has or ever will sound quite like them.&quot;

==Appearance==
Although Mudvayne was known for its appearance, Gray described its aesthetic as &quot;music first, visuals second&quot;. When &quot;L.D. 50&quot; was released, the band performed in horror film-style makeup. Epic Records initially promoted Mudvayne without focusing on its members; early promotional materials featured a logo instead of photos of the band, but its appearance and music videos publicized &quot;L.D. 50&quot;. The members of Mudvayne were originally known by the stage names Kud, sPaG, Ryknow and Gurrg. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards (where they won the MTV2 Award for &quot;Dig&quot;), the band appeared in white suits with bloody bullet-hole makeup on their foreheads. After 2002, Mudvayne changed makeup styles (from multicolored face paint to extraterrestrials) for promotional photos and changed their stage names to Chüd, Güüg, Rü-D, and Spüg, though they would continue to perform in the horror-style makeup live. According to the band, the extravagant makeup added a visual aspect to their music and set them apart from other metal bands. From 2003 up until their dissolution, Mudvayne largely abandoned the use of makeup to avoid image comparisons with the band Slipknot. With their 2021 reunion, they began wearing makeup again when performing live.

<text>Hon. Auberon Edward William Molyneux Herbert (18 June 1838 – 5 November 1906) was an English writer, theorist, philosopher, and 19th century individualist. He was a son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for the two-member constituency of Nottingham from 1870 to 1874.

He promoted a classical liberal philosophy and took the ideas of Herbert Spencer a stage further by advocating voluntary-funded government that uses force only in defence of individual liberty and private property. He is known as the originator of voluntaryism.

==Early life and education==
Herbert was born at Highclere Castle on 18 June 1838. He was the third son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon, and brother of Henry Herbert, the 4th Earl. Herbert was educated at Eton College, entering the school in 1850. He left school early, having been elected to a founder&#x27;s kin fellowship at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1855. He gained a second class in Classical Moderations in 1857. In May 1858 he joined the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars at Canterbury with the rank of Cornet by purchase, and in June 1859 became a Lieutenant, also by purchase. In the autumn of 1860 he joined the service troops at Umballa, India. In 1861 he returned to England and sold his commission in 1862. He then resumed his career at Oxford, where he was President of the Union in Hilary Term 1862; he graduated B.C.L. in 1862 and D.C.L. in 1865. He lectured in history and jurisprudence at St John&#x27;s College, and resigned his fellowship in 1869.

In March 1864 he visited the scene of the Prusso-Danish war, and distinguished himself at Dybbol by sallies from the Danish redoubts for the purpose of rescuing the wounded. As a recognition of his bravery he was made a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. His impressions of the campaign were recorded in his letters to his mother published under the title &quot;The Danes in Camp&quot; (1864). He went to the United States during the American Civil War, and he witnessed the Siege of Richmond (1864–65). During the Franco-Prussian War he went to France, and was present at the Battle of Sedan (1870). He was outside Paris during the Siege of Paris (1870–71), and was one of the first to enter the city after the capitulation, being nearly shot as a spy on his way in. He remained there during the Paris Commune in the company of his second brother, Alan Herbert, who practised medicine in Paris. In later life he received the Austrian Order of the Iron Crown, third class, for helping to rescue the crew of the &quot;Pare&quot;, an Austrian vessel wrecked off Westward Ho!

===Political career===
Herbert stood as a Conservative candidate for Newport in the 1865 general election but was defeated. He held the post of private secretary to Stafford Northcote, the President of the Board of Trade from 1866 to 1868. He stood as a Liberal candidate for Berkshire in the 1868 election but lost. He served as President of the fourth day of the first ever Co-operative Congress in 1869. He was elected in a by-election for Nottingham in 1870 becoming a Liberal M.P.

For the Elementary Education Act 1870 he supported the principle that all provided schools should be secular or strictly unsectarian. His support for this Act (state provided schools) is in contradiction to his later political position. In 1872 he seconded Sir Charles Dilke&#x27;s motion for an inquiry into the expenses of the civil list, and followed Sir Charles&#x27;s example by declaring himself a republican. This led to a scene of great disorder, and the latter part of his speech was inaudible. He took a leading part in the passing of the Protection of Wild Birds Act 1872. He was an ardent supporter of Joseph Arch and spoke at the mass meeting at Leamington on Good Friday 1872, when the National Agricultural Labourers&#x27; Union was formed. On account of his objection to taking life he became a vegetarian.

Herbert retired from parliamentary life at the 1874 general election. He took an active part in the agitation caused by the Bulgarian atrocities; organised in 1878 the great &#x27;anti-Jingo&#x27; demonstration in Hyde Park against the expected war with Russia; and in 1880 championed the cause of Charles Bradlaugh, speaking at some of the stormy Hyde Park meetings.

He was an ardent but independent supporter of Herbert Spencer. His creed developed a variant of Spencerian individualism which he described as &#x27;voluntaryism&#x27;. In 1884 Herbert published his best-known book, &quot;A Politician in Trouble about his Soul&quot;, a reprint with alterations and additions from &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;. In the first chapters the objections to the party system are discussed, and in the last chapter Spencerian principles are expounded and the doctrine of Laissez-faire is pushed to the extreme point of advocating &#x27;voluntary taxation.&#x27; In 1890 Herbert started a small weekly paper, &quot;Free Life&quot;, which soon became a small separate monthly paper, the &quot;Organ of Voluntary Taxation and the Voluntary State&quot; which ran until 1901.

==Later life==
On leaving parliament, he took to farming, purchasing Ashley Arnewood farm in Ashley, New Forest, where he lived until his wife&#x27;s death in 1886. He then moved to the neighbourhood of Burley in the New Forest, and built, after a pre-existing building, &#x27;The Old House,&#x27; which was his home until his death on 5 November 1906. He was buried in a grave in the grounds of his house.

==Herbert and anarchism==
In an announcement of Herbert&#x27;s death, Benjamin Tucker said, &quot;Auberon Herbert is dead. He was a true anarchist in everything but name. How much better (and how much rarer) to be an anarchist in everything but name than to be an anarchist in name only!&quot; Tucker praised Herbert&#x27;s work as &quot;a magnificent assault on the majority idea, a searching exposure of the inherent evil of State systems, and a glorious assertion of the inestimable benefits of voluntary action and free competition...&quot; while admonishing him for his support of profit in trade (but believes, unlike Herbert himself, that Herbert&#x27;s system would result in an economy without profit). According to Eric Mack, Herbert felt that people who &quot;like Tucker, favored the free establishment of defensive associations and juridical institutions were simply making a verbal error in calling themselves &#x27;anarchists&#x27;.&quot;

Herbert explicitly rejected the label &quot;anarchist&quot; for his ideas. He argued that anarchy was a &quot;contradiction,&quot; and that the Voluntaryists &quot;reject the anarchist creed.&quot; They &quot;believe in a national government, voluntary supported... and only entrusted with force for protection of person and property.&quot; He called his system of a national government funded by non-coerced contributions &quot;the Voluntary State.&quot;

According to Chris Tame, &quot;He refused to accept the label of &#x27;anarchist&#x27;, largely because of a semantic decision whereby he labelled the defensive use of force (which, naturally, he accepted) as &#x27;government. Richard Sylvan, points out that &quot;a variety of political arrangements and organization, including governments of &quot;certain sorts&quot;, are entirely compatible with anarchy.&quot; Rather, anarchists oppose the state or &quot;coercive government.&quot; Sean Sheehan points out, &quot;A distinction that is relevant to the anarchist ideal is the difference between the government, referring to the state, and government, referring to the administration of a political system. Anarchists, like everyone, tend to use the word government as a synonym for state, but what is rejected by anarchism&#x27;s a priori opposition to the state is not the concept of government as such but the idea of a sovereign order that claims and demand obedience, and if necessary the lives, of its subjects.&quot;

Anarchist William R. McKercher notes that Herbert &quot;was often mistakenly taken as an anarchist&quot; but &quot;a reading of Herbert&#x27;s work will show that he was not an anarchist.&quot; The leading British anarchist journal of the time noted that the &quot;Auberon Herbertites in England are sometimes called Anarchists by outsiders, but they are willing to compromise with the inequity of government to maintain private property.&quot; Since the development of anarcho-capitalism in the 1950s, at least one anarcho-capitalist, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, believes that Herbert &quot;develops the Spencerian idea of equal freedom to its logically consistent anarcho-capitalist end&quot; as noted in a bibliography. However, anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard disagreed and called Herbert a &quot;near-anarchist.&quot;

==Criticism==
Victor Yarros, an individualist anarchist, noted what he believed to be a key flaw in Herbert&#x27;s ideology, namely economic inequality. In an article called &quot;Private Property and Freedom&quot;, Yarros argued:

 According to Carl Watner, &quot;Herbert never defended his position in &quot;Liberty&quot;.&quot;

Anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin echoed Yarros and argued that the &quot;modern Individualism initiated by Herbert Spencer is... a powerful indictment against the dangers and wrongs of government, but its practical solution of the social problem is miserable – so miserable as to lead us to inquire if the talk of &#x27;No force&#x27; be merely an excuse for supporting landlord and capitalist domination.&quot;

John A. Hobson, an early democratic socialist, echoed the anarchist critique in his essay on Herbert, &quot;A Rich Man&#x27;s Anarchism&quot;. He argued that Herbert&#x27;s support for exclusive private property would result in the poor being enslaved to the rich. Herbert, &quot;by allowing first comers to monopolise without restriction the best natural supplies&quot; would allow them &quot;to thwart and restrict the similar freedom of those who come after.&quot; Hobson gave the &quot;extreme instance&quot; of an island &quot;the whole of which is annexed by a few individuals, who use the rights of exclusive property and transmission... to establish primogeniture.&quot; In such a situation, the bulk of the population would be denied the right to exercise their faculties or to enjoy the fruits of their labour, which Herbert claimed to be the inalienable rights of all. Hobson concluded: &quot;It is thus that the &#x27;freedom&#x27; of a few (in Herbert&#x27;s sense) involves the &#x27;slavery&#x27; of the many.&quot; Hobson&#x27;s argument reflected Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s critique of inheritance and land laws in continental Europe in &quot;What Is Property?&quot; Scholar M. W. Taylor notes that &quot;of all the points Hobson raised... this argument was his most effective, and Herbert was unable to provide a satisfactory response.&quot;
==Marriage and issue==

In 1871 Herbert married Lady Florence Amabel, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. She died in 1886. They had four children:

* Rolf (23 July 1872 – 13 April 1882), died in childhood 
* Capt. Auberon Thomas &quot;Bron&quot; (1876–1916), succeeded his uncle Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper as 9th Baron Lucas and 5th Lord Dingwall in 1905. He flew for the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and died of wound after being shot down over France. 
* Clair Mimram (28 September 1874 – 8 January 1893); died young; presumably named for the River Mimram in Hertfordshire 
* Nan Ino (1880–1958), who succeeded her brother as 10th Baroness Lucas and 6th Lady Dingwall.

<text>The Natural Law Party of Canada (NLPC) was the Canadian branch of the international Natural Law Party founded in 1992 by a group of educators, business leaders, and lawyers who practised Transcendental Meditation.

==Description and history==

The magician Doug Henning was senior vice president of NLPC, and ran as the party&#x27;s candidate for the former Toronto riding of Rosedale in the 1993 federal election, finishing sixth out of ten candidates.

The NLPC supported federal funding for further research in the technique of yogic flying, a part of the TM-Sidhi program, as a tool for achieving world peace. The NLPC platform maintained that once it took over the government, Canada&#x27;s crime, unemployment, and deficit would disappear. In a 1993 news article, Naomi Rankin, the leader of the Communist Party of Alberta, referred to the NLP as &quot;crackpot&quot;. One of its slogans was &quot;If you favour Natural Law, Natural Law will favour you.&quot; The party was de-registered by Elections Canada, the Canadian government&#x27;s election agency, on January 23, 2004.

===Election results===

==Ontario branch==
The Natural Law Party of Ontario was a political party in Ontario, Canada, the provincial affiliate of the Natural Law Party of Canada. It was established in 1993, and fielded candidates in the 1995 and 1999 provincial elections. Ashley Deans, who was a candidate for Trinity-Spadina in the 1997 and 2000 elections, was the president of the party between 1993 and 2000. The party leader was Ron Parker.

==Quebec branch==
The Parti de la loi naturelle du Québec (PLNQ, in English: &quot;Natural Law Party of Quebec&quot;) was the Quebec branch of the Natural Law Party of Canada. The party was de-registered by the Directeur général des élections du Québec, the Quebec government&#x27;s election agency, in 2003. Its leader from 1994 to 2003 was Allen Faguy.

<doc id="433413" wikidata="Q8071464" url="?curid=433413" title="Zichmni">
<text>Zichmni is the name of an explorer-prince who appears in a 1558 book by Caterino Zeno of Venice, allegedly based on letters and a map (called the Zeno map) dating to the year 1400 by the author&#x27;s ancestors, brothers Nicolò and Antonio Zeno. Zichmni is described as a great lord of some islands off the southern coast of Frislanda, a possibly fictitious island claimed to be larger than Ireland and located south of Iceland.

According to the book, the letters provided a first-hand account of a voyage of exploration undertaken in 1398 by Prince Zichmni, accompanied by the Zeno brothers. The book claims that the voyagers crossed the North Atlantic to Greenland. A few recent authors speculate that they may have reached the coast of North America. There is disagreement among historians as to whether to accept the Zeno letters as valid.

Some proponents of the authenticity of the tale maintain that Zichmni was a Scottish nobleman named Henry Sinclair. However, other scholars have pointed to flaws in this identification and consider it extremely unlikely.

The first person to identify Zichmni with Henry Sinclair was Johann Reinhold Forster in 1784. 

The account of the voyages given by the younger Nicolò continues to attract debate. Some of the islands the Zeno brothers allegedly visited either conflate existing locations or do not exist at all. Research has shown that the Zeno brothers were occupied elsewhere when they were supposedly doing their exploring. Contemporary Venetian court documents place Nicolò as undergoing trial for embezzlement in 1394 for his actions as military governor of Modone and Corone in Greece from 1390–1392. He wrote his last will and testament in Venice in 1400, many years after his alleged death in Frislanda around 1394. There is disagreement about the brothers&#x27; whereabouts at the time of the supposed voyages, with some readings of archival records placing the brothers in Venice at that time. Andrea di Robilant suggests this interpretation is in error.

According to &quot;The Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&quot;, &quot;the Zeno affair remains one of the most preposterous and at the same time one of the most successful fabrications in the history of exploration.&quot; Herbert Wrigley Wilson described and analysed the story at length in &quot;The Royal Navy, a History from the Earliest Times to the Present&quot;, and was sceptical about its veracity, noting &quot;At the date when the work was published Venice was extremely eager to claim for herself some share in the credit of Columbus&#x27;s discoveries as against her old rival Genoa, from whom Columbus had sprung.&quot; Di Robilant disagrees, stating that the younger Nicolò was &quot;a first-class muddler, not a fablemonger&quot;, whose inaccuracy was the result of second-hand retelling that still contains much of the truth of his forebears&#x27; voyages.

== Modern views ==
Most historians regard the map and accompanying narrative as a hoax, perpetrated by the younger Zeno to make a retroactive claim for Venice as having discovered the New World before Christopher Columbus.

The evidence against the authenticity of the map is based largely on the appearance of many phantom islands in the North Atlantic and off the coast of Iceland. One of these non-existent islands was Frisland, where the Zeno brothers allegedly spent some time.

<doc id="433414" wikidata="Q835650" url="?curid=433414" title="Tremors (1990 film)">
<text>Tremors is a 1990 American monster horror film directed by Ron Underwood, produced by Brent Maddock and S. S. Wilson, written by Maddock, Wilson, and Underwood and starring Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, and Reba McEntire.

In the film, handymen Val McKee (Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Ward) wish to leave the small desert town of Perfection, Nevada, as they are tired of their dull lives. However, they happen upon a series of mysterious deaths and a concerned seismologist Rhonda (Carter) studying unnatural readings below the ground. With the help of eccentric survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Gross and McEntire), the group fights for survival against giant, prehistoric, worm-like monsters hungry for human flesh.

Released by Universal Pictures, the film is the first installment of the &quot;Tremors&quot; franchise and was followed by five direct-to-video sequels and one prequel: &quot;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&quot; (1996), &quot;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&quot; (2001), &quot;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&quot; (2004), &quot;Tremors 5: Bloodlines&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2020). A television series titled &quot;Tremors: The Series&quot; aired from March through August 2003. A second television series was set to air in 2018 after a pilot had been shot with Bacon reprising his role for the first time since the original film, but multiple networks including Syfy passed on the series.

==Plot==
Valentine &quot;Val&quot; McKee and Earl Bassett are handymen working in Perfection, Nevada, an isolated settlement in the high desert east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. They eventually get tired of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an electrical tower, still grasping the tower&#x27;s crossbeams and his rifle. Jim Wallace, the town&#x27;s doctor, determines that Edgar died of dehydration, apparently having been too afraid to climb down.

Later on, an unseen creature kills shepherd Fred and his flock of sheep. Val and Earl discover his severed head and believe that a serial killer is on the loose. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl&#x27;s warning and are killed by the same creature, causing a rock slide. Val and Earl try to find help after warning the residents, but find the phone lines are dead and that the rock slide has blocked the only road out of town. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck&#x27;s rear axle, but is torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, and is discovered when they return to town.

Val and Earl borrow horses to ride to Bixby for help. They come upon Wallace and his wife&#x27;s buried station wagon near their trailer, but the couple is missing. As they press on, an enormous burrowing worm-like monster suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of the worm&#x27;s many tentacled &quot;tongues&quot;. Thrown from their horses, the men flee with the monster in pursuit. The chase ends when the eyeless creature crashes through the concrete wall of an aqueduct, dying from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting seismology tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous readings that three other worms are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the worms, and surmise that the creatures hunt their prey by detecting seismic vibrations. The trio then finds some discarded poles, uses them to pole vault over to nearby boulders, and eventually reaches Rhonda&#x27;s truck, narrowly escaping the creature.

After the three return to town, the worms attack and kill general store owner Walter Chang, forcing everyone to hide on the town&#x27;s various rooftops. Meanwhile, survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer manage to kill one of the creatures after unwittingly luring it to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining worms attack the building foundations, knocking over a trailer belonging to Nestor before dragging him under and devouring him. Realizing they cannot stay in the town any longer, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel distract the monsters while Val commandeers a track loader and chains a semi-trailer to the rear; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. En route, both worms create a sinkhole trap that disables the track loader, and the survivors flee to some nearby boulders for safety. Earl then has an idea to lure in the worms and trick them into swallowing Burt&#x27;s homemade pipe bombs. The strategy successfully kills one worm, but the last one spits a bomb back towards the survivors, forcing them to disperse as the explosion destroys all but one of the remaining bombs.

Val lures the final worm into chasing him to the edge of a cliff and throws the remaining bomb behind it, propelling the worm through the cliff face, where it plummets to its death onto the rocks below. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation while Earl encourages Val to pursue a romantic relationship with Rhonda.

==Production==
The concept of &quot;Tremors&quot; was originally conceived in the early 1980s, when writer S. S. Wilson was serving as an editor at a base for the United States Navy as a filmmaker. When hiking one time over large boulders that involved pole vaulting, he suddenly had the thought, “What if something was under the ground and I couldn’t get off this rock?” He tucked away the idea on a piece of paper and eventually came back to it after the success of selling the script of &quot;Short Circuit&quot; with his writing partner Brent Maddock. Nancy Roberts, who was their agent, suggested that they get out their old ideas and start trying to approach them for pitches, with the one she liked best being what became Tremors. Wilson and Maddock shared their idea to their friend Ron Underwood, who was working with National Geographic as a documentary director, and used his knowledge of zoology to better develop the &quot;land sharks&quot; into creatures that could realistically exist.

After their script for &quot;Short Circuit&quot; spawned a major box office hit, Wilson and Maddock quickly began shopping around their idea for &quot;Tremors&quot;. The name &quot;Land Sharks&quot; was changed owing to a then-popular &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch featuring a character of the same name. The original screenplay, titled &quot;Beneath Perfection&quot;, was finished in June 1988.

===Filming===
Filming began in early 1989 and lasted over 50 days. Principal photography took place around Lone Pine, California, and the isolated community of Darwin, California, which the crew liked because of its similitaries to the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada. The town, which was entirely a set, was built near Olancha, California. The mountains in the distance are the Sierra Nevada, and Owens Lake is visible in the background during the film&#x27;s climax.
===Props===

The creature for &quot;Tremors&quot; was designed by Amalgamated Dynamics. The full-scale graboid seen after being dug up by Val was cast in lightweight foam. It was placed in a trench and buried and dug up again to achieve the desired &quot;used&quot; effect.

Burt&#x27;s elephant gun, an 8-gauge Darne shotgun, was rented from a private collector for use in the film. It &quot;fired&quot; dummy cartridges custom made from solid brass rod stock.

===Post-production===
Composer Ernest Troost&#x27;s musical score for the film was atmospheric and suspenseful. The studio wanted the action scenes to have a larger feel, hiring composer Robert Folk to write a few new pieces of score that would give the action greater heft. Despite his contributions, Folk ultimately went uncredited.

&quot;Tremors&quot; was set for a November 1989 release. However, the MPAA gave the film an R rating owing to language, and the creators decided at the last minute to make the film more commercially available. Over 20 or so uses of the word &quot;fuck&quot; were either cut or redubbed with softer words; examples include &quot;Can you fly, you sucker?&quot; and &quot;We killed that motherhumper&quot;, among several others. The film was pushed back to allow more time for editing, and the film was eventually released in January 1990 with a PG-13 rating. Wilson and Maddock later stated they were very happy with the decision to make &quot;Tremors&quot; appeal to a more family-friendly audience rather than an adult-oriented audience.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Tremors&quot; opened on January 19, 1990, in 1,457 theaters against no new releases and debuted at number 5 at the US box office, behind &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; and &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;, grossing $3,731,520 in its opening weekend. It dropped to sixth in its second week but would stay in the top 10 for four weeks before finally dropping to eleventh in its fifth week. &quot;Tremors&quot; grossed $16 million against the budget of $6 million. In 2019, Kevin Bacon hinted that &quot;Tremors&quot; only made &quot;a fifth of what the charts at Universal said it would.&quot; Its creators blamed the subpar theatrical performance on its marketing campaign; S.S. Wilson felt that the film was not well promoted once its release date was delayed, while Brent Maddock stated the theatrical trailer was &quot;cringeworthy&quot; and likely deterred audiences.

===Critical reception===
The film holds a rating of 88% at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews and an average score of 7.20/10. The critics consensus reads: &quot;An affectionate throwback to 1950s creature features, &quot;Tremors&quot; reinvigorates its genre tropes with a finely balanced combination of horror and humor.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

James Berardinelli praised &quot;Tremors&quot; with a three out of four rating, feeling that &quot;horror/comedies often tread too far to one side or the other of that fine line; &quot;Tremors&quot; walks it like a tightrope&quot;. Roger Ebert said that he &quot;liked it enough to recommend it, just barely&quot; and described it as &quot;a goofy, dumb, fun movie&quot;. Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave &quot;Tremors&quot; a B+, saying: &quot;&quot;Tremors&quot; is the &quot;Slacker&quot; of monster movies: bemused, improvisatory, willfully low-key&quot;. Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a delightful throwback&quot; that &quot;evokes the populist spirit of &#x27;50s B-movies&quot;. Jeffery Anderson of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; gave the film a glowing four and a half out of five review, calling &quot;Tremors&quot; &quot;effectively terrifying when it needs to be, effectively exciting when it needs to be, and effectively hilarious when it needs to be... &quot;Tremors&quot; may very well be the best horror film, the best action flick, and the best comedy of the year&quot;.

TV Guide said: &quot;Tremors&quot; is very well cast, with [Fred] Ward and [Kevin] Bacon proving affable and enjoyable comedy leads [...] The special effects are first-rate [...] It may not top anyone&#x27;s 10-best list, but &quot;Tremors&quot; is nevertheless solid entertainment.

Vincent Canby for &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the film &quot;was clearly more fun to make than it is for us to watch&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a C− on the basis that &quot;Tremors&quot; &quot;...has a few clever twists and characters but ultimately can&#x27;t decide on what it wants to be: flat-out funny, which it&#x27;s usually not, or a scarefest, which it&#x27;s usually not either.&quot; Gene Siskel initially gave the film a negative review, stating: &quot;A little of it goes an awfully long way... There are just so many tricks, though, that you can do with the worms. &quot;Tremors&quot; would make a cute short subject, it doesn&#x27;t sustain itself for an entire film&quot;. Two years later he reevaluated the film, saying, &quot;This picture has grown on me... I think it is worth a second viewing. There is a spirit of good fun there.&quot;

===Home releases===
While only a modest hit at the box office, &quot;Tremors&quot; went on to become a massive hit on home video purchases, rentals and television, becoming one of the most rented films of 1990. Because of this, it gained a very large cult following.

&quot;Tremors&quot; debuted on VHS on April 1, 1990, on Laserdisc on April 16, 1996, and on DVD on April 28, 1998. The film was released on Blu-ray on November 9, 2010, and again on September 17, 2013, as part of the &quot;Tremors: Attack Pack&quot; for region 1 (U.S. and Canada). In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Attack Pack &quot;was not released on Blu-ray; instead, the second, third, and fourth films were released on Blu-ray separately on August 5, 2013. It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray and Blu-ray by Arrow Video on December 15, 2020, based on a 4K restoration.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;Tremors&quot; was composed by Ernest Troost and released in 2000. The album contained nine tracks from the film as well as four additional tracks, also composed by Troost, from &quot;Bloodrush&quot;. For promotional purposes, the album was released as a limited edition CD. In 2020, La-La Land Records gave the score its first commercial release as a 2-CD set; CD 1 featured Troost&#x27;s music, with CD 2 containing Robert Folk&#x27;s additional music.
==Sequels and spin-offs==
A sequel, &quot;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&quot;, was released in 1996. A second sequel, &quot;Tremors 3: Back to Perfection&quot;, was released in 2001, followed by a prequel, &quot;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&quot; in 2004. These three sequels were all made with direct involvement from S. S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, and Ron Underwood at Stampede Entertainment. Following an 11-year gap, &quot;Tremors 5: Bloodlines&quot; was released in 2015, with the franchise&#x27;s sixth inclusion, &quot;&quot;, in 2018. These two films were made by Universal 1440 Entertainment without any involvement from Stampede Entertainment. All Tremors sequels thus far have been released direct-to-video without a theatrical release, though &quot;Tremors 2: Aftershocks&quot; did receive a brief limited theatrical run. Another direct-to-video sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released in October 2020.

In 2003, the franchise spawned a television show titled &quot;&quot;. The show aired in 2003 on the Syfy Channel but was canceled after one season. A 60-minute pilot for a second television series also titled &quot;Tremors&quot; was filmed in 2017, but no further episodes of this show were ever filmed.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm&quot;, an episode of the second season of the animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, features a large worm known as the &quot;Alaskan bull worm&quot;; the worm is defeated when it tumbles off a cliff, similar to the death of the final graboid in &quot;Tremors&quot;.
* &quot;Tremors&quot; is one of several monster films referred to in James Gunn&#x27;s 2006 horror-comedy &quot;Slither&quot;, as the high school depicted in the movie is named the &quot;Earl Bassett Community School&quot;, a nod to Fred Ward&#x27;s character from the first two &quot;Tremors&quot; entries.
* &quot;&quot;&#x27;s water monster enemy called the Kaernk (or Lurky among developer Frictional Games&#x27; employees) was slightly inspired by the creature in &quot;Tremors&quot;, as revealed in the developer commentary for the game, &quot;Tremors&quot; was Frictional Games employee Thomas Grip&#x27;s favorite film when he was a child.
* On March 21, 2012, the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; story &quot;Shaken and awakened in Wisconsin&quot; jokingly blamed the filming of a &quot;&quot;Tremors&quot; remake&quot; as the cause for unidentified loud booming noises.
*&quot;Bad Apple!&quot;, a 2013 episode of the superhero comedy series &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, features a scene of a giant underground worm attacking a desert farm which series co-creator Christian Jacobs noted was an homage to &quot;Tremors&quot;, with some shots mirroring those in the original film.

<doc id="433417" wikidata="Q7079597" url="?curid=433417" title="Official party status">
<text>Official party status refers to the Westminster practice which is officially used in the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures of recognizing parliamentary caucuses of political parties. In official documents, this is sometimes referred to as being a recognized party ().

==History==
Traditionally in Westminster-style parliaments, the only non-governmental member other than the speaker with a recognised status is the Leader of the Opposition. This would be the member who had the widest support among opposition MPs, who would take the lead in questioning the government during parliamentary debates, and who would traditionally be called upon by the King or Governor to attempt to form a government if the previous government lost the confidence of the House. As political parties became more formalized in the 20th century, some Westminster parliaments (particularly in Canada, but also elsewhere) began to recognize opposition political party caucuses as having a distinct role, where they would have their own opportunities to ask questions during parliamentary debates and have their own organizational budgets and offices within the parliament buildings.

Recognition in Parliament allows party caucuses certain parliamentary privileges. Generally official party status depends on winning a minimum number of seats (that is, the number of Members of Parliament or Members of the Legislative Assembly elected). The type of recognition and threshold needed to obtain it varies. However, the most coveted privileges are funding for party research offices and the right to ask questions during Question Period.

At the federal level in Canada, the idea of recognizing parties for official status started in 1963. Prior to this, the only opposition recognition was that of the Leader of the Opposition, effectively limiting &quot;official status&quot; to the Government and the largest Opposition party. It was not until 1970 that the Elections Act was amended to allow parties to register and thus have their party name on the ballot.

Most of the rules governing official party status are not laws, but are internal rules governing the legislatures. Therefore, the members of a legislature may, if they choose, pass a motion to dispense with the rules and grant official status to parties that would otherwise fail to qualify. There are many examples of this practice in multiple areas.

==Requirements for official party status==
Sometimes, the requirements for official party status are set out either in a law or in the parliament&#x27;s Rules of Procedure. These rules may usually be changed or waived by a vote of the House (for instance, to allow some or all official party privileges to a party that does not meet the minimum requirements set out in the Rules).

==Special cases==
===House of Commons===
Under the Canadian War Service Voting Regulations, 1944, membership standings in the House of Commons of eight or more were used to qualify leaders to appoint scrutineers for the special returning offices.

Since the early 1950s, parties other than the government and official opposition had been granted limited rights by a series of rulings in the House of Commons. Following an amendment to the Senate and House of Commons Act in 1963, the leaders of parties with twelve or more recognized members in the House of Commons began to be paid an additional stipend above that paid to all members of the House of Commons. Such recognized parties have also received research funding since 1968.

In 2001, the Speaker, Peter Milliken, ruled against full party recognition for the Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative (PC/DR) Coalition, which had been formed by the 12 members of the recognized PC Party and 8 independent members of the Democratic Representative Caucus, who had left the larger Canadian Alliance caucus. Milliken identified the features of a recognized party as having 12 or more members, appointing slate of House officers as official spokespeople, and working as a cohesive unit under the same banner but noted the practice related to the recognition of parties rather than parliamentary groups. The Speaker could not grant the PC/DR Coalition full party recognition because the group disavowed the title of being a party.

A party must have at least 12 seats to be recognized as an official party in the House of Commons. Recognition means that the party will get time to ask questions during question period, and money for research and staff (both proportional to the number of seats).

===Senate===
In the Senate, a group must have nine seats to be recognized. If the group was registered by Elections Canada in the last 15 years, it is called a recognized party. Otherwise, it is called a recognized parliamentary group, as is the case of the Independent Senators Group, which has been granted some privileges like those of a party.

Prior to 2017, when the Senate adopted a rules amendments to recognize parliamentary groups not affiliated with a political party, the Senate used political party recognition rules first adopted in 2002. The 2002 rules defined a recognized party as having five or more members in the Senate and required that the party be registered by Election Canada at the time of initial recognition. However, once the party was recognized in the Senate, it could retain its status even if it became deregistered, so long as it kept at least five members. In response to a question in an earlier debate about third political party recognition, Jack Austin, at the time the chair of the Senate Rules Committee, stated that the number of five was chosen as a proportional equivalent to the House of Commons 12-member rule.

The second part of the 2002 rule meant that the rump Progressive Conservative caucus in the Senate would have been able to qualify for official status after the rest of that party merged into the Conservative Party except that the initial PC caucus in 2004 after the merger only had three members.

===Alberta===
In the general elections of 1997, 2001, and 2008, the Alberta New Democratic Party (NDP) failed to win the requisite four seats to gain official party status in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Nevertheless, the governing Progressive Conservatives (PCs) granted party status to the NDP after each election.

===British Columbia===
After the 2001 general election, new B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell, leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, was criticized for his decision not to grant official party status to the NDP. It was the only opposition party in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia but it had won only two of 79 seats in the last election.

Since the 2013 election, the Green Party of British Columbia has held their first seat as their then-leader Andrew Weaver was elected in Oak Bay-Gordon Head district. After the 2017 election, Weaver was re-elected and they gained two more seats, thus overall had three seats when the minimum for official party status was four. However, after the party entered a confidence and supply agreement with the New Democratic Party to allow the NDP to form government, it was granted official party status with reduced funding. The Legislative Assembly still recognized the Greens as an official party, after the agreement ended, retaining the threshold for official status at 2 seats.

===New Brunswick===
In New Brunswick, parties require 5 seats or 20% of the popular vote to get official party status. However, parties with one to four seats have been allowed time in Question Period with consent of other parties. The Liberals won all 58 seats in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in 1987. The government allowed the Progressive Conservative Party, which won the second most votes collectively in the election, to submit written questions to ministers during Question Period.

===Ontario===
Following the 1999 Ontario general election, the Ontario New Democratic Party fell to nine seats in the Ontario Legislative Assembly, down from 17 in 1995. The rules at the time of the election called for parties to hold 12 seats to maintain party status. Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris, citing the reduction in seats from 130 to 103 (-20.76%) between elections, subsequently lowered the required number of seats for official party status from 12 to 8 (33 1/3%). The mathematically corresponding cut would therefore have been from 12 seats to 9 seats (25%, slightly higher than the seat reduction) or 10 seats (16 2/3%, slightly lower). In the 2019 fall economic statement, Doug Ford&#x27;s government changed the rules to 10% of the total number of seats in the Assembly, so it is currently set at 12.

In the 2003 election, the New Democrats won only seven seats in the Ontario Legislative Assembly. The new Liberal government refused to accord official party status to the NDP, with Premier Dalton McGuinty instead offering the NDP additional funding in return for accepting their status as independents; NDP leader Howard Hampton refused and disrupted the throne speech in protest. MPP Marilyn Churley threatened to change her surname legally to &quot;Churley-NDP&quot; so that the Speaker would be forced to say NDP when recognizing her in the House (a non-official party loses the right to have its members addressed in the Legislature by party affiliation). The PCs&#x27; Bill Murdoch also considered joining the NDP caucus to help them make official status. Andrea Horwath&#x27;s by-election win in May 2004 regained official party status for the NDP.

After Churley resigned to run in the 2006 federal election, bringing the party to only seven members again, the government decided to allow the NDP to retain official status pending the results of the by-election to replace her, which the NDP won.

In the 2018 Ontario general election, the Liberals dropped from a majority government of 55 seats to 7 seats, one seat fewer than official party status. (The legislature expanded to 124 members in this election.) The Green Party of Ontario also elected its first member, leader Mike Schreiner, at Guelph, in 2018 and similarly lacks official party status.

===Quebec===
In 1989, the Equality Party won four seats in the National Assembly of Quebec (eight seats short of the total needed for official status). Although it did not receive official party status, its members were granted some of the privileges of an official party: their seats in the Assembly were placed together, as were their offices in the Parliament Building. They were also granted a limited number of opportunities to ask questions during Question Period, at the Speaker&#x27;s discretion. The party had no success in subsequent elections, and stopped organizing after the 2003 election. This precedent was followed when Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) elected four members in 2003 and seven members in 2008. However, when ADQ merged into the newly formed Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) and the seven former ADQ MNAs joined with two former Parti Québécois (PQ) members in January 2012 to form the CAQ caucus, the governing Liberals and opposition PQ refused to grant any status to the new party, requiring all nine members to sit as independents.

In the 2018 Quebec general election, the PQ, which was the outgoing Official Opposition party, fell from 28 to 10 seats (and below 20% of the popular vote), thus falling below the threshold of official party status. Québec solidaire (QS) rose from 3 to 10 seats but did not reach the threshold of 12 to gain official party status. However, before the National Assembly convened, all political parties agreed to give the PQ and QS the status of official parties in the assembly.

==Registered party==
Official party status is not to be confused with being a &quot;registered party&quot;. A political party (even if it has no parliamentary seats) may register with Elections Canada or a provincial electoral authority. Doing so allows the political party to run candidates for office during elections, have their candidates&#x27; party affiliation identified on the ballot, issue tax receipts for donations, and spend money on advertising and campaigning during election campaigns. In return, the party must obey campaign spending and donation limits, disclose the source of large donations, and obey various election laws.

<text>The Rock Bottom Remainders, also known as the Remainders, was an American rock charity supergroup consisting of popular published writers, most of them also amateur musicians. The band took its self-mocking name from the publishing term &quot;remaindered book&quot;, a term for books that are no longer selling well and whose remaining unsold copies are liquidated by the publisher at greatly reduced prices. Their performances collectively raised $2 million for charity from their concerts.

Band members included Dave Barry, Stephen King, Amy Tan, Sam Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Joel Selvin, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Robert Fulghum, Matt Groening, Tad Bartimus, Greg Iles, Aron Ralston and honorary member Maya Angelou among others, as well as professional musicians such as multi-instrumentalist (and author) Al Kooper, drummer Josh Kelly, guitarist Roger McGuinn and saxophonist Erasmo Paulo. Founder Kathi Kamen Goldmark died on May 24, 2012, and the group disbanded a month later, following a memorial concert in her honor.

==History==
The Remainders was founded by Kathi Kamen Goldmark in 1992. Goldmark was then a musician whose day job was in book publicity. Through this, she met many prolific authors. One day while driving one of the authors around, she hit upon the idea of starting a band with them. It stuck. The Remainders&#x27; first performance was in 1992 at the American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, California. A review of the concert in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to it as &quot;the most heavily promoted musical debut since The Monkees.&quot;

In his memoir &quot;On Writing&quot;, Stephen King described the Remainders&#x27; performances as energetic if sloppy due to the limited music skill of himself and some other writers, and perhaps reminiscent of a bar band when augmented by a few professional musicians.: &#x27;...with a couple of “ringer” musicians on sax and drums (plus, in the early days, our musical guru, Al Kooper, at the heart of the group), we sounded pretty good. You’d pay to hear us. Not a lot, not U2 or E Street Band prices, but maybe what the oldtimers call “roadhouse money.&quot;&#x27; Dave Barry later joked &quot;We played music by what I call the Rumor Method, wherein from time to time an alarming rumor went around the band: &quot;There might have been a chord change&quot;. This prompted everybody to change to a new chord. Although not necessarily the &quot;same&quot; new chord.&quot;

The Remainders also played at the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1995.

In April 2010, they began the Wordstock Tour presented by the Pearson Foundation and We Give Books, benefiting the children and schools of Haiti.

The Remainders gave their last concert on June 23, 2012, at the annual conference of the American Library Association in Anaheim, where they played their first concert 20 years before. The event, co-sponsored by ProQuest, raised money for library and information science scholarships.

The Remainders last performed together on the August 6, 2012, episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, on which both Stephen King and Dave Barry were guests (although the segment was taped in June 2012 when the band was in town for the ALA concert).

In September 2014, it was announced that the Remainders would reunite to perform at the Tucson Festival of Books in March 2015. On March 15, 2015, the band&#x27;s reunion was referenced in Merl Reagle&#x27;s syndicated Sunday crossword puzzle. Titled &quot;Book Notes,&quot; the crossword included the band&#x27;s name and several puns using names of writers who were members.

<text>Financial services are economic services tied to finance provided by financial institutions. Financial services encompass a broad range of service sector activities, especially as concerns financial management and consumer finance. 

The finance industry in its most common sense concerns commercial banks that provide market liquidity, risk instruments, and brokerage for large public companies and multinational corporations at a macroeconomic scale that impacts domestic politics and foreign relations. The extragovernmental power and scale of the finance industry remains an ongoing controversy in many industrialized Western economies, as seen in the American Occupy Wall Street civil protest movement of 2011.

Styles of financial institution include credit union, bank, savings and loan association, trust company, building society, brokerage firm, payment processor, many types of broker, and some government-sponsored enterprise.

Financial services include accountancy, investment banking, investment management, and personal asset management. 

Financial products include insurance, credit cards, mortgage loans, and pension funds. 


== History ==
The term &quot;financial services&quot; became more prevalent in the United States partly as a result of the GrammLeachBliley Act of the late 1990s, which enabled different types of companies operating in the U.S. financial services industry at that time to merge.

Companies usually have two distinct approaches to this new type of business. One approach would be a bank that simply buys an insurance company or an investment bank, keeps the original brands of the acquired firm, and adds the acquisition to its holding company simply to diversify its earnings. Outside the U.S. (e.g. Japan), non-financial services companies are permitted within the holding company. In this scenario, each company still looks independent and has its own customers, etc. In the other style, a bank would simply create its own insurance division or brokerage division and attempt to sell those products to its own existing customers, with incentives for combining all things with one company.

== Relationship to the government ==
The financial sector is traditionally among those to receive government support in times of widespread economic crisis. Such bailouts, however, enjoy less public support than those for other industries.

== Banks ==
=== Commercial banking services ===

A commercial bank is what is commonly referred to as simply a bank. The term &quot;commercial&quot; is used to distinguish it from an investment bank, a type of financial services entity which instead of lending money directly to a business, helps businesses raise money from other firms in the form of bonds (debt) or share capital (equity).

The primary operations of commercial banks include:
* Keeping money safe while also allowing withdrawals when needed
* Issuance of chequebooks so that bills can be paid and other kinds of payments can be delivered by the post
* Provide personal loans, commercial loans, and mortgage loans (typically loans to purchase a home, property or business)
* Issuance of credit cards, processing of credit card transactions and billing
* Issuance of debit cards for use as a substitute for cheques
* Allow financial transactions at branches or by using automatic teller machines (ATMs)
* Provide wire transfers of funds and electronic fund transfers between banks
* Facilitation of standing orders and direct debits, so payments for bills can be made automatically
* Provide overdraft agreements for the temporary advancement of the bank&#x27;s own money to meet the monthly spending commitments of a customer in their current account.
* Provide internet banking system to facilitate customers to view and operate their respective accounts through the internet.
* Provide charge card advances of the bank&#x27;s own money for customers wishing to settle credit advances monthly.
* Provide a check guaranteed by the bank itself and prepaid by the customer, such as a cashier&#x27;s check or certified check.
* Notary service for financial and other documents
* Accepting deposits from customers and providing credit facilities to them.
* Sell investment products like mutual funds Etc.
The United States is the largest commercial banking services location.

*Broker Services – Buy and sell securities on behalf of their clients (sometimes may involve financial consulting as well). 
*Prime brokerage – An exclusive type of bundled broker service specifically meant to service the needs of hedge funds. 
*Private banking – Private banks provide banking services exclusively to high-net-worth individuals. Many financial services firms require a person or family to have a certain minimum net worth to qualify for private banking service.

New York City and London are the largest centers of investment banking services. NYC is dominated by U.S. domestic business, while in London international business and commerce make up a significant portion of investment banking activity.

== Foreign exchange services ==

*Currency exchange – where clients can purchase and sell foreign currency banknotes.
*Wire transfer – where clients can send funds to international banks abroad.

London handled 36.7% of global currency transactions – an average daily turnover of US$1.85 trillion – with more US dollars traded in London than New York, and more Euros traded than in every other city in Europe combined.

== Investment services ==
*Collective investment fund – A fund that acts as an investment pool so investors can put money into a fund that will reinvest it into a variety of securities based upon their common, outlined investment goal. 
*Investment Advisory Offices – Run by registered investment advisors who advise clients in financial planning and invest their money.
*Hedge fund management – Hedge funds often employ the services of &quot;prime brokerage&quot; divisions at major investment banks to execute their trades.
*Private equity – Private equity funds are typically closed-end funds, which usually take controlling equity stakes in businesses that are either private or taken private once acquired. Private equity funds often use leveraged buyouts (LBOs) to acquire the firms in which they invest. The most successful private equity funds can generate returns significantly higher than provided by the equity markets.
*Venture capital – Private equity capital typically provided by professional, outside investors to new, high-growth-potential companies in the interest of taking the company to an IPO or trade sale of the business. Startup companies are typically fueled by an angel investor.
*Family office – Investment and wealth management firm that handles a wealthy family or small group of wealthy individuals with financial plans tailored to their needs. Similar to private banking. 
*Advisory services – These firms (or departments within a larger entity) service clients with financial advisers who serve as both, a broker as well as a financial consultant. 
*Custody services – the safe-keeping and processing of the world&#x27;s securities trades and servicing the associated portfolios. Assets under custody in the world are approximately US$100 trillion.
New York City is the largest center of investment services, followed by London.

== Insurance ==
*Insurance brokerage – Insurance brokers shop for insurance (generally corporate property and casualty insurance) on behalf of customers. Recently several websites have been created to give consumers basic price comparisons for services such as insurance, causing controversy within the industry.
*Insurance underwriting – Personal lines insurance underwriters actually underwrite insurance for individuals, a service still offered primarily through agents, insurance brokers, and stock brokers. Underwriters may also offer similar commercial lines of coverage for businesses. Activities include insurance and annuities, life insurance, retirement insurance, health insurance, and property insurance and casualty insurance.

*Market Maker - Company that quotes both buy and sell prices in tradable assets in order to create liquidity within the marketplace.
*Proprietary trading firms - Not always, but frequently overlapping as market makers, these firms trade a variety of financial instruments with the firms own money to profit for itself (unlike hedge funds, whom use clients money to invest).
*Conglomerates – A financial services company, such as a universal bank, that is active in more than one sector of the financial services market e.g. life insurance, general insurance, health insurance, asset management, retail banking, wholesale banking, investment banking, etc. A key rationale for the existence of such businesses is the existence of diversification benefits that are present when different types of businesses are aggregated. As a consequence, economic capital for a conglomerate is usually substantially less than economic capital is for the sum of its parts.
*Debt resolution – A consumer service that assists individuals that have too much debt to pay off as requested, but do not want to file bankruptcy and wish to pay off their debts owed. This debt can be accrued in various ways including but not limited to personal loans, credit cards, or in some cases merchant accounts.

== Financial exports ==

A financial export is a financial service provided by a domestic firm (regardless of ownership) to a foreign firm or individual. While financial services such as banking, insurance, and investment management are often seen as domestic services, an increasing proportion of financial services are now being handled abroad, in other financial centres, for a variety of reasons. Some smaller financial centres, such as Bermuda, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, lack sufficient size for a domestic financial services sector and have developed a role providing services to non-residents as offshore financial centres. The increasing competitiveness of financial services has meant that some countries, such as Japan, which were once self-sufficient, have increasingly imported financial services.

The leading financial exporter, in terms of exports less imports, is the United Kingdom, which had $95 billion of financial exports in 2014. The UK&#x27;s position is helped by both unique institutions (such as Lloyd&#x27;s of London for insurance, the Baltic Exchange for shipping etc.) and an environment that attracts foreign firms; many international corporations have global or regional headquarters in the London and are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and many banks and other financial institutions operate there or in Edinburgh.

<text>Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel, 9th Earl of Surrey (1346 – 21 September 1397) was an English medieval nobleman and military commander.

==Lineage==
Born in 1346, he was the son of Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster. He succeeded his father to the title of Earl of Arundel on 24 January 1376.

His brother was Thomas Arundel, the Bishop of Ely from 1374 to 1388, Archbishop of York from 1388 to 1397, and Archbishop of Canterbury in 1397 and from 1399 until his death in 1414.

At the coronation of Richard II, Richard Fitzalan carried the crown.

==Admiral==
In 1377, Richard Fitzalan held the title of Admiral of the North and West. In this capacity, he attacked Harfleur at Whitsun 1378, but was forced to return to his ships by the defenders. Later, he and John of Gaunt attempted to seize Saint-Malo but were unsuccessful.

===Power struggle===
Fitzalan was closely aligned with Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, who was an uncle of King Richard II. Thomas was opposed to Richard II&#x27;s desire for peace with France in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and a power struggle ensued between him and Gloucester. In late 1386, Gloucester forced King Richard II to name himself and Richard Fitzalan to the King&#x27;s Council. This Council was to all intents and purposes a Regency Council for Richard II. However, Richard limited the duration of the Council&#x27;s powers to one year.

===Knight of the Garter===
In 1386, Richard II named Richard Fitzalan Admiral of England and made him a Knight of the Garter. As Admiral of England, he defeated a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off Margate in March 1387, along with Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham.

==New favourites==
In August 1387, the King dismissed Gloucester and Fitzalan from the Council and replaced them with his favourites—including the Archbishop of York, Alexander Neville; the Duke of Ireland, Robert de Vere; Michael de la Pole; the Earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, who was the Chief Justice; and the former Mayor of London Nicholas Brembre.

==Radcot Bridge==
The King summoned Gloucester and Fitzalan to a meeting. However, instead of coming, they raised troops and defeated the new Council at Radcot Bridge on 22 December 1387. During that battle, they took the favourites prisoner. The next year, the Merciless Parliament condemned the favourites.

Fitzalan was one of the Lords Appellant who accused and condemned Richard II&#x27;s favourites. He made himself particularly odious to the King by refusing, along with Gloucester, to spare the life of Sir Simon de Burley who had been condemned by the Merciless Parliament. This was even after the queen, Anne of Bohemia, went down on her knees before them to beg for mercy. King Richard never forgave this humiliation and planned and waited for his moment of revenge.

Arundel was named Governor of Brest in 1388.

===Opposed to peace===
Peace was concluded with France in 1389. However, Richard Fitzalan followed Gloucester&#x27;s lead and stated that he would never agree with the peace that had been concluded.

==Marriage and children==
Arundel married twice.

His first wife was Elizabeth de Bohun, daughter of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton and Elizabeth de Badlesmere. They married around 28 September 1359 and had seven children:
* Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel, married 26 November 1405, Beatrice, Countess of Arundel, illegitimate daughter of King John I of Portugal and Inês Pires, members of the Royal House of Aviz.
* Lady Eleanor Fitzalan (c. 1365 – 1375), on 28 October 1371, at the age of about six, married Robert de Ufford. Died childless.
* Elizabeth Fitzalan (c. 1366 – 8 July 1425), married first William Montacute (before December 1378); no issue. Married second, in 1384, Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk; had issue. Married third, before August 1401, Sir Robert Goushill of Hoveringham; had issue. Married fourth, before 1411, Sir Gerard Usflete, son of Sir Gerard Usflete (d.1406), MP, without issue.
* Joan FitzAlan (1375 – 14 November 1435), who married William Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny. They had a son, Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester and a daughter Joan de Beauchamp, wife of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormonde.
* Alice Fitzalan (1378 – before October 1415), married before March 1392, John Charleton, 4th Baron Cherleton. (not mentioned as an heir of Thomas in the &quot;Complete Peerage&quot;). Had an affair with Cardinal Henry Beaufort, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Jane Beaufort.
* Margaret Fitzalan, who married Sir Rowland Lenthall; by whom she had two sons.
* William (or Richard) Fitzalan

After the death of his first wife in 1385, Arundel married Philippa Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. Her mother was Philippa Plantagenet, the only daughter of Lionel of Antwerp and thus a granddaughter of Edward III. They had one child together, a short-lived son named John FitzAlan (b. ca 1394, d. ca 1397). (Alison Weir, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Royal Families&quot;, page 98).

== Death and succession ==
By 1394, Arundel was again a member of the royal council, and was involved in a quarrel with John of Gaunt, whom he accused in the parliament of that year. Fitzalan further antagonized the King by arriving late for the queen&#x27;s funeral. Richard II, in a rage, snatched a wand and struck Fitzalan in the face and drew blood. Shortly after that, the King feigned a reconciliation but he was only biding his time for the right moment to strike.

Arundel was persuaded by his brother Thomas to surrender himself and to trust the king&#x27;s clemency. On 12 July 1397, Richard was arrested for his opposition to Richard II, as well as plotting with Gloucester to imprison the king. He stood trial at Westminster and was attainted. He was beheaded on 21 September 1397 and was buried in the church of the Augustin Friars, near Old Broad Street, London. Tradition holds that his final words were said to the executioner, &quot;Torment me not long, strike off my head in one blow&quot;.

In October 1400, the attainder was reversed, and Richard&#x27;s son Thomas succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates and honours.

<text>International courts are formed by treaties between nations, or by an international organization such as the United Nations – and include &quot;ad hoc&quot; tribunals and permanent institutions but exclude any courts arising purely under national authority.

== Definition ==
An international court is an international organization, or a body of an international organization, that hears cases in which one party may be a state or international organization (or body thereof), and which is composed of independent judges who follow predetermined rules of procedure to issue binding decisions on the basis of international law.

== History ==
Early examples of international courts include the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals established in the aftermath of World War II. Several such international courts are presently located in The Hague in the Netherlands, most importantly the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Further international courts exist elsewhere, usually with their jurisdiction restricted to a particular country, a global or regional intergovernmental or supranational organisation, or historic issue, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda that deals with the genocide in Rwanda. 

In addition to international tribunals created to address crimes committed during genocides and civil war, &quot;ad hoc&quot; courts and tribunals combining international and domestic strategies have also been established on a situational basis. Examples of these &quot;hybrid tribunals&quot; are the Special Court for Sierra Leone, Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Special Panels of the Dili District Court in East Timor, and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.

== Privileges and immunities ==
Judges and high-level staff of such courts may be afforded diplomatic immunity if their governing authority allows.

<text>Gebr. Märklin &amp; Cie. GmbH or Märklin (stylized as ma̋rklín) (MÄRKLIN or MAERKLIN in capital letters) is a German toy company. The company was founded in 1859 and is based at Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg. Although it originally specialised in doll house accessories, today it is best known for model railways and technical toys. In some parts of Germany and in Sweden, the company&#x27;s name is almost synonymous with model railways.

== History ==


Märklin was founded by in 1859. After his death in 1866, early in the company&#x27;s life, his wife Caroline Märklin lead the business until 1888.

 and took over the company from her, and Märklin released its first wind-up train with carriages that ran on standardised track in 1891, noting that railway toys had the potential to follow the common practice of doll&#x27;s houses, in which the initial purchase would be enhanced and expanded with more accessories for years after the initial purchase. To this end, Märklin offered additional rolling stock and track with which to expand its boxed sets.

Märklin is responsible for the creation of several popular model railway gauges or scale, noteworthy exceptions being N scale and Wide gauge. In 1891, Märklin defined gauges 1-5 as standards for toy trains and presented them at the Leipzig Toy Fair. They soon became international standards. Märklin followed with O gauge (by some accounts as early as 1895 or as late as 1901), HO scale in 1935, and the diminutive Z scale, 1:220, in 1972  — smallest in the world for decades  — under the name Mini-Club (the scale of Z was assigned after the product line was introduced). Mini-Club was developed as Märklin&#x27;s answer to Arnold Rapido&#x27;s introduction of N gauge.

Today, Märklin manufactures and markets trains and accessories in Gauge 1, HO scale, and Z scale. In 1994 Märklin acquired the Nuremberg based model train manufacturer Trix producing DC-operated HO and N scale. Märklin&#x27;s older trains are considered highly collectible, and Märklin&#x27;s current offerings enjoy premium status among hobbyists.

Although Märklin is best known for its trains, from 1914 to 1999, the company produced mechanical construction sets similar to Meccano and Erector. Between 1967 and 1982, the company produced a slotcar system called Märklin Sprint. Märklin also produced numerous other toys over the years, including lithographed tinplate toy automobiles and boats. From 1909 until well into the 1950s they sold a range of alcohol-burning model steam engines. These were very educational toys, and could be linked to dynamos to provide lighting. In the late 1990s, Märklin purchased the assets of Trix in January 1997, thus adding N gauge to their scale lineup.

On 11 May 2006, the company, which had until then been owned by the three families Märklin, Friz and Safft, was sold to the British investment group Kingsbridge Capital, with the support of the employees. The purchase price was approximately $38 million. At the time, Märklin had approximately $70.5 million in debt, as a result of several years of slumping sales.

In 2007, the company expanded its product offering by buying the remaining assets of the bankrupt firm, Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk, who owned the LGB brand and product line of G scale model railways.

On 4 February 2009 Märklin filed for insolvency at the Göppingen municipal court. A year and a day later, on 5 February 2010, Märklin announced a return to profitability.

In 2013 Märklin was acquired by the Simba Dickie Group.

On July 22, 2013 the managing director Stefan Löbich left Märklin.

During the 2020-2021 COVID pandemic, Märklin saw an upswing in sales, leading to shortages of parts such as rails, and even found they had to hire new employees and apprentices to meet the demand.

== The Märklin System ==

The Märklin system is the technique of using a third rail concealed in the roadbed with only small studs protruding through the ties of the track. The two outer rails are connected electrically. This provides the simplified wiring enjoyed by larger gauges—such as for reverse loops—without seriously detracting from the realism of the track because only two of the rails are visible. Because the two outer rails are not electrically isolated from each other, however, some do not consider Märklin&#x27;s system to be a true three-rail system. However, older sections of &#x27;M-Track&#x27; do have an actual conductor rail rather than studs. This older system is compatible with newer trains, although the reduced clearance for the pick-up shoe can sometimes cause running difficulties.

The Märklin system has some incompatibility with other manufacturers&#x27; H0 trains. Because the wheels on Märklin&#x27;s cars are not insulated, it causes shorts if its cars are used on other manufacturers&#x27; H0 track without changing the wheels. The profile of the wheels are also different (see also NEM 340). Additionally, for many years Märklin was the only brand that used AC for its H0 scale trains, although in the 60s Fleischmann, HAG, Röwa, Roco and others started producing trains for the Märklin system. Some people convert Märklin locomotives to DC for use on DC layouts, and by buying HAMO, Märklin had begun offering a line of DC locomotives as well, first under the name of HAMO and, after buying Trix, under that name.

=== Märklin Digital ===

Märklin was among the early model railway companies to introduce a digital train-control system. The Märklin Digital system for Märklin&#x27;s 3-rail AC train layouts was introduced in 1984 using Motorola microchips. A few years later the system developed jointly by Märklin, Lenz GmbH and Arnold GmbH was introduced for 2-rail DC locomotives. The system was used by Arnold in their N scale locomotives. While the first digital Z locomotives were announced in the late 1990s, the plans were cancelled rapidly due to heat dissipation problems in small locomotives. This digital control system was later developed into DCC (Digital Command Control). Märklin&#x27;s digital system for 3 rail track is not directly compatible with DCC (Digital Command Control) although the systems are electrically compatible and many controllers can work both systems. Today Märklin offers DCC compatible locomotives for its 2-rail DC Trix brand.

== Products and collectibles ==

Over the years, the Märklin marque became valuable to model train collectors, some of the very early models fetching impressive prices at auction. 
The range of products is extensive, and collectors also pay attention to the packaging that was used for the products. Collectors also look for rare and hard to find models, such as the SBB Crocodile model, the AMTRAK ICE model, the Western Pacific &#x27;California Zephyr&#x27; model, and the famous Union Pacific Big Boy model, among many others.

The Märklin toy company systematically included a print run number on almost all printed material, including the boxes in which their products shipped. These print run numbers indicate the printer and also the month and year of printing. This is useful for dating an item that is known to be associated with some printed material. The second group of digits indicates the catalogue number. The last set of numeric digits in the print run number indicates the month and year that the item was printed. The last group of letters identifies the printer.

&quot;Koll&#x27;s Preiskatalog&quot; issued by Joachim Koll in German lists all 00/H0 models and provides price estimates.
Märklin&#x27;s products are mainly German (DB) model trains. However, Märklin also produces Swiss (SBB), Dutch (NS), American (various independent railways from the Golden Age of American trains), and various other model trains from around the world.

In January 2005, the Märklin museum in Göppingen, Germany, was burgled and more than 100 pieces, with an estimated value of more than 1 million Euros, were stolen. The items, which included one-of-a-kind prototypes along with pieces that dated back to 1891, were recovered in March 2005.

The third game in the Ticket to Ride board game series, released in 2006, was named &quot;Märklin&quot; in their honour.

In 2010 Märklin announced the release of its sixth model of the Russian Railways, the Russian Velaro SAPSAN high speed train. The model is based upon the DB ICE 3MF model which began to be sold in 2008. The first SŽD railways Russian HO models was a Transsiberian &quot;100 ЛеТ Транссибирской&quot; (&quot;100 Let Transsibirskoy&quot;) tanker wagon, a rare limited edition from 1991, two locomotives, steam locomotive Series TЭ-5293 (Märklin ref. 34159), a second version of the same Cold War military reserve steam locomotive TЭ-3915 (Märklin ref. 37159) and two SŽD car goods wagon sets (Märklin ref. 47897 and ref. 47899).

=== Nominal size H0 ===

The largest segment of product range and sales is nominal size H0, with a scale of 1:87 and an H0 track. Märklin introduced it in 1935, about half a year later than Trix, and today it is the most common size worldwide. The company is market leader in H0 in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), having a market-share of approximately 50 per cent. So, in the area of H0 tracks, there are two categories of similar size - the track system with two conductors, produced by multiple companies on the one side, the middle-conductor track system dominated by Märklin on the other. Also, in this area Märklin is the only company to offer a complete assortment of goods - the range in this track size consists of a huge variety of rolling stock, tracks, analog as well as digital control systems, trolley systems and other accessory parts.

<doc id="433440" wikidata="Q378878" url="?curid=433440" title="Mitch Albom">
<text>Mitchell David Albom (born May 23, 1958) is an American author, journalist, and musician. As of 2021, he has sold 40 million books worldwide. Having achieved national recognition for sports writing in his early career, he turned to writing inspirational stories and themes—a preeminent early one being &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;.

==Early life==
Albom was born on May 23, 1958, in Passaic, New Jersey; he lived in Buffalo, New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey, just outside of Philadelphia. He is of Jewish descent.

Albom earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in 1979 from Brandeis University. After forays into music and journalism, returned to academia to earn graduate master&#x27;s degrees in journalism (at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism), and business (from Columbia University Graduate School of Business). Albom paid his tuition in part through employment playing piano.

==Career==
===As a columnist===
While living in New York, Albom developed an interest in journalism. Still supporting himself by working nights in the music industry, he began to write during the day for the &quot;Queens Tribune&quot;, a weekly newspaper in Flushing, New York. His work there helped earn him entry into the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. To help pay his tuition he took work as a babysitter. In addition to nighttime piano playing, Albom took a part-time job with &quot;SPORT&quot; magazine. After graduation he freelanced as a sportswriter for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;GEO&quot;, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and covered Olympic sports events in Europeincluding track and field and lugepaying his own way for travel, and selling articles once he was there. In 1983, he was hired as a full-time feature writer for &quot;The Fort Lauderdale News and Sun Sentinel&quot;, and eventually promoted to columnist. In 1985, having won that year&#x27;s Associated Press Sports Editors award for best Sports News Story, Albom was hired as lead sports columnist for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; to replace Mike Downey, a popular columnist who had taken a job with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Albom&#x27;s sports column quickly became popular. In 1989, when the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Detroit News&quot; merged weekend publications, Albom was asked to add a weekly non-sports column to his duties. That column ran on Sundays in the &quot;Comment&quot; section and dealt with American life and values. It was eventually syndicated across the country. Both columns continue in the &quot;Detroit Free Press.&quot;

Many of his columns have been collected into anthology books including &quot;Live Albom I&quot; (Detroit Free Press, 1988), &quot;Live Albom II&quot; (Detroit Free Press, 1990), &quot;Live Albom III&quot; (Detroit Free Press, 1992), and &quot;Live Albom IV&quot; (Detroit Free Press, 1995).

Albom also serves as a contributing editor to &quot;Parade&quot; magazine. His column is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency.

====Game attendance error suspension====
In 2005, Albom and four editors were briefly suspended from the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; after Albom wrote a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an NCAA tournament game when in fact they were not. In a column printed in the April 3, 2005, edition, Albom described two former Michigan State University basketball players, both then in the NBA, attending an NCAA Final Four semifinal game on Saturday to cheer for their school. The players had told Albom they planned to attend, so Albom, filing on his normal Friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until Sunday (after the game was over) wrote that the players were there. But the players&#x27; plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; also suspended the four editors who had read the column and allowed it to go to print. Albom was in attendance at the game, but the columnist failed to check on the two players&#x27; presence. A later internal investigation found no other similar instances in Albom&#x27;s past columns, but did cite an editorial-wide problem of routinely using unattributed quotes from other sources. Carol Leigh Hutton, publisher of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; at the time of these events, later told Buzzfeed that she regretted the way it was handled. &quot;It was a stupid mistake that Mitch made that others failed to catch but not at all indicative of some problem that required the response we gave it. I allowed myself to believe that we were doing this highly credible, highly transparent thing, when really in hindsight what I think we were doing was acquiescing to people who were taking advantage of a stupid mistake.&quot;

===As an author===

As of 2021, Albom&#x27;s books had sold over 40 million copies worldwide.

====Sports volumes====
Albom&#x27;s first non-anthology book was &quot;Bo: Life, Laughs, and the Lessons of a College Football Legend&quot; (Warner Books), an autobiography of football coach Bo Schembechler co-written with the coach. The book was published in August 1989 and became Albom&#x27;s first &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Albom&#x27;s next book was &quot;Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream&quot;, a look into the starters on the University of Michigan men&#x27;s basketball team that reached the NCAA championship game as freshmen in 1992 and again as sophomores in 1993. The book was published in November 1993 and also became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

====&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;====
Albom&#x27;s breakthrough book came about after he was rotating the TV channels and viewed Morrie Schwartz&#x27;s interview with Ted Koppel on ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; in 1995, in which Schwartz, a sociology professor, spoke about living and dying with a terminal disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease). Albom, who was close to Schwartz during his college years at Brandeis University, felt guilty about not keeping in touch so he reconnected with his former professor, visiting him in suburban Boston and eventually coming every Tuesday for discussions about life and death. Albom, seeking a way to pay for Schwartz&#x27;s medical bills, sought out a publisher for a book about their visits. Although rejected by numerous publishing houses, Doubleday accepted the idea shortly before Schwartz&#x27;s death, and Albom was able to fulfill his wish to pay Schwartz&#x27;s bills.

&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, which chronicled Albom&#x27;s time spent with his professor, was published in 1997. The initial printing was 20,000 copies. As word of mouth grew, the book sales slowly increased and landed the book a brief appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, nudging the book onto the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in October 1997. It steadily climbed reaching the number-one position six months later. It remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 205 weeks. One of the top selling memoirs of all time, &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; has sold over 20 million copies and has been translated into 45 languages. On November 22, 2005, Albom was the sole and final guest on Ted Koppel&#x27;s farewell appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. Koppel had gotten to know Albom through his broadcasts with Morrie Schwartz, and the final program dealt with the legacy of those shows and Albom&#x27;s book.

Oprah Winfrey produced a television movie adaptation by the same name for ABC, starring Hank Azaria as Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. It was the most-watched TV movie of 1999 and won four Emmy Awards. (In 2000, at the Emmy Awards, Albom was personally thanked by actor Jack Lemmon during his acceptance speech for his Emmy for Best Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;, which would be Lemmon&#x27;s last major acting role.)

====&quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;====
After the success of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;, Albom&#x27;s follow-up was the fiction book &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; (Hyperion Books) which he published in September 2003. It was a fast success and again launched Albom onto the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; sold over 10 million copies in 38 territories and in 35 languages. In 2004, it became a television movie for ABC, starring Jon Voight, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Imperioli, and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Lloyd Kramer, the film was critically acclaimed and the most watched TV movie of the year, with 18.7 million viewers.

====&quot;For One More Day&quot;====
Albom&#x27;s second novel, &quot;For One More Day&quot; (Hyperion), was published in 2006. It is about Charley &quot;Chick&quot; Benetto, a retired baseball player who, facing the pain of unrealized dreams, alcoholism, divorce, and an estrangement from his grown daughter, returns to his childhood home and attempts suicide; there, he meets his long dead mother, who welcomes him as if nothing ever happened, and in this way, the book explores the question, &quot;What would you do if you had one more day with someone you&#x27;ve lost?&quot;.

The hardcover edition of &quot;For One More Day&quot; spent nine months on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list after debuting at the top spot, and reached No. 1 on the USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It has been translated into 26 languages. It was the first book to be sold by Starbucks in the launch of the Book Break Program in the fall of 2006.

On December 9, 2007, ABC television aired the 2-hour television event motion picture &quot;Oprah Winfrey Presents: Mitch Albom&#x27;s For One More Day&quot;, which starred Michael Imperioli and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance in the role of Posey Benetto. Albom has said his relationship with his own mother was largely behind the story of that book, and that several incidents in &quot;For One More Day&quot; are actual events from his childhood.

====&quot;Have a Little Faith&quot;====
&quot;Have a Little Faith&quot;, Albom&#x27;s first nonfiction book since &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;, was released on September 29, 2009, through Hyperion publishing, and recounts Albom&#x27;s experiences that led to him writing the eulogy for Albert L. Lewis, a rabbi from his hometown in New Jersey. The book is written in the same vein as &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;, in which the main character, Mitch, goes through several heartfelt conversations with the Rabbi in order to better know and understand the man that he would one day eulogize. Through this experience, Albom writes, his own sense of faith was reawakened leading him to make contact with Henry Covington, the African-American pastor of the &quot;I Am My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; church in Detroit, where Albom was then living. Covington, a past drug addict, dealer, and ex-convict, ministered to a congregation of largely homeless men and women in a church so poor that the roof leaked when it rained. From his relationships with these two very different men of faith, Albom writes about the difference faith can make in the world.

On November 27, 2011, ABC aired the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie based on the book.

====&quot;The Time Keeper&quot;====

====&quot;The First Phone Call from Heaven&quot;====
In 2013, Albom moved to a new publisher, HarperCollins, for the publication of his seventh book and fourth novel. In &quot;The First Phone Call From Heaven&quot;, the small town of Coldwater, Michigan, is thrust into the international spotlight when its citizens suddenly start receiving phone calls from deceased loved ones. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father recently released from prison, is determined to find the truth. The town is fictional and not the real Coldwater, Michigan, but Albom pays tribute to the real small town in the book&#x27;s acknowledgements. &quot;The First Phone Call from Heaven&quot; received starred reviews from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

====&quot;The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto&quot;====
Albom&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto&quot;, was published by HarperCollins in 2015. His longest book at almost 400 pages, it chronicles the life and mysterious death of the fictional musician Frankie Presto, as narrated by the voice of Music. An orphan born in a burning church in Spain in 1936, Frankie is blessed with musical ability: at nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat, his only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings. The Forrest Gump-like journey that follows takes him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll super stardom, meeting and working with musical greats (like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Little Richard, and The Beatles). Real musicians including Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis, Paul Stanley, Darlene Love, and Ingrid Michaelson, lent their names to first-person passages to the book, and an original 17-song soundtrack for the book was released by Republic Records four days before the book&#x27;s release. It featured original songs written and performed by Albom and other artists including Sawyer Fredericks, Mat Kearney, Ingrid Michaelson, John Pizzarelli, and James Brent, interpreting Frankie Presto&#x27;s &quot;greatest hits&quot;, along with such older favorites featured in the novel such as Tony Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; and Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;A House is Not a Home.&quot;

====&quot;The Next Person You Meet in Heaven&quot;====
A sequel to &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;, Albom&#x27;s novel &quot;The Next Person You Meet in Heaven&quot; tells the story of Eddie&#x27;s heavenly reunion with Annie, the little girl he saved on earth in the first book. The story strongly emphasizes on how lives and losses intersect, and that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a new beginning. The book debuted at the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

====&quot;Finding Chika&quot;====

This book marked Albom&#x27;s return to nonfiction for the first time in a decade. It is a memoir and a tribute to Chika, a young Haitian orphan who arrived at Albom&#x27;s Have Faith Haiti Orphanage in Port Au Prince before being diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor and dying two years later.

An excerpt was read by Albom on the new Lit Hub/Podglomerate Storybound (podcast), accompanied by an original score from musician Maiah Wynne.

====&quot;The Stranger in the Lifeboat&quot;====

Albom&#x27;s seventh novel, &quot;The Stranger in the Lifeboat&quot; was published on November 2, 2021, in the US by Harper, an imprint of Harpercollins, and by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown Book Group in the UK. The book became a #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller in its first week of sales.

==== &quot;The Little Liar&quot; ====
&quot;The Little Liar&quot; was published on November 14, 2023, by HarperCollins. The book peaked at #5 on the New York Times Best Sellers list on December 3, 2023. The book is historical fiction following Nico, an eleven-year-old boy during Germany&#x27;s occupation of Greece in World War II.

===As playwright===
On November 19, 2002, the stage version of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; opened Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre. Co-authored by Mitch Albom and Jeffrey Hatcher (&quot;Three Viewings&quot;) and directed by David Esbjornson (The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?). &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; starred Alvin Epstein (original Lucky in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;) as Morrie and Jon Tenny (&quot;The Heiress&quot;) as Mitch.

His follow-up to the stage adaptation of &quot;Tuesdays&quot; were two original comedies that premiered at the Purple Rose Theatre Company in Chelsea, Michigan, started by actor Jeff Daniels. &quot;Duck Hunter Shoots Angel (&quot;the Purple Rose&#x27;s highest grossing play as of 2008&quot;) &quot;and &quot;And the Winner Is&quot; have both been produced nationwide, the latter having its West Coast premiere at the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach, California.

The premiere of Albom&#x27;s &quot;Ernie&quot;, a play dedicated to the memory of famed Detroit Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell, occurred in April 2011 at the City Theatre in Detroit. In subsequent years the play travelled to theaters in Traverse City, East Lansing, and Grand Rapids. It has run for seven summer seasons as of 2017.

In the summer of 2016, Albom debuted his first musical at the City Theatre with &quot;HockeyThe Musical!&quot; A musical comedy with a book, original songs and parody lyrics written by Albom, &quot;HockeyThe Musical!&quot; follows five characters who work to convince God to spare hockey after concluding that the world has too many sports and one should be eliminated. An opening night review in The Detroit Free Press describe an &quot;audience roaring for most of the 90 minutes&quot;

===As musician===
Albom is an accomplished songwriter, pianist and lyricist. In 1992, he wrote the song &quot;Cookin&#x27; For Two&quot; for a television movie, &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot;, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The song was nominated for The CableACE Award. Albom has been featured on the cover of Making Music Magazine. He also co-wrote the song &quot;Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)&quot;, which was recorded by singer/songwriter Warren Zevon with David Letterman on backup vocals. The song was released as a single in Canada and will be adapted into a film by director Kevin Smith. He performed with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a band of writers that also featured Dave Barry, Stephen King, Ridley Pearson, Amy Tan, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Scott Turow from 1995 until the band dissolved in 2012 with the death of founder Kathi Goldmark. Their performances raised funds for various children&#x27;s literacy projects across the country.

In July 2013, Albom co-authored &quot;Hard Listening&quot; (Coliloquy, 2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders. The ebook combines essays, fiction, musings, candid email exchanges, and conversations, compromising photographs, audio, and video clips, and interactive quizzes to give readers a view into the private lives of the authors.

==Charity work==
&quot;The Dream Fund&quot;, established in 1989, provides a scholarship for disadvantaged children to study the arts. &quot;A Time to Help&quot; which started in 1998, is a Detroit volunteer group. &quot;S.A.Y. (Super All Year) Detroit&quot; is an umbrella program that funds shelters and cares for the homeless. It is now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that funds numerous homeless shelters throughout the Metro Detroit area.

In 1999, Albom was named National Hospice Organization&#x27;s Man of the Year.

His most recent effort, A Hole in the Roof Foundation, helps faith groups of different denominations who care for the homeless repair the spaces they use. Their first project was the I Am My Brother&#x27;s Keeper roof in the crumbling but vibrant Detroit church, completed in December 2009. The second project, completed in April 2010, was the rebuilding of the Caring and Sharing Mission and Orphanage. It is now called the Have Faith Haiti Mission &amp; Orphanage, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

Albom also directs the &quot;Have Faith Haiti Mission&quot;, a project whose stated objective is &quot;dedicated to the safety, education, health and spiritual development of Haiti&#x27;s impoverished children and orphans&quot;, incorporating language lessons and Christian prayer.

==Other activities==

During the Detroit newspaper strike of 1995–1997, Albom crossed the picket line and returned to work.

In February 2003, Albom was called to testify at the perjury trial of Chris Webber, member of the &quot;Fab Five&quot; of the University of Michigan&#x27;s basketball teams in the early 1990s, and subject of a book by Albom. Webber and three others players—the remainder of &quot;Fab Five&quot; were not implicated—were alleged to have received over $290,000 in improper loans from a man considered to be a booster of the University of Michigan, although the amounts were never verified. The loans were allegedly made to players and their families (the school being without alleged involvement or knowledge).

On October 22, 2007, Albom appeared with former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Tony Bennett in &quot;An Evening with Tony Bennett&quot;, to honor the release of Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Tony Bennett In The Studio: A Life of Art and Music&quot;, for which Albom wrote the foreword.
==Awards and recognition==

During Albom&#x27;s years in Detroit, he became one of the most awarded sports writers of his era: He was named best sports columnist in the nation a record 13 times by the Associated Press Sports Editors, and won best feature writing honors from the AP a record seven times. As of that date, no other writer has received the award more than once. Albom has won more than 200 other writing honors, from organizations including the National Headliner Awards, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and National Association of Black Journalists.

On June 25, 2010, Albom was awarded the APSE&#x27;s Red Smith Award for lifetime achievement, presented at the annual APSE convention in Salt Lake City, Utah, although his selection was heavily criticized by a number of Albom&#x27;s peers, including fellow Red Smith Award winner Dave Kindred.

In 2013, Albom was inducted into the National Sports Media Association (NSMA) &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association). Albom&#x27;s induction into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame was announced May 2017.

==Personal life==
Albom has been married to his wife, Janine, since 1995, and they reside in Detroit, Michigan.

Albom and his wife adopted an orphan named Chika Jeune, who came to his attention as a result of his work with his Haitian orphanage. The child was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died after a two-year battle, at age 7, in 2017. His 2019 book, &quot;Finding Chika&quot;, was about the experiences with her.

<text>The Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), also known as the Church of God Evening Light, is a Christian denomination in the Wesleyan-Arminian and Restorationist traditions, being aligned with the conservative holiness movement.

==History==
The origin of the Church of God lies in the holiness movement, particularly the teaching of Daniel Sidney Warner that led to the establishment of the Church of God (Anderson). Distinctives included the teaching that &quot;all believers are members of the church of God&quot; and the &quot;concept of unity among believers.&quot; The Church of God taught nonresistance and held that &quot;interracial worship was a sign of the true Church&quot;, with both whites and blacks ministering regularly in Church of God congregations, which invited people of all races to worship there. Those who were entirely sanctified testified that they were &quot;saved, sanctified, and prejudice removed.&quot; Though outsiders would sometimes attack Church of God services and camp meetings for their stand for racial equality, Church of God members were &quot;undeterred even by violence&quot; and &quot;maintained their strong interracial position as the core of their message of the unity of all believers&quot;.

George Winn, an ex-slave, founded the Guthrie congregation itself at Guthrie in 1905. Its early work toward racial integration gained it the pejorative title &quot;The Church of God (Holstein)&quot;. The Guthrie congregation and associated congregations are from a group who under the leadership of C.E. Orr dissolved fellowship with Church of God (Anderson) as a result of controversies, chiefly &quot;worldly conformity in dress&quot;, that arose regarding liberal versus conservative issues during the years 1910-1917; the Church of God is thus among the original denominations of the conservative holiness movement though it remains generally isolated due to its anti-sectarian position. It is therefore not well represented in the Interchurch Holiness Convention, with only a few Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma) adherents in attendance. The Guthrie congregation felt that the larger Church of God (Anderson) was compromising the original teachings of the Evening Light Reformation and chose to remain with what they believed to be the original standards. They felt that this could easily be ascertained by comparing the teachings of the Anderson Movement at that time with the original writings of the Evening Light Reformation. The term &quot;Evening Lights Saints&quot;, connected to the Church of God&#x27;s mission to evangelism, is derived from : &quot;...it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.&quot;

In 2003, the &quot;Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma)&quot; had 43 congregations in 18 states in the United States; (the largest concentrations being in Oklahoma and California). The church does not keep membership rolls. &quot;Faith and Victory&quot; (founded 1923) is a monthly publication of the church. Through mission efforts the church has extended into at least 11 other countries outside of the U.S., including India, Mexico, Nigeria and the Philippines.

==Theology and practices==
This body teaches that believers should closely follow the teachings of The Bible. They see an example in spiritual leaders of the holiness movement such as Daniel Sidney Warner, among others, that were instrumental in bringing about the &quot;Evening Light Reformation.&quot; They believe that God began to restore the church to the standards and light of the early morning church era through Warner and others in 1880. 

The doctrines and practices of the church reflect those of the Church of God (Anderson) in its earlier days. In comparison, the church maintains a stronger emphasis on outward, practical holiness and separation from cultural trends of the world than the present Anderson Movement. Entire Sanctification is held as a second work of grace after the New Birth. The Church of God teaches that &quot;Acts of benevolence and charity are foundational to the life of a Christian&quot; and that &quot;True godly love and religious faith are demonstrated through sacrifice in ministering to the needy and less fortunate.&quot; In keeping with the standard of holiness, a ministerial statement was issued in 1959 taking a stand against people in leadership positions in the church having televisions in their homes. Those who attend the Church of God practice plain dress and do not wear jewelry, inclusive of wedding rings. Women do not wear makeup or cut their hair; &quot;plaiting or interweaving material or other items into the hair is forbidden&quot;. In keeping with the doctrine of outward holiness, men keep their hair cut short and wear pants, while women wear long skirts or dresses. The church teaches that the committing of willful sin, and that alone, disqualifies someone from being a member.

As the Church of God teaches nonresistance, it falls into the subcategory of Holiness Pacifists (along with other denominations such as the Emmanuel Association of Churches). It teaches that marriage is &quot;a lifetime union between one man and one woman&quot; and forbids the remarriage of divorced persons. 

Practices of the church include baptism by immersion, the Lord&#x27;s supper, feet washing, lifting up holy hands, anointing with oil, divine healing, fasting and a cappella singing. With regard to the administration of Holy Communion, the Church of God teaches that &quot;communion of the body and blood of the Lord among believers could not be signified in any other way than by all of them partaking of one loaf and one cup ... A number of small individual glasses and a number of small individual wafers or pieces of bread may be a proper signification of sectism and division, or maybe of individualism, but not of the unity and oneness of believers as they partake of that one bread and one body.&quot; The Church of God has a ministry of elders and deacons. Teaching on the end of time is that the second coming of the Lord represents the end of the world and the end of life on the world for all people, both good and evil, without there being a one thousand-year reign on earth or second chance for the wicked to repent. Free-will offering is taught rather than tithing, and the ministry believes in living by faith rather than accepting salaries. Although Guthrie is home to one of the larger congregations in this fellowship, Guthrie is not the headquarters. The church teaches that Christ is the head of the church and that the headquarters is in heaven. An ecclesiastical hierarchy with one man having the preeminence over others is considered man-rule and not the pattern described in the Bible for church leadership. It opposes the Pentecostal practice of glossolalia.

==Camp meetings==
A campground for church of God meetings was built at Monark Springs, Missouri. The original tabernacle was constructed in 1940, and has been expanded more than once. The tabernacle at Monark is still in use today for the national Church of God campmeeting, with attendance from a number of States and international locations.

The Monark campmeeting begins the third Friday of each July and continues for 10 days. The grounds include dining and sleeping facilities. The Church of God ministry believes in Holy Spirit leadership in the services, allowing liberty for calling of songs, testimonies, and preaching in the general services, as the Lord leads rather than following a prepared schedule. Special services are usually set aside for missionary reports, for observance of foot-washing and the Lord’s supper, and for healing of the sick. The healing service coincides with fast day.

Two meetings are held in Guthrie each year - the Oklahoma State Campmeeting toward the end of May and the Assembly meeting toward the end of December. Both are ten-day meetings. Other major meetings are held in California, West Virginia, and Louisiana each year.

<text>Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (&quot;Songs of a Wayfarer&quot;) is a song cycle by Gustav Mahler on his own texts. The cycle of four &quot;lieder&quot; for medium voice (often performed by women as well as men) was written around 1884–85 in the wake of Mahler&#x27;s unhappy love for soprano Johanna Richter, whom he met as the conductor of the opera house in Kassel, Germany, and orchestrated and revised in the 1890s.

==Introduction==
The work&#x27;s compositional history is complex and difficult to trace. Mahler appears to have begun composing the songs in December 1884 and to have completed them in 1885. He subjected the score to a great deal of revision, probably between 1885 and 1886, and some time in the early 1890s orchestrated the original piano accompaniments. As a result of this situation, various discrepancies exist between the different sources.

It appears to have been in the orchestral version that the cycle was first performed on 16 March 1896 by the Dutch baritone Anton Sistermans with the Berlin Philharmonic and Mahler conducting, but possible indications of an earlier voice-and-piano performance cannot be discounted. The work was published in 1897 and is one of Mahler&#x27;s best-known compositions.

The lyrics are by the composer himself, though they are influenced by &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, a collection of German folk poetry that was one of Mahler&#x27;s favorite books, and the first song is actually based on the &quot;Wunderhorn&quot; poem &quot;&quot;Wann&quot; &quot;mein Schatz&quot;&quot;.

In this song cycle, Mahler extensively uses progressive tonality. Each of the four songs ends in a different key: (1) D minor to G minor; (2) D major to F-sharp major; (3) D minor to E-flat minor; (4) E minor to F minor.

There are strong connections between this work and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 1, with the main theme of the second song being the main theme of the first movement and the final verse of the fourth song reappearing in the third movement as a contemplative interruption of the funeral march.

In addition to the solo baritone, the work is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (both doubling English horn), 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam-tam, and glockenspiel) harp, and strings.

===I – &quot;Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht&quot; (&quot;When My Sweetheart is Married&quot;)===

The first song is entitled &quot;Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht&quot; (&quot;When My Sweetheart is Married&quot;), and the text discusses the Wayfarer&#x27;s grief at losing his love to another. He remarks on the beauty of the surrounding world, but how that cannot keep him from having sad dreams. The orchestral texture is bittersweet, using double reed instruments, clarinets and strings. It begins in D minor and ends in G minor.

&lt;poem&gt;
:Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht,
:Fröhliche Hochzeit macht,
:Hab&#x27; ich meinen traurigen Tag!
:Geh&#x27; ich in mein Kämmerlein,
:Dunkles Kämmerlein,
:Weine, wein&#x27; um meinen Schatz,
:Um meinen lieben Schatz!

:Blümlein blau! Verdorre nicht!
:Vöglein süß!
:Du singst auf grüner Heide.
:Ach, wie ist die Welt so schön!
:Ziküth! Ziküth!

:Singet nicht! Blühet nicht!
:Lenz ist ja vorbei!
:Alles Singen ist nun aus!
:Des Abends, wenn ich schlafen geh&#x27;,
:Denk&#x27; ich an mein Leide!
:An mein Leide!

&lt;/poem&gt;

===II – &quot;Ging heut&#x27; Morgen über&#x27;s Feld&quot; (&quot;I Went This Morning over the Field&quot;)===

The second song, &quot;Ging heut&#x27; Morgen über&#x27;s Feld&quot; (&quot;I Went This Morning over the Field&quot;), contains the happiest music of the work. Indeed, it is a song of joy and wonder at the beauty of nature in simple actions like birdsong and dew on the grass. &quot;Is it not a lovely world?&quot; is a refrain. However, the Wayfarer is reminded at the end that despite this beauty, his happiness will not blossom anymore now that his love is gone. This movement is orchestrated delicately, making use of high strings and flutes, as well as a fair amount of triangle. The melody of this movement, as well as much of the orchestration, was later reused by Mahler and developed into the &#x27;A&#x27; theme of the first movement of his Symphony No. 1. It begins in D major and ends in F major.

&lt;poem&gt;
:Ging heut&#x27; Morgen über&#x27;s Feld,
:Tau noch auf den Gräsern hing;
:Sprach zu mir der lust&#x27;ge Fink:
:&quot;Ei du! Gelt? Guten Morgen! Ei gelt?
:Du! Wird&#x27;s nicht eine schöne Welt?
:Zink! Zink! Schön und flink!
:Wie mir doch die Welt gefällt!&quot;

:Auch die Glockenblum&#x27; am Feld
:Hat mir lustig, guter Ding&#x27;,
:Mit den Glöckchen, klinge, kling,
:Ihren Morgengruß geschellt:
:&quot;Wird&#x27;s nicht eine schöne Welt?
:Kling, kling! Schönes Ding!
:Wie mir doch die Welt gefällt! Heia!&quot;

:Und da fing im Sonnenschein
:Gleich die Welt zu funkeln an;
:Alles Ton und Farbe gewann
:Im Sonnenschein!
:Blum&#x27; und Vogel, groß und Klein!
:&quot;Guten Tag, ist&#x27;s nicht eine schöne Welt?
:Ei du, gelt? Schöne Welt!&quot;

:Nun fängt auch mein Glück wohl an?
:Nein, nein, das ich mein&#x27;,
:Mir nimmer blühen kann!

&lt;/poem&gt;

===III – &quot;Ich hab&#x27; ein glühend Messer&quot; (&quot;I Have a Gleaming Knife&quot;)===

The third song is a full display of despair. Entitled &quot;Ich hab&#x27; ein glühend Messer&quot; (&quot;I Have a Gleaming Knife&quot;), the Wayfarer likens his agony of lost love to having an actual metal blade piercing his heart. He obsesses to the point where everything in the environment reminds him of some aspect of his love, and he wishes he actually had the knife. Note: while the translation of &quot;glühend&quot; as gleaming is not totally incorrect, &quot;gleaming&quot; misses an important point: &quot;glühend&quot; includes an element of heat, as in &quot;glowing with heat&quot;; a potentially better translation might be any of &quot;glowing&quot;, &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;scorching&quot;. This is not just a bright-looking (&quot;gleaming&quot;) knife, but one that burns and scorches. The music is intense and driving, fitting to the agonized nature of the Wayfarer&#x27;s obsession. It begins in D minor and ends in E minor.

&lt;poem&gt;
:Ich hab&#x27; ein glühend Messer,
:Ein Messer in meiner Brust,
:O weh! Das schneid&#x27;t so tief
:in jede Freud&#x27; und jede Lust.
:Ach, was ist das für ein böser Gast!
:Nimmer hält er Ruh&#x27;,
:nimmer hält er Rast,
:Nicht bei Tag, noch bei Nacht,
:wenn ich schlief!
:O weh!

:Wenn ich den Himmel seh&#x27;,
:Seh&#x27; ich zwei blaue Augen stehn!
:O weh! Wenn ich im gelben Felde geh&#x27;,
:Seh&#x27; ich von fern das blonde Haar
:Im Winde weh&#x27;n!
:O weh!

:Wenn ich aus dem Traum auffahr&#x27;
:Und höre klingen ihr silbern Lachen,
:O weh!
:Ich wollt&#x27;, ich läg&#x27; auf der Schwarzen Bahr&#x27;,
:Könnt&#x27; nimmer die Augen aufmachen!

&lt;/poem&gt;

===IV – &quot;Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz&quot; (&quot;The Two Blue Eyes of my Beloved&quot;)===

The final song culminates in a resolution. The music, also reused in the First Symphony (in the slow movement), is subdued and gentle, lyrical and often reminiscent of a chorale in its harmonies. Its title, &quot;Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz&quot; (&quot;The Two Blue Eyes of my Beloved&quot;), deals with how the image of those eyes has caused the Wayfarer so much grief that he can no longer stand to be in the environment. He describes lying down under a linden tree, finding rest for the first time and allowing the flowers to fall on him; and somehow (beyond his own comprehension) everything was well again: &quot;Everything: love and grief, and world, and dream!&quot; It begins in E minor and ends in F minor.

&lt;poem&gt;
:Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz,
:Die haben mich in die weite Welt geschickt.
:Da mußt ich Abschied nehmen vom allerliebsten Platz!
:O Augen blau, warum habt ihr mich angeblickt?
:Nun hab&#x27; ich ewig Leid und Grämen!

:Ich bin ausgegangen in stiller Nacht
:wohl über die dunkle Heide.
:Hat mir niemand Ade gesagt
:Ade!
:Mein Gesell&#x27; war Lieb und Leide!

:Auf der Straße steht ein Lindenbaum,
:Da hab&#x27; ich zum ersten Mal im Schlaf geruht!
:Unter dem Lindenbaum,
:Der hat seine Blüten über mich geschneit,
:Da wußt&#x27; ich nicht, wie das Leben tut,
:War alles, alles wieder gut!
:Alles! Alles, Lieb und Leid
:Und Welt und Traum!
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Translation of the title==

Although &quot;Songs of a Wayfarer&quot; is the title by which the cycle is generally known in English, Fritz Spiegl has observed that German &quot;Geselle&quot; actually means &quot;journeyman&quot;, i.e., one who has completed an apprenticeship with a master in a trade or craft, but is not yet a master himself; journeymen in German-speaking countries traditionally traveled from town to town to gain experience with various masters. A more accurate translation, therefore, would be &quot;Songs of a Travelling Journeyman&quot;. The title hints at an autobiographical aspect of the work; as a young, newly qualified conductor (and budding composer), Mahler was himself at this time in a stage somewhere between &#x27;apprentice&#x27; and recognized &#x27;master&#x27; and had been moving from town to town (Bad Hall, Laibach, Olmütz, Vienna, Kassel). All the while, he was honing his skills and learning from masters in his field.

<doc id="433447" wikidata="Q259362" url="?curid=433447" title="Haliplidae">
<text>The Haliplidae are a family of water beetles that swim using an alternating motion of the legs. They are therefore clumsy in water (compared e.g. with the Dytiscidae or Hydrophilidae), and prefer to get around by crawling. The family consists of about 200 species in 5 genera, distributed wherever there is freshwater habitat; it is the only extant member of superfamily Haliploidea. They are also known as crawling water beetles or haliplids.

==Description==
The adults of these beetles are generally oval in shape, with a very convex upperside, and are generally long. They are generally yellowish to light brown in color, frequently with light and dark patterns dotted with 10 or more rows of punctures on the elytra. The family&#x27;s most distinctive characteristic is the large coxal plates of the hindlegs, which are immobile (though not fused in the centerline) and extend back along the underside to cover most of the abdomen base and the hindleg trochanters and femora. They are used as air storage supplementing the air carried under the elytra.

The compound eyes are markedly protruding from a smallish head, which bears antennae with 11 segments set upon an antennophore with a conspicuously short base (scapus). The extension of the prosternum is broad, with a truncated tip, ending adjacent to the metasternal process. The metasternum has a complete transverse ridge. The slender legs have long swimming hairs on tibiae and tarsi, but are not flattened into &quot;flippers&quot;. The foreleg tibiae lack the apparatus for antenna cleaning present in many other beetles. Unlike in other Adephaga, the hindwings are not folded under the elytra, but rolled together apically.

Haliplidae larvae have a long and slender body with a tough exoskeleton. They can be recognized by their specialized mouthparts, carried on a small head. The maxillae and labium are adapted to manipulating the algae the larvae feed on, while the mandibles contain a channel through which fluids are sucked out of the food. The larval legs are short and carry a single claw each, but the forelegs have various adaptations for climbing among water plants. Respiration is via gills which are either long and filamentous, or (in &quot;Peltodytes&quot;) short microtracheal extensions; they are carried on the tergites of all sternal and all but the tenth (last) abdominal segments. The latter may be absent, but in the larvae of some Haliplidae it is tapering and ends in two prongs (which are not urogomphi though). The last (third) instar has functional spiracles on the mesothorax and the first to seventh abdominal segments.

==Ecology==
Haliplids live in the aquatic vegetation around the edges of small ponds, lakes, and quiet streams. Adults are omnivorous, eating insect eggs, small crustaceans, hydrozoan polyps, and algae, while the larvae eat only algae. The species of &quot;Peltodytes&quot; deposit eggs on the surface of aquatic plants, while &quot;Haliplus&quot; chews out a cavity in the plants for their eggs. There are three instars, and pupation takes place on land in a chamber constructed by the larva.

Crawling water beetles are not extensively studied because their interaction with humans is minimal. Hungerford&#x27;s crawling water beetle (&quot;Brychius hungerfordi&quot;) is an endangered species found only in Michigan and Ontario.

==Systematics==
The classification of haliplids as a separate group of Adephaga is unquestioned, and most entomologists believe they developed from terrestrial beetles separately from other types of water beetles. For many decades, the family was in need of revision, the last general catalog being published by A. Zimmermann in 1920. B. J. van Vondel produced an updated catalogue of the known Haliplidae taxa.

Like predaceous diving beetles (Dytiscidae), the crawling water beetles form an early offshoot of the Adephaga. They still have grooved maxillae and their tentoriolacinial muscle does not attach to the mesal stipial base. Their larvae, like those of predaceous diving beetles, do not possess eggshell-bursters on the head. It is not yet resolved whether Haliplidae and Dytiscidae are closest relatives, or whether they originated independently from the basal Adephaga.

===Genera===
The family is not very diverse, with only five genera accepted. Of these, &quot;Peltodytes&quot; is probably the most ancestral, though it has a number of autapomorphies. The others have more synapomorphies in common; &quot;Haliplus&quot; is the more diverse and appears to include some minor lineages formerly considered independent genera.

<text>William Henry Gates II (November 30, 1925September 14, 2020), better known as Bill Gates Sr., was an American attorney, philanthropist, and civic leader. He was the founder of the law firm Shidler McBroom &amp; Gates (a predecessor of K&amp;L Gates), and also served as president of both the Seattle King County and Washington State Bar associations. He was the father of Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft.

==Early life and education==
Gates was born in Bremerton, Washington, in 1925, and was the son of Lillian Elizabeth Rice (1891–1966) and William Henry Gates (1891–1969), who was himself the son of William Henry Gates, a furniture store owner and gold prospector during the Dawson Gold Rush of 1898. He graduated from Bremerton High School in 1943.

Gates served in the US Army for three years during World War II. He subsequently attended the University of Washington under the G.I. Bill, earning a B.A. in 1949 and a J.D. degree in 1950. While at UW, he was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity.

==Career==
Gates co-founded the law firm Shidler McBroom &amp; Gates in 1964, which later became a part of Preston Gates &amp; Ellis LLP (PGE). He practiced with the firm until 1998, when it was merged into the firm now known as K&amp;L Gates.

Gates&#x27; legal practice focused on corporate, technology and disputes. During his career he served as president of both the Seattle/King County Bar Association and the Washington State Bar Association.

Gates served on the boards of numerous organizations in the Pacific Northwest, including the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, King County United Way and Planned Parenthood. In 1995, he founded the Technology Alliance, whose mission is to expand technology-based employment in Washington.

In 1998, Gates retired from Preston Gates &amp; Ellis. He served for 15 years on the Board of Regents for the University of Washington, and until his death was a co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which his son Bill and his daughter-in-law Melinda founded. He served as a director for the bulk retail corporation Costco Wholesale from 2003, and was a founding co-chair of the Pacific Health Summit. He served as an honorary chair for the World Justice Project. The project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

Gates co-authored the book &quot;Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes&quot; with Chuck Collins. It is a defense of the policies promoted by the estate tax. He was also the author of the book &quot;Showing Up for Life: Thoughts on the Gifts of a Lifetime&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Gates married Mary Maxwell Gates () (1929–1994), whom he met at the University of Washington (UW), and they remained married until her death in 1994. They had three children: Kristianne, Bill, and Libby. His two daughters, Kristi Blake and Libby Armintrout, are both active members of the UW community. He was a lifelong supporter of the Washington Huskies college football team.

In 1996, Gates married his second wife Mimi Gardner Gates (b. 1943), who was director of the Seattle Art Museum.

In 2018, it was revealed that Gates was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on September 14, 2020, aged 94, at his beach home on Hood Canal in Washington state. In a tribute, his son said that his &quot;wisdom, generosity, empathy, and humility had a huge influence on people around the world.&quot;

<text>Emack &amp; Bolio&#x27;s is a chain of ice cream stores based in Boston, Massachusetts, United States.

== History ==
The chain was founded by Robert Rook, a lawyer and self-declared hippie who has worked closely with the homeless, Vietnam war protesters, civil and gay rights advocates, and numerous rock bands such as Aerosmith, U2, Boston, The Cars, and James Brown. Emack and Bolio&#x27;s was founded in 1975, three years before Ben and Jerry&#x27;s used the concept of a hippie ice cream store. There are now a few stores in other states, including New York, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois, apart from the ones in Massachusetts.

The first international locations opened in Bangkok, Thailand in 2014 and in Abu Dhabi, UAE. A shop in Xian, China and one in Hong Kong opened in 2015. By 2017 there were shops in 6 different Asian countries.

==Name==
The store was named after two homeless men for whom Robert Rook did pro bono work, who asked that the ice cream shop be named after them. Emack and Bolio were mascots of a sort for the first store.

It has been noted that Emacs, text editing software popular with computer programmers, and BOLIO, a text-formatting program, were developed within walking distance of a store near MIT. The explanation by the GNU Emacs Project does not indicate a connection.

<text>The Interior Plains is a vast physiographic region that spreads across the Laurentian craton of central North America, extending along the east flank of the Rocky Mountains from the Gulf Coast region to the Arctic Beaufort Sea. In Canada, it encompasses the Canadian Prairies separating the Canadian Rockies from the Canadian Shield, as well as the Boreal Plains and Taiga Plains east of the Mackenzie and Richardson Mountains; while in the United States, it includes the Great Plains of the West/Midwest and the tallgrass prairie region to the south of the Great Lakes extending east to the Appalachian Plateau region.

==Geologic history==
A series of tectonic plate collisions in the crust that formed the center of the North American continent laid the groundwork for the modern-day interior plains. Mountain building and erosion around the plains as well as flooding from inland seas provided sediments that make up the rock strata of the interior plains.

===Proterozoic Eon (2500 to 539 million years ago)===
Between 2.0 and 1.8 billion years ago the Hearne-Rae, Superior, and Wyoming cratons were sutured together to form the North American craton, Laurentia, in an event called the Trans-Hudson Orogeny (THO). This event was like the Indian Plate colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which formed the Himalayas. After initial collisions during the THO, tectonic activity at the edges of the four main cratons sparked mountain building. The interior of Laurentia remained relatively flat and became a basin for eroded sediment from mountains at the beginning of the current time period, the Phanerozoic Eon. The only remaining outcrops from this orogeny in the interior plains are in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The sediments that formed the Black Hills were granite and different types of igneous rocks, which make up the basement of bedrock in central North America. However, much of the Black Hills sediment has been metamorphosed and deformed, so it is uncertain what the conditions were like at the time of their formation.

===Paleozoic Era (539 to 252 million years ago)===
This period has a large importance in Earth&#x27;s history as it saw the Cambrian explosion and Permian extinction. When global sea level rose and continents became partially submerged, the oceans had an explosion of complex life, which was the first time an event like this occurred on Earth. However, the center of Laurentia remained above sea level and as the continent moved east towards other supercontinents like Gondwana, the Appalachian Mountains began to form around 400 MYA. This coincided with the formation of Pangea around 300 MYA, when the Appalachians were at their peak height. The central plains of Laurentia were subjected to deposition of eroded sediment from these mountains. The oldest sediments from this period are felsic igneous rocks and granite that have since been metamorphosed, while the younger sediments are made up of sandstone, shale, limestone, and coal. Sediments deposited in the interior plains from this era are currently buried deep beneath the surface where they are difficult to study.

===Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago)===
Around 220 MYA, the supercontinent Pangea broke apart, and the North American continent began to move west and isolate itself. For much of this period the interior plains were covered by inland seas. During the Jurassic period, the Sundance Sea formed along the western coast of the North American continent and extended from northern Canada to the interior plains, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Coquina and sandstone layers from marine deposition were deposited on top of rock layers from the Paleozoic Era. During the Cretaceous period, another inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway was formed. This body of water extended from present-day Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico and covered almost all the interior plains west of the current boundary of the Mississippi River. Limestone-shale couplets, as well as carbonate layers, are commonly found in sedimentary deposits from this inland sea. Towards the end of this period, the inland seas began to drain due to uplift from the formation of the Rocky Mountains.

===Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to Present Day)===
The Laramide Orogeny event was when the western Cordillera was formed due to the flat-slab subduction of the Farallon Plate under the North American Plate. This created the frontal range of the Rockies from Montana through New Mexico. The outcrops seen at the surface of the Rockies are made up of sandstone, granite, and limestone; as well as metamorphic rocks uplifted from the Proterozoic Period. The interior plains have remained relatively flat during this period and recent sedimentation is from erosion of the newly formed Rocky Mountains as well as continued erosion from Appalachia. In general, Rocky Mountain sediment is deposited on the plains west of the Mississippi River, and Appalachian sediment is deposited to the east of the Mississippi River.

==Glacial history==
2.6 million years ago at the start of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Laurentide Ice Sheet began to spread southwards to cover North America down to the northern Great Plains on the western side of the Interior Plains and down into most of Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Laurentide Ice Sheet had a large influence on the morphology of the Interior Plains during the end of the Pleistocene. During the retreat, the Laurentide scoured numerous pockets of sediment. Upon the plate&#x27;s melting, those pockets were filled, resulting in the kettle lakes. The Great Lakes and both Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake of Canada were formed by the Laurentide. During the retreat, the Laurentide gouged and filled the glacial paleolake McConnell in northern Canada. As the region uplifted and rebounded isostatically from the mass of the ice sheet, paleolake McConnell was split into Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake. Great Slave Lake&#x27;s basin formed under the 4-kilometer thick Keewatin Dome that today is the deepest lake in North America. A vast amount of smaller lakes were formed as well and serve an integral part of ethos in the surrounding regions. For example, Minnesota is often referred to as “the Land of 10,000 Lakes” due to the number and widespread recreational use of the state&#x27;s lakes.

Much of the loess distributed within the Interior Plains has its origin in glaciers. In glaciated conditions, sand and silt-laden meltwater originating from alpine glaciers in the Rocky Mountains generated alluvial deposits at their base. This alluvium was then distributed throughout the Interior Plains by strong winds.

==Sediment transport==
Sediment transport within the Interior Plains occurs primarily by aeolian and fluvial processes. Due to climate change, the average temperature of the Interior Plains is increasing and the region is becoming more arid. Because of the increase in rainstorm intensity, rain-driven erosion will grow as a factor of soil erosion in the Interior Plains.

===Fluvial processes===
Civil engineering projects have altered the fluvial geomorphology of the Interior Plains. Normal sediment transport by river and channel systems is interrupted by river-blocking structures such as dams and flow regulators. Before 1900, the estimated annual sediment transport by the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico was 400 million tons. However, in the early 20th century, engineering projects including dams were created on the Missouri River, meander cutoffs, river training, bank revetments, and soil erosion control have reduced the annual transport rate to between 100 and 150 million tons of sediment per year. The artificial structures trap suspended sediment from traveling as it would in an un-engineered river.

===Aeolian processes===
While average annual temperatures vary significantly between the northern and southern portions of the Interior Plains, the climate is characterized by susceptibility to droughts due to generally low annual precipitation.

Due to a warm climate and evapotranspiration rates surpassing precipitation rates, the southern Interior Plains are highly susceptible to droughts and soil erosion. A significant feature of aeolian erosion in the Interior Plains is the ubiquitous loess deposits. The deposits were placed by winds during the Pleistocene epoch. The Nebraska Sand Dunes are an example of the sand and loess during the epoch. These dunes were formed during the Pleistocene by Northwesterly winds depositing alluvial silt and sand. That loess is so prevalent in the Interior Plains is evidence of significant aeolian erosion, as deposits are generally accumulations of wind-blown dust. 
Following World War I, wheat farming in the fertile loess soil of the Interior Plains swelled. The expansion of farmland eliminated many prairies containing soil-stabilizing grasses. While droughts in the region were common, during the following drought, aeolian soil erosion was exacerbated by the reduced soil-holding prairie grasses. Dust storms eroded hundreds of millions of tons of topsoil, causing dust storms for months in the historical region known as the Dust Bowl. On May 12, 1934, alone, an estimated 200 million tons of wind-eroded topsoil were transported to the Atlantic Ocean.

In response to the rapid aeolian erosion, soil preservation methods were implemented. In the years following the Dust Bowl, of shelterbelt were planted by the Works Progress Administration to reduce wind intensity.

==Current land use==
Grassland and shrubland make up the largest portion of the Interior Plains within the United States, at 44.4 percent. The western margin is mainly shortgrass prairie dominated by blue grama and buffalograss. Prairies on the eastern side of the Interior Plains are dominated by tall grass varieties including big bluestem and switchgrass. The two regions are separated by mixed-grass prairie, which contains both short and long grass varieties as well as little bluestem and western wheatgrass. Land used for cattle-grazing is included under this classification, which sustains nearly 50 percent of all United States beef cattle.

In Canada, provinces located within the Interior Plains produce nearly 60 percent of all beef cattle.

Much of the land in the Interior Plains is used for agriculture. In the year 2000, 43.8 percent of the Great Plains portion of the Interior Plains were used for agriculture. By far, wheat comprises the largest portion of the agricultural yield in region; combined, wheat exports from the Interior Plains make up more than half of the world&#x27;s exports. Other significant crops produced in the region include barley, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, and canola, which is particularly important to Canadian exports.

Other sources comprise much smaller portions of the land. In decreasing percentage, forests make up 5.8%, wetland makes up 1.6%, developed land makes up 1.5%, barren land makes up .6%, and land used for mining makes up .1%.

==Physiography==
The Interior Plains physiographic area stretches across Canada and the United States, and the two governments each use a different hierarchical system to classify their portions. In Canada, the Interior Plains makes up one of seven physiographic areas included in the highest level of classification - defined as a &quot;region&quot; in that country. In the United States it is one of eight physiographic areas (of the contiguous 48 states) included in the highest classification, defined as a &quot;division&quot; there.

===Interior Plains in Canada===

The Interior Plains of Canada are one of seven physiographic areas included in the highest level classification in that country. That country calls this primary classification level &quot;region.&quot; For some of the seven regions, a subregion schema is provided. For other physiographic regions (such as the Interior Plains and Appalachian Uplands) subregions are not developed, but the tertiary level (called &quot;division&quot; in Canada) is used in the mapping data.

The following list is of the 14 physiographic divisions in the Interior Plains of Canada. Further information can be found at https://atlas.gc.ca/phys/en/index.html

<text>Sir Robert Wingfield (died 1454), of Letheringham in Suffolk, was an English landowner, administrator and politician.

==Origins==
Born in about 1403, he was the son of Sir Robert Wingfield (died 1409) by his wife Elizabeth Russell, daughter of Sir John Russell (d.1405), of Strensham in Worcestershire and his first wife Agnes. The elder Robert was son of Sir John Wingfield and his wife Margaret Hastings (died 1397), later second wife of Russell. As guardian of her son, it was Russell who arranged the marriage of Robert to his daughter Elizabeth.

He was the great, great nephew of Sir John de Wingfield (fl.c.1350) of Wingfield Castle in Suffolk, about 12 miles north of Letheringham, chief administrator to Edward the Black Prince (1330-1376), whose daughter and heiress Catherine Wingfield married Michael de la Pole, later 1st Earl of Suffolk, and lived at Wingfield Castle in Suffolk.

==Career==
In 1420 he was a legatee in the will of his great-aunt Elizabeth Elmham, and in 1426 was knighted at Hereford by King Henry VI. The next year he was elected a knight of the shire for Suffolk and sat in all Parliaments until 1436.

In 1436 he was appointed steward of the lands in Norfolk of the Honour of Richmond and in 1443 he became steward to John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and accompanied him on his embassy to the court of King Charles VII of France.

In December 1447 he was named as a rioter in Suffolk and was imprisoned in the Marshalsea, but was pardoned in February 1448. In September of that year he complained that the Duke of Norfolk had attacked his home at Letheringham with an armed force and had burned his furniture and removed goods worth the then huge sum of £1,200.

Despite these local difficulties, in 1449 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire.

==Marriage and children==
Before 18 August 1421 he married Elizabeth Goushill (born circa 1402), a daughter of Sir Robert Goushill of Hoveringham in Nottinghamshire, by his wife Elizabeth Fitzalan. Elizabeth Goushill was co-heiress of her father&#x27;s estate along with her sister Joan Goushill, the wife of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley, and their half-brother was John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Robert Wingfield had twelve children by Elizabeth, who survived him: 
*Richard Wingfield (died before 1509).
*Sir John Wingfield (died 1481), of Letheringham, who married Elizabeth Fitzlewis, a daughter of Sir John Fitzlewis, MP, by whom he had sixteen children, including Sir Richard Wingfield, Sir Robert Wingfield, Sir Humphrey Wingfield, and Thomas Wingfield.
*Sir Robert Wingfield, who married Anne Harling.
*Sir Henry Wingfield (died by May 1494), of Orford in Suffolk, who married firstly Alice Seckford and secondly Elizabeth Rookes, and was the ancestor of the Wingfields of Tickencote.
*Sir Thomas Wingfield (died 1475), who married Philippa Tiptoft, a daughter of John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft and widow of Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros.
*William Wingfield (died 1509).
*Anthony Wingfield, of Glossop in Derbyshire, who married Mary Duke and was ancestor of the Wingfields of Onslow.
*Elizabeth Wingfield(died 28 April 1497), who in 1462 married Sir William Brandon (died 1491), of Wangford in Suffolk. Their grandson was Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk.
*Catherine Wingfield, who married Sir John Bonville, of Halnaker in Sussex. Their daughter Florence Bonville married firstly Sir Humphrey Fulford and secondly John Bourchier, 1st Earl of Bath.
*Agnes Wingfield, who married John Fremingham.
*Alice Wingfield.
*Margaret Wingfield.

==Death==
He died in 1454 and was buried at Letheringham. His will, made on 6 October 1453, was proved on 21 Nov 1454.

<text>The Maine Law (or &quot;Maine Liquor Law&quot;), passed on June 2, 1851 in Maine, was the first statutory implementation of the developing temperance movement in the United States.

==History==
Temperance activist Neal Dow helped craft the Maine liquor law while he was mayor of Portland, Maine. The law&#x27;s wording included that the sale of all alcoholic beverages except for &quot;medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes&quot; was prohibited. Word of the law&#x27;s passage quickly spread elsewhere in the nation, and by 1855 twelve states had joined Maine in total prohibition. Known as &quot;dry&quot; states, these states were the opposite of &quot;wet&quot; states, where no prohibition laws existed.

The act was unpopular with many working-class people and immigrants. Opposition to the law turned violent in Portland on June 2, 1855, during an incident known as the Portland Rum Riot. Opponents of the Maine Law stormed Portland City Hall because they thought Mayor Dow was keeping liquor in the basement. Newspapers reported that Dow ordered rioters to be fired upon, killing one and wounding seven. The riot was a contributing factor to the law being repealed in 1856. However, despite repeal, prohibition was re-enacted in various forms and eventually was written into the state constitution in 1885.

The Maine Law gained recognition internationally and was the inspiration for United Kingdom Alliance in Manchester, England. That organization grew and during the late 19th century a street in Manchester, England, was renamed Maine Road in honour of the law. Originally known as Dog Kennel Lane, the street was renamed due to the influence of the temperance movement in the United Kingdom. A 16.5 acre brickworks on the street was later redeveloped into Maine Road football stadium, where Manchester City F.C. played home games between 1923 and 2003.

==Other states==
* In 1847 Delaware became the second state to pass an unenforced prohibitory liquor law by the legislature, but the people in Kent and Sussex Counties voted against it. Delaware&#x27;s third county, New Castle, was the only to vote for it. 
* The Massachusetts legislature passed a &quot;Maine Law&quot; in 1852 which was struck down a year later by that state&#x27;s Supreme Court. Two years later, in 1855, the legislature passed a revised prohibitory liquor law to avoid the constitutional flaws of the first law.
* The Rhode Island General Assembly passed its own &quot;Maine Law&quot; in 1852, which outlawed sale or consumption of liquor for eleven years. Liquor was banned again in 1874 and 1886. When statewide prohibition finally ended in 1889, the decision was left to the individual cities and towns of Rhode Island whether to be &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot;.
* Vermont&#x27;s legislature also passed a prohibitory liquor law in 1852 which was ratified by the people of the state the year after.
* Connecticut&#x27;s legislature passed a prohibitory liquor law in 1853 but was vetoed by the governor. The next year, with a new governor, the legislature once again passed a &quot;Maine Law&quot; with a majority in both houses.
* In 1853, Indiana passed a &quot;Maine Law&quot; which was invalidated by the state&#x27;s supreme court. But in 1855, a new prohibitory liquor law was passed.
* Also in 1853, Michigan passed a prohibitory liquor law which was ratified by 2/3 of the electorate. However, in 1854, the law was declared unconstitutional. The next year the state legislature passed a revised liquor law.
* In 1854, the people of Texas voted to prohibit the sale of liquor in quantities less than one quart.
* In 1854, Ohio passed a law &quot;forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquor,&quot; which was ruled unconstitutional by state appellate courts. However, in 1855, the Ohio State Supreme Court overturned the lower court rulings and upheld the constitutionality of a statewide prohibitory liquor law.
* The New York state legislature passed a prohibitory liquor law in 1854, only to be vetoed by Governor Seymour. The same year, Governor Seymour was replaced by the prohibition candidate Myron H. Clark. Early the next year, the legislature re-passed the &quot;Maine Law,&quot; though it had spotty enforcement.
* Pennsylvania&#x27;s prohibitory liquor law went into effect in 1855 after its passage by the state legislature.
* 1855, the Iowa state legislature passed a &quot;Maine Law&quot; which was ratified by the people the same year.
* In 1855, the New Hampshire state Assembly overcame two previous rejections by the state Senate to pass a prohibitory liquor law.
*In 1880, under the Governorship of John St. John, the State of Kansas enacted a liquor prohibition law.

<doc id="433468" wikidata="Q1147795" url="?curid=433468" title="Temperance (virtue)">
<text>Temperance in its modern use is defined as moderation or voluntary self-restraint. It is typically described in terms of what a person voluntarily refrains from doing. This includes restraint from revenge by practicing mercy and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance by practicing humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as extravagant luxury or splurging, restraint from overindulgence in food and drink, and restraint from rage or craving by practicing calmness and equanimity. The distinction between temperance and self-control is subtle. A person who exhibits self-control wisely refrains from giving in to unwise desires. A person who exhibits temperance does not have unwise desires in the first place because they have wisely shaped their character in such a way that their desires are proper ones. Aristotle suggested this analogy: An intemperate person is like a city with bad laws; a person who lacks self control is like a city that has good laws on the books but doesn’t enforce them.

Temperance has been described as a virtue by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, psychologists, particularly in the positive psychology movement. It has a long history in philosophical and religious thought. It is generally characterized as the control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as chastity, modesty, humility, self-regulation, hospitality, decorum, abstinence, and forgiveness; each of these involves restraining an excess of some impulse, such as sexual desire, vanity, or anger. In classical iconography, the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another. It is one of the cardinal virtues in western thought, and is found in Greek philosophy and Christianity, as well as in Eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism.

Temperance is one of the six virtues in the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, along with wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, and transcendence. The term &quot;temperance&quot; can also refer to the abstention from alcohol (teetotalism), especially with reference to the temperance movement. It can also refer to alcohol moderation.

== Philosophical perspectives ==
===Greek civilization===

There are two words in ancient Greek that have been translated to &quot;temperance&quot; in English. The first, , largely meant &quot;self-restraint&quot;. The other, &#x27;, was a word coined during the time of Aristotle, to mean &quot;control over oneself&quot;, or &quot;self-discipline&quot;. appears three times in the Bible, where it was translated as &quot;temperance&quot; in the King James translation.

The modern meaning of temperance has evolved since its first usage. In Latin, means restraint (from force or anger), but also more broadly the proper balancing or mixing (particularly, of temperature, or compounds). Hence the phrase &quot;to temper a sword&quot;, meaning the heating and cooling process of forging a metal blade. The Latin also referred to governing and control, likely in a moderate way (i.e. not with the use of excessive force).

Temperance is a major Athenian virtue, as advocated by Plato; self-restraint () is one of his four core virtues of the ideal city. In &quot;Charmides&quot;, one of Plato&#x27;s early dialogues, an attempt is made to describe temperance, but fails to reach an adequate definition.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle included discussions of both temperance and self-control in his pioneering system of virtue ethics.

Aristotle restricts the sphere of temperance to bodily pleasures, and defines temperance as &quot;a mean with regard to pleasures,&quot; distinct from self-indulgence. Like courage, temperance is a virtue concerning our discipline of &quot;the irrational parts of our nature&quot; (fear, in the case of courage; desire, in the case of temperance).

His discussion is found in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; Book III, chapters 10–12, and concludes in this way:
And so the appetites of the temperate man should be in harmony with his reason; for the aim of both is that which is noble: the temperate man desires what he ought, and as he ought, and when he ought; and this again is what reason prescribes. This, then, may be taken as an account of temperance.
As with virtue generally, temperance is a sort of habit, acquired by practice. It is a state of character, not a passion or a faculty, specifically a disposition to choose the mean between excess and deficit. The mean is hard to attain, and is grasped by perception, not by reasoning.

Pleasure in doing virtuous acts is a sign that one has attained a virtuous disposition. Temperance is the alignment of our desires with our enlightened self-interest, such that we desire to do what is best for our own flourishing.

The word Aristotle used for &quot;intemperate&quot; () was the Greek word for &quot;unchastened&quot; — the implication being that the intemperate person is immature and undisciplined and has not yet learned how to live well.

===Marcus Aurelius===
In his &quot;Meditations&quot;, the Roman emperor and stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius defines temperance as &quot;a virtue opposed to love of pleasure&quot;. He argues that temperance separates humans from animals, writing that: [I]t is the peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses or the appetites, for both are animal; but the intelligent motion claims superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others. For Marcus, this rational faculty exists to understand the appetites, rather than be used by them. In the ninth book of the &quot;Meditations&quot;, he gives this advice: &quot;Wipe out imagination: check desire: extinguish appetite: keep the ruling faculty in its own power.&quot;

Marcus takes inspiration from his father, someone Marcus remembers as &quot;satisfied on all occasions&quot;, who &quot;showed sobriety in all things&quot; and &quot;did not take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves.&quot; Marcus writes that temperance is both difficult and yet important. He favourably likens his father to Socrates, in that &quot;he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul&quot;.

===Thomas Aquinas===
In his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Thomas Aquinas defines the scope of temperance: &quot;Temperance... considered as a human virtue, deals with the desires of sensible pleasures&quot;. He refines &#x27;sensible pleasure&#x27; by stating, &quot;the object of temperance is a good in respect of the pleasures connected with the concupiscence of touch.&quot; He further defines temperance by associating it with the forbearing of sensible pleasures, as opposed to the mere toleration of sensible pain, a distinction he highlights when he claims that &quot;the temperate man is praised for refraining from pleasures of touch, more than for not shunning the pains which are contrary to them&quot;.

For Aquinas, temperance need never contradict pleasure in itself: &quot;The temperate man does not shun all pleasures, but those that are immoderate, and contrary to reason.&quot; For example, he discusses food and sex, which, when approached with temperance, fulfill human requirements for survival without contradicting the virtue of moderation:Accordingly, if we take a good, and it be something discerned by the sense of touch, and something pertaining to the upkeep of human life either in the individual or in the species, such as the pleasures of the table or of sexual intercourse, it will belong to the virtue of temperance.

===Michel de Montaigne===
Similarly to Marcus Aurelius, the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne writes in his essay &#x27;Of Experience&#x27; that temperance enhances the soul:Greatness of soul consists not so much in mounting and in pressing forward, as in knowing how to govern and circumscribe itself; it takes everything for great, that is enough, and demonstrates itself in preferring moderate to eminent things.&quot; Montaigne differs from Marcus in that Montaigne believes temperance enhances pleasure, rather than opposing the love of it: &quot;Intemperance is the pest of pleasure; and temperance is not its scourge, but rather its seasoning.&quot; Like Aquinas, Montaigne sees no contradiction between temperance and pleasure in the right moral context. Rather, he believes that &quot;there is no pleasure so just and lawful, where intemperance and excess are not to be condemned.&quot; For example, he commends a temperate approach to the pleasures of sex within marriage: &quot;Marriage is a solemn and religious tie, and therefore the pleasure we extract from it should be a sober and serious delight, and mixed with a certain kind of gravity; it should be a sort of discreet and conscientious pleasure.&quot;

Montaigne also discusses the difficulty of temperance. He muses on whether pleasure&#x27;s tempering creates unhappiness: But, to speak the truth, is not man a most miserable creature the while? It is scarce, by his natural condition, in his power to taste one pleasure pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving doctrines and precepts to curtail that little he has; he is not yet wretched enough, unless by art and study he augment his own misery[.]

In his essay &#x27;Of Drunkenness&#x27;, Montaigne accepts that temperance neither can nor should completely exclude the possibility of desire: &quot;’Tis sufficient for a man to curb and moderate his inclinations, for totally to suppress them is not in him to do.&quot; But in &#x27;Of Managing the Will&#x27;, Montaigne warns against failing to curb inclinations: &quot;The more we amplify our need and our possession, so much the more do we expose ourselves to the blows and adversities of Fortune.&quot;

===Francis Bacon===
In his &quot;Advancement of Learning&quot;, the English philosopher Francis Bacon, like Marcus and Montaigne, recognizes the difficulty of adhering to temperance in the face of sensations and desires. He writes &quot;that the mind in the nature thereof would be temperate and stayed, if the affections, as winds, did not put it into tumult and perturbation.&quot; He believes this problem applies especially to those fortunate enough to enjoy the security of material comfort. Of these, he says, &quot;great and sudden fortune for the most part defeateth men&quot; and quotes &#x27;s advice that the wealthy ought to emotionally detach from their wealth.

===John Milton===
In &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, the English poet and revolutionary republican John Milton has the Archangel Michael expound on the value of temperance, or what he calls &quot;the rule of not too much&quot;, a virtue he states has the benefit of conferring long life on the temperate person:

However, like Marcus, Montaigne, and Bacon before him, Milton well-estimated the difficulty of attaining temperance. In his essay &quot;Areopagitica&quot;, he writes that temperance requires prudence in differentiating good desires from evil passions, but also that this prudence comes only from an understanding of temptation, a familiarity which could bring an intemperate person under the sway of evil appetites: &quot;He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true wayfaring Christian.&quot;

===Blaise Pascal===
For the French philosopher Blaise Pascal, temperance respects the balance between the two extremities of insatiable desire and total lack thereof. Like Montaigne, Pascal believes it impossible to completely extinguish desire, as advocated by Marcus Aurelius, yet Pascal calls for a curbing of desire. As he writes in his &quot;Pensées&quot;, &quot;Nature has set us so well in the centre, that if we change one side of the balance, we change the other also.&quot; For example, he calls for a balancing temperance in the acts of reading and of drinking wine: &quot;When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing&quot;; &quot;Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same.&quot;

===Immanuel Kant===
In the first section of his &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, German philosopher Immanuel Kant explores temperance as the virtue of &quot;Moderation in the affections and passions, self-control, and calm deliberation&quot; and goes so far as to praise temperance as an essential and beneficial element of every human being&#x27;s potential, even though he thinks ancient philosophers, which would include Marcus Aurelius, mostly accept the virtue as one requiring no qualification. On the other hand, Kant qualifies temperance by warning it could increase the effectiveness of evil acts by the ill-intentioned: &quot;For without the principles of a good will, [temperance] may become extremely bad, and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more dangerous, but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it.&quot; Thus, for Kant, temperance takes on its most important moral effects when it complements the other virtues.

In his &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;, Kant writes that art and science, by sharpening rationality, assist the cultivation of temperance in the face of purely animal or sensual desire, or what he termed &#x27;sense-propensions&#x27;:The beautiful arts and the sciences which, by their universally-communicable pleasure, and by the polish and refinement of society, make man more civilised, if not morally better, win us in large measure from the tyranny of sense-propensions, and thus prepare men for a lordship, in which Reason alone shall have authority[.]

===John Stuart Mill===
John Stuart Mill writes about temperance in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot;. He supports laws against intemperate behavior and asks a rhetorical question:If gambling, or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as injurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as many or most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should not law, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience, endeavour to repress these also?
Mill also supports the cultivation of public opinion against intemperance:
And as a supplement to the unavoidable imperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organise a powerful police against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penalties those who are known to practise them? However, Mill advocates public punishment of intemperance, not of the kind affecting a person&#x27;s close friends and family, but of the kind affecting society at large, and uses the example of a drunk police officer: &quot;No person ought to be punished simply for being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should be punished for being drunk on duty.&quot;

===Charles Darwin===
In his book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, the naturalist Charles Darwin expresses a strong belief in the human ability to cultivate temperance: Man prompted by his conscience, will through long habit acquire such perfect self-command, that his desires and passions will at last yield instantly and without a struggle to his social sympathies and instincts, including his feeling for the judgment of his fellows. The still hungry, or the still revengeful man will not think of stealing food, or of wreaking his vengeance.

Thus, for Darwin, humanity&#x27;s sociability dictates a level of personal restraint, especially as practiced over time by the socialized person. Darwin also states his belief in the likelihood of temperance&#x27;s transmittance from one generation to subsequent generations: &quot;It is possible, or as we shall hereafter see, even probable, that the habit of self-command may, like other habits, be inherited.&quot;

==Religions==
Themes of temperance can be seen across cultures and time.

===Buddhism===
Temperance is an essential part of the Noble Eightfold Path; &quot;Right Effort&quot;, the sixth step on the path, includes , translated as &quot;guarding the sense doors&quot; or &quot;sense restraint&quot;. In the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, often regarded as the first teaching, the Buddha describes the Noble Eightfold Path as the Middle Way of moderation, between the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification. The third and fifth of the five precepts () reflect values of temperance: &quot;misconduct concerning sense pleasures&quot; and drunkenness are to be avoided.

===Christianity===
&quot;Temperance is the moral virtue that moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods.&quot;
The Old Testament emphasizes temperance as a core virtue, as evidenced in the Book of Proverbs. The New Testament does so as well, with forgiveness being central to theology and self-control being one of the Fruits of the Spirit. With regard to Christian theology, the word temperance is used by the King James Version in Galatians for the Greek word (), which means self-control or discipline.

Thomas Aquinas adopted Aristotle&#x27;s set of virtues, which included temperance, and built his own scheme on those. He called temperance a &quot;disposition of the mind which binds the passions&quot;. Temperance is believed to combat the sin of gluttony.

Within Christianity, temperance is a virtue akin to self-control. It is applied to all areas of life. It can especially be viewed in practice among sects like the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and Conservative Mennonites. Temperance is regarded as a virtue that moderates attraction and desire for pleasure and &quot;provides balance in the use of created goods&quot;. 

===Hinduism===
The concept of () in Hinduism is equivalent to temperance. It is sometimes written as (). The word , and Sanskrit derivative words based on it, connote self-control and self-restraint. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (), compassion and love for all sentient life (), and charity (). In Hinduism literature dedicated to yoga, self-restraint is expounded with the concept of (). Self-restraint () is one of the six cardinal virtues of in jnana yoga.

The list of virtues that constitute a moral life evolved in vedas and upanishads. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added, some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a &quot;dharmic&quot; (moral) life: (courage), (forgiveness), (temperance), (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), (purity), (control of senses), (reflective prudence), (wisdom), (truthfulness), and (freedom from anger). In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: (Non-violence), (temperance), (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), (purity), and (truthfulness). This trend of evolving concepts continues in classical Sanskrit literature.

Five types of self-restraints are considered essential for a moral and ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must refrain from any violence that causes injury to others, refrain from starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, refrain from theft of other&#x27;s property, refrain from sexually cheating on one&#x27;s partner, and refrain from avarice. The scope of self-restraint includes one&#x27;s action, the words one speaks or writes, and one&#x27;s thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad which sooner or later haunts and returns to the unrestrained. The theological need for self-restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one&#x27;s action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.

=== Jainism ===
Temperance in Jainism is deeply imbibed in its five major vows which are:
* (nonviolence)
* (truth)
* (chastity or celibacy), 
* (non-stealing)
* (non-possessiveness).

In Jainism, the vow of is not just restricted to not resorting to physical violence, but to violence in all forms either by thought, speech, or action.

On Samvatsari, the last day of Paryushana—the most prominent festival of Jainism—the Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with , seeking their forgiveness. The phrase is also used by Jains throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.

==Contemporary organizations==

The value of temperance is still promoted by more modern sources such as the Boy Scouts, William Bennett, and Benjamin Franklin. Philosophy has contributed a number of lessons to the study of traits, particularly in its study of injunctions and its listing and organizing of virtues.

One set of positive psychology theorists defined temperance to include as facets these four main character strengths: forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.

<text>Eleanor of Lancaster, Countess of Arundel (sometimes called Eleanor [[Plantagenet]]; 11 September 1318 – 11 January 1372) was the fifth daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth.

==First marriage and issue==
Eleanor married, first, on 6 November 1330 John de Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont (d. 1342). He was the son of Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan, 1st Baron Beaumont (c. 1288 – 1340) by his wife Alice Comyn (1289 – 3 July 1349). John died in a tournament on 14 April 1342. They had one son, born to Eleanor in Ghent whilst serving as lady-in-waiting to Queen Philippa of Hainault:
*Henry Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont (4 April 1340 – 25 July 1369), the first husband of Lady Margaret de Vere (d. 15 June 1398), the daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford by his wife Maud de Badlesmere. Henry and Margaret had one son, John Beaumont, 4th Baron Beaumont KG (1361–1396).
In 1341, Eleanor was granted £100 yearly for life by the Exchequer, in recognition of her service to Queen Philippa of Hainault. In 1344 she went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, nominating attorneys in England to manage her estates. 

==Second marriage==
On 5 February 1345 at Ditton Church, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, she married Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. The wedding was attended by King Edward III. Richard&#x27;s previous marriage, to Isabel le Despenser, daughter of Hugh le Despenser, had taken place when they were children. It was annulled by papal mandate as she, since her father&#x27;s attainder and execution, had ceased to be of any importance to him. Pope Clement VI obligingly annulled the marriage, bastardized their son Edmund FitzAlan, and provided a dispensation for FitzAlan&#x27;s second marriage to Eleanor, with whom he had been living in adultery. The dispensation, dated 4 March 1345, was required because his first and second wives were first cousins.

The children of Eleanor&#x27;s second marriage were:

#Richard Fitzalan (1346–1397), who succeeded as 4th Earl of Arundel. He married firstly Elizabeth de Bohun, by whom he had issue, and secondly Philippa Mortimer, and they had no children.
#John Fitzalan (bef. 1349 – 1379), married Eleanor Maltravers, by whom he had issue.
#Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury (c. 1353 – 19 February 1413).
#Lady Joan Fitzalan (1347/1348 – 7 April 1419), married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, by whom she had issue.
#Lady Alice Fitzalan (1350 – 17 March 1416), married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent by whom she had issue.
#Lady Mary FitzAlan (died 29 August 1396), married John Le Strange, 4th Lord Strange of Blackmere, by whom she had issue.
#Lady Eleanor FitzAlan (1348 – 29 August 1396) married Sir Anthony Browne.

==Later life==

Eleanor died at Arundel in Jan 1371/2 and was buried at Lewes Priory in Lewes, East Sussex, England.

Her husband survived her by four years, and was buried beside her; in his will Richard requests to be buried &quot;&quot;near to the tomb of Eleanor de Lancaster, my wife; and I desire that my tomb be no higher than hers, that no men at arms, horses, hearse, or other pomp, be used at my funeral, but only five torches...as was about the corpse of my wife, be allowed&quot;.&quot;

The memorial effigies raised to Eleanor and her husband Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, now in Chichester Cathedral, are the subject of the celebrated Philip Larkin poem &quot;An Arundel Tomb.&quot;

<text>Critical discourse analysis (CDA) uncovers the hidden meanings embedded in texts and conversations. It analyses the way the language used reinforces power relationships, social hierarchies, and ideologies. 

CDA is a critical theory approach to the study of discourse that views language as a form of social practice. CDA combines critique of discourse and explanation of how it figures within and contributes to the existing social reality, as a basis for action to change that existing reality in particular respects. Scholars working in the tradition of CDA generally argue that (non-linguistic) social practice and linguistic practice constitute one another and focus on investigating how societal power relations are established and reinforced through language use. In this sense, it differs from discourse analysis in that it highlights issues of power asymmetries, manipulation, exploitation, and structural inequities in domains such as education, media, and politics.

==Background==
Critical discourse analysis emerged from &#x27;critical linguistics&#x27; developed at the University of East Anglia by Roger Fowler and fellow scholars in the 1970s, and the terms are now often interchangeable. Research in the field of sociolinguistics was paying little attention to social hierarchy and power. CDA was first developed by the Lancaster school of linguists of which Norman Fairclough was the most prominent figure. Ruth Wodak has also made a major contribution to this field of study.

In addition to linguistic theory, the approach draws from social theory, critical theory and contributions from Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Jürgen Habermas, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu—in order to examine ideologies and power relations involved in discourse. Language connects with the social through being the primary domain of ideology, and through being both a site of, and a stake in, struggles for power. Ideology has been called the basis of the social representations of groups, and, in psychological versions of CDA developed by Teun A. van Dijk and Ruth Wodak, there is assumed to be a sociocognitive interface between social structures and discourse structures. The historical dimension in critical discourse studies also plays an important role.

==Methodology==
CDA is an application of discourse analysis; it is generally agreed that methods from discourse studies, the humanities and social sciences may be used in CDA research. This is on the condition that it is able to adequately and relevantly produce insights into the way discourse reproduces (or resists) social and political inequality, power abuse or domination. Examples of power being used by mainstream media have been identified in the work of Stephen Teo in Australia where he found numerous examples of racism in crime reports of Vietnamese youth. He describes the use of headlines used to control the opinions of readers to see and read about crime using what David Altheide calls fear discourse. CDA does not limit its analysis to specific structures of text or talk, but systematically relates these to structures of the sociopolitical context. This was further examined by Pamela D Schulz in her book linking Media reporting of Courts in Australia and in western democracies. Her book &quot;Courts and Judges on Trial: Analysing and Managing Discourses of Disapproval&quot; showed a strong connection between political manipulation of media to encourage &quot;tougher sentencing&quot; while at the same time refraining from changing legislation to ensure that it happens. CDA has been used to examine rhetoric in political speech acts, and any forms of speech that may be used to manipulate the impression given to the audience. However, there have been flaws noted with CDA. For example, it has been said that it is simultaneously too broad to distinctly identify manipulations within the rhetoric, yet is also not powerful enough to appropriately find all that researchers set out to establish.

Norman Fairclough discussed the term CDA in his book &quot;Language and Power.&quot; Fairclough introduced the concepts that are now viewed as vital in CDA such as &quot;discourse, power, ideology, social practice and common sense.&quot; He argues that language should be analyzed as a social practice through the lens of discourse in both speaking and writing.

Fairclough developed a three-dimensional framework for studying discourse, where the aim is to map three separate forms of analysis onto one another: analysis of (spoken or written) language texts, analysis of discourse practice (processes of text production, distribution and consumption) and analysis of discursive events as instances of socio-cultural practice. Particularly, he combines micro, meso and macro-level interpretation. At the micro-level, the analyst considers various aspects of textual/linguistic analysis, for example syntactic analysis, use of metaphor and rhetorical devices. The meso-level or &quot;level of discursive practice&quot; involves studying issues of production and consumption, for instance, which institution produced a text, who is the target audience, etc. At the macro-level, the analyst is concerned with intertextual and interdiscursive elements and tries to take into account the broad, societal currents that are affecting the text being studied.

Teun A. van Dijk&#x27;s approach to critical discourse analysis combines cognitive theories with linguistic and social theories. Van Dijk uses cognition as the middle layer of a three-layer approach consisting of discourse, cognitive and society. By integrating a cognitive approach, researchers are better able to understand how larger social phenomenon are reinforced through popular, everyday discourse. Critics of this practice point out that his approach focuses on the reproduction of ideologies rather than the transformation.

Ruth Wodak has developed a framework based on the systemic collection of sample texts on a topic to better understand the interrelationship of discourses that exist within the field. This framework allows for the discussion and analysis of ideologies involved in a set of discourses. The macro level of analysis is helpful in understanding how macro-structures of inequality persist through discursive processes across multiple sites and texts.

== Applications ==
CDA has been applied to media studies, advertisements texts English language teaching, heritage language, power and ideology, socialization and environmental sciences to name a few.

<doc id="433487" wikidata="Q950456" url="?curid=433487" title="Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster">
<text>Henry, 3rd Earl of Leicester and Lancaster ( – 22 September 1345) was a grandson of King Henry III of England (1216–1272) and was one of the principals behind the deposition of King Edward II (1307–1327), his first cousin.

==Origins==
He was the younger son of Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Leicester, a son of King Henry III by his wife Eleanor of Provence. The Earl Henry&#x27;s mother was Blanche of Artois, Queen Dowager of Navarre. Through his mother, he was a half-brother of Queen Joan I of Navarre.

Henry&#x27;s elder brother Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, succeeded their father in 1296, but Henry was summoned to Parliament on 6 February 1298/99 by writ directed to &quot;Henrico de Lancastre nepoti Regis&quot; (&quot;Henry of Lancaster, nephew of the king&quot;, Edward I), by which he is held to have become Baron Lancaster. He took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock in July 1300.

==Petition for succession and inheritance==
After a period of long-standing opposition to King Edward II and his advisors, including joining two open rebellions, Henry&#x27;s brother Thomas was convicted of treason, executed and had his lands and titles forfeited in 1322. Henry did not participate in his brother&#x27;s rebellions; he later petitioned for his brother&#x27;s lands and titles, and on 29 March 1324 he was invested as Earl of Leicester.

A few years later, shortly after his accession in 1327, the young Edward III of England returned the earldom of Lancaster to him, along with other lordships such as that of Bowland. He may have inherited the Barony of Halton.

==Capture and custody of the King==
On the Queen&#x27;s return to England in September 1326 with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, Henry joined her party against King Edward II, which led to a general desertion of the King&#x27;s cause and overturned the power of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his son Hugh the younger.

Henry was sent in pursuit and captured the King at Neath in South Wales. He was appointed to take charge of the King and was responsible for his custody at Kenilworth Castle.

==Full restoration and reward==
Henry was appointed head of the regency council for the new king, Edward III, and was also appointed captain-general of all the King&#x27;s forces in the Scottish Marches. He was appointed Constable of Lancaster Castle and High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1327. He helped the young king put an end to Mortimer&#x27;s regency and tyranny, having him declared a traitor and executed in 1330.

==Later life and death==
In about the year 1330, he became blind (Prestwich states Henry was going blind around 1329).

Henry spent the last fifteen years of his life at Leicester Castle. There he founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in an extension of the castle bailey. It became known as the Newarke, and Henry was buried in the hospital chapel when he died in 1345. The King and Queen attended his funeral. He was succeeded as Earl of Lancaster and Leicester by his eldest son, Henry of Grosmont, later first Duke of Lancaster. Henry had his father&#x27;s remains moved to the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, which he had built when he enhanced his father&#x27;s foundation.

<text>Aldo Nova is the stage name of Aldo Caporuscio (born November 13, 1956), a Canadian hard rock musician and music producer. He is a guitarist, keyboardist, and vocalist. He gained recognition with his 1982 debut album &quot;Aldo Nova&quot;, which peaked at &quot;Billboard&quot; number 8 position, and its accompanying single, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which reached number 23 on the US &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and boosted sales for its parent album. In 1997, he won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year as co-producer of Celine Dion&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Falling into You&quot;. He co-wrote four songs on the 2000 album &quot;Uno&quot; by La Ley, which won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album.

== Early life ==
Nova was born in Montreal, Quebec, to Italian immigrant parents from a small village near Rome. He adopted the stage name Aldo Nova when he started playing guitar and keyboards at age 15.

== Career ==
=== 1980s–1990s ===
Signing with Portrait Records, Nova released a self-produced album &quot;Aldo Nova&quot; in 1982, that had two singles: &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27; Yourself&quot;. The Top 40 success of &quot;Fantasy&quot; led to Nova being listed as a one-hit wonder by VH1 in 2009.

Nova&#x27;s second album &quot;Subject...Aldo Nova&quot; from 1983, had two singles: &quot;Monkey on Your Back&quot; and &quot;Always Be Mine&quot;. His third album &quot;Twitch&quot; from 1985, had two singles: &quot;Rumours of You&quot; and &quot;Tonite (Lift Me Up)&quot;.

Nova was displeased with the third album and the record company&#x27;s insistence on making a more commercial album. After supporting the &quot;Twitch&quot; album, Nova&#x27;s label refused to release him from his contract, and he stopped working with Portrait. In 1990, Aldo Nova wrote the main guitar riff used in the Jon Bon Jovi song, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;. In 1991, to return the favour, Bon Jovi worked with Nova to release &quot;Blood on the Bricks&quot; on Bon Jovi&#x27;s label Jambco Records. It had three singles: &quot;Blood on the Bricks&quot;, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, and &quot;Someday&quot;.

In addition, Nova produced some early Celine Dion albums. He co-wrote the hit song, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; for Dion, and has been featured playing guitar, synthesizer, and percussion on her records. He also wrote her songs &quot;Your Light&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Fight the Feelin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;You and I&quot; (which was used as Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign song and as the Air Canada theme song). He co-wrote the Blue Öyster Cult song &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and was a member of the Guitar Orchestra of the State Of Imaginos on their album &quot;Imaginos&quot;.

In 1996, he received a Grammy Award as producer for Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;Falling into You&quot; for Album of the Year. In 1997, he released his own album &quot;Nova&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which was seen as a return to his &quot;signature&quot; style of hard rock. He co-wrote the Latin Grammy nominated song &quot;Aqui&quot; for the Chilean rock group La Ley on the album &quot;Uno&quot;. He also co-wrote and co-produced four other tracks on that album, which won a Grammy for best Latin/Alternative/Rock Album.

As a songwriter, Nova&#x27;s hits include Clay Aiken&#x27;s &quot;This Is The Night&quot; (co-written with Chris Braide and Gary Burr), which in the US was a number 1 hit and the best-selling single of 2003. He wrote one and co-wrote more songs on Dion&#x27;s &quot;Taking Chances&quot; album.

=== 2000s–present ===
In 2003, Nova received an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for co-writing the Dion song &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;.

In early 2019, Nova announced to &quot;Loudwire&quot; that he would release a rock opera in June 2020 under the name &quot;The Life and Times of Eddie Gage&quot;. He had been working on the album from 2008. The release was delayed, eventually coming out in the smaller EP format on 1 April 2022.

<doc id="433491" wikidata="Q1276568" url="?curid=433491" title="Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford">
<text>Brigadier-General Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford, KP, MVO (19 October 1864 – 21 August 1915), known as Lord Silchester until 1887, was an Anglo-Irish hereditary peer and soldier.

==Biography==

=== Background and early life ===
Born in Dublin, Longford was the second but eldest surviving son of William Pakenham, 4th Earl of Longford and his wife the Hon Selina Rice-Trevor, daughter of George Rice-Trevor, 4th Baron Dynevor. He succeeded in the earldom on his father&#x27;s death in 1887. Educated at Winchester College, he served in the 2nd Life Guards, into which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1887, achieving the rank of colonel, and also held the honorary post of Lord-Lieutenant of County Longford from 1887 to 1915. In 1901 he was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick.

===Second Boer War and aftermath===
Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Lord Longford was instrumental in forming a company of volunteers from the Irish Hunt for the Imperial Yeomanry, serving in South Africa. He was formally seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry and appointed a captain of the 45th (Dublin) Company on 3 February 1900. The company left for South Africa in the middle of March 1900, and on arrival was attached to the 13th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. He was wounded and returned home the following year. In January 1902 he was again seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry.

He was appointed in command of the 29th Battalion (composed primarily of officers and men from the Irish Horse), with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel (antedated to 1 January 1902), and left Ireland for South Africa in May 1902. As the senior officer, he was in command of almost 1,150 officers and men on board the transport ship &quot;Bavarian&quot; for the journey. They arrived in South Africa after the end of hostilities, as the Peace of Vereeniging was signed on 31 May, and returned home only four months later, leaving Cape Town on the SS &quot;Dilwara&quot; which arrived at Southampton in late October. Lord Longford relinquished command of the 29th battalion on their return.

In Dublin, he was a member of the Kildare Street Club.

While serving on half-pay Longford was promoted to colonel in January 1911. He was placed in command of the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade, a Territorial Force (TF) formation, in April 1912.

===World War I and death===
During World War I, Lord Longford took command of his brigade, which formed part of the 2nd Mounted Division, a yeomanry formation, with the temporary rank of brigadier general, a rank he had been promoted to in August 1914.

The division was initially based in Egypt but was sent dismounted to Suvla on the Gallipoli peninsula as reinforcements during the Battle of Sari Bair. On 21 August 1915 the Division was in reserve for the final attack on Scimitar Hill. When the initial attack by the 29th Division failed, the yeomanry were ordered to advance in the open across a dry salt lake. Raked by shrapnel fire, most of the brigades halted in the shelter of Green Hill but Longford led his brigade in a charge which captured the summit of the hill. As he continued to advance, he was killed. His last words before his death were, reputedly, &quot;Don&#x27;t bother ducking, the men don&#x27;t like it and it doesn&#x27;t do any good…&quot;

Longford&#x27;s body was never recovered as the British made no further advances before the evacuation of Suvla on 20 December. His grave is marked as a special memorial in Green Hill Cemetery at Suvla.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Longford married Lady Mary Julia Child-Villiers, daughter of Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, in 1899. They had two sons and four daughters:

* Edward Arthur Henry Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford (29 December 1902 - 4 February 1961)
* Lady Margaret Pansy Felicia Pakenham (18 May 1904 - 19 February 1999), novelist and biographer, married painter Henry Lamb.
* Francis Aungier &quot;Frank&quot; Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford (5 December 1905 - 3 August 2001)
* Lady Mary Katherine Pakenham (23 August 1907 - 19 March 2010), writer, author of &quot;Christmas at the Savages&quot; and other novels, married Major Meysey Clive.
* Lady Violet Georgiana Pakenham (13 March 1912 - 12 January 2002), writer and critic, married novelist Anthony Powell.
* Lady Julia Agnes Cynthia Pakenham (5 November 1913 - 10 September 1956), married Robert (Robin) Mount, mother of Sir Ferdinand Mount 3rd Bt.

Upon his death in 1915, Lord Longford was succeeded in the earldom by his elder son, Edward. His second son, Frank, later succeeded his elder brother and became a prominent Labour politician. 

The Countess of Longford died in November 1933, aged 56.

<doc id="433497" wikidata="Q2083538" url="?curid=433497" title="Hotsuma Tsutae">
<text>The Hotsuma Tsutae (also &quot;Hotuma Tsutaye&quot;, Japanese 秀真伝) is an elaborate epic poem of Japanese legendary history. It differs substantially from the mainstream version as recorded in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, and its antiquity is undetermined.

Although many proponents allege that the &quot;Hotsuma&quot; predates the mainstream mythology, the first known manuscript was dedicated to a shrine by Waniko Yasutoshi (also known as Yunoshin Ibo) in 1775. Some excerpts were published and translated into modern Japanese in 1884, a printing which was noted by Hirata Atsutane in his work on &quot;jindai moji&quot;, a Japanese writing system developed prior to the use of Chinese characters, but which otherwise ignored the work. Atsutane&#x27;s Kokugaku was principally concerned with the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Hotsuma Tsutae&quot; would have only muddled his theories. Yasutoshi&#x27;s manuscript was almost lost, but was discovered and rescued in 1993 following the publication of some popular books on the subject in the mid-20th century by Yoshinosuke Matsumoto.

The &quot;Hotsuma Tsutae&quot; is known for its text and rhythm. It was written in &quot;yamato-kotoba&quot;, which only uses a Japanese vocabulary which predates contact with China. Some of the &quot;yamato-kotoba&quot; used in &quot;Hotsuma Tsutae&quot; are unattested elsewhere in the Old Japanese corpus but have parallels to old words. Meaning that if it is a late medieval hoax, it is extremely elaborate. Among other things in its primarily historical and non-mythological record, the text discusses the births, lives, and deaths of &quot;kami&quot; from Japanese folk shrines and history; in this case, the word &quot;kami&quot; being used to mean something like royalty and not &quot;gods&quot;. In the poem, Amaterasu, the sun &quot;kami&quot; of Shinto, is male, and not female as is written in the official records. Matsumoto theorizes that Amaterasu was feminized in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; to provide a justification for the reign of Empress Suiko who reigned just before those documents were written.

Although for the most part Japanese academics remain uninterested in this text, some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been written in the Edo period. This is due to claims that the text was written in an original Japanese writing system - in academic circles, the existence of writing in Japan before the use of Chinese characters is denied. Also, the allegedly pre-Chinese Japanese writing system does not match the Old Japanese phonology but rather the phonologies of later stages of Japanese. The general opinion is that it is a false document. However, no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.

<doc id="433505" wikidata="Q815148" url="?curid=433505" title="Siege of Harfleur">
<text>The siege of Harfleur (18 August – 22 September 1415) was conducted by the English army of King Henry V in Normandy, France, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The defenders of Harfleur surrendered to the English on terms and were treated as prisoners of war. It was the first time that an English army made significant use of gunpowder artillery in the siege of a large urban settlement.

The English army was considerably reduced by casualties and an outbreak of dysentery during the siege but marched towards Calais, leaving a garrison behind at the port. The English were intercepted en route and fought the Battle of Agincourt (25 October), inflicting a huge defeat on the French.

==Background==

Henry V of England invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather Edward III, although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on Aquitaine and other French lands (the terms of the Treaty of Brétigny). He initially called a great council in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of John II (who had been captured at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of Normandy, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany and Flanders, as well as Aquitaine. Henry would marry Princess Catherine, the young daughter of Charles VI, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Princess Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415 negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself. In December 1414, the English Parliament was persuaded to grant Henry a &quot;double subsidy&quot;, a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the great council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.

==Invasion and preparation ==
On Tuesday 13 August 1415, Henry landed at Chef-en-Caux in the Seine estuary. Then he attacked Harfleur with at least 2,300 men-at-arms and 9,000 bowmen. The French garrison of 100 men was reinforced by two experienced knights, the Sieur d&#x27;Estouteville and the Sieur de Gaucourt, who arrived with a further 300 men-at-arms and took command.

==Investment and siege==

On 18 August, Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence, led part of the army to set up camp on the far east side of the town. This meant that the town was and a French relief convoy, bearing supplies of guns, powder, arrows, and crossbows, was captured. Details of the siege are not well known but seem to have followed the standard pattern of siege warfare in the Late Middle Ages. After the walls had been seriously damaged by the twelve great guns and other traditional artillery of the English siege train, Henry planned a general assault one month to the day that the town had been enveloped. But the town&#x27;s commanders asked for a parley and terms were agreed that if the French army did not arrive before 23 September, the town would surrender to the English. Harfleur yielded to the invaders on 22 September. The knights were released on parole to gather ransom, and those townspeople who were prepared to swear allegiance to Henry were allowed to remain, while the rest were ordered to depart.

==Aftermath==
Henry left a garrison of 300 men-at-arms and 900 archers in the town. On Monday 8 October the English army set out for Calais. Henry searched for an undefended or weakly defended bridge or ford on the Somme river, hoping to slip past the French army unnoticed, but although he crossed the Somme he failed to evade the French army and was forced to fight the battle of Agincourt.

===Casualties===

During the siege, the English army suffered from dysentery (known as the bloody flux) which continued to affect them after the siege ended. Contemporary sources suggest that Henry V lost up to 5,000 men at Harfleur, principally to disease. Anne Curry, drawing information from existing sick lists, identifies 1,330 men who were invalided home and another 36 who died during the siege. She believes these numbers represent a close maximum of English casualties and estimated that the English numbered around 9,000 at Agincourt. Several historians criticised her methodology and preferred to maintain the higher casualty rates, pointing out that existing records are incomplete and that they are not reliable ways to estimate total troop numbers. Clifford J. Rogers considers the number of 36 deaths to be impossibly low and finds the higher contemporary figures believable, citing other historical examples of armies being heavily hit by dysentery. In the second edition of his volume &quot;Cursed Kings...&quot; (2016) Jonathan Sumption wrote that less the Harfleur garrison, the English army numbered 900 men-at-arms and 5,000 archers when the march began.

==In popular culture==
As it forms a crucial episode in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Henry V&quot;, the siege is portrayed in all cinematic adaptations, including the 1944 film by Laurence Olivier, the 1989 film by Kenneth Branagh, the 2012 television film, as well as the 2019 film by David Michôd. It is also fictionally portrayed in the historical novel &quot;Azincourt&quot; (2008) by Bernard Cornwell as well as the children&#x27;s novel &quot;My Story: A Hail of Arrows&quot; (2009) by Michael Cox, and the Danish novel &quot;The Highest Honour&quot; (2009) by Susanne Clod Pedersen.

The island was originally called Isla Raza de Buena Gente and later Rattlesnake Island. It was renamed Terminal Island in 1891.

In 1909, the newly reincorporated Southern California Edison Company decided to build a new steam station to provide reserve capacity and emergency power for the entire Edison system and to enable Edison to shut down some of its small, obsolete steam plants. The site chosen for the new plant was on a barren mudflat known as Rattlesnake Island, today&#x27;s Terminal Island in the San Pedro Bay. Construction of Plant No. 1 began in 1910.

The land area of Terminal Island has been supplemented considerably from its original size. In 1909 the city of Los Angeles annexed the city of Wilmington. During this time the &quot;Father of the Harbor&quot; Phineas Banning, held deed to roughly 18 acres of land on Rattlesnake Island. Phineas Banning was instrumental in bringing innovative changes to San Pedro Bay and made the first steps towards expansion. Once annexed with the city of Los Angeles the expansion was completed. In the late 1920s, Deadman&#x27;s Island in the main channel of the Port of Los Angeles was dynamited and dredged away, and the resulting rubble was used to add to Terminal Island&#x27;s southern tip.

In 1930, the Ford Motor Company built a facility called Long Beach Assembly, having moved earlier operations from Downtown Los Angeles. The factory remained until 1958 when manufacturing operations were moved inland to Pico Rivera.

In 1927, a civilian facility, Allen Field, was established on Terminal Island. The Naval Reserve established a training center at the field and later took complete control, designating the field Naval Air Base San Pedro (also called Reeves Field). In 1941, the Long Beach Naval Station was located adjacent to the airfield. In 1942, the Naval Reserve Training Facility was transferred, and a year later NAB San Pedro&#x27;s status was downgraded to a Naval Air Station (NAS Terminal Island). Reeves Field as a Naval Air Station was disestablished in 1947, although the adjacent Long Beach Naval Station continued to use Reeves Field as an auxiliary airfield until the late 1990s. A large industrial facility now covers the site of the former Naval Air Station.

====Japanese American Fishing community====
Starting in 1906, a thriving Japanese American fishing community became established on Terminal Island in an area known as East San Pedro or Fish Island. Because of the island&#x27;s relative geographical isolation, its inhabitants developed their own culture and even their own dialect. The dialect, known as &quot;kii-shu ben&quot; (or &quot;Terminal Island lingo&quot;), was a mix of English and the dialect of Kii Province, where many residents hailed from. Prior to World War II, the island was home to about 3,500 first- and second-generation Japanese Americans.

Like many Japanese immigrants, the initial settlers who came to America were Dekasegi, immigrants who intended to work short time in the U.S. and then return to Japan with their built-up coffers. Many of these immigrants first arrived in Santa Monica with the hopes of creating a community there, but after their town was burned to the ground in 1916, they found their home at Terminal Island. Growing fishing interests in San Pedro&#x27;s White Point and Terminal Island led many Japanese to become sought after due to their skill as fishermen, and connections to the canning industry. The first major sign of the community&#x27;s forming came in the form of the Southern California Japanese Fishermen&#x27;s Association (SCJFA), a political and social body. On January 26, 1918, their efforts were rewarded with a completed assembly hall for the community. The Hall&#x27;s grand opening saw lots of local coverage, and even a sumo mound!

The community saw some major political activism at the time as well, particularly combatting anti-Japanese racism. One such example was the actions of Kihei Nasu (a bilingual intellectual) that was hired by the SCJFA to write a report refuting recent attempts by Senator James D. Phelan of California that the Japanese were driving out American fishermen. According to Nasu, if the Japanese were cornering the market:If the Japanese, who are only one-third of the fishermen, are driving out American fishermen, but do not only not drive out the other foreign fishermen but are actually outnumbered two to one by them? The statement of Senator Phelan seems so illogical that it should fall of its own weight.While the report was not delivered in person to Congress, it reveals the challenges the community faced and their persistence in fighting back.

The lands of Fish Harbor were owned by the City of Los Angeles, and leased out to the respective canning companies, who in turn, built workers housing. The workers’ houses were often small wooden abodes of the same make &amp; model, that were very cramped/close-quartered. The main thoroughfare was Tuna Street, which was where many local businesses were housed. The businesses themselves were so communally driven that they would look out for the interests of the community before seeking profit/competition. As noted above, fishing was integral to local ways of life, with the men being absent from family life for weeks or even months at a time. Women and young children often worked in the canneries, which was often grueling work, needing to be done as soon as the fishermen arrived with their catch. For the children, schooling was the most important aspect of life, with the Kibei Nisei (roughly translating to returning Nisei)—who were sent away for education in Japan, returned with the most opportunities. Cultural infusions were becoming very popular, with the Skippers (the local baseball team) and Kendo (a martial art) being the most popular aspects of life for the youth. Finally, interethnic relationships were quite strong among the Japanese and other ethnicities, particularly local white cannery owners. One such person, Wilbur F. Wood, was very often seen as very kind towards the Japanese Americans, especially realizing their strength as fishermen. Tensions did brew however between local unions, but this was nothing new in American history.

On December 7, 1941, the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii was attacked in a surprise air raid by the Japanese Navy, which affected the United States’ relationships with Japan and its citizens.  As U.S.-Japanese relations frayed further in the late 1930s and early 1940s, nativist organizations raised new questions about the loyalty of Japanese Americans living in the country. On February 19, 1942, two months after the attack, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066.  The order authorized the removal of all people deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast to one of the ten relocation camps across the nation. Immediately after Executive Order 9066 was authorized, Japanese Americans of Terminal Island were among the first groups to be forcibly removed from their homes. Japanese men were the first taken into custody. They were put on trains and could not see where they were being taken, because the blinds were drawn. Residents were only given 48 hours to evacuate their homes and forced to leave everything they owned behind and relocate to the detention centers. Everyone was ordered to leave Terminal Island, even if they were not Japanese, because the United States military took control of the land. Terminal Island was a fishing village, located next to a United States Navy facility, which ultimately resulted in the Japanese Americans becoming fishermen. As a result of their occupation and location, they were accused of being spies for the Japanese army through the use of depth meters and fishing equipment, prior to the attack. The Justice Department and the Office of Naval Intelligence claimed that the fishermen had the ability to contact enemy vessels with their boats, radios, and equipment. The FBI raided the homes of the Japanese Americans and searched for contraband which included, radios, flashlights, cameras, and morse code telegraph machines. Out of the ten relocation camps, Manzanar in the Owens Valley was where most Terminal Island residents were incarcerated.

           In 1945, many of the Japanese Americans who were interned began getting released.  They thought that they were going back to the homes and the community they had built, however, they were completely destroyed. It was the only community where the built environment had vanished almost completely. They were given $25 and a ticket home, but they returned to nothing and were forced to relocate. The Navy was responsible for razing the homes and structures of the Japanese Americans of Terminal Island.

           In 1971, twenty-three Japanese Americans who were former residents of Terminal Island established a new group called the Terminal Islanders. It was established in an effort to preserve the essence of their beloved community.  In 2002, a memorial was established on Terminal Island by surviving second generation citizens to honor their Issei parents and preserve the memory of their Furusato, which means hometown. Terminal Island is now protected under a perseveration plan established by the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners, so the struggle and history are not forgotten.

===World War II and beyond===
During World War II, Terminal Island was an important center for defense industries, especially shipbuilding; the first California Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard was established there in 1941. It was also, therefore, one of the first places where African Americans tried to effect their integration into defense-related work on the West Coast.

The San Pedro yard of Bethlehem Steel was also located on the Island. 26 destroyers were built there following the mobilization of the warship industry by the Two-Ocean Navy Act of July 1940. The yard was the third largest of the kind on the West Coast, behind the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation (&quot;Todd Pacific&quot;) in Puget Sound and Bethlehem&#x27;s own San Francisco yards (Union Iron Works).

In 1943, Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company became Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division.

Also in the Port of Los Angeles (but not on the Island) was the Wilmington yard of Consolidated Steel.

In 1946, Howard Hughes moved his monstrous Spruce Goose airplane from his plant in Culver City to Terminal Island in preparation for its test flight. In its first and only flight, it took off from the island on November 2, 1947.

Brotherhood Raceway Park, a mile drag racing strip, opened in 1974 on former US Navy land. It operated, with many interruptions, until finally closing in 1995 to be replaced by a coal-handling facility.

Preservation of vacant buildings earned the island a spot on the top 11 sites on the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s 2012 Most Endangered Historic Places List. In mid-2013, the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners approved a preservation plan. The trust cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013.

==Current use==

The west half of the island is part of the San Pedro area of the city of Los Angeles, while the rest is part of the city of Long Beach. The island has a land area of 11.56 km2 (4.46 sq mi), or , and had a population of 1,467 at the 2000 census. 

The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach are the major landowners on the island, who in turn lease much of their land for container terminals and bulk terminals. The island also hosts canneries, shipyards, and United States Coast Guard facilities.

The Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, which began operating in 1938, hosts more than 900 low security federal prisoners.

The Long Beach Naval Shipyard, decommissioned in 1997, occupied roughly half of the island. Sea Launch maintains docking facilities on the mole that was part of the naval station.

Aerospace company SpaceX is initially leasing from the Port of Los Angeles on the island at Berth 240. They will refurbish five buildings and raise a tent-like structure for research, design, and manufacturing. SpaceX has been building and testing its planned Starship crewed space transportation system intended for suborbital, orbital and interplanetary flight in Texas. The new SpaceX rocket, too large to be transported for long distances overland, will be shipped to the company&#x27;s launch area in Florida or Texas by sea, via the Panama Canal. The site was used for shipbuilding from 1918, and was formerly operated by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and then the Southwest Marine Shipyard. The location has been disused since 2005.

==Bridges==

Terminal Island is connected to the mainland via four bridges. To the west, the distinctive green Vincent Thomas Bridge, the fourth-longest suspension bridge in California, connects it with the Los Angeles neighborhood of San Pedro. The Long Beach International Gateway, the longest cable-stayed bridge in California, connects the island with downtown Long Beach to the east. The Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge joins Terminal Island with the Los Angeles neighborhood of Wilmington to the north. Adjacent to the Heim Bridge is a rail bridge called the Henry Ford Bridge, or the Badger Avenue Bridge.

<doc id="433508" wikidata="Q447802" url="?curid=433508" title="Edmund Crouchback">
<text>Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster (16 January 12455 June 1296), also known as Edmund Crouchback, was a member of the royal Plantagenet Dynasty and the founder of the first House of Lancaster. He was Earl of Leicester (1265–1296), Lancaster (1267–1296) and Derby (1269–1296) in England and Count Palatine of Champagne (1276–1284) in France. 

Named after the 9th-century saint, Edmund was the second surviving son of King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence and the younger brother of King Edward I of England, to whom he was loyal as a diplomat and warrior. In 1254, the 9-year-old Edmund became involved in the &quot;Sicilian business&quot;, in which his father accepted a papal offer granting the Kingdom of Sicily to Edmund, who made preparations to become king. However, Henry III could not provide funds for the operation, prompting the Papacy to withdraw the grant and give it to Edmund&#x27;s uncle, Charles I of Anjou. The &quot;Sicilian business&quot; outraged the barons led by the Earl of Leicester and Edmund&#x27;s uncle, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and was cited as one of the reasons for limiting Henry&#x27;s power. Deterioration of relations between the barons and the king resulted in the Second Barons&#x27; War, in which the royal government, supported by Edmund, triumphed over the baronage following the death of Montfort in the Battle of Evesham in 1265. 

Edmund received the lands and titles of Montfort and the defeated barons Nicholas Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave and Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby, and became Earl of Lancaster, Leicester and Derby. Primarily known as the earl of the first county, he eventually became the most powerful baron of England. Later, Edmund accompanied his elder brother Edward on his crusade in the Holy Land, where his epithet &quot;Crouchback&quot; originated from a corruption of &#x27;cross back&#x27;, referring to him wearing a stitched cross on his garments. Following the death of his first wife, Aveline de Forz, Edmund&#x27;s aunt and Dowager Queen of France Margaret of Provence arranged his second marriage to Blanche of Artois, the recently widowed Queen Dowager of Navarre and the Countess of Champagne. With his second wife Blanche, Edmund governed Champagne as count palatine in the name of his stepdaughter Joan until she came of age. Edmund was active in supporting his family members, such as assisting Edward in conquering Wales, advocating for the claims of his aunt Margaret against his uncle Charles I of Anjou in his mother and aunt&#x27;s homeland of Provence and managing Ponthieu on behalf of his sister-in-law, Eleanor of Castile.

When Edmund&#x27;s stepson-in-law, King Philip IV of France, demanded Edward, who was also his vassal through Gascony, to come to Paris to answer charges of damages caused by English mariners in 1293, Edward sent Edmund to mediate the crisis to avert war. Edmund negotiated an agreement with Philip where France would occupy Gascony for 40 days, and Edward would marry Philip&#x27;s half-sister, Margaret. When the 40 days were over, Philip tricked Edward and Edmund by refusing to relinquish control over Gascony, calling Edward to again answer for his charges. Edmund and Edward then renounced their homages to Philip and prepared for war against France. Edmund sailed for Gascony with his army and besieged the city of Bordeaux. Unable to pay his troops, Edmund was deserted by his army and retreated to Bayonne, where he died from illness in 1296. Edmund&#x27;s body was brought back to England, where he was buried in Westminster Abbey in 1301.

== Early years, 1245–1265 ==

=== Birth and childhood ===

Edmund was born in London to King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence on 16 January 1245. Henry named him after the martyred and canonised 9th-century East Anglian king, whom Henry prayed to for a second son. He was a younger brother of Edward (later King Edward I of England), Margaret and Beatrice, and an elder brother of Catherine. Edmund spent most of his childhood at Windsor Castle alongside his siblings. He grew emotionally attached to his father Henry, who rarely spent extended periods apart from his family.

=== Sicilian business ===

In 1254, Henry accepted a papal offer from Pope Innocent IV to make Edmund the next king of Sicily. Sicily had been ruled by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was a rival to Innocent for many years; the papacy hoped for a friendlier ruler to succeed Frederick following his death in 1250. For Henry, Sicily was a valuable prize for his son and would also provide a base to launch his planned crusades in the east. Innocent tasked Henry with sending Edmund and an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick&#x27;s son, Manfred, King of Sicily, and to cover expenses and debts up to a total of £135,000, for which the papacy would provide assistance in funding.

The nine-year-old Edmund made preparations to become king, sailing to Gascony with his mother, Eleanor, in May 1254. In Bordeaux, on 3 October, Edmund granted his granduncle Count Thomas of Flanders the Principality of Capua before returning home in December of that year. On 18 October 1255, Edmund received a ceremonial investiture in Sicily, where his father Henry styled him as king and presented him with a ring. In April 1256, Edmund proposed marriage to Plaisance of Antioch, the queen of Cyprus and Lady of Beirut. In April 1257, Henry paraded Edmund in Parliament dressed in Italian clothing to appeal for funds. He also suggested marrying Edmund to a daughter of Manfred to resolve the &quot;Sicilian business&quot; in the summer of that year.

Prospects turned grim when Pope Alexander IV succeeded Innocent and faced military pressure from the Holy Roman Empire. Alexander could no longer finance Henry&#x27;s expenses and instead demanded that Henry pay £90,000 in debts to the Papacy as compensation for the war. This was an enormous sum, and Henry found himself desperate for funds. He sought assistance from Parliament, but his request was denied. Despite further attempts, Parliament only granted to Henry. Growing impatient, Alexander sent an envoy to Henry in 1258, threatening him with excommunication unless he paid his debts and sent an army to Sicily. Failing to convince Parliament further, Henry resorted to extorting money from the senior clergy, raising approximately £40,000. Subsequently, at some point between 1258 and 1263—either under Alexander or Pope Urban IV—the papacy revoked the grant of the Kingdom of Sicily to Edmund and instead bestowed the title upon Edmund&#x27;s uncle, Charles I of Anjou.

=== Second Barons&#x27; War ===

The barons, led by Edmund&#x27;s uncle, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, cited the &#x27;Sicilian business&#x27; as one of their grievances against Edmund&#x27;s father, King Henry III of England. This led to Henry&#x27;s signing of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258, which curtailed his power as well as that of the major barons. However, Edmund collaborated with Henry and his brother Edward to overturn the Provisions in midsummer of 1262. Power in England swung back and forth between Henry and the barons, culminating in the Treaty of Kingston, under which disputes were to be resolved by Edmund&#x27;s uncles, Richard of Cornwall and King Louis IX of France. 

Despite the treaty, an open civil war erupted between the royal government and the radical barons led by Simon in the summer of 1263, prompting Edmund to flee from the Tower of London to Dover Castle. On 10 July, Henry wrote to Edmund and Robert de Glaston, the constable of Dover Castle, urging them to surrender the castle to the Bishop of London, Henry of Sandwich, who represented the barons, in preparation for peace negotiations. However, in a letter dated 28 July, Edmund and Robert refused to comply, arguing that surrendering the castle would go against their duties until peace was established. As a result, Henry had to personally command them to relinquish the castle.

When Simon&#x27;s coalition of barons showed signs of fragmentation, Henry appealed to Louis for arbitration in the dispute, as stipulated in the Treaty of Kingston. Initially resistant to this, Simon eventually agreed to French arbitration, and representatives of Henry and Simon traveled to Paris. On 23 January 1264, Louis declared in the Mise of Amiens that Henry had the right to rule over the barons, thereby annulling the Provisions of Oxford. However, the French decision was unpopular; upon Henry&#x27;s return to England unrest brewed and violence became imminent.

The Second Barons&#x27; War finally erupted in April 1264 when Henry&#x27;s army occupied Simon&#x27;s territories in the Midlands and advanced to reoccupy a route to France in the southeast. Accompanied by his mother, Eleanor, Edmund went to France, where he helped to raise a mercenary army, with financial assistance from his uncle Louis, to support his father. Despite Simon&#x27;s capture of Henry, Richard and Edward in the Baronial victory at Lewes on 14 May, he failed to consolidate his control over England and Edward managed to escape captivity. Following the Baronial defeat at Evesham on 4 August 1265, Simon was killed and dismembered by the royal army, and his lands and title as Earl of Leicester were forfeited.

=== Becoming earl ===

On 26 October 1265, Edmund became the Earl of Leicester when his father, King Henry III of England, granted him the title and associated lands, following the re-creation of the earldom. Additionally, he received all the lands that had belonged to Nicholas Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave, a rebel baron. Once the king&#x27;s victory over the barons was assured, Edmund returned to England on 30 October 1265. As a political refugee, he harboured a desire for revenge against the barons. Alongside his brother Edward, Edmund focused on suppressing the rebel barons known as the &quot;disinherited,&quot; whose lands had been confiscated by the royal government. On 6 December of the same year, Edmund gained control of the castles of Cardigan and Carmarthen, and on 8 January 1266, he acquired the demesnes of Dilwyn, Lugwardine, Marden, Minsterworth and Rodley.On 28 June of the same year, Edmund acquired the forfeited estates of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby, whose family had held a significant feudatory since the time of Stephen, King of England. During the Second Barons&#x27; War, Robert was seen as an unreliable and violent ally to the barons, as he failed to appear promptly at the Battle of Lewes. Moreover, Robert had engaged in indiscriminate raids on lands belonging to his rival, Edward. As a result, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, imprisoned him, fearing his excessive power. After receiving a pardon from Henry, Robert rebelled once again and was captured following his defeat at the Battle of Chesterfield on 15 May of that year. Edmund compelled Robert to agree that he would regain his estates upon payment of an exceedingly hefty sum, fully aware that Robert would be unable to afford such a penalty. This allowed Edmund to retain control of Robert&#x27;s estates. When Edward ascended to the throne, he granted Robert&#x27;s former domain of Chartley Castle to Edmund on 26 July 1276 and absolved Edmund from the debts owed by Robert and his ancestors on 5 May 1277. 

During the summer of 1266, Edmund led an army in Warwick to counter the raids carried out by the rebels occupying Kenilworth Castle. The Kenilworth garrison attempted to attack Warwick, but Edmund&#x27;s forces successfully repelled them back to the castle. Subsequently, the royal army besieged Kenilworth Castle, with Edmund commanding one of the four divisions alongside Henry and Edward. The siege concluded on 13 December with the implementation of the Dictum of Kenilworth, which brought peace between the king and the baronial forces by 31 October. Either in the same month or the following year, Edmund acquired Kenilworth Castle.

Since Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of the Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd was an ally of the barons, Henry dispatched Edmund, along with his Justiciar, Robert Walerand, on a diplomatic mission to negotiate peace with the prince on 21 February 1267. However, Llywelyn refused to make peace with the English until September, when Henry threatened to invade Gwynedd. Edmund continued his diplomatic activities by attending the knighting ceremony of his cousin Philip, conducted by his uncle King Louis IX of France, in Paris on 4 June. During his visit, he received the hospitality of Robert II, Count of Artois, and Robert&#x27;s sister Blanche of Artois.

On 30 June 1267, Edmund became the Earl of Lancaster following the title&#x27;s creation by Henry, and he was granted the royal demesne lands in Lancashire, along with the lordships of Lancaster, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Pickering. Edmund was also earl of Leicester and later Derby, though he is mostly associated with the earldom of Lancaster. On the same day, Edward granted Edmund the Three Castles and Monmouth Castle in Wales. The following year, Henry appointed Edmund as the Constable of Leicester Castle, a royal possession held in the king&#x27;s name. The conclusion of the Second Barons&#x27; War marked a significant turning point in Edmund&#x27;s life. Although he had been disappointed by losing the Sicilian crown to his uncle Charles I of Anjou, he had now received a powerful earldom that established the Lancastrian branch of the Plantagenet dynasty. By this time, Edmund had gained a reputation as a ruthless and formidable warrior. With these acquisitions, he became the most influential peer in England. Even upon becoming king, Edward was not worried about Edmund&#x27;s powerful position or the affairs of most of the baronage because of Edmund&#x27;s unwavering loyalty to him.

=== First marriage and crusading ===
In the Holy Land, under the leadership of the Baibars, the Mamluks captured the city of Antioch, the last remnant of the principality that bears its namesake. The fall of the city led the papal legate of England, Ottobuono—the future Pope Adrian V—to preach for a new crusade. In an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268, Edmund pledged himself to undertake a crusade alongside his elder brother Edward and their cousin Henry of Almain. However, after years of civil war, the English crown had depleted its funds and could not support a crusade. Edward was forced to borrow a loan from his uncle, King Louis IX of France, who was organizing a large crusader force with the intent of invading Tunis. Despite being in a better position with his newly received earldom, Edmund hastened to marry a wealthy lady to fund the crusade.

On 20 November 1268, King Henry III of England, Edmund&#x27;s father, arranged a marriage between Edmund and the recently widowed Isabel de Forz, 8th Countess of Devon. Isabel was a wealthy countess, holding the earldoms of Devon and Aumale, as well as the lordships of Holderness and the Isle of Wight. However, Edmund wanted to ensure the security of his inheritance and decided to marry Isabel&#x27;s daughter, Aveline de Forz, Countess of Aumale. The marriage between Edmund and Aveline was arranged by Edmund&#x27;s mother, Eleanor of Provence. On 8 or 9 April 1269, Edmund married 10-year-old Aveline, who was 14 years his junior, in Westminster Abbey; the marriage could not be consummated until she turned 14. During 1269, Edmund and his brother Edward prepared for the crusade, although they also participated in carrying the remains of Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey following the partial completion of the church&#x27;s reconstruction by Henry on 13 October 1269. In addition, Edmund assumed the title of Earl of Derby because Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby, was unable to fulfill his obligations. As a result, Edmund merged the title and estates of the Earldom with his Earldoms of Leicester and Lancaster.

In the summer of 1270, Edmund and Edward were delayed in joining Louis on the crusade because their father was indecisive about participating. Upon the advice of his councilors, Henry chose to remain in England, while Edward led the first group of English crusaders, setting sail from Dover on 20 August that year. The crusaders&#x27; plans failed when an epidemic broke out in their camp, killing Louis on 25 August. Edward arrived at Tunis on 10 November 1270, but it was too late to engage in battle due to the Treaty of Tunis, which had been signed on 30 October. As a result, most of the crusaders returned home. 

Between 25 February and 4 March 1271, Edmund embarked for the Holy Land, leaving his mother Eleanor in charge of his estates. Edward had already set off on a crusade to Palestine to support Bohemund VI of Antioch, and arrived in Acre on 9 May 1271. In September 1271, Edmund arrived with a larger army, reinforced by King Hugh III of Cyprus, to assist his brother. Despite some successes, such as the raid on Qaqun—where the crusaders reportedly killed one thousand Turkomans—the seizure of numerous cattle and the repulsion of several Mamluk attacks, the limited size of the crusader forces compelled Hugh to sign a 10 year truce with Baibars in May 1272, much to Edward&#x27;s dismay. With the crusade coming to an end, Edmund returned to England around 6 December, where he was greeted by jubilant crowds in London. However, Edmund&#x27;s crusade proved futile and incurred significant expenses.

Historians Peter Heylyn and Simon Lloyd believe that Edumund received his epithet &#x27;Crouchback&#x27; during the crusade, suggesting it as a corruption of &#x27;crossback&#x27;, as Edmund wore a cross stitched into the back of his garments while on the crusade. In 1394, John of Gaunt, the founder of the second House of Lancaster and the husband of Edmund&#x27;s great-granddaughter Blanche of Lancaster, interpreted the epithet differently, believing that Edmund was a hunchback. According to chronicler John Hardyng, John would forge chronicles to assert that Edmund was the elder brother and not Edward, claiming that the crown passed over him due to his physical deformity. However, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, presented evidence countering these claims, stating that the chronicles described Edmund as a handsome knight who was skilled in combat.

=== Second marriage to Blanche of Artois ===

Edmund&#x27;s father King Henry III of England died on 16 November 1272, and Edmund&#x27;s elder brother Edward was proclaimed king. However, Edward was on his way back to England from the Holy Land and his journey was slow, as Edward had to negotiate with King Philip III of France about several claims and put down a Gascon revolt. A rumour spread that Edward was never going to return to England, leading to a growing rebellion in the northern part of the country. Edmund then dispersed the rebels with Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer of Wigmore. In 1273, Edmund&#x27;s wife Aveline turned fourteen and Edmund consummated his marriage with her. 

Edward returned to England on 2 August 1274, and he was crowned King Edward I of England on 19 August 1274. Edmund succeeded him as Lord High Steward of England the following day. On 10 November 1274, Aveline suddenly died, leaving Edmund with no children and dashing his hopes to inherit Aveline&#x27;s titles and earldoms. Edmund&#x27;s maternal aunt and the Queen Dowager of France Margaret of Provence wanted to secure a wealthy bride for her nephew not only for familial reasons, but to convince Edmund&#x27;s brother Edward to support her claims to Provence against Charles I of Anjou, King of Sicily.

Margaret pushed for the marriage of Edmund and Blanche of Artois, Queen Dowager of Navarre and widow of King Henry I of Navarre, and the Countess of the wealthy and powerful County of Champagne and Brie, which made up more than Edmund&#x27;s lost possessions. Blanche accepted the match because she needed a second husband who was congenial to King Philip III of France—who was Edmund&#x27;s cousin—to help manage Champagne with her. However, the chronicler John of Trokelowe reported that Edmund and Blanche had also known of each others&#x27; reputations as a chivalrous knight and a skilled and beautiful regent, respectively, and they became mutually attracted to each other. Blanche&#x27;s brother Robert II, Count of Artois, an ally to Charles, was furious upon hearing about their engagement, believing the English to still be hostile to France. Edward, meanwhile, was neutral toward the couple&#x27;s betrothal, seeing it as nothing more than an additional familial link with his French relatives.

On 6 August 1275, Edmund received a writ of protection to travel overseas from England to France to meet his bride. Between December 1275 and January 1276 in Paris, Edmund married Blanche, three years his junior, and thus became a stepfather to Blanche&#x27;s daughter Joan. In the name of Joan, Edmund became the count palatine of Champagne and would govern the County along with his wife until Joan reached the age of majority. In January 1276, Edmund paid homage to Philip III, becoming his vassal. The kings of France struggled in controlling Champagne as a vassal until Joan&#x27;s betrothal to Philip the Fair, the son of Philip III, which allowed Philip III to fully control the county. Due to his commitments elsewhere, Edmund could only administer Champagne intermittently, with the Grand Butler of France John II of Brienne serving in his absence. In June, Edmund brought Blanche to England to see his English possessions and in July he made a journey to his wife&#x27;s kingdom of Navarre, around the same time Blanche&#x27;s brother Robert was pacifying the region.

=== Commander at Wales and diplomat ===

Following the deterioration of relations between England and Gwynedd, Edmund&#x27;s brother King Edward I of England declared war in November 1276. In early 1277, Edmund was summoned to return to England by Edward, along with other English nobles, to proceed against the Prince of Wales, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. Edmund succeeded Payne de Chaworth as &quot;capitaneus&quot; of the royal forces in South Wales in April and launched military operations against the Welsh alongside Roger Mortimer and William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Payne had previously had success in the valley of the River Towy, capturing the castles of Dryslywn, Dinefwr, Carreg Cennan and Llandovery, allowing Edmund, who assumed his command, to push further north, seizing the lands of the Welsh noble Rhys ab Maelgwyn and taking Aberystwyth at the end of July 1277. Edmund assigned his troops to rebuild Aberystwyth Castle, then known as Llanbadarn Castle, and returned to England on 20 September, assigning Roger Myles as constable of the castle. The war ended with the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, with Gwynedd surrendering and ceding control over his vassals and conquered territories.

In 1278, Edmund travelled to his dominion of Champagne to administer the county, after which he returned to England to approve and attend the wedding of Llywelyn and his cousin Eleanor de Montfort, the daughter of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, in Worcester. In the same year, Edmund&#x27;s wife Blanche gave birth to their son Thomas, who became heir to the Earldom of Lancaster and all of Edmund&#x27;s domains. The next year, Edward appointed Edmund to be Ambassador to France to negotiate with their cousin King Philip III of France regarding the English claims on the Counties of Agenais and Quercy as part of the dowry of Edmund and Edward&#x27;s grand-aunt Joan of England, which were under the control of Alphonse, Count of Poitiers. 

Since Alphonse died without issue, according to the Treaty of Abbeville of 1259 signed between England and France, the counties as part of Joan&#x27;s dowry were to be returned to the English crown. Edmund signed a treaty with Philip in May 1279, with Philip renouncing his 1275 oath of allegiance to the vassals of Aquitaine and ceding only Agenais to the English, as he did not believe Quercy to be a part of Joan&#x27;s dowry. In addition, with the approval of Philip, Edmund started governing the County of Ponthieu alongside his brother-in-law (through his sister Beatrice) Duke John II of Brittany on behalf of his sister-in-law Eleanor of Castile, who inherited the County as Countess following the death of her mother Joan of Dammartin in 1279.

=== Business in France ===

In January 1280, a mob formed in Provins, the capital of Brie and also part of the County of Champagne, following the implementation of an unpopular tax, and installed Gilbert de Morry as mayor, killing the previous mayor William Pentecost. Edmund and the Grand Butler of France John II of Brienne marched to Provins with an army, and the leaders of the mob fled, leaving the gates open. Edmund and John forfeited the town&#x27;s privileges and authorities, disarmed the inhabitants of Provins and condemned the leaders of the mob to death or banishment, with Gilbert being excommunicated. John was more ruthless in punishing the inhabitants of Provins than Edmund; according to a chronicler of the abbey of Saint-Magloire, John ordered hangings, beheadings and mutilations. Edmund went back to visit his estates in England following his chastisement of Provins. 

Edmund returned to France and pardoned the town of Provins in July 1281 through the meditation of several church officials and Gilles de Brion, the grand mayor of Donnemarie and brother of Pope Martin IV. Edmund returned privileges to the town, and allowed the inhabitants of Provins to build new fountains, acquire buildings for their courts and establish a bell to mark the work hours and curfew; in exchange, he enacted a harsh tax on the town. The prosperity of Provins soon declined, in contrast to Leicester, a town in Edmund&#x27;s English domains that saw major growth during his reign. In the same year, Blanche gave birth to Edmund&#x27;s second son Henry, whose son Henry of Grosmont would eventually become a powerful leader of England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

In the autumn of 1281, Edmund, as Count Palatine of Champagne, joined forces in Mâcon in October with Philip I of Savoy, Robert II of Burgundy, Otto IV of Burgundy and other nobles to support the claims of his aunt Margaret of Provence to her homeland of Provence against his uncle Charles I of Anjou, who had solidified his control over the region and was unwilling to negotiate. Edmund and the nobles assembled their forces at Lyon in May 1282 to invade Provence, but the eruption of the Sicilian Vespers forced Charles to rent out Provence to Margaret, averting war. That same month, Edmund heard that Wales had launched a war against England, and returned to England to command the English army in South Wales. The Prince of Wales Llywelyn ap Gruffudd retreated southwards when Edward&#x27;s army pressed hard in North Wales, but a detachment of Edmund&#x27;s army lured Llywelyn into a trap and killed him in the Battle of Orewin Bridge on 11 December 1282. Edward finalized his conquest of Wales through the capture of Llywelyn&#x27;s brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd in June 1283, who succeeded Llywelyn as Prince of Wales in December.

=== Ceding Champagne and managing England ===
As Joan approached the age of 11, the age of majority in France, Edmund debated with his cousin King Philip III of France about whether Joan would still be under his guardianship until she turned 21, in accordance with the laws of Champagne. This would have allowed him to attain management and revenue of the county for a longer duration. For three months, Edmund would query on Joan&#x27;s age of majority until he finally yielded. 

When Joan reached the age of majority on 14 January 1284, Philip III compromised with Edmund&#x27;s wife Blanche of Artois on 17 May via a treaty, allowing her to keep several of her dowerlands—the castles of Sézanne, Chantemerle, Nogent-sur-Seine, Pont-sur-Seine and Vertus, and the Palace of Navarrese Kings in Paris—and paying 60 to 70 thousand &quot;livres tournois&quot; to Edmund and Blanche. In addition, Philip relinquished any claim to half of the property acquired and held jointly by Blanche and her first husband King Henry I of Navarre in Champagne, and extended this renouncement to Edmund.

Following the marriage of Joan and Prince Philip the Fair, Philip III&#x27;s son, on 16 August 1284, Edmund renounced the title of Count Palatine of Champagne and ceded control of all of the county except his wife&#x27;s dowerlands to Philip the Fair. Edmund and Blanche&#x27;s last son, John, was born in May 1286. For the rest of the 1280s, Edmund oversaw the affairs of his lands, such as hiring a chaplain for Tutbury Castle, but also accompanied his brother King Edward I of England when he stayed in Gascony for almost three years.

Edward inherited the County of Ponthieu following the death of his wife Eleanor of Castile on 28 November 1290. On 23 April 1291, due to Edmund&#x27;s experience in managing his French domains, Edward granted Ponthieu to Edmund, which he was to administer until Edward&#x27;s son Edward of Caernarfon gained the age of majority. During the assembly at Norham on 13 June 1291 to select the next King of Scotland, Edmund witnessed the submission of rival claims to the Scottish crown under Edward&#x27;s arbitration. Edmund also observed the claimants&#x27; pledges to accept his brother&#x27;s decision and witnessed the Scottish nobility swearing fealty to Edward as their overlord. 

On 5 February 1292, Edmund was chosen as part of a five-member commission with full authority to establish and enforce regulations to uphold the use of arms in the kingdom. During the same year, he also provided bail for Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, when he was involved in a private war with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, regarding their rights and privileges as Marcher lords. In 1293, Edmund founded the Abbey of the Minoresses of St. Clare without Aldgate, a convent for the Order of Poor Clares, outside Aldgate. Blanche, his wife, facilitated the arrival of the first nuns to the convent from France. Due to the high rank of Edmund and Blanche in society, the Abbey grew more rapidly than any other Minoresses house in England. Edmund also played a role in establishing a Greyfriars priory at Preston, located in his earldom of Lancaster.

== Last years, 1293–1296 ==

=== Crisis with France ===

The cordial relationship between England and France soured intensely when English mariners of the Cinque Ports defeated the Norman fleet off of Brittany in 15 May 1293 and the Bayonnais afterwards sacked the port of La Rochelle in Poitiers. Edmund&#x27;s stepson-in-law and first cousin once removed, King Philip IV of France, was outraged and demanded that Edmund&#x27;s brother King Edward I of England deliver the offenders and pay for damages, threatening to confiscate the English-held vassal of Gascony and imprison many of its influential citizens. On 27 October 1293, Philip IV formally summoned Edward to come to Paris in person to answer for the charges against him in January 1294. The French, especially followers of Philip&#x27;s brother, Count Charles of Valois, wanted France to annex the Duchy of Aquitaine, which comprises Gascony, believing that Edward wanted war.

Edward did not want war and wanted to show his respect to Philip as his vassal, and sent Edmund and some ambassadors to Paris to negotiate with Philip. Edmund left England for France between the end of 1293 and the beginning of 1294, bringing his wife Blanche with him. In Paris, Edmund was unsuccessful in negotiating a compromise with Philip, until Philip&#x27;s wife and Edmund&#x27;s stepdaughter through Blanche, Queen Joan I of Navarre, and his cousin-in-law Queen Dowager of France Marie of Brabant offered to intervene on Edmund&#x27;s behalf. The private conversation between the queens and the English envoys was cordial and easy-going, with the queens 

The English made a secret agreement with Philip: in exchange for Edward&#x27;s citation being withdrawn, Edward would marry Philip&#x27;s half-sister Margaret and France would occupy Gascony for 40 days. To arrange the marriage, Edward was to come under safe conduct to Amiens in the week before or after Easter of 1294, following the 40 days of occupation. Edmund, satisfied with the agreement, ordered John St John, the Lieutenant of Gascony, to hand Gascony over to the French, but not before receiving a personal assurance from Philip, in front of an audience including the English envoys, Blanche and Duke Robert II of Burgundy, that he would honor his agreement. After hearing rumours of French betrayal and that Margaret would not accept him as a husband, Edward decided not to visit France, much to Philip&#x27;s anger.

When the 40 days expired, Edmund and the English envoys asked that Gascony be returned to Edward and the citation be withdrawn. Philip reassured them that they should not be alarmed, as he planned to give a negative answer in public because he did not want to refuse some of his council members who opposed restoring Gascony to English control. The English asked if they could attend the council meeting, but they were refused, and they waited anxiously for Philip&#x27;s response. Once the meeting was completed, the bishops of Orléans and Tournai told the English envoys that France would keep Gascony and that Philip would not change his mind. Finally, on 21 April, in a &quot;parlement&quot; session overseen by Philip, Edward was cited again to appear in Paris with no safe conduct granted nor delay allowed. Historian Michael Prestwich believes that the French queens were likely acting in good faith in representing Edmund&#x27;s interests, but that they and Edmund had overestimated their influence on Philip.

=== War in France ===
Upon hearing the decision on his brother King Edward I of England, Edmund renounced his homage to King Philip IV of France, and with his wife Blanche of Artois, sold a part of her dowerlands to an abbey. The couple returned to England with all of their English household and John of Brittany, who had also renounced his homage to Philip. Edward formally renounced his homage to Philip and the English baronage prepared for war. On 1 July 1294, Edward wrote to his administrators in Gascony, apologizing for the secret treaty and stating that he would send Edmund and the Earl of Lincoln Henry de Lacy to reclaim Gascony. On 3 September, he ordered the Cinque Ports to provide shipping for Edmund&#x27;s voyage. Following the suppression of a Welsh rebellion, Edmund and his envoys explained the causes of the war to a council of magnates on 5 August 1295. Edmund was among the loudest of the nobles in their cries for war.

Edmund planned to launch his expedition to Gascony in October, but fell ill that autumn and did not depart England until the winter. With his expedition, he brought his wife Blanche, Earl Henry de Lacy, 26 knights bannerets and 1,700 men-at-arms. The English prince landed in Pointe Saint-Mathieu in Brittany, sending messengers that they would rest there for several days. The Bretons responded by hanging the messengers, resulting in Edmund&#x27;s forces looting the countryside. English soldiers also looted the Abbey of Saint-Mathieu de Fine-Terre, although Edmund ordered them to return all stolen valuables. The English army then arrived at Brest, where they received supplies, and sailed down to Blaye and later Castillon, where they landed their forces.

The castle of Lesparre surrendered to Edmund&#x27;s forces on 22 March 1296 and Edmund launched his siege of Bordeaux with his encampment in Bègles in the south. On 28 March, the Bordeaux garrison attempted to surprise the English encampment, but realized that the English were waiting for them and hastily retreated back to the city, sustaining casualties. On 30 March, the English broke into the outer wall of Bordeaux, but did not have siege engines to break through the city&#x27;s inner walls. Hearing that his brother-in-law Robert II, Count of Artois, was in command of a French army at Langon, Edmund and his army left Bordeaux to meet him. Edmund did not find his brother-in-law there and the village there surrendered to him. Edmund then launched a siege of the castle in nearby Saint-Macaire, alerting Robert to send his forces to relieve the castle. Realizing his funds were low, Edmund returned to Bordeaux to siege the city.

=== Death and burial ===
During the siege of Bourdeaux, Edmund ran out of money to pay his army and his mercenaries deserted him. Edmund and his remaining forces then travelled to Bayonne, where he was warmly received, although the failure of his campaign troubled him. The English prince fell sick on 13 May 1296 and died on 5 June. In his will, Edmund instructed that his body should not be buried until his debts were paid. Edmund&#x27;s remains were embalmed and initially kept at the church of the Friars Minors in Bayonne. After six months, they were transferred to the Convent of the Minoresses in London. On 17 November 1296, Edmund&#x27;s widow, Blanche of Artois, obtained safe conduct for her return to England. In 1298, she received a third of Edmund&#x27;s estates as part of her dowry. On 24 March 1301, Edmund&#x27;s body was transported to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and later moved to Westminster Abbey, where it was laid to rest in an elaborate tomb near the resting place of Edmund&#x27;s first wife, Aveline de Forz.

==Family==

=== Issue ===
Edmund&#x27;s first wife Aveline de Forz died before the couple could have any children.

By his second wife Blanche of Artois, Edmund had four children. Of these, all three of his sons outlived their father. Edmund&#x27;s children with Blanche were:

* Thomas (b. 1278 – 22 March 1322)
* Henry (b. 1281 – 22 September 1345)
* John (b. bef. May 1286 – 13 June 1317)
* Mary, no dates were recorded, presumably died young in France
Through his marriage to Blanche, Edmund also became stepfather to Queen Joan I of Navarre.
