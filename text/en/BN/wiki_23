<text>START I (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was a bilateral treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction and the limitation of strategic offensive arms. The treaty was signed on 31 July 1991 and entered into force on 5 December 1994. The treaty barred its signatories from deploying more than 6,000 nuclear warheads and a total of 1,600 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and bombers.

START negotiated the largest and most complex arms control treaty in history, and its final implementation in late 2001 resulted in the removal of about 80% of all strategic nuclear weapons then in existence. Proposed by US President Ronald Reagan, it was renamed START I after negotiations began on START II.

The treaty expired on 5 December 2009.

On 8 April 2010, the replacement New START Treaty was signed in Prague by US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Following its ratification by the US Senate and the Federal Assembly of Russia, the treaty went into force on 5 February 2011, extending deep reductions of American and Soviet or Russian strategic nuclear weapons through February 2026.&lt;ref name=&quot;state.org/new-start&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==

The START proposal was first announced by US President Ronald Reagan in a commencement address at his alma mater, Eureka College, on 9 May 1982, and presented by Reagan in Geneva on 29 June 1982. He proposed a dramatic reduction in strategic forces in two phases, which he referred to as SALT III.

The first phase would reduce overall warhead counts on any missile type to 5,000, with an additional limit of 2,500 on ICBMs. Additionally, a total of 850 ICBMs would be allowed, with a limit of 110 &quot;heavy throw&quot; missiles like the SS-18 and additional limitations on the total &quot;throw weight&quot; of the missiles.

The second phase introduced similar limits on heavy bombers and their warheads, as well as other strategic systems.

The US then had a commanding lead in strategic bombers. The aging B-52 force was a credible strategic threat but was equipped with only AGM-86 cruise missiles beginning in 1982 because of Soviet air defense improvements in the early 1980s. The US had begun to introduce the new B-1B Lancer quasi-stealth bomber as well and was secretly developing the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) project, which would eventually result in the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.

The Soviet force was of little threat to the US, on the other hand, as it was tasked almost entirely with attacking US convoys in the Atlantic and land targets on the Eurasian landmass. Although the Soviets had 1,200 medium and heavy bombers, only 150 of them (Tupolev Tu-95s and Myasishchev M-4s) could reach North America (the latter only by in-flight refueling). They also faced difficulty penetrating US airspace, which was smaller and less defended. Having too few bombers available compared to US bomber numbers was evened out by the US forces being required to penetrate the Soviet airspace, which is much larger and more defended.

That changed in 1984, when new Tu-95MS and Tu-160 bombers appeared and were equipped with the first Soviet AS-15 cruise missiles. By limiting the phasing in, it was proposed that the US would be left with a strategic advantage for a time.

As &quot;Time&quot; magazine put it, &quot;Under Reagan&#x27;s ceilings, the US would have to make considerably less of an adjustment in its strategic forces than would the Soviet Union. That feature of the proposal will almost certainly prompt the Soviets to charge that it is unfair and one-sided. No doubt some American arms-control advocates will agree, accusing the Administration of making the Kremlin an offer it cannot possibly accept—a deceptively equal-looking, deliberately nonnegotiable proposal that is part of what some suspect is the hardliners&#x27; secret agenda of sabotaging disarmament so that the US can get on with the business of rearmament.&quot; However, &quot;Time&quot; pointed out, &quot;The Soviets&#x27; monstrous ICBMs have given them a nearly 3-to-1 advantage over the US in &#x27;throw weight&#x27;—the cumulative power to &#x27;throw&#x27; megatons of death and destruction at the other nation.&quot;

==Costs==
Three institutes ran studies in regards to the estimated costs that the US government would have to pay to implement START I: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). The CBO estimates assumed that the full-implementation cost would consist of a one-time cost of $410 to 1,830 million and that the continuing annual costs would be $100 to 390 million.

The SFRC had estimates of $200 to 1,000 million for one-time costs and that total inspection costs over the 15 years of the treaty would be $1,250 to 2,050 million.

Finally, the IDA estimated only the verification costs, which it claimed to be around $760 million.

In addition to the costs of implementing the treaty, the US also aided the former Soviet republics with the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar Program), which added $591 million to the costs of implementing the START I program in the former Soviet Union, which would almost double the cost of the program for the US.

After the treaty&#x27;s implementation, the former Soviet Union&#x27;s stock of nuclear weapons fell from 12,000 to 3,500. The US would also save money since it would not have to be concerned with the upkeep and innovations of its nuclear forces. The CBO estimated that would amount to a total saving of $46 billion in the first five years of the treaty and around $130 billion until 2010, which would pay for the cost of the implementation of the treaty about twenty times over.

The other risk associated with START was the failure of compliance on the side of Russia. The US Senate Defence Committee expressed concerns that Russia could covertly produce missiles, produce false numbers regarding the numbers of warheads, and monitor cruise missiles.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff assessment of those situations determined the risk of a significant treaty violation within acceptable limits. Another risk would be the ability of Russia to perform espionage during the inspection of US bases and military facilities. The risk was also determined to be an acceptable factor by the assessment.

Considering the potential savings from the implementation of START I and its relatively-low risk factor, Reagan and the US government deemed it a reasonable plan of action towards the goal of disarmament.

==Negotiations==
Negotiations for START I began in May 1982, but continued negotiation of the START process was delayed several times because US agreement terms were considered nonnegotiable by pre-Gorbachev Soviet rulers. Reagan&#x27;s introduction of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program in 1983 was viewed as a threat by the Soviets, who withdrew from setting a timetable for further negotiations. In January 1985, however, US Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko discussed a formula for a three-part negotiation strategy that included intermediate-range forces, strategic defense, and missile defense. During the Reykjavík Summit between Reagan and Gorbachev in October 1986, negotiations towards the implementation of the START Program were accelerated and turned towards the reduction of strategic weapons after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed in December 1987.

However, a dramatic nuclear arms race proceeded in the 1980s. It ended in 1991 with nuclear parity preservation with 10,000 strategic warheads on both sides.

==Verification tools==
The verification regimes in arms control treaties contain many tools to hold parties accountable for their actions and violations of their treaty agreements. The START Treaty verification provisions were the most complicated and demanding of any agreement at the time by providing twelve different types of inspection. Data exchanges and declarations between parties became required and included exact quantities, technical characteristics, locations, movements, and the status of all offensive nuclear threats. The national technical means of verification (NTM) provision protected satellites and other information-gathering systems controlled by the verifying side, as they helped to verify adherence to international treaties. The international technical means of verification provision protected the multilateral technical systems specified in other treaties. Co-operative measures were established to facilitate verification by the NTM and included displaying items in plain sight and not hiding them from detection. The new on-site inspections (OSI) and Perimeter and Portal Continuous Monitoring (PPCM) provisions helped to maintain the treaty&#x27;s integrity by providing a regulatory system handled by a representative from the verifying side at all times. In addition, access to telemetry from ballistic missile flight tests was required, including exchanges of tapes and a ban on encryption and encapsulation from both parties.

==Signing==
Negotiations that led to the signing of the treaty began in May 1982. In November 1983, the Soviet Union &quot;discontinued&quot; communication with the US, which had deployed intermediate-range missiles in Europe. In January 1985, US Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko negotiated a three-part plan, including strategic weapons, intermediate missiles, and missile defense. It received a lot of attention at the Reykjavik Summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev and ultimately led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in December 1987. Talk of a comprehensive strategic arms reduction continued, and the START Treaty was officially signed by US President George H. W. Bush and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev on 31 July 1991.

==Implementation==
There were 375 B-52s flown to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, in Arizona. The bombers were stripped of all usable parts and chopped into five pieces by a steel blade dropped from a crane. The guillotine sliced four times on each plane, which severed the wings and left the fuselage in three pieces. The dissected B-52s remained in place for three months so that Russian satellites could confirm that the bombers had been destroyed, and they were then sold for scrap.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, treaty obligations were passed to twelve Soviet successor states. Of those, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan each eliminated its one nuclear-related site, and on-site inspections were discontinued. Inspections continued in Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine became non-nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968 and are committed to it under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol (Protocol to the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms).

==Efficacy==
Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have disposed of all their nuclear weapons or transferred them to Russia. The US and Russia have reduced the capacity of delivery vehicles to 1,600 each, with no more than 6,000 warheads.

A report by the US State Department, &quot;Adherence to and Compliance With Arms Control, Nonproliferation and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments,&quot; was released on 28 July 2010 and stated that Russia was not in full compliance with the treaty when it expired on 5 December 2009. The report did not specifically identify Russia&#x27;s compliance issues.

One incident concerning Russia violating the START I Treaty occurred in 1994. It was announced by Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director John Holum in a congressional testimony that Russia had converted its SS-19 ICBM into a space-launch vehicle without notifying the appropriate parties. Russia justified the incident by claiming it did not have to follow all of START&#x27;s reporting policies regarding missiles that had been recreated into space-launch vehicles. In addition to the SS-19, Russia reportedly used SS-25 missiles to assemble space-launch vehicles. The issue that the US had was that it did not have accurate numbers and locations of Russian ICBMs with those violations. The dispute was resolved in 1995.

==Expiration and renewal==

START I expired on 5 December 2009, but both sides agreed to keep observing the terms of the treaty until a new agreement was reached. There are proposals to renew and expand the treaty, supported by US President Barack Obama. Sergei Rogov, director of the Institute of the U.S. and Canada, said: &quot;Obama supports sharp reductions in nuclear arsenals, and I believe that Russia and the U.S. may sign in the summer or fall of 2009 a new treaty that would replace START-1.&quot; He added that a new deal would happen only if Washington abandoned plans to place elements of a missile shield in Central Europe. He expressed willingness &quot;to make new steps in the sphere of disarmament&quot; but said that he was waiting for the US to abandon attempts to &quot;surround Russia with a missile defense ring&quot; in reference to the placement of ten interceptor missiles in Poland and accompanying radar in the Czech Republic.

On 17 March 2009, Medvedev signaled that Russia would begin &quot;large-scale&quot; rearmament and renewal of Russia&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. He accused NATO of expanding near Russian borders and ordered the rearmament to commence in 2011 with an increased army, naval, and nuclear capabilities. Also, the head of Russia&#x27;s strategic missile forces, Nikolai Solovtsov, told news agencies that Russia would start deploying its next-generation RS-24 missiles after the 5 December expiry of the START I. Russia hopes to form a new treaty. The increased tensions came despite the warming of relations between the US and Russia in the two years since Obama had taken office.

On 4 May 2009, the US and Russia began renegotiating START and counting nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles in making a new agreement. While setting aside problematic issues between the two countries, both sides agreed to make further cuts in the number of warheads deployed to around 1,000 to 1,500 each. The US said that it is open to a Russian proposal to use radar in Azerbaijan rather than Eastern Europe for the proposed missile system. The George W. Bush administration insisted that the Eastern Europe defense system was intended as a deterrent for Iran, but Russia feared that it could be used against itself. The flexibility by both sides to make compromises now will lead to a new phase of arms reduction in the future.

A &quot;Joint understanding for a follow-on agreement to START-1&quot; was signed by Obama and Medvedev in Moscow on 6 July 2009 to reduce the number of deployed warheads on each side to 1,500–1,675 on 500–1,100 delivery systems. A new treaty was to be signed before START-1 expired in December 2009, with reductions to be achieved within seven years. After many months of negotiations, Obama and Medvedev signed the successor treaty, Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, in Prague, Czech Republic, on 8 April 2010.

==New START Treaty==
The New START Treaty imposed even more limitations on the United States and Russia by reducing them to significantly-less strategic arms within seven years of its entering full force. Organized into three tiers, the new treaty focuses on the treaty itself, a protocol containing additional rights and obligations regarding the treaty provisions, and technical annexes.

The limits were based on rigorous analysis conducted by Department of Defense planners in support of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. These aggregate limits consist of 1,550 nuclear warheads, which include warheads on deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), warheads on deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and even any deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments. That is 74% fewer than the limit set in the 1991 Treaty and 30% fewer than the limit of the 2002 Treaty of Moscow. Both parties will also be limited to 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped with nuclear armaments. There is also a separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments, which is less than half the corresponding strategic nuclear delivery vehicle limit imposed in the previous treaty. Although the new restrictions have been set, the new treaty does not contain any limitations regarding the testing, developing, or deploying current or planned US missile defense programs and low-range conventional strike capabilities.

The duration of the new treaty is ten years and can be extended for no more than five years at a time. It includes a standard withdrawal clause like most other arms control agreements. Subsequent treaties have superseded the treaty.

<text>The National University of Lesotho, the main and oldest university in Lesotho, is located in Roma, southeast of Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. The Roma valley is broad and is surrounded by a barrier of rugged mountains which provides magnificent scenery. The university enjoys a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The governing body of the university is the council and academic policy is in the hands of Senate, both Council and Senate being established by the Act.

==History==

===Pius XII Catholic University College===

The origins of the National University of Lesotho (NUL) date to April 8, 1945, when a Catholic University College was founded at Roma by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Southern Africa. The establishment of this college was a realisation of a decision taken in 1938 by the Synod of Catholic Bishops in South Africa to provide African Catholic students with post-matriculation and religious guidance. The Catholic University College was founded in an isolated valley from Maseru in a temporary primary school building at Roma Mission.

===University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland===

On January 1, 1964, Pius XII University College was replaced by the independent, non-denominational University of Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate, and Swaziland with its own charter granted by Queen Elizabeth II. By virtue of the same charter, the Oblate Fathers kept a close relationship with the U.B.B.S. through serving on the Council and teaching, as well as in the physical presence of Pius XII College House, a residence for the Oblate community.

===University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland===
To be in line with the names chosen after independence in 1966, U.B.B.S. became the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.

===National University of Lesotho===

The decision to establish the National University of Lesotho on the Lesotho (Roma) campus site of the former U.B.L.S. was taken on October 20, 1975, by the National Assembly through Act No. 13 of 1975. NUL is the proud heir of Pius XII University College and U.B.L.S. It occupies the same site, grounds, and buildings as its predecessors, as well as additional ones.

==Academic performance==
The university in ranked 121st in Africa and 6,045th in the world.

There were 9,263 students at the university in 2018; 9,460 in 2017; 9,560 in 2016 and 9,239 in 2015.

There were 2,017 graduates at the university in 2020; 2,120 graduates in 2019 and 2,266 graduates in 2018.

There were 1,387 new enrolled students at the university in 2019 and 2,700 enrolled students in 2018.

The university offers 70 accredited study programmes.

In June 2011, the &quot;Lesotho Times&quot; reported that half of the students in three of the seven faculties at the university failed their examinations. This &quot;unprecedented failure rate&quot; was in the law, health sciences and science and technology faculties.

== Library ==
The National University of Lesotho supports open access in Lesotho and has signed the Budapest Open Access Initiative. In 2011, the National University of Lesotho has established the first institutional repository in the country. The National University of Lesotho Institutional Repository (NULIR) is the institutional repository and provides access to the research output of staff and students.

<text>Baldock ( ) is a historic market town in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England. The River Ivel rises from springs in the town. It lies north of London and north northwest of the county town of Hertford. Nearby towns include Royston to the northeast, Letchworth and Hitchin to the southwest and Stevenage to the south.

==History and etymology==
Baldock has an exceptionally rich archaeological heritage. Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements show the site of Baldock has been continuously occupied since prehistoric times.

The earliest monument in the area is a narrow cursus, probably from the middle Neolithic. At the beginning of the Iron Age there was a hillfort at Arbury Banks, 5 km to the northeast of Baldock, that dominated the area. In the Late Iron Age (c. 100 BC), the local power base shifted from the hillfort to the vicinity of Baldock. The soil was easily farmed and transportation was more convenient. In the later part of the middle Iron Age (from prior to c.100 BC) Baldock became the site of a large oppidum, arguably the largest such site in Britain. The oppidum in turn became a sizeable Roman settlement, which although not administratively important, seems to have been a significant cult centre. The Baldock area is also host to the highest quantity of finds of ancient coins in Hertfordshire after the Verulamium region. The site was used until the fifth or sixth century. The Roman settlement gradually disappeared and there is no entry for Baldock in the Domesday Book.

Baldock was founded by the Knights Templar (after whom the town&#x27;s secondary school is named) as a medieval market town in the 1140s. It was laid out by the Knights Templar on land in the manor of Weston in the hundred of Broadwater, granted by the earl of Pembroke, Gilbert de Clare, before his death in 1148. The 1850 tithe map, drawn up before the parish boundaries were extended in the later 19th century, clearly shows the boundaries of the land grant made from the manor of Weston in the 12th century; it is a triangular parcel of land beside the old Roman Road, cut out from an older estate.

The popular story for the origin of the name &quot;Baldock&quot; is that it is a derivation from the Old French name for Baghdad: &quot;Baldac&quot; or later &quot;Baudac&quot;. While Damascus was the farthest location of Templar military activity during the Crusades, they would have been aware of the significance of Baghdad, which was widely regarded as the most prosperous market in the world. Perhaps the Templars hoped that the name would confer a similar prosperity on their own market town in England. Founding contemporaneous documents use the spelling &quot;Baudac&quot;, but it is first recorded as &quot;Baldac&quot; in the Pipe Rolls of Hertfordshire in 1168.

Walter William Skeat writes in &quot;The Place-names of Hertfordshire&quot; (1904):

Others, however, consider it more likely that the Knights Templar used a name already in use, particularly since the location was already a crossroads. In addition the settlement was already thriving as a late Anglo-Saxon part of Weston. Alternative etymologies have been suggested, including Middle English &quot;balled&quot;, meaning &quot;bald&quot;, together with Old English &quot;āc&quot;, meaning &quot;oak&quot; (the site may have been identified by a large old tree near the Anglo-Saxon graveyard or where the Templar church was built); and a conjectured Old English personal name &quot;*Bealdoc&quot;, from &quot;beald&quot;, meaning &quot;bold&quot;, with a diminutive &quot;-oc&quot; suffix. These derivations, however, are not entirely satisfactory.

The modern layout of the town and many buildings in the centre date from the sixteenth century, with the earliest dating from the fourteenth century.

Thanks to its location, the town was a major staging post between London and the north: many old coaching inns still operate as pubs and hotels, and Baldock has a surprising number of pubs for its size. The High Street is very wide, a typical feature of medieval market places where more than one row of buildings used to stand. In the case of Baldock, the bottom of the High Street had three such rows, until Butcher&#x27;s Row was demolished by the turnpike authorities in the 1770s.

Since the 16th century, Baldock has been a centre for malting, subsequently becoming a regional brewing centre with at least three large brewers still operating at the end of the 19th century, despite a decline in demand for the types of beer produced locally. The 1881 Census records approximately 30 drinking establishments (the town&#x27;s population was at that time around 1900). Throughout the early 20th century a large number of pubs continued to operate, many of which were sustained by the adjacent and much larger town of Letchworth, which had no alcohol retailers prior to 1958, and had only two pubs and a single hotel bar until the mid-1990s. Its larger population had for many years visited both Baldock and Hitchin for refreshment.

The Wynn almshouses, in the High Street, were founded in 1621 and were endowed &quot;To the World&#x27;s End&quot; by John Wynne, a cloth merchant from London who left £1000 in his will of 1614 for their upkeep.

Since 1850, the town has a railway station which today operates on the line between London Kings Cross and Cambridge. With frequent services to London, including fast services of around 30 minutes, the town is home to many commuters. The station is part of the Thameslink Programme which connects Cambridge to Farringdon, City Thameslink and Blackfriars via the Great Northern Route. 
There has been human activity on the site well before the modern town was founded. Prehistoric remains on Clothall Common date back as far as c 3000 BCE. Many Roman remains have been discovered in building work in and around the town, and the core of the Roman settlement lies between Walls Field and Bakers Close. Earlier Iron Age remains have also been uncovered in the same general location, which may be the earliest town ever to develop in Britain.

A medieval leper colony, on Royston Road, was located during excavations in 2003, having been thought for many years to lie to the south-east of the town on the former Pesthouse Lane (now Clothall Road), the A507.

From 1808 to 1814, Baldock hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain that connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth.

A history of &quot;Baldock&#x27;s Middle Ages&quot; () was compiled by Vivian Crellin, a former headmaster of The Knights Templar School, while local archaeologists Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews and Gilbert Burleigh published &quot;Ancient Baldock: the story of an Iron Age and Roman town&quot; in 2007.

Baldock&#x27;s position at the crossing of two important thoroughfares, the Great North Road and the Icknield Way has made it a stopping point for a number of illustrious visitors, including Charles I, who passed through Baldock en route for London after his arrest in 1648 and supposedly Dick Turpin. Preacher John Wesley came to the town in 1747.

In the 1960s and 70s Baldock was a centre of laser research at a MOD laboratory called SERL (Services Electronics Research Laboratory). This facility closed in the late 1970s and some projects and staff were transferred to RSRE (Royal Signals &amp; Radar Establishment) near Pershore.
Baldock was formerly the location of a film processing factory which closed before the company (originally based in Letchworth Garden City) could move in; local folklore has it that it was a silent film studio, but this is not the case. The building was then bought by the Full-Fashioned Hosiery Company from Halifax, later becoming the Kayser Bondor ladies stocking factory (which temporarily produced parachutes in World War II). The site was redeveloped to become a Tesco supermarket in the late 1980s, but the Art Deco facade of the former factory was retained and incorporated into the new building.

Another notable building in the town is the thirteenth century Baldock Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin at the centre of the town. The original church was built in about 1150 by the Knights Templar before being largely rebuilt in about 1330 by the Knights Hospitaller. It is a Grade I listed building.

Malting and brewing were formerly major industries in the town, but apart from some light industry, today it is mostly a commuter town.

The original incarnation of the local football team Baldock Town F.C. was formed in 1905. The club disbanded in 2001, but a new club was formed two years later.

Baldock Radio Station, sometimes called Slip End Radio Station, opened in 1929 as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain. That year it made the first successful radiotelephone call to the USA, to the RCA radio station at Rocky Point, New York. A radio frequency control station was added at Baldock in 1938. In World War II, Baldock was one of the Allied radio stations that intercepted Kriegsmarine signals and forwarded them to Bletchley Park to be deciphered. After the war, the radio station joined the International Telecommunication Union. Ofcom has operated the station insce 2003.

To the east of the town there is a large residential estate that was built in several phases. This is known as Clothall Common. An archaeological dig took place in this part of Baldock in the late 1980s.

According to the humorous book &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot;, a Baldock is defined as: &quot;The sharp prong on the top of a tree stump where the tree has snapped off before being completely sawn through&quot;.

==Transport==
It was where the old Great North Road and the Icknield Way crossed. The A1(M) motorway (1963), was called the Baldock Bypass for some years. A £3,490,762 contract was given to A. Monk Ltd of Padgate in May 1965 for a 6.5-mile bypass, to take two years. It would make 39.5 mile of motorway on the A1, and 13 miles of motorway north of London. The bypass began at Corey&#x27;s Mill, near Stevenage, to the north of Radwell. Baldock was a big bottleneck on the north-south route.

In March 2006, a new bypass removed the A505 road (part of the old Icknield Way to the east of Baldock) from the town.

==Events==
Several events take place in Baldock throughout the year. The largest three are the Annual Beer Festival, the Charter fair and the Balstock music festival.

=== Baldock Festival ===
The Baldock Festival is a cultural festival which started in 1982 and starts on the May Day bank holiday weekend. The festival consists of three weeks of events throughout the town and local area, such as museum displays, wine tasting, whiskey tasting, beer festivals, brewery tours, cricket match, comedy sketches, family quiz night, mystery tour, open gardens, history talks, and several music events, some of which feature local bands. The festival Street Fair is held in the High Street, on the second weekend. Stallholders dress in themed clothing of the street fair theme, in 2022 this was &#x27;Green&#x27; Baldock.

The Baldock Beer Festival takes place on the first weekend where local and national real ales, real ciders and continental lagers may be sampled.

=== Baldock Charter Fair ===
Baldock&#x27;s Charter Fair dates back to 1199, when King John granted to the Templars the right of holding a yearly fair at Baldock on St. Matthew&#x27;s Day and for four days following.
This would mean the original fair was held on 21–25 September, but with the Calendar reform of 1752 the dates are now 2, 3 and 4 October. Today the principal part of the fair is a visiting Amusement Fair which sets up in the High Street.

=== Balstock ===
In 2015, the Balstock Festival completed its tenth year, having grown from a small event held in one pub, to a three-day event featuring more than 200 artists held on 13 stages across the town. It is now Hertfordshire&#x27;s biggest free music festival with all proceeds going to a nominated charity. In 2015, that charity was Up on Downs, a local charity which aids families that have children with Downs Syndrome.

The 2012 festival resulted in a dispute between the organisers of the festival and the Performing Rights Society 

==In literature==
Daniel Defoe, in his book &quot;A tour through the whole island of Great Britain&quot;, passed through Baldock and commented: &quot;Here is that famous Lane call&#x27;d &quot;Baldock Lane&quot;, famous for being so unpassable, that the Coaches and Travellers were oblig&#x27;d to break out of the Way even by Force, which the People of the Country not able to prevent, at length placed Gates, and laid their lands open, setting Men at the Gates to take a voluntary Toll, which Travellers always chose to pay, rather than plunge into Sloughs and Holes, which no Horse could wade through.&quot;

Baldock is one of the waypoints on Warren&#x27;s long drive up the Great North Road, which brings about the occasion for the novel&#x27;s plot, the rescue of the shipbuilding town of &#x27;Sharples&#x27; (Blyth), in &quot;Ruined City&quot; by Nevil Shute.

Baldock is mentioned frequently in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Green Man&quot; by Kingsley Amis (1969). The town is the nearest centre to the fictional pub owned and run by the main character &quot;Maurice Allington&quot;. The Green Man was later adapted into a television drama starring Albert Finney as Allington.

The author Monica Dickens, who lived in nearby Hinxworth for four years after World War II, refers to her regular visits to Baldock and to &quot;The George and Dragon&quot; public house in particular, in her 1978 autobiography &quot;An Open Book&quot;.

==Governance==
Baldock has two tiers of local government, at district and county level: North Hertfordshire District Council and Hertfordshire County Council. There is no parish or town council in Baldock, which has been an unparished area since 1974. North Hertfordshire District Council has a Baldock and District Committee where the councillors representing Baldock and two neighbouring rural wards meet to discuss local matters.

===Parish===
The parish of Baldock was created in the mid-twelfth century from the northern tip of the older parish of Weston, around the time of the town&#x27;s founding by the Knights Templar. The parish was relatively small, being bounded by Icknield Way to the north, Clothall Road (Pesthouse Lane) to the east, South Road / Crabtree Lane to the south, and Weston Way / Norton Road to the west. From its founding until the nineteenth century the town was governed by the parish vestry and county authorities, in the same way as most rural areas; there was no separate borough corporation or other urban authority for the town.

The parish of Baldock was included in the Hitchin Poor Law Union from 1835.

===Baldock local board (1872–1894)===

In August 1872 sanitary districts were established, with public health and local government responsibilities being given to the boards of guardians of the poor law unions for all areas which did not have urban authorities. Baldock therefore became part of the Hitchin Rural Sanitary District, governed by the Hitchin Board of Guardians. Less than three months later, on 1 November 1872, a public meeting was held in Baldock where the town&#x27;s ratepayers voted to establish a local board to govern the town, allowing it to become its own urban sanitary district, independent of the Hitchin Rural Sanitary District. The new board came into effect on 30 December 1872, when the Local Government Board gave its consent. The first chairman of the Baldock Local Board was Thomas Rigby Kewley, who was the rector of Baldock&#x27;s parish church of St Mary&#x27;s. Kewley served as chairman of the board until his death in 1885.

Baldock Local Board initially only covered the parish of Baldock. The district was enlarged in 1880 to take in adjoining areas where the urban area had expanded beyond the parish boundary, with parts of the five neighbouring parishes of Bygrave, Clothall, Weston, Willian, and Norton being brought under the local board&#x27;s control from 29 September 1880. The Local Board generally met at the Rose and Crown public house at 8 Whitehorse Street in Baldock.

===Baldock urban district (1894–1974)===
Under the Local Government Act 1894, urban sanitary districts became urban districts on 31 December 1894. Baldock Local Board therefore became Baldock Urban District Council. The new council held its first meeting on 7 January 1895, when Evelyn Simpson was elected chairman. He had been the chairman of the previous Local Board. The Local Government Act 1894 also stipulated (at Section 61) that council meetings should not be held in licensed premises. The new council was therefore unable to meet at the Rose and Crown as the local board had done. The first meeting of the new council was held at the town&#x27;s Reading Rooms on Whitehorse Street, with subsequent meetings from February 1895 onwards being held at the Infant School on Park Street.
Shortly after its creation, the new council was presented with the possibility of building a new town hall to provide a public hall and other facilities for the town and a meeting place and office for the council. A fire had destroyed a row of shops in a prominent position at the junction of High Street and Whitehorse Street in the centre of the town, and the landlord, Thomas Pryor, offered to donate the site to the council if they would then build a town hall on it. Through 1895 and early 1896 the council was split on whether it should accept the offer and commit to the estimated £2,000 construction cost. This was the main issue at the council election in April 1896, with candidates presenting themselves as either supporters or opponents of the town hall scheme. The supporters won, and the scheme went ahead. Baldock Town Hall was formally opened on 25 November 1897, and included a public hall, council chamber and office, fire station, and library.
By 1935 the council had outgrown the offices in the Town Hall. The council bought a large eighteenth century house called The Grange at 14a High Street for £875, converting it to become the council&#x27;s offices and meeting place. The Grange was formally opened as the council&#x27;s new home in September 1936.

Baldock Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 10 May 1951.

Baldock Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of North Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the town, and so it became an unparished area.

<text>Duane Hanson (January 17, 1925 – January 6, 1996) was an American artist and sculptor born in Minnesota. He spent most of his career in South Florida. He was known for his life-sized realistic sculptures of people. He cast the works based on human models in various materials, including polyester resin, fiberglass, Bondo, and bronze. Hanson&#x27;s works are in the permanent collections of The Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and The Smithsonian.

==Education==
Duane Elwood Hanson was born January 17, 1925, in Alexandria, Minnesota. After attendance at Luther College and the University of Washington, he graduated from Macalester College in 1946. Following a period where he taught high school art, he received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills in 1951.

==Career and style==
Around 1966 Hanson began making figural casts using fiberglass and vinyl. Works that first brought him to notice were of figures grouped in tableaux, some depicting brutal and violent subjects. Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Abortion&quot; (1966) was inspired by the horrors of an illicit backroom procedure, and &quot;Accident&quot; (1967) showed a motorcycle crash. &quot;Race Riot&quot; (1969–1971) included among its seven figures a white policeman terrorizing an African American man as well as an African American rioter attacking the policeman. Other works which dealt with physical violence or other explosive social issues of the 1960s were &quot;Riot&quot; (1967), &quot;Football Players&quot; (1969), and &quot;Vietnam Scene&quot; (1969).

These sculptures, cast from actual people, were painted to make the revealed skin look realistic, replete with veins and blemishes. Hanson then clothed the figures with garments from second-hand clothing stores or from the person who modeled for him. Clearly, these works contained strong social comment, and can be seen as modern parallels to the concerns of 19th-century French Realists such as Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, artists Hanson admired.

Few of Hanson&#x27;s early sculptures would survive because he later destroyed many of them, preferring to be known for his more mature style.

Around 1970, Hanson abandoned gut-wrenching scenes for more subtle, though no less vivid ones. In that year he made the &quot;Supermarket Shopper&quot;, &quot;Hardhat&quot;, and &quot;Tourists&quot;; &quot;Woman Eating&quot; was completed in 1971. These were also life-sized, clothed, fiberglass figures. Unlike the earlier works, however, these were single or paired figures, and not overtly engaged in violent activity. Instead, his figures often had a listless, bored look, staring into the distance and disengaged from their surroundings.

In 1967, art dealer Ivan Karp attempted to persuade Hanson to move from South Florida to New York City, and the artist moved to Manhattan in 1969, residing on The Bowery (Bleecker Street) across the street from CBGB. However, in 1973, Hanson moved to Davie, Florida, where he would spend the remainder of his life.

While the earlier works tended to be more contained spatially, the later figures had no clearly defined boundaries separating them from the viewer. They quite literally inhabited the viewer&#x27;s space—with amusing results at times, as in the cases of &quot;Reading Man&quot; (1977) or &quot;Photographer&quot; (1978). Hanson sometimes would cast his own children in his work, as in &quot;Cheerleader&quot; (1988), and &quot;Surfer&quot; (1987).

In 2018, two of Hanson&#x27;s works were exhibited at the Met Breuer in the show &quot;Like Life&quot;, which NY Times critic Roberta Smith reviewed, stating &quot;[the show] juxtaposes figurative sculptures throughout time. On view was Hanson&#x27;s hyper-realistic “Housepainter II” (1984), and “Hermes,” attributed to Polykleitos (A.D. first or second century). Mr. Hanson&#x27;s sculpture of a black man whitewashing a brown wall underscores the curators’ point that ancient marbles were originally brightly colored — and that the whiteness of Classical art is a fiction that has “colored” the Western view of perfection.&quot;

Peter Schjeldahl, noted in his March 2018 article for The New Yorker about the show &quot;Like Life&quot;, &quot;his (Hanson&#x27;s) hyperrealistic tableaux, starring a frowsy working-class housewife and a weary housepainter, curiously become ever more affecting as their period looks recede in time.&quot;
The Estate of Duane Hanson is represented by Gagosian Gallery.

<doc id="430709" wikidata="Q628953" url="?curid=430709" title="The 7th Guest">
<text>The 7th Guest is an interactive movie puzzle adventure game, produced by Trilobyte and originally released by Virgin Interactive Entertainment in April 1993. It is one of the first computer video games to be released only on CD-ROM. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; is a horror story told from the unfolding perspective of the player, as an amnesiac. The game received press attention for making live action video clips a core part of its gameplay, for its then-unprecedented amount of pre-rendered 3D graphics, and for its adult content. The game was very successful, with over two million copies sold. The game alongside &quot;Myst&quot;, is widely regarded as a killer app that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; has subsequently been re-released on Apple&#x27;s app store for various systems such as the Mac. Bill Gates called &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; &quot;the new standard in interactive entertainment&quot;.

The game has been ported in various formats to different systems, with Trilobyte mentioning the potential for a third entry in the series.

==Gameplay==
The game is played by wandering through a mansion, solving logic puzzles and watching videos that further the story. The main antagonist, Henry Stauf, is an ever-present menace, taunting the player with clues, mocking the player as they fail his puzzles (&quot;We&#x27;ll all be dead by the time you solve this!&quot;), and expressing displeasure when the player succeeds (&quot;Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be so lucky next time!&quot;).

A plot of manipulation and sin is gradually played out, in flashback, by actors through film clips as the player progresses between rooms by solving twenty-one puzzles of shifting nature and increasing difficulty. The first puzzles most players encounter are either one where players must select the right interconnected letters inside the lens of a telescope to form a coherent sentence; or a relatively simple cake puzzle, where the player has to divide the cake evenly into six pieces, each containing the same number of decorations. Other puzzles include mazes, chess problems, logical deductions, Simon-style pattern-matching, word manipulations, and a difficult game of &quot;Ataxx&quot;, similar to &quot;Reversi&quot;. For players who need help or cannot solve a particular puzzle, there is a hint book in the library of the house. The first two times the book is consulted about a puzzle, the book gives clues about how to solve the puzzle; for the third time, the book completes the puzzle for the player so that the player can proceed. After each puzzle, the player is shown a video clip of part of the plot, if the hint book was consulted three times, the player does not get to view the clip. The hint book can be used for all but the final puzzle.

&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was one of the first games for the PC platform to be available only on CD-ROM, since it was too large to be distributed on floppy disks. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported with amazement in 1993, &quot;not only does &quot;Guest&quot; consume an entire CD-ROM ... it actually requires TWO&quot;. Removing some of the large movies and videos was not an option, as they were essential to the gameplay. This game, along with LucasArts&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault&quot; and Broderbund&#x27;s &quot;Myst&quot;, helped promote the adoption of CD drives, which were not yet common. The game&#x27;s POV video of walking through the house was originally planned as a live-action video in a practical set, but the idea was abandoned after pre-rendered 3D sequences proved feasible and more cost-effective.

==Plot==
The game begins with a flashback to 1935 in the town of Harley-on-the-Hudson. A drifter named Henry Stauf kills a woman to steal her purse, beginning a series of deplorable acts. He has a vision of a beautiful doll, and the next day begins carving it. He trades the doll for food, drink and a place to stay at a local tavern. Stauf has other visions of dolls and toys, and crafts and sells these as well. Stauf becomes a successful toymaker. He uses his fortune to build a mansion at the edge of town, following another vision. At the same time, several children possessing Stauf&#x27;s toys contract a mysterious illness and die. Stauf disappears into his mansion and is never seen again.

In the game&#x27;s present, the narrator (the player&#x27;s character) named &quot;Ego&quot; awakens in the Stauf mansion. The mansion is deserted, but as Ego explores it, he has ghostly visions of events in the past. These visions all take place on a night sometime after the deaths of the children, where six guests were invited to the Stauf mansion: Martine Burden, a former singer; Edward and Elinor Knox, a dissatisfied middle-aged couple; Julia Heine, a bank worker who reminisces of her youth; Brian Dutton, a fellow shop owner; and Hamilton Temple, a stage magician. The six arrive but find no sign of Stauf or anyone else. They discover a number of puzzles that give them instructions. They learn that Stauf wanted them to bring him a seventh, uninvited guest: a boy named Tad who entered the house on a dare. The guests debate what to do. Elinor and Hamilton feel they must find Tad and help him escape Stauf&#x27;s plan. The others search for Tad in earnest to claim their reward from Stauf. The evening becomes bloody as the guests turn on one another or become trapped by Stauf&#x27;s machinations. Julia, the last survivor, drags Tad to the attic where Stauf waited for them. Having made a pact with the evil force that gave him his visions and killed the children, Stauf has transformed into a horrific creature. He needs Tad&#x27;s soul to complete the pact. Stauf kills Julia and entangles Tad with a prehensile tongue.

Ego realizes that he is the spirit of Tad, witnessing the events of that night over and over but previously unable to help; the house has been a purgatory for him. Ego finds he can now intervene in the events, and helps Tad to escape. Stauf is unable to recapture the child, and the evil entity consumes Stauf for failing to complete the pact. Tad thanks Ego for his help, and then Ego steps into a sphere of light and disappears.

==Cast and characters==
*Henry Stauf (Robert Hirschboeck) – The owner of the mansion in which the game takes place. Stauf was a homeless drifter who became a successful toymaker after a series of visions showed him the toys he would create, but the people of Harley know nothing of his past. They only know him as the eccentric old man who makes marvelous toys for their children and became a hugely successful &quot;rags to riches&quot; story. His name is an anagram of Faust.
*Ego (Keith Ranney) – The player&#x27;s character, a disembodied consciousness that moves through the house solving puzzles and observing the events of that mysterious night at Stauf&#x27;s house as they unfolded long ago. The entire game takes place in first-person view through Ego&#x27;s eyes. Ego does not know how he came to the house, or why, he only knows that there is a reason for him to be there that he hasn&#x27;t figured out yet.
*Tad (Douglas Knapp) – A boy who lives next door to the Stauf mansion. On the night of the party he enters the house on a dare by climbing in through a window, then discovers that he can&#x27;t get out again. He spends most of the game dodging Stauf&#x27;s guests while he tries to find a way to escape the house.
*Martine Burden (Debra Ritz Mason) – Young, pretty, and ambitious, Martine Burden was once named Miss Harley-on-the-Hudson, but she hated the small town and left as soon as she had the chance. Now she is back after her wealthy boyfriend dumped her. She is immediately attracted to the older Edward Knox, whose desires for wealth and a new life away from Elinor are quite compatible with her own desires for power and status. In one scene the player sees her apparently being pulled underwater in a bathtub and hears a long drawn-out scream.
*Edward and Elinor Knox (Larry Roher and Jolene Patrick) – An older, married couple. Elinor is a decent woman who still loves her husband and seems to want to help the boy, Tad, as much as she can. Edward is having severe financial difficulties, and he shows little love or concern for his wife, instead teaming up with the younger Martine Burden to try and solve the mystery. His greatest desire is to start over with a new life, a full bank account, and no marriage tying him down. The desire of Elinor is also to start over again, but with Edward still at her side. Edward is killed by Hamilton Temple, who slams his head into the side of a coffin in order to save Tad. The player does not see Elinor get killed, but the last time she&#x27;s seen, she is turning into a mannequin, pitifully calling out to Tad for help.
*Julia Heine (Julia Tucker) – An older woman, and quite vain. She is unhappy with her life, and recently lost her job at the bank due to a quickly developing drinking problem. Her heart&#x27;s desire is to be young and beautiful again, when she felt like she could take on the world. Julia succeeds in bringing Tad to Stauf, but instead of making her wish come true, Stauf mercilessly kills her by spitting acidic bile at her.
*Brian Dutton (Michael Pocaro) – A middle-aged man who walks with a cane, Brian owns a shop in Harley-on-the-Hudson, and has sold goods to Stauf. Brian admires the way Stauf had grown wealthy and the way he had solved his own problems, and his greatest desire is to be as successful as Stauf, but he is also haunted by memories of seeing his brother fall through thin ice and drown when he was a child. Brian is stabbed repeatedly by Edward while they fight over Tad (ironically with his own knife), but he survives. Later, when he returns to his room and sees the suitcase of money Stauf had left him, his excitement causes his wounds to open up, and he dies.
*Hamilton Temple (Ted Lawson) – A professional stage magician nearing the end of his career, he is a kindly man who also tries to help Tad, and he gets along well with Elinor Knox. His greatest desire is to know if there is such a thing as real magic. After trying to convince Tad to trust him, Hamilton is later strangled to death by Julia.

==Music==
The second disc of the CD-ROM set included a single audio track playable on a CD player. In total, the track was almost half an hour long and it included both the in-game music, composed by video game musician George &quot;The Fat Man&quot; Sanger, and two live music recordings: &quot;The Game&quot;, whose melody in various permutations and stylistic variations became the background music for most of the game (as well as the theme for a piano puzzle) and whose lyrics (sung on the disc by Cotton Mather vocalist Robert Harrison) were based on Stauf&#x27;s twisted plot, and the ending credits theme, &quot;Skeletons in My Closet&quot;, a jazzy tune with a female lead voice (Kris McKay), parts of which are used in the game as Julia&#x27;s theme. A few years later, Sanger independently released an album titled &quot;7/11&quot;, which was a little over an hour long and contained all the music from &quot;T7G&quot; (this time, on separate tracks) as well as its sequel, &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;.
The in-game music had conventions similar to the use of leitmotif in Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Peter and the Wolf, wherein each guest was assigned a musical theme; where Peter and Wolf used instrumental changes for its characters, &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, conversely, used stylistic variations on the melody of Sanger&#x27;s &quot;The Game&quot;.
Where two characters interact in the story, the styles are fused, counterpointed, or even sounded simultaneously and when tension abounds, the characters&#x27; themes are reflected thusly.

==Development==

&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was the brainchild of game designer/graphic artist Rob Landeros, and a Virgin Mastertronic programmer, Graeme Devine. When Landeros and Devine presented their idea for the game to Martin Alper, CEO of Virgin Games, they were promptly &quot;fired&quot; so that with Virgin&#x27;s help they could start their own company, Trilobyte, dedicated solely to the development of this game. They originally intended to create the movements through the mansion using video. 3D graphics and animation were introduced to the title early in 1991 when Robert Stein III joined the team.

After creating the design document Devine and Landeros gave it to writer Matthew Costello. The developers chose to use 24-bit Super VGA graphics and a simple, textless, TV remote control-like user interface to make the game the answer to the question &quot;What would Mom play?&quot;, and to simplify porting to game consoles such as the SNES-CD. Devine created the GROOVIE game engine, which allowed continuous streaming of data from CD-ROM, ran on multiple platforms, and was reusable. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was the first graphic adventure to use 640x320 graphics with 256 colors; Trilobyte reportedly spent more than $500,000 over more than two years to produce the graphics. George Sanger created the soundtrack.

The developers found that, as Devine said in 1993, &quot;CD-ROM is bloody slow&quot;. Early blue-screened footage was imperfect and left ghostly auras, which they left in as a feature. The puzzles they intended to use were under copyright, so the developers used puzzle books from the 19th century. Cast members&#x27; work on FMVs was different from traditional filmmaking: They performed all possible actions players chose in a game, usually looked into the camera to react to the player, and usually did not react to others on the chroma key sets. Devine said that he cried when watching the end credits play for the first time: &quot;It had been such a hard game to make and I was so exhausted from the process of getting it finished that seeing those credits play through made me realise what we had done&quot;.

==Reception==
The game received a very positive response at its preview at the Summer 1992 Consumer Electronic Show and was very successful. In its first year, it sold 450,000 units and earned more than $15 million. Its sales reached 500,000 units by 1994, exceeded one million copies by 1995 (higher than &quot;Myst&quot; at the time), and sold in excess of copies worldwide . It is widely regarded as a killer app that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. In July 1995, it was the best-selling game on CD-ROM, with sales of 1.5 million copies. At the time, &quot;Myst&quot; placed second, with 1.1 million sales. By April 1998, &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; had sold 929,611 units and earned $40 million in revenue in the United States. This led PC Data to declare it the country&#x27;s eighth-best-selling computer game for the period between January 1993 and April 1998. Bill Gates called &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; &quot;the new standard in interactive entertainment&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in August 1993 was critical of the IBM version of the game, calling it more &quot;a nightmare and a dream&quot; and stating that despite its lengthy delay the game should have been developed further. While praising the &quot;rich, enjoyable gaming experience&quot; from the graphics, sound, and puzzles, the reviewer found that the minimum system requirements were unrealistic and that as of May 1993 many players, including him, encountered stability and software incompatibility issues with their computers. An issue with Media Vision sound cards was especially problematic as it prevented him from hearing digitized speech necessary for progress. The reviewer concluded: &quot;I feel I have been deprived of the full pleasure that &quot;Guest&quot; has to offer by the inability to get the game to run satisfactorily ... It would have been better to further delay the game than to release it as it was done, without sufficient testing&quot;. The magazine stated in April 1994 that the game was &quot;consistently ranking high in our [reader] polls and a proven bestseller&quot;, and recommended it to puzzle fans who &quot;want to see and hear some of the most exceptional computer graphics and music created to date&quot;. The Macintosh version of the game was reviewed in 1994 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #212 by Paul Murphy in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Murphy said: &quot;&quot;The Seventh Guest&quot; suffers from an incurable case of confusion about what it is trying to be. It&#x27;s either a collection of puzzles encumbered by an unnecessary horror setting and story—or it&#x27;s a horror story and setting encumbered by an unnecessary collection of puzzles&quot;. &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; won &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot;″s 1993 &quot;Breakthrough Game&quot; award, while &quot;Myst&quot; claimed an honorable mention in the category. The editors called Trilobyte&#x27;s project &quot;the first truly compelling interactive CD-ROM game&quot;.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #38 (1993), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Excellent&quot; and stated that &quot;&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; is a brilliant piece of software that heralds new standards. While it isn&#x27;t a perfect piece of programming, it&#x27;s a great start towards that elusive goal.&quot;

The CD-i version received mostly positive reviews. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s review lauded the &quot;sinister&quot; story line, the challenging puzzles, the beautiful graphics, and the generally creepy tone. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored it an 8 out of 10, describing it as superior to any of the computer versions of the game. Like &quot;GamePro&quot;, they praised the game&#x27;s puzzles, graphics, and tone. Power Unlimited gave the CD-i version a score of 70% writing: &quot;Horror thriller with beautiful computer graphics, full-motion video footage and spoken word/music in hi-fi stereo. The story is quite scary and the puzzles are extremely difficult. The emphasis is therefore more on thinking than on action.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the CD-i version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;the smooth video, crisp sound, original tracks featuring the almost famous &#x27;FAT MAN&#x27;—combined with devilish puzzles—makes for a lavish CD-i game&quot;.

In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the game 23rd on their Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere and plot. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; the 82nd-best adventure game ever released.

===Awards===
&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; won the following awards:

==Legacy==
&quot;The 7th Guest&quot; and &quot;Myst&quot; are considered to be the killer apps that popularized CD-ROM for computer systems.

===Sequels===
Due to the success of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;, Trilobyte released a sequel titled &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; in December 1995. The game&#x27;s reception was initially mixed and did not sell as well as was expected. Plans for further sequels to the series were initiated, but never completed due to the initial demise of the company. Landeros attempted to create his own official third installment titled &quot;The 7th Guest Part III: The Collector&quot;, releasing a trailer for the game onto his official website, only for the trailer to disappear and no further information on the series being released.

Trilobyte also released a compilation game made up of the puzzles from both &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; and &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; as well as &quot;Clandestiny&quot; titled &quot;Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. The game was poorly received, only selling 27 copies in the United States.

Ports of both &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; and &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; were planned, with &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; being ported to the CD-i format. Initial plans for &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; to be ported to the 3DO platform eventually fell through. In 2010 the first game in the series was ported to the iPhone and iPad, with the series later also being ported to other systems such as the Macintosh. A stand-alone version of the Microscope Puzzle from the original version of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; was later released under the name &quot;The 7th Guest: Infection&quot;. The puzzle had been excluded from the game for technical reasons and features two versions of the puzzle, a somewhat updated version of the puzzle as well as an older version of the &quot;Infection&quot; game that can be unlocked by beating the main game. In 2013, Trilobyte partnered with Night Dive Studios to re-release both &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; and &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; on Steam.

Trilobyte, relaunched under Rob Landeros, started a Kickstarter campaign on Halloween 2013 for &quot;The 7th Guest 3: The Collector&quot;. However, it failed to meet its funding target of $435,000. Another crowdfunding campaign was started at Crowdtilt with a smaller goal of $65,000 to build the first story of the haunted mansion but also failed to reach the goal.

===&quot;The 13th Doll&quot;===
In July 2015, developer Attic Door Productions, having received licensing from Trilobyte for a commercial release pending success in gaining sufficient public interest and funding, began a Kickstarter campaign for an unofficial fan game to &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; titled &quot;The 13th Doll&quot;. The campaign target was set at $40,000, running until August 27. The campaign had 1,199 backers and $60,266 was pledged. The game was released on October 31, 2019. Its story centers on a grown-up Tad, the original seventh guest of the first game, revisiting the house to face his past; Robert Hirschboeck reprised his role as Stauf. The player has the option of two playable characters to explore the house and solve puzzles. The newer game engine also allows the player to explore the house freely, moving away from the original &quot;on rails&quot; movement.

Adventure Gamers gave the game 3 out 5 stars and summarized that &quot;While it doesn&#x27;t quite rise to the level of the classic horror puzzler that inspired it, The 13th Doll is a fairly enjoyable tribute that ought to please those who spent the past two decades wanting more Stauf.&quot;

===&quot;The 7th Guest: The Board Game&quot;===
In April 2017, Trilobyte launched a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;The 7th Guest: The Board Game&quot;. The game features a Cluedo-like board design and figures representing the guests from the original PC game. Players must solve Puzzler Cards to get credit for unlocking specific rooms in the Stauf Mansion with the ultimate goal to reach the room at the top and to receive their heart&#x27;s desires.

===&quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot;===
In April 2019, Trilobyte and MojoTouch released the remastered &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; of the original game (on Windows 7-8-10 platforms), replacing the previous version on Steam and GOG.com.

Apart from the digitally enhanced original movie clips and sound, the release contained a completely reworked control system, a map, the possibility to skip scenes and new menus. The player can choose between the original soundtrack and MIDI or Adlib synth music, with or without &quot;retro&quot; mode (with original image, sound and controls).

The release also contained a large amount of extras: three new language soundtracks and subtitles, deleted features, and behind-the-scenes clips, 36 tracks audio, a complete novel and script, along with a &quot;Making of&quot; featurette. It also included the possibility to download the original versions for Windows, macOS or Linux.

The &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; is also available on Android, iOS and iPadOS.

=== Console edition ===
In April 2023, Trilobyte and MojoTouch released a new console edition for the Nintendo Switch, which has most of the features from the &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; while supporting all of the console game modes: TV, touch, tabletop and both JoyCons and Pro game controllers.

In July 2024, the console edition was ported to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

===Virtual reality remake===
Vertigo Studios and Exkee developed a virtual reality version of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot; for Meta Quest, PSVR 2, and Windows-based VR headsets. It was released on October 19, 2023. The game had similar story and fully explorable VR environments with new puzzles better suited for VR, and the prior full-motion video clips were replaced with newly filmed (new actors) clips using volumetric video.

<text>Clapham Common () is a London Underground station in Clapham within the London Borough of Lambeth. It is on the Northern line, between Clapham North and Clapham South stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
The station is at the eastern tip of Clapham Common and was opened on 3 June 1900 as the new southern terminus of the City and South London Railway, which was extended from Stockwell. It remained the terminus until the Morden extension was opened on 13 September 1926.

In May 2023, a carriage of a packed rush-hour train began to fill with smoke, with passengers smashing windows to escape. The subsequent Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation noted that passengers became panicked by a combination of factors, including smoke and a burning smell, closed train doors, no onboard announcement and &quot;perceived inaction&quot; by staff. The RAIB also noted that the narrow platforms at the station meant the incident “had the potential to have more serious consequences”.

=== Advertising ===
For 2 weeks in September 2016, all of the adverts used in the station were replaced by photos of cats. This was an initiative paid for on crowdfunding site Kickstarter and organized by an organisation called &quot;The Citizens Advertising Takeover Service (C.A.T.S)&quot;.

In January 2017, as part of the initiative Veganuary, PETA took over the station informing and encouraging commuters to adopt veganism for the month.

==The station today==
The station has two entrances, one at the west via a domed building dating from the 1920s, and one at the east via a modern curved-steel and glass pavilion.

Clapham Common and Clapham North are the only stations left on the network that are physically underground with narrow island platforms, around wide. In September 2024, TfL indicated that they had no plans to widen the platforms due to the high cost of doing so – despite safety concerns raised by the RAIB.

Clapham Common is one of eight London Underground stations that have a deep-level air-raid shelter underneath them. Both entrances to the shelter are north of the station on Clapham High Street.

==Services==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–6 minutes between 06:09 and 00:21 in both directions.

==Connections==
A large number of London Buses routes serve the station day and night.

<text>A nursing home is a facility for the residential care of older people, senior citizens, or disabled people. Nursing homes may also be referred to as care homes, skilled nursing facilities (SNF) or long-term care facilities. Often, these terms have slightly different meanings to indicate whether the institutions are public or private, and whether they provide mostly assisted living, or nursing care and emergency medical care. Nursing homes are used by people who do not need to be in a hospital, but require care that is hard to provide in a home setting. The nursing home staff attends to the patients&#x27; medical and other needs. Most nursing homes have nursing aides and skilled nurses on hand 24 hours a day.

In the United States, while nearly 1 in 10 residents aged 75 to 84 stays in a nursing home for five or more years, nearly 3 in 10 residents in that age group stay less than 100 days, the maximum duration covered by Medicare, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Some nursing homes also provide short-term rehabilitative stays following surgery, illness, or injury. Services may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language therapy. Nursing homes also offer other services, such as planned activities and daily housekeeping. Nursing homes may offer memory care services, often called dementia care.

==History==
From before the 17th century to modern day, many families care for their elders in the family&#x27;s home. While this is still common practice for many communities and families around the world, this has become increasingly more difficult over time as life expectancy increases, family size decreases, and increased expertise in caring for a person with a chronic disease is needed. In the 21st century, nursing homes have become a standard form of care for most aged and incapacitated persons to account for those complexities. Nearly 6 percent of older adults are sheltered in residential facilities that provide a wide range of care. Yet such institutions have not always existed; rather, their history and development reflect relatively recent demographic and political realities that shape the experience of growing old.

In the 17th century, poorhouses (also referred to as almshouses) originated in England as municipalities were expected to care for their poor. Orphans, people determined to be mentally ill, and elderly people were often placed into these living commons while able-bodied individuals were expected to work and could be imprisoned if they refused. This model was brought to North America by English settlers. Before the 19th century, no age-restricted institutions existed for long-term care; elderly individuals, who needed shelter because of incapacity, impoverishment, or family isolation, often ended their days in an almshouse. Placed alongside people deemed insane, people who were inebriated, or people who were homeless, they were simply categorized as part of the community&#x27;s most needy recipients. Poorhouses gave a place where they could be given shelter and daily meals.

In the 1800s in the US, women&#x27;s and church groups began to establish special homes for elderly people. Often concerned that individuals of their own ethnic or religious communities might die alongside the most despised society, this led to the creation of private care facilities for the elderly in these communities. Poorhouses continued to exist into the early 20th century, despite the criticism of the poor conditions of the poorhouses. In the US, the Great Depression overwhelmed the poorhouses, leading to not enough space and funding. Due to muckraking in the 1930s, the less-than-favorable living conditions of the poorhouses were exposed to the public. This led to the provision of the Social Security Act (1935) to only give people their pension if they did not live in poorhouses, but could live in private institutions.

In the US, poorhouses were then replaced with residential living homes, known as board-and-care homes or convalescent homes. These board-and-care homes provided basic levels of care and meals in a private setting for a specific fee. Board-and-care homes proved to be a success and by World War II, the new way of nursing homes began to take shape. As the times continued to change, the government identified the issue of people spending extensive amounts of time in hospitals. To combat these long stays in short-term settings, board-and-care homes began to convert into something more public and permanent that was state and federally funded. From this, by 1965 nursing homes were a solid fixture. Nursing homes were a permanent residence where the elderly and disabled could receive any necessary medical care and receive daily meals. These nursing homes showed improvement in maintaining care and cleanliness standards in comparison to almshouses and poorhouses. From the 1950s through the 1970s, the dynamics of nursing homes began changing significantly. In the United States, Medicare and Medicaid began to make up much of the money that would filter through the homes and the 1965 amendment laws enforced nursing homes to comply with safety codes and required registered nurses to be on hand at all times. Additionally, nursing homes may sue children for the costs of caring for their parents in jurisdictions which have filial responsibility laws. Later in 1987, in the US the Nursing Reform Act was introduced to begin defining the different types of nursing home services and later added the Residents&#x27; Bill of Rights.

In the UK, after World War II many soldiers and civilians needing hospital care due to war casualties were placed in the hospital along with the many elderly patients present there, leading to overcrowding. The implementation of the NHS in 1948 and the abolition of the Old Poor Law allowed modern public nursing homes to be built. In the 1950s, Professor Peter Townsend brought to light the discrepancies in the standard of care between the publicly and privately funded care homes, leading to health policy reforms that assured the standard care practices for the elderly living in NHS funded care homes. The 1980s and 1990s saw care homes becoming a large industry in the UK, with the Registered Homes Act 1984 regulating private care homes and the Care Standards Act of 2000 ensuring that patient needs are met.

Today, nursing homes are varied. Some nursing homes still resemble a hospital while others look more like a home. Nursing home residents can pay for their care out of pocket or with government assistance. In the US, others may receive Medicare for a short time, while in other countries, public assistance may be available, and some may use long-term insurance plans. Across the spectrum, most nursing homes in the US will accept Medicaid as a source of payment.

== Considerations ==
Below are a few reasons to consider a nursing home:
* Managing a worsening and progressive disease such as Alzheimers.
* Care after a recent hospital admission and not ready to transition to independently caring for oneself at home.
* When medical needs at home become unmanageable by the primary caregiver at home.
* When activities and socialization with people of similar age is deprived.
* When primary caregiver at home do not have the proper knowledge of the nutrition needed.

When looking into nursing homes, consider what activities and/or medical needs patients one would need from the nursing home. Also consider finances, such as medical insurance and personal funds. Ensure the nursing home is properly licensed and has qualified staff. If time allows, visit the nursing home in person to receive a walk through of the facility and if given the opportunity to speak with a guest or family member of guest, ask about their experience thus far.

==Staff==
In the United States, nursing home employees are all required to be licensed or uphold a certificate in the state of which they work. In most facilities, nursing homes are required to provide enough staff to adequately care for residents. In the US, for instance, nursing homes must have at least one registered nurse (RN) available for at least 8 straight hours a day throughout the week, and at least one licensed practical nurse (LPN) on duty 24 hours a day. Direct care nursing home employees usually include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, social workers, certified nursing assistants, and physical therapists, amongst others.

=== Medical staff ===

==== Nurses ====

Nursing homes require assessment and monitoring of residents by a registered nurse (RN) who is typically required to have between two and six years of education. The RN&#x27;s job duties include implementing care plans, administering medications, recording and maintaining accurate reports for each resident, monitoring and recording medical changes, and providing direction to the nursing assistants and licensed practical nurses (LPN). RNs are not required to choose a specialization. To gain recognition as a specialized nurse professional, RNs typically need education in their specialized field, and further experience through clinical practices. LPNs are typically required to have a year of training before working with any patients. The LPN monitors residents&#x27; well-being and administers treatments and medications, such as dressing wounds and dispensing prescribed drugs. LPNs are responsible for patients&#x27; direct bed care and carry out a daily routine.

==== Nursing assistants ====
A nursing assistant provides basic care to patients while working directly under a LPN or RN. These basic care activities, also referred to as activities of daily living, can include assisting with bathing and dressing residents, helping residents with meals, either serving them or with feeding, transferring to and from the bed or wheelchair, making and cleaning beds, assisting with toileting, and answering call lights. Nursing assistants&#x27; official titles can vary between jurisdictions and facilities. They can include Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), nursing aides, caregivers, patient care associates, patient care technicians, personal care attendants (PCAs), and care assistants.

====Physicians====

At skilled nursing facilities, in addition to required 24 hour skilled nursing, a licensed physician supervises individual patients. At nursing homes other than skilled nursing facilities, patients receive care from physicians not affiliated with the nursing home. These physicians are typically employed by a private agency that sends physicians to nursing homes at the request of the patient, the nursing home, or the patient&#x27;s family. The majority of these physicians are family medicine doctors or internists; however, some specialists such as cardiologist or nephrologist may also make independent visits to supplement their care.

=== Non-medical staff ===

====Administration====
Depending on the size of the nursing home, a nursing home may have either a nursing home administrator or an executive director. Some nursing homes may have both, but their job duties are similar and can include overseeing staff, supplying medical supplies, and financial matters. Some nursing homes also have human resources personnel, who are in charge of all aspects of hiring new employees. Human resources job duties vary but can also include coordinating payroll, organizing orientation programs for new employees, interviewing, disciplinary actions, and ensuring compliance with federal and state laws. Nursing homes are usually licensed and heavily regulated under governing legislation. Compliance with the federal and state legislatures are reviewed regularly for adherence to strict standards of building codes, care plans, behavior and altercations between residents, nutrition and dietary services, medical services, nursing and personal care, religious and spiritual practices, pets, and recreational programs.

====Housekeeping====
Housekeepers perform everyday cleaning and upkeep in nursing homes. They play a huge part in ensuring that nursing homes are kept clean and free of disease causing agents. Housekeepers have a long list of duties which include cleaning floors, changing linens, disinfecting bathrooms, changing towels, washing clothes, emptying trashcans, sanitizing rooms, replenishing supplies, dusting, vacuuming, and keeping windows and woodwork clean. These duties can vary from facility to facility, but will include basic cleaning. Housekeeping does not require any license or schooling, but some jobs may prefer experienced housekeepers.

====Recreational staff====
Recreational staff usually include an activity director and possibly activity assistants depending on the size of the nursing home. Activities aim to meet each resident&#x27;s emotional, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, and vocational needs. The transition from being independent to having to depend on others and be away from home is oftentimes very difficult, which is why activities are important to combat depression and anxiety. Some of the different activities that may be offered include hosting birthday parties, celebrating holidays, book clubs, musical events, outdoor activities, discussion and social groups, exercise, arts and crafts, pet therapy, religious services and community outings. Volunteer involvement is also an important part of nursing home activities given that volunteers can act as a link between the nursing home and the outside community.

==Therapy==
===Occupational therapy===
One of the many services offered in a nursing home is occupational therapy. Occupational therapy may be necessary following an injury or illness in order to regain skills, and to receive support during any physical or cognitive changes. Occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, grooming. Occupational therapy also assists with instrumental activities of daily living, which include home and financial management, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. Occupational therapists work to allow the person to safely and comfortably reintegrate into society by practicing public dining, and transferring to different surfaces (chairs, beds, couches etc.), and will assess the need for any home modifications or safety equipment to ensure a proper and safe transition. When a cognitive and/or perceptual deficit is presented, therapists will work with the person by teaching strategies to maximize memory, sequencing and attention span length.

===Physical therapy===

Another important service found in a nursing home is physical therapy. Physical therapy may be necessary following an injury, illness or surgery. Physical therapy works with the person to help them regain strength, endurance, flexibility, balance and range of motion. It can also help to prevent injuries and accidents by focusing on restoring mobility, increasing fitness levels, reducing pain and overall reaching a certain point of independence. There are many conditions that can benefit from receiving physical therapy in a nursing home. These conditions include arthritis, pain associated with cancer, dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s, stroke and incontinence.

=== Speech language therapy ===
Speech-language pathology is another service found in a nursing home. Speech language pathologists specialize in working with those who have a difficult time with language and/or speech, usually following an injury or an underlying diagnoses. The SLP will evaluate the person&#x27;s speech. If the person is having trouble with speech, this points to an issue with coordinating the movements and muscles used to produce speech. Trouble with language points to the person having difficulty with understanding what they are hearing and seeing. The SLP will also look at difficulty with swallowing food and will evaluate the person in order to figure out which part of the swallowing process is not working. Some of the many speech disorders worked with by the SLP are:
* phonology meaning the speech patterns used,
* apraxia meaning difficulty with coordinating the movements needed to make sounds,
* receptive language meaning difficulty understanding language,
* fluency meaning stuttering,
* expressive language meaning difficulty using language,
and many other disorders.

==Elder abuse==

Elder abuse is more prevalent in hospitalized settings including nursing homes than in the general community. There are three major types of abuses reported in nursing homes: physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.

Physical abuse is the intention or action to hurt an older person or senior citizen resulting in scars and bruising.

Emotional abuse occurs when an employee makes verbal threats and continuously degrades the patient, resulting in the patient experiencing mood swings, anxiety, and depression.

Sexual abuse is when an elderly patient is being forced into unwanted sexual activity by an employee, resident or visitor, usually attempted and reported when the patient is sleeping, sick, or weak.

Nursing home neglect is similar to elder abuse. It is when employees begin to repeatedly ignore and leave a patient alone, neglect the patient&#x27;s personal hygiene like bathing and brushing of teeth, provide the patient with an inadequate amount of food and water, or neglect to provide the patient with the correct amount of medication they require. One factor unique to elder abuse in nursing homes is that many nursing home contracts require residents to sign delegation clauses, giving up their right to trial by jury and instead using an arbitrator to settle disputes. In states such as Connecticut, nursing home abuse is considered a felony charge with minimum mandatory sentences.

==By country==
===Canada===

Long-term care facilities exist under three major types: privately owned, non-profit/charitable, and municipal. Regardless of their ownership, aspects of funding, admission criteria, and cost to the individuals are all regulated by their respective provincial governments. As medical care is publicly funded in Canada, all long-term care facilities receive funding from provincial governments for the health care component of the residence – the nurses and personal support workers. Residents pay daily rates for &#x27;room and board&#x27; (accommodation and food) that are determined by the type of room chosen, either shared or private. Provincial governments manage waiting lists for long-term care facilities. People who cannot afford to pay the monthly fees receive subsidies, and no one is refused due to inability to pay.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, care homes and care homes with nursing are regulated by different organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To enter a care home, a candidate patient needs an assessment of needs and of their financial condition from their local council. The candidate may also have an assessment by a nurse, should the patient require nursing care. The cost of a care home is means tested in England.

Care homes for adults in the UK are regulated by Care Quality Commission, which replaced the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and each care home is inspected at least every three years. In Wales the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales has responsibility for oversight, In Scotland Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland otherwise known as the Care Inspectorate, and in Northern Ireland the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland.

In 2002, nursing homes became known as care homes with nursing, and residential homes became known as care homes.

As of April 2009, the lower capital limit is £13,500. At this level, all income from pensions, savings, benefits and other sources, except a &quot;personal expenses allowance&quot; (currently £21.90), goes towards paying the care home fees. The local council pays the remaining contribution provided the room occupied is not more expensive than the local council&#x27;s normal rate.
The NHS has full responsibility for funding the whole placement if the resident is in a care home with nursing that meets the criteria for NHS continuing Health Care. This is identified by a multidisciplinary assessment process.

In May 2010, a coalition government announced the formation of an independent commission on the funding of long-term care, which was due to report within a 12-month time frame on the financing of care for an ageing population. It delivered its recommendations on Monday 4 July 2011. The Care Quality Commission have themselves implemented a re-registration process, completed in October 2010, which will result in a new form of regulation being outlined in April 2011.

In 2020 it emerged that some UK care home residents had blanket Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNACPR) orders applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. These decisions were made without discussion with the patients involved, and the practice is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission.

===United States===

In the United States, there are three main types of nursing facilities (NFs).

An intermediate care facility (ICF) is a health care facility for individuals who are disabled, elderly, or non-acutely ill, usually providing less intensive care than that offered at a hospital or skilled nursing facility. Typically an ICF is privately paid by the individual or by the individual&#x27;s family. An individual&#x27;s private health insurance and/or a third party service like a hospice company may cover the cost. Board and Care Homes are special facilities designed to provide those who require assisted living services both living quarters and proper care. Often referred to as residential care homes, these facilities can either be located in a small residential home or a large modern facility. In fact, a large majority of board and care homes are designed to accommodate fewer than 6 people. Board and care homes are typically staffed by licensed professionals, including nurses, doctors and other medical professionals. These facilities are highly regulated in order to ensure that the best possible care is being provided for the residents. Board and care homes offer residents 24-hour assistance, making them a highly popular choice for those in need of regular assistance.

Assisted living residences or assisted living facilities (ALFs) are housing facilities for people with disabilities. These facilities provide supervision or assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs); ALFs are an eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity.

A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is a nursing home certified to participate in, and be reimbursed by Medicare. Medicare is the federal program primarily for the aged (65+) who contributed to Social Security and Medicare while they were employed. Medicaid is the federal program implemented with each state to provide health care and related services to those who are below the poverty line. Each state defines poverty and therefore Medicaid eligibility. Those eligible for Medicaid may be low-income parents, children (including those in State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Programs (SCHIPs) and maternal-child wellness and food programs), seniors, and people with disabilities.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is the component of the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. A large portion of Medicare and Medicaid dollars is used each year to cover nursing home care and services for the elderly and disabled. State governments oversee the licensing of nursing homes. In addition, states have a contract with CMS to monitor those nursing homes that want to be eligible to provide care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Congress established minimum requirements for nursing homes that want to provide services under Medicare and Medicaid. These requirements are broadly outlined in the Social Security Act, which also entrusts the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing these requirements. CMS is also charged with the responsibility of working out the details of the law and how it will be implemented, which it does by writing regulations and manuals.

<text>Nicola (or Niccolò) Antonio Giacinto Porpora (17 August 16863 March 1768) was an Italian composer and teacher of singing of the Baroque era, whose most famous singing students were the castrati Farinelli and Caffarelli. Other students included composers Johann Adolph Hasse, Matteo Capranica and Joseph Haydn.

==Biography==
Porpora was born in Naples, Italy. He graduated from the music conservatory Poveri di Gesù Cristo of his native city, where the civic opera scene was dominated by Alessandro Scarlatti. Porpora&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Agrippina&quot;, was successfully performed at the Neapolitan court in 1708. His second, &quot;Berenice&quot;, was performed at Rome. In a long career, he followed these up by many further operas, supported as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; in the households of aristocratic patrons, such as the commander of military forces at Naples, prince Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt, or of the Portuguese ambassador at Rome, for composing operas alone did not yet make a viable career. However, his enduring fame rests chiefly upon his unequalled power of teaching singing. At the Neapolitan Conservatorio di Sant&#x27;Onofrio and with the Poveri di Gesù Cristo he trained Farinelli, Caffarelli, Salimbeni, and other celebrated vocalists, during the period 1715 to 1721. In 1720 and 1721 he wrote two serenades to libretti by a gifted young poet, Metastasio, the beginning of a long, though interrupted, collaboration. In 1722 his operatic successes encouraged him to lay down his conservatory commitments.

After a rebuff from the court of Charles VI at Vienna in 1725, Porpora settled mostly in Venice, composing and teaching regularly in the schools of La Pietà and the Incurabili. In 1729 the anti-Handel clique invited him to London to set up an opera company as a rival to Handel&#x27;s, without success, and in the 1733–1734 season, even the presence of his pupil, the great Farinelli, failed to save the dramatic company in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields (the &quot;Opera of the Nobility&quot;) from bankruptcy.

An interval as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at the Dresden court of the Elector of Saxony and Polish King Augustus from 1748 ended in strained relations with his rival in Venice and Rome, the hugely successful opera composer Johann Adolph Hasse and his wife, the prima donna Faustina, and resulted in Porpora&#x27;s departure in 1752.

As his accompanist and valet he hired the youthful Joseph Haydn, who was making his way in Vienna as a struggling freelancer. Haydn later remembered Porpora thus: &quot;There was no lack of &quot;Asino&quot;, &quot;Coglione&quot;, &quot;Birbante&quot; [ass, cullion, rascal], and pokes in the ribs, but I put up with it all, for I profited greatly from Porpora in singing, in composition, and in the Italian language.&quot; He also said that he had learned from the maestro &quot;the true fundamentals of composition&quot;.

In 1753 Porpora spent three summer months, with Haydn in tow, at the spa town Mannersdorf am Leithagebirge. His function there was to continue the singing lessons of the mistress of the ambassador of Venice to the Austrian Empire, Pietro Correr.

Porpora returned in 1759 to Naples.

From this time Porpora&#x27;s career was a series of misfortunes: his florid style was becoming old-fashioned, his last opera, &quot;Camilla&quot;, failed, his pension from Dresden stopped, and he became so poor that the expenses of his funeral were paid by a subscription concert. Yet at the moment of his death, Farinelli and Caffarelli were living in splendid retirement on fortunes largely based on the excellence of the old maestro&#x27;s teaching.

A good linguist, who was admired for the idiomatic fluency of his recitatives, and a man of considerable literary culture, Porpora was also celebrated for his conversational wit. He was well-read in Latin and Italian literature, wrote poetry and spoke French, German, and English.

Besides some four dozen operas, there are oratorios, solo cantatas with keyboard accompaniment, motets and vocal serenades. Among his larger works, his 1720 opera &quot;Orlando&quot;, oratorio &quot;Gedeone&quot; (1737), one mass, his Venetian Vespers, and the operas &quot;Germanico in Germania&quot; (1732) and &quot;Arianna in Nasso&quot; (1733 according to HOASM) have been recorded.

<text>Bebington () is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside, England. Historically part of Cheshire, it is south of Liverpool, close to the River Mersey on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula. Nearby towns include Birkenhead and Wallasey to the north-northwest, and Heswall to the west-southwest. Bebington railway station opened in 1838 and is on the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network.

Bebington was an ancient parish, which included the two villages of Lower Bebington around the parish church of St Andrew&#x27;s and Higher Bebington to the west, as well as several other surrounding hamlets. Following the 2021 census, the Office for National Statistics defined a Bebington built up area which had a population of 57,600. The Bebington electoral ward covers a much smaller area around the original village centres of Higher Bebington and Lower Bebington. Some definitions of Bebington include adjoining areas such as Port Sunlight (an early planned factory town), New Ferry, Spital and Storeton. The former Municipal Borough of Bebington, a local authority between 1937 and 1974, also included within its boundaries Bromborough, Eastham, Raby, Thornton Hough and Brimstage, which now fall within the electoral wards of Bromborough, Eastham and Clatterbridge.

According to a 2015 study commissioned by Royal Mail from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, Bebington&#x27;s postcode area, CH63, is the most desirable in England in which to live and work. The study found that the area had &quot;the ideal balance&quot; of housing close to places of work, good schools and high employment.

==History==
The name Bebington is derived from the Anglo-Saxon meaning the &quot;Village of Bebba&quot;, probably a Saxon chief or landowner.

The area is thought to be the site of the &quot;Birth of England&quot; at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937,
an English victory by the army of Æthelstan, King of England, and his brother Edmund over the combined armies of Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin, Constantine II, King of Alba, and Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of the Cumbrians. Though relatively little known today, it was called &quot;the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before Hastings.&quot; Michael Livingston claimed that Brunanburh marks &quot;the moment when Englishness came of age.&quot; The Brackenwood golf course was cited in 2004 as the most likely site for the Battle of Brunanburh.
Mention of the battle is made in dozens of sources, in Old English, Latin, Irish, Welsh, Anglo-Norman and Middle English, and there are many later accounts or responses to the battle. A contemporary record of the battle is found in the Old English poem Battle of Brunanburh, preserved in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

The Church of St. Andrew, on a site occupied since Saxon times, dates from the 14th and 16th centuries.
In 1801, Bebington was a small country hamlet with a population of only 273, situated on the main road connecting Chester and Birkenhead, and then via ferry to Liverpool. Up to 30 horse-drawn coaches would pass by each day. By 1840, the Birkenhead to Chester railway was running and in 1844 the New Chester Road opened and Bebington lost its coaching traffic.

In 1838, the footprints of an archosaur later called the &quot;Chirotherium storetonese&quot; were found in a sandstone bed at Storeton Quarry. Examples can be seen at the Liverpool Museum and at Christ Church within the parish of Higher Bebington. Also a small example can be seen at Higher Bebington Junior School, in their reception area.

Stone quarried at Bebington was used for the construction of Birkenhead Town Hall, some of the villas around Birkenhead and Rock Parks and most famously of all the Empire State Building in New York City. The stone is considered to be a high quality sandstone which is creamy in appearance. The quarries were eventually filled in with debris removed during the construction of the two Mersey Tunnels.

Mayer Hall, in Lower Bebington village, was formerly an art gallery built by Bebington philanthropist Joseph Mayer, a noted antiquarian, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon antiquaries helped in the development of British archaeology. He made Pennant House his home. It is still a community resource and boasts many of its original features.

==Geography==
Bebington is on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton, about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Gayton and less than west-north-west of the River Mersey at New Ferry. The area is situated at an elevation of between above sea level.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Bebington, at metropolitan borough level: Wirral Council. The council is a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region.

===Administrative history===
Bebington was an ancient parish in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into five townships, called Higher Bebington, Lower Bebington, Poulton cum Spital, Storeton, and Tranmere. The original parish church, St Andrew&#x27;s, is at Lower Bebington. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Bebington, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so each township became a separate civil parish.

Local government districts, each governed by an elected local board, were established in 1859 for Higher Bebington, in 1860 for Tranmere, and in 1863 for Lower Bebington. The Tranmere district was abolished in 1877 and its area incorporated into the borough of Birkenhead. Port Sunlight was developed from 1888 on land within the Lower Bebington district.
Local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Lower Bebington Urban District Council bought Pennant House to serve as its headquarters in 1901, using the adjoining Mayer Hall as its council chamber.
The three urban districts of Lower Bebington, Higher Bebington and neighbouring Bromborough to the south were merged into a single Bebington and Bromborough Urban District in 1922. The urban district was renamed Bebington in 1933, when its territory was also significantly enlarged to take in the neighbouring parishes of Storeton, Poulton cum Spital, Brimstage, Thornton Hough, Raby, and Eastham. The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1934. Bebington Urban District was raised to the status of a municipal borough in 1937.
A new Town Hall was built opposite Pennant House in 1955 as one of the first phases of a wider civic centre. The borough council continued to meet at Mayer Hall until a new council chamber was completed in 1971 as one of the later phases of the civic centre complex, forming part of the same building as Bebington Central Library.

The borough of Bebington was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the new county of Merseyside.

==Education==
Bebington contains ten main schools; Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Wirral Grammar School for Girls, St John Plessington Catholic College, St John&#x27;s Junior and Infant Schools, Higher Bebington Junior School, Co-op Academy Bebington, Brackenwood Junior School, Stanton Road Primary School, St Andrew&#x27;s Primary School, Town Lane Infants School, Church Drive Primary School.

==Cultural references==
The Oval Sports Centre was used in the film, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, to portray the 1924 Colombes Olympic Stadium in Paris.

==Warship Week WW2==
In March 1942 after a successful ‘Warship Week’ National Savings campaign HMS Sabre (H18) was adopted by the civil community of Bebington, Cheshire, the same month she was detached for escort of the Russian Convoy PQ 13 during its initial stage of passage to Iceland in the Northwest Approaches.

<doc id="430728" wikidata="Q16240947" url="?curid=430728" title="BMX racing">
<text>BMX racing is a type of bicycle racing which features BMX riders sharing a short single-lap circuit or point-to-point course, with multiple banked corners, jumps and rollers. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing, and sanctioned internationally by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), facilitated by a number of continental, national and local sanctioning bodies.

==History==

While informal bicycle racing existed to different extents, it was in Southern California that the sport of BMX started to become organized and resemble the modern sport. Original influencers included Ron Mackler, who was a park attendant in Santa Monica and set up races at Palms Park in West Los Angeles in 1969. Mackler, a teenager with motocross experience helped organize local boys who wanted to race. The first race took place on July 10, 1969. Four years later, in 1973, back-to-back seasons of ten weeks in duration were established with an entrance fee of $4.50. The track ran through the southeast areas of the park with variations in topography; the track remained relatively unchanged through 1980.

==Bikes sizes==
There are two BMX racing bikes sizes. The first is the 20-inch (ISO 406mm) wheel bicycle. The 20&quot; wheel bikes are referred to as &quot;Class&quot; bikes, with an outer tire diameter up to 22.5&quot;. The second type is &quot;Cruiser&quot; bikes which are any bikes with an outer tire diameter larger than 22.5&quot;. The most common cruiser size uses a 24&quot; (ISO 507mm) wheel.

==Advantages==
While BMX racing is an individual sport, teams are often formed from racers in different classifications for camaraderie and for business exposure of a sponsoring organization or company. BMX racing rewards strength, quickness, and bike handling. Many successful BMX racers have gone on to leverage their skills in other forms of bicycle and motorcycle competitions.

==Track features==
There are many types of BMX jumps, ranging from small rollers to massive step-up doubles. There are pro straights for professional racers which are doubles that range from about 6 m to 12 m, while &quot;Class&quot; straights have more flow and have many more range of jumps.


The Start Gate

The start gate marks the start of the track. Most BMX tracks have a gate. The starting hill will normally provide all the speed for the remainder of the race. Generally, the larger the hill, the faster, so pro hills are much larger than the amateur ones.

Step-up

A step-up jump is one where the landing point is at a higher elevation than the take-off point.

Berms

Turns which are at an angle. Therefore, one can easily turn without having to brake.

Double

A double is two hills close enough to each other that it is possible to jump between them.

Step-down

A step-down jump is one where the landing point is at a lower elevation than the take-off point.

Roller

A small hill, generally too low to be jumped off. Rollers are normally built in groups that are known as rhythm sections because they challenge the riders&#x27; ability to maintain speed over the bumps.

Tabletop

A tabletop is a jump where the track is level across between the take-off and landing points. They are especially useful for beginning BMX riders who are still learning how to jump since a too-short jump will land on the level tabletop rather than slamming into the uphill side of the landing hill.

Pro set

A set of jumps with only a takeoff lip and a landing ramp, that is, where a failure to take-off or to jump far enough will result in a crash.

==Olympics==
BMX racing became a medal sport at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under the UCI sanctioning body. BMX racing has appeared in the 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024 Summer Olympics.

==Sanctioning bodies==
A sanctioning body is a private (in the United States and most Western Nations) governing body which controls a sport or specific discipline thereof. One or more sanctioning bodies may operate in a sport at any given time, often with subtle rule variations which appeal to regional tastes. They make and enforce the rules, and decide the qualifications and responsibilities of the participants, including the players, owners, and operators of facilities. In legal terms, they are an intermediary between the participants and higher governing bodies such as (in cycling) the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and National Governing Bodies such as USA BMX. Sanctioning bodies mete out discipline and punishments, as well as bestow awards and rankings of their participants.

In the Bicycle Motocross context, sanctioning bodies are chiefly responsible for providing insurance coverage and other &quot;back office&quot; services to local tracks. They also keep points on riders&#x27; performance throughout the year, and undertake the production of a national racing series (which is typically 18-22 weekends per year). Riders are permitted to race at the sanctioning body&#x27;s affiliated tracks and national events via the purchase of an annual membership. As part of their administrative &quot;service provider&quot; role, BMX sanctioning bodies also determine the rules of competition, such as clothing requirements, age and gender divisions (or &quot;classes&quot;), as well as the rules and protocol for advancement in proficiency classes (Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Girl Expert, Cruiser, Girl Cruiser, Vet Pro, Men/Women Junior, and Men/Women Pro.)

BMX Racing has had many sanctioning bodies over its 40-year history as an organized sport, the first being Scot Breithaupt&#x27;s Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS), created in the early 1970s (see below). Since then, there have been dozens of regional, national, and international sanctioning bodies, some of them associated with or owned by another. Most are defunct or have been merged into larger, more successful organizations, but a handful still exist in their original forms.

In the United States, USA BMX is the main sanctioning body which was formed in 2011 from the merger of the two largest organizations, the ABA and NBL.

===Australia===

====Australian Bicycle Motocross Association (ABMXA)====
Two ABMXA sanctioning bodies that formed in the history of BMX in Australia:

The first one was formed in May 1975 by Bob Smith, an Australian businessman and two of his friends. He open the first BMX track in Australia on May 17, 1975, on the Gold Coast in Tallebudgera, Queensland adjacent to the Tally Valley Golf Club. He had admired BMX through the American magazines his son brought home.

The second ABMXA was formed in April 1981 from three regional Australian BMX organizations: The Victoria BMX Association; (VBMXA), the Queensland BMX Association (QBMXA) and the New South Wales BMX Association (NSWBMXA). It was Australia&#x27;s representative to the IBMXF in the 1980s.

Currently, the ABMXA is governed by Auscycling, creating mediated and consistent rules and regulations.

====National Bicycle Association (NBA)====

The National Bicycle Association was a third, separate Australian sanctioning body. It was formed in December 1981 and had branches in different countries around the world. By the summer of 1982 it had 20,000 members worldwide and 950 members in the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. Despite sharing a common name this association had nothing to do with the original United States–based National Bicycle Association that was formed in California in 1974 and ironically merged with the National Bicycle League and ceased operations as an independent body in December 1981, the same month and year the Australian namesake was formed.

====Bicycle Motocross Australia (BMXA)====
BMX Australia (BMXA) is the current sanctioning body for BMX in Australia.

===Canada===
*Cycling Canada Cyclism (CCC)
*BMX Canada

Currently - Cycling Canada http://www.cyclingcanada.ca/ is the Federal Sanctioning body for all Canadian cycling disciplines (including BMX) under the UCI.
Some tracks and Provinces have chosen BMX Canada over the Provincial UCI representative. Here are the different choices that are available in Canada,

Alberta - ABA -Alberta BMX Association. http://www.albertabmx.com/

British Columbia - Cycling BC. http://cyclingbc.net/bmx/

Saskatchewan - http://www.saskcycling.ca/BMX.html 

Quebec - http://www.fqsc.net/BMX

All Ontario tracks and some BC tracks are sanctioned by an American corporation - USA BMX (also known as ABA) under the assumed name BMX Canada - http://www.bmxcanada.org
These tracks run rules separate from the UCI but offer similar race structure and age categorization. BMX Canada offers full support to their affiliated tracks, including point tracking, marketing materials, an in-house magazine and a coaching/retention program. Results from these races run under the USA BMX/BMX Canada name are used in the team selection process for Provincial and National teams.

===France===

====Fédération Française de Bicrossing (FFB)====
La Fédération Française de Bicrossing, which in English translates to The French Federation of Bicrossing (FFB) was created on March 1, 1978, by Marcelle Seurat, a motorcycle importer and distributor. At first its primary purpose was to promote BMX and its products. On May 17, 1980, it held is first race in Beaune, France. This organization would cease to exist in early 1981 after only acquiring 100 members.

====Association Française de Bicrossing (AFdB)====
L&#x27;Association Française de Bicrossing, which in English translates to the French Association of Bicrossing (FAB), was founded by Raymond Imbert, Rene Nicolas, Denis Mourier, Bernard Nicolas, Fabrice Pérez, Gerard Hinault and Pascal Giboulot on March 1, 1981.

====Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC)====
On January 1, 1990, the AFdB joined the FFC. On March 4, 1993, BMX was recognized as an important sport by the French Ministry for sports. Today the official French BMX Sanctioning body is now the Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC), or in English the French Cycling Federation (FCF). It has almost 10,000 members.

===Italy===

====Associazione Italiana BMX (A.I.BMX)====
The &quot;Associazione Italiana BMX&quot;, which in English translates to &quot;Italian BMX Association&quot;, was founded in December 1981 by Aldo Gandolfo, an Italian journalist and sport promoter. In 1983 the A.I.BMX joined the I.BMX.F. and held the first official Italian BMX race. In 1984, the A.I.BMX held the first Italian international race in Pinerolo and organized the first Italian participation in European Championships. In 1985 Galdolfo left the Association, which was refounded with a new statute and a new board of directors. In 1988 the A.I.BMX concluded an agreement with the UISP in order to unify their respective national championships and in 1989 ceased the activity.

====Unione Italiana Sport per Tutti (UISP)====
The &quot;Unione Italiana Sport per Tutti&quot;, which in English translates to &quot;Italian Sport For All Association&quot;, is an amateur sport association which conducted an official BMX racing activity from 1985 to 1990, mainly developed in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. In 1988 concluded an agreement with the A.I.BMX in order to unify their respective national championships and in 1991 ceased the BMX activity.

====Federazione Ciclistica Italiana====
The Federazione Ciclistica Italiana (FCI), which in English translates to &quot;Italian Cycling Federation&quot;, is the national governing body of cycle racing in Italy and started conducting official BMX activity in 1984. It was a big promoter of BMX racing within the &quot;Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme&quot; (FIAC) and in 1985 held the first FIAC World Championship in Jesolo (near Venice). Every year the FCI organize the National Championship (held in a single race normally on the first Sunday of July) and a season-long competition called &quot;Circuito Italiano BMX&quot; (seven rounds in 2008, with the same point system as the UEC European Championship) open to Italian and foreign riders.

===Japan===
*Japan Bicycle Motocross Association (JBA)

===Netherlands===

====Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN)====
The first sanctioning body in the Netherlands was called the Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Foundation (DBMXF)) and was co-founded on October 19, 1978, by Gerrit Does and Louis Vrijdag. It held its first race on April 21, 1979. In December 1980 it was folded into the KNWU (see below) but a second incarnation was created in 1987 called the Stichting Fietscross Promotie Nederland (the Dutch BMX Promotion Foundation) to promote Dutch racing in the Netherlands. This second &quot;SFN&quot; was dissolved in 1997.

====Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie (KNWU)====
On December 16, 1980, the SFN was integrated into the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie (KNWU) (in English the Royal Dutch Cycling Federation (RDCF)), the Dutch cycling sanctioning body that was the governing body for all types of cycling and represents the Netherlands as a member of the UCI.

====Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF)====
Some of the then-existing local tracks in 1980 did not become a member of the KNWU. Operating for a while independently, they formed another sanctioning body in 1987, the Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF), (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Federation (DBMXF)).

Both organizations function as sanctioning bodies for BMX racing.

===New Zealand===

*BMX New Zealand Incorporated (BMXNZ) is the recognised National Sporting Organisation (NSO) for BMX racing in New Zealand. It is a founding Member Organisation of Cycling New Zealand (CNZ) the National Federation for cycling in New Zealand. BMXNZ has a membership of 32 clubs (as of January 2017) based in seven regions.

===United Kingdom===

====United kingdom bicycle motocross association (UKBMXA)====
The UKBMXA was created in April 1980 by David Duffield as first as a way of promoting BMX in England. On August 30, 1980, it held its first BMX race in Redditch, England. This sanctioning body would later become affiliated with the IBMXF and represent England in the IBMXF sanctioned events including the European and World Championships. In the summer of 1985 it merged with the National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBMXA) with the UKBMXA being the dominant partner with its name carrying on.

====National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBMXA)====
The National Bicycle Motocross Association was a British sanctioning body headquartered in Ashton in Makersfield, Wigan England.

====English Bicycle Association (EBA)====

In November 1989 UKBMX Association (UKBMXA) and the British BMX Association (BBMXA) merged and formed the English Bicycle Association (EBA). This combination would represent England in the IBMXF.

====British Cycling====

The EBA merged with the British Cycling Federation (BCF) which had represented all other aspects and disciplines of English bicycle racing other than BMX. This organization is now known as British Cycling. British Cycling now represents all aspects of sport cycling in the United Kingdom including BMX within the UCI.

It is not to be confused with the now-defunct United States–based National Bicycle Motocross Association (NBmxA) (1972–1981) that was formerly known as the National Bicycle Association (NBA) and was the first BMX sanctioning body in the world. The British NBMXA ceased operations in the summer of 1985.

===United States===
On July 10, 1969, a group of boys riding their Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycles in Palms Park in West Los Angeles wanted to race. A park attendant, Ronald Mackler, a teenager with motorcycle motocross (MX) experience, helped them organize. Palms Park became to BMX as Elysian Fields is to American baseball, for at that moment Bicycle Motocross racing was born. By 1973, entrance fees of US$4.50 (which included a US$1.00 insurance fee for the year) for a 10-week season of Thursday-night racing was charged, and the top three racers in the season were given trophies. Then a new season of 10 weeks would start the following Thursday.

The track operated well into the 1980s largely unchanged;, including the lack of a modern starting gate.

====Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS)====

The first BMX proto sanctioning body was the Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS) founded by Scot Breithaupt in Long Beach, California on November 14, 1970, when he was fourteen years old. On that day he put on his first ad hoc BMX race. At first BUMS simply referred to the transients that congregated in the field around 7th and Bellflower Streets where the track was located, but later Scot turned it into the acronym BUMS. The first race had 35 participants, who paid Scot a quarter (US25 cents) each for the privilege. At the next race 150 kids showed up.

Since Scot was a motorcycle racer, he knew even at thirteen the importance of a sanctioning body and how races were run and organized. He used his personal trophies that he won racing motocross motorcycles as awards for the winning competitors. He gave out membership cards, wrote the rulebook, and had a points system for scoring and proficiency level promotion. He ran the first state championship in 1972, when he was all of 16 years old. Also due to his racing experience, he knew how to lay out a particularly exciting course. The track was about long and much more demanding than today&#x27;s typical BMX course. It was more akin to what the professionals race on in special Pro sections of track at large events today, including water holes and high dropoffs. Indeed, this early track resembled more closely a shortened mountain biking course than today&#x27;s comparatively well groomed BMX tracks. With the aforementioned exception of pro sections, today&#x27;s tracks for the most part are pretty tame by comparison due to insurance concerns by the sanctioning bodies. The National Bicycle League even went so far as to ban double jumps in 1988.

This first structured sanctioning body would eventually grow to seven tracks in California. This is what made him different from other track operators at the time: he did not just start one track but several others under a single jurisdiction of rules and regulations, all the requirements of a sanctioning body.

Among the firsts credited to BUMS was the first professional race in 1975 at Saddleback Park with a US$200 purse. Breithaupt also promoted in a joint venture with the new National Bicycle Association (NBA) (which was established the year before) what would later be called &quot;Nationals&quot; with the Yamaha Bicycle Gold Cup series in 1974. They were three separate qualifying races held at three separate tracks in California sponsored and heavily promoted by Yamaha Motor Company Ltd. to decide the first &quot;National&quot; No. 1 racer at a fourth and final race at the Los Angeles Coliseum. It was an achievement of import in the infancy of BMX, but it was not a true national since virtually all the events were held in California and almost all racers were Californians. It would be left for other innovators to create a true national event.

====National Bicycle Association (NBA)====

Many followed Ronald Mackler, Rich Lee and Scot Breithaupt, opening impromptu often short-lived tracks sometimes within preexisting Motorcycle Motocross tracks; but with the exception of Breithaupt, the operators were independent &quot;organizations&quot; that operated individual tracks without any cohesion. What was needed was a governing body that would standardize and give direction and purpose to the grab bag of these amateur-run (in that these operators did not have this enterprise as the main concern of their lives) tracks.

The first official BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot he was a promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed a group of kids trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today&#x27;s standards as Scot Breithaupt&#x27;s BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.

Mismanagement irreparably damaged its reputation, including such practices as not reporting points totals in time, running races late and behind schedule, deliberately scheduling its own events opposite the events of other sanctioning bodies to weaken their attendance, and a less-than-attentive attitude to members. In its last two years it went through a name change to National BMX Association (NBmxA) in 1979. It tried to reorganize in 1981, starting new tracks and by most accounts had a spark of new energy and enthusiasm, but still suffered lack of ridership (racers were committed to other point races with the other sanctioning bodies). This was to no avail. The NBA, suffering financial difficulties, ceased sanctioning its own races and started joint operations and did merge its membership (but did not merge its management) with the NBL after the 1981 season.

Mr. Alexander did try at least one more foray into the sport he helped to pioneer: he started the World Wide Bicycle Motocross Association (WWBMXA) in Chatsworth, California in 1981. Unfortunately it did not last more than two racing seasons.

====National Bicycle League (NBL)====

The National Bicycle League (NBL), a nonprofit organization, was started in 1974 by George Edward Esser (September 17, 1925 – August 31, 2006). It was originally based in Pompano Beach, Florida, in the US, but ultimately moved its headquarters is located in Hilliard, Ohio. George Esser was exposed to BMX by his son Greg Esser, who was famous within the sport and one of the sport&#x27;s earliest superstars and first professionals. Like Ernie Alexander and Scot Breithaupt before him, he was a promoter who created the NBL as the BMX auxiliary to the National Motorcycle League (NML), now-defunct, when he became dissatisfied with how the races were run.

The NBL expanded rapidly on the East Coast of the United States and for most of its early history it had only a few tracks west of the Mississippi River. That changed in 1982 when it inherited the membership and tracks of the defunct National Bicycle Association (NBA) which had ceased sanctioning its own races and went into partnership with the NBL. The NBL acquired all the NBA tracks in the nation including all those west of the Mississippi. As a result, it became a nation-spanning sanctioning body like the ABA.

In 1997 the NBL joined USA Cycling, a sanctioning body that has long supported road race, mountain biking and other cycling disciplines in the United States, tracing its roots back to 1920. The resulting organization was the National Federated body that represents cycling in the United States. USA Cycling is part of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) also known as UCI Cycling, the Switzerland-based international governing body that oversees virtually all aspects of cycling around the world (see International Sanctioning bodies below).

The NBL had a previous association with the UCI through its affiliations with the defunct NBL sister organization, the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF), which was also co-founded by Mr. Esser. The UCI absorbed IBMXF in 1993 through its amateur cycling division, Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), which in the prior five years held joint World Championships for BMX with the IBMXF (See International Sanctioning bodies below).

On May 17, 2011, the NBL announced that a letter of agreement was signed and approved by their Board of Directors, to merge operations with the ABA. The merged organization would be controlled by ABA ownership, and would be called USA BMX. After a month of negotiation between the parties, the final documents were signed on June 18, 2011. That day was the first time in more than 35 years that the sport of BMX Racing was run under a single sanctioning body in North America. The following week, the NBL Midwest National in Warsaw, Indiana was the first event to be run under the USA BMX banner (though was still an NBL-branded event, as part of their 2011 national series). The 2011 NBL Grand National was the final NBL race to be held, held September 3–4, 2011 and dubbed &quot;The Grand Finale.&quot;

====American Bicycle Association (ABA)====

The American Bicycle Association (ABA), created by Gene Roden and Merl Mennenga in 1977, originated in Chandler, Arizona, USA. As the NBA was declining, the ABA inherited many of its tracks and members making the ABA (within two years) the largest and the first nation-spanning sanctioning body. It was the ABA which introduced the &quot;Direct Transfer System&quot; that shortened the duration of race events. The ABA also started the team trophy concept to award trophies and prizes to the bicycle shop and factory teams with the best race results over a season. It was also the first to install electronic gates for its starting line with &quot;Christmas tree&quot; style lights (reminiscent of drag racing), to ensure fair starts. The ABA also established the BMX Hall of Fame, now called the National BMX Hall of Fame, which recognizes the pioneers and industry visionaries of the sport.

It was the largest sanctioning body in the world (a position it won as early as 1979 when it surpassed the NBL and the old NBA in numbers) with an estimated 60,000 members and 272 affiliated tracks in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It was technically an international organization, but did not bill itself as one, based on its mandate to grow BMX in the United States, unlike its predecessor, the International Bicycle Motocross Association (IBMX), and its chief early rival, the NBA, both of which had international aspirations.

The ABA brand was retired at the close of the 2011 season, becoming USA BMX as part of its merger with the rival National Bicycle League (NBL).

====USA BMX====

USA BMX was formed in 2011 from the merger of the ABA and NBL organizations (with ABA taking control, and is the current sanctioning body for BMX racing in the United States. As the sport has grown in the United States and Internationally, BMX racing has evolved with new rules, classes, and competition. A consolidated governing body had become a necessity to solidify BMX racing as a recognized cycling sport both nationally and internationally. In the following years since USA BMX was formed, the ABA and NBL rivalry that once permeated BMX in the United States has been forgotten.

====Other notable American sanctioning bodies====

Along with the majors and pioneers, there were other BMX governing bodies, both national and regional. Among them were the Bicycle Motocross League (BMXL); the United Bicycle Racers Association (UBR) (1977–1983); the United States Bicycle Motocross Association (USBA) (1984–1986), which merged with the ABA at the end of the 1986 racing season after financial trouble made it unsustainable; the International Cycling Association (ICA), which was started in part by professional racer Greg Hill in 1990; and the Southeast Region-based National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA) (1975–1988). These organizations have all ceased to exist.

==International sanctioning bodies==

===International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF)===

The International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) was founded on April 3, 1981, by Gerrit Does, a former motocross racer and Dutch citizen. He introduced BMX to the Netherlands in 1974 after seeing it in the United States. He also started the first European BMX sanctioning body the Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Foundation (DBMXF) in English) in the Netherlands in 1978. George Esser, the same man who founded the American-based National Bicycle League (NBL) in 1974 was the co-founder of the IBMXF, after Mr. Does approached the NBL to begin preparations for the new body in December 1980 with the representatives of sanctioning bodies from Canada, Colombia, Japan, Panama, and Venezuela as well as representing his native the Netherlands. The IBMXF was a Waalre, the Netherlands-based body that conducted international events including its own World Championship event until its formal merger with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) amateur cycling division the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) in 1996 to form the largest international sanctioning body. The UCI championships have since superseded the old IBMXF championships and unlike the old FIAC BMX championships it has a pro class. The NBL was affiliated with the UCI through its previous ties with the IBMXF and its merger with the FIAC. 

In the old days of the IBMXF, when riders raced an IBMXF sanctioned race, they received NBL state points and points that went toward trheir international standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for national number one plates. The World Championship title was open to 16 &amp; over Experts and older amateurs in the 20&quot; class as well as Pros in the 20&quot; class. There is a class in European BMX called Superclass. In this class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted definition of amateur. However, no racer in Superclass could win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF affiliate the NBL, Superclass is the equivalent of the old &quot;B&quot; pro class and &quot;A&quot; pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World Championships.

Among the European standards of racing the IBMXF observed is the rule that racers must stay within their lanes until out of the gate. This is to prevent racers from throwing elbows at each other and to eliminate major crashes before they even get to the first jump. However, on tracks with short straights those who must start from the outside lanes are at a serious disadvantage since they cannot begin moving inside to shorten the distance before the first turn. As a result, many races could be won or lose by lane assignment even before the race begins.

In the first year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after having standard racers decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill&#x27;s participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best of them. Because of this loss of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion.

On January 1, 1993, the IBMXF and the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), the amateur governing branch of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) which handled Olympic Cycling, merged formally after having held joint World Championships since July 22, 1991 in Sandness, Norway (FIAC had been holding its own separate BMX World Championships starting 1986). After a further three year transition time in which the European and World Championships where credited as &quot;IBMXF/FIAC&quot; the UCI held its first official BMX World Championship in 1996 in England. It has continued to hold BMX European and World Championships ever since.

===Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC)===

The Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) which in English stands for International Amateur Cycling Federation, which was based in Rome, Italy, was the amateur cycling arm of the UCI. It had direct ties to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It had no professional division. That was the purview of its professional counterpart based in Luxembourg, the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP), also operated by the UCI. However, a class of paid amateurs called the Superclass is allowed even though it may contradict the accepted notions of what an amateur is. However, members of the Supercross class could not win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. In any case, with the allowance of professionals in the Olympics this has largely become a moot point. USA Cycling, formerly the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) as it was known at the time, was the American affiliate of FIAC. However, it did not have a BMX division at this time. The NBL worked through the then independent IBMXF. Today after purchasing the NBL USA Cycling the NBL represents BMX in the UCI through USA Cycling.

FIAC started holding its own BMX World Championships in 1984. At the time the IBMXF and FIAC were two separate International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. However, the IBMXF&#x27;s was far more prestigious, professionally competently run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association (then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States&#x27;s case, it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced at the time in running BMX races. In some nations, if riders race in the IBMXF circuit (see above), they could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being allowed to race in NBL if they raced the ABA circuit, if they had such rules in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC&#x27;s only experience. For instance, racing three times to determine average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL. If the class was big enough, riders raced the eighths, quarters and semis, also three times, and the best racers qualified for the Main. Main qualifiers had to race the Main five times to find the final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20&quot; class raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time-consuming, even at races scheduled over two days.

For a sanctioning body then new to BMX, it was pretty efficient in terms of running an event (taking into consideration the multiple qualifying runs). However, because of its inexperience it was plagued with tracks of inferior quality, both in terms of difficulty, they were deemed far too easy for venues of an international event; and the building materials used, for example during the 1988 Championships in Mol, Belgium the track was built out of white sand, which became particularly boggy in the turns. &quot;It feels like riding on the beach&quot; was a refrain from many American racers. This inexperience of track construction was rectified by 1991 when the FIAC and the IBMXF started holding combined World Championship series in 1991 after four years of holding separate championship events. The two bodies formally unified in 1993 (FICP was disbanded along with the FIAC by the UCI). After a three-year transition period, The UCI held its first World Championship in 1996 after absorbing the IBMXF and abolishing FIAC. With the increasing relaxation of the rules of Professionalism in the IOC, the merged governing body, run directly by the UCI, retained the professional division.

===Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI)===

The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) or in English the International Cycling Union, is a Switzerland-based international sanctioning body created in 1900 which has had its own international BMX racing program since 1982 (through FIAC) and have been holding BMX World Championships for BMX racing since 1996. The UCI also supports Mountain Bike, Track, Road Race Cycling, and Cyclo-Cross. The UCI through its amateur division FIAC, held championships were separate and distinct from the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) World Championships until they started to hold the World Championships jointly starting in 1991 (see above). The American sanctioning body the National Bicycle League (NBL) was affiliated with the UCI via the old IBMXF which the NBL was a part of. With the merger of the IBMXF with FIAC, they in turn being folded into the UCI, and the NBL joining the USA Cycling directly, the NBL was affiliated with the UCI from 1996 to 2008. After the ABA and NBL merger and founding of USA BMX in 2011, USA Cycling maintained the UCI affiliation with USA BMX handling logistics for UCI races at American BMX tracks. USA BMX riders who race in a UCI qualifying event in the United States may use their USA BMX membership to do so, but USA BMX riders participating in UCI events outside of North America, at UCI Finals, or the Olympics must buy an international race license from USA Cycling.

==General rules of advancement in organized BMX racing==
To advance a racer must win 10 races as a Novice to advance to Intermediate. Upon winning 20 races (or 10 as a girl) in the Intermediate class the rider will move to Expert, the highest non-Pro class. Boys and girls are combined and race together in Novice and Intermediate classes; at the Expert level boys and girls are separated into Expert and Girls Expert. Any rider can request to be moved into a different class (typically to advance) regardless of number of wins, but upon doing so the rider cannot reclass again or return to their former class for one year. Cruiser and Girls Cruiser have no advancement and are only separated by age.

===Skill levels, race structure, qualifying methods, awards===
For North Americans racing with USA BMX (or affiliate BMX Canada) racers in the 20&quot; class are grouped with others of the same relative age and experience levels; Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Girls Expert, Vet Pro, Men Pro, and Women Pro. The Veteran, A Pro, AA Pro, Rookie, B Pro (Superclass) and A Pro (Elite) classes were retired or renamed upon either the 2011 ABA-NBL merger or prior to the 2021 BMX racing season. Cruiser classes are not divided into skill classes, only age classes.

The UCI structure is divided by age classes and lacks the skill levels such as novice and intermediate; rather 7 year-olds will ride with 7 year-olds regardless of experience level. UCI pro racing classes are Men/Women Junior, Men/Women U23 (Under 23), and Men/Women Elite.

There are two main types of races; the Transfer System, and the Total Points System. Note that 8 riders are the maximum number of riders per moto. If more than 8 riders of the same age and skill are present multiple motos will be run to determine the final 8 riders who will race for placement, i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., etc.

In a Transfer System race the racer will ride in qualifying rounds, called motos (called heats in other types of racing) to determine the number of racers in the finals which are called Mains. The sizes and number of motos at a skill level and age group is determined by the number of racers who register for that race and in their respective skill level and age group. Usually a racer gets two chances (sometimes three) to qualify. In a transfer race the top finishers in the qualifying motos are transferred directly to the Main depending on the size of the class. The last place racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main.

In the Total Points System a racer must race three times and is scored on their respective places for the three motos. The scoring formula (rider&#x27;s three finishes added together) combines the rider&#x27;s finishing place in their class for each round. The lower the points total determines the rider&#x27;s placement or advancement. A rider finishing the three motos in 2nd, 3rd, and 2nd place would have a score of 7; a rider in the same class finishing 1st, 4th, and 1st would have a score of 6, effectively beating the rider with 7 points. This same formula is used to determine which riders would proceed to quarter, semi, and final events if there were more than eight riders present.

Currently the UCI, and Olympics, use the Total Points System. USA BMX allowed the use of both Transfer and Total Points depending on the racing event and track operator&#x27;s discretion. Starting in 2025, USA BMX no longer will use the Transfer System for motos with 8 or less riders; these motos will use Total Points. 

===Local Points Awards and District Ranking===
The racer&#x27;s home state/province may be divided up into several districts depending how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province.

Riders are awarded points depending on their respective finish in the race, which are added to their cumulative totals, and ultimately determining district rankings at the end of the calendar year. The number of points a racer gets after a race is determined by his place in the Main in a Transfer Race, or overall score in a Total Points race. The skill level class also determines how many points are awarded. First place in an Expert class will get 100 points while the first place Intermediate will get 50 points; and the first place Novice gets 25 points. Second, third et al. placers get lower points in proportion.

In all classes and skill levels racers also receive points depending on how many are in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate, all those in that race will get 8 points added to their placing points.

There are separate point scoring for cruiser classes, and separate point tables for state and national rankings.

===National and special event points awards===
To compete on a nationwide level (National or National Age Group), a racer must compete in races called Nationals. Riders compete in their age and skill groups and receive points toward a National ranking and title. The National rankings are amongst all racers regardless of their age or skill competing in Nationals events. The National Age Group rankings are against all the riders in a respective age group regardless of skill competing in Nationals events. Nationals have their own points tables that are accumulated by the racers similarly to local district points. Just like in local races he or she is also awarded participant (rider) points. Professionals are not affected since they have their own points system and table separate from the amateurs.

There is yet another points table for Regional, State, and Provincial race series. Riders compete against their age and skill group only, therefore there could be multiple #1 number plates awarded in a state level race series. Currently the regional race series in the United States is called Gold Cup, and is separated into commonly grouped national regions, i.e. Northwest, Midwest, Southeast, etc.

There is also UCI BMX Racing World Championships (Worlds) which is for amateur BMX&#x27;ers across the globe. Qualifying races are held in multiple countries with the Finals race location in pre-determined country. Each country sends a set number of qualifying riders who then race as their country&#x27;s team. Worlds competition follows UCI amateur classes and race format. UCI BMX Racing World Cup is a separate UCI race series open to professional BMX riders only.

===Open Events===
Another class of racing in BMX which are typically only held at national events are called Opens. Opens are a chance for riders to test themselves and practice against better competition without jeopardizing their point standings. Nationals events are often large and riders may wait hours between motos. Opens allow them more track time. They must be registered to race in a points race to sign up for the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races.

===Professionals===
There are professional rankings in BMX. The Professionals are the only class allowed to compete for cash prizes.

To become a pro, a rider has to be at least 17 years old. A professional BMX&#x27;er with another BMX sanctioning body will be recognized as a Pro by USA BMX. In UCI BMX racing the professional class is called Elite.

Since the 2021 racing season, USA BMX Pro Series races only offer 3 categories of professional racing: Men Pro, Women Pro, and Vet Pro (minimum age of 30).

*The NBA did not have a true National no.1 until 1975 when the first true national was held. Until then No.1s were strictly district. However, since the NBA Southern California District was the largest by far in the country during those years (indeed, only in Arizona did the NBA have any districts outside of California) and John George in 1975 and before him David Clinton in 1974 where the district champions at the end of those seasons that made them National No.1s by default. In the case of David Clinton in 1974 almost no tracks existed outside of California and none of those were NBA sanctioned.
**The NBA did have a separate professional division beginning in 1976, but until 1979 the National No.1 plate was all around for every class pro or amateur.

***The Number One pro title did not exist until 1979.

****NBA Pros were allowed to race in the Amateur class and hold the amateur title at the time, so Greg Hill, while a professional was eligible for and won the no. 1 Amateur title.

*Class Did Not Exist

**Until the 1980 season the #1 plate holder was considered #1 overall amateur or professional. The NBL did have a pro class in 1977, 1978 &amp; 1979 but the title of National Number One Professional was not created until the 1980 season when the pros and the 16 Experts were separated and the pros earning separate points (in the form of purse money won) from the amateurs. Prior to 1980 the pros, due to the comparatively small number of them, competed with the 16 Experts and were able to earn amateur titles.

***Title Did Not Exist The title plate for this class did exist under the title of &quot;B&quot; pro (which was created for the 1981 season), but it was not until 1990 when the name was changed to &quot;Superclass&quot; and it became a pro/am class were the racers of that class given an opportunity to win a separate year end overall National #1 plate title separate from the pure Pro and the pure amateur classes. Amateurs competed for prizes and Pros could compete for a limited amount purses. Also beginning in the 1990 season &quot;Pro Cruiser&quot; was renamed &quot;Super Cruiser&quot; and &quot;A&quot; Pro &quot;All Pro&quot;. In 1996 Super Cruiser was renamed &quot;Pro Cruiser&quot; once again and &quot;All&quot; Pro reverted to &quot;Pro Class&quot; This was to harmonize NBL nomenclature with UCI/IBMXF labels. Because of this the NBL would change the name of its pro Classes many times during the 1990s, They even began calling there senior pro class &quot;AA&quot; and the junior pros &quot;A&quot; just like the ABA beginning in the year 2000. Continuing the name shuffle the senior male pro class was officially known as Elite Men and the junior men &quot;A&quot; pro until the end of the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 season the junior &quot;A&quot; pro class was called &quot;Super X&quot; (SX). The single level pro females are called Elite Women. Beginning with the 2006 season the NBL ceased offering an independent year end title for both the &quot;A&quot; pro class and the Pro Cruisers. In the case of Pro Cruiser it was an end of a long era with the Pro Cruiser No.1 title going back to 1981 when Brent Patterson first won the class. In 2007 the junior pro class was rechristened &quot;Super X&quot; and an independent year end number one plate was reestablished.

****Title Discontinued

†(AM)=Amateur. From 1981 to 1984 the girl&#x27;s National No.1 title was amateur. Between 1985 and 1987 a girl&#x27;s pro class was established but that division was discontinued between 1988 and 1996 due to lack of participants and those National No.1 women titles were again amateurs. From 1997 to the present the title is a professional one once again.
‡(Sup)=Superclass. Superclass was a Pro/Am class.
===American Bicycle Association (ABA)===

Note: Dates reflect the year the racers *won* their plates, not the year they actually *raced* their No.1 plates. In other words, Stu Thomsen won his No.1 title in 1979 entitling him to race with #1 on his plate for the 1980 season. Brent Patterson then won the No.1 plate in 1980 and raced with #1 on his plate during the 1981 racing season.

<text>Rockfish is a common term for several species of fish, referring to their tendency to hide among rocks.

The name rockfish is used for many kinds of fish used for food. This common name belongs to several groups that are not closely related, and can be arbitrary.

Specific examples of fish termed rockfish include: 
*The family Sebastidae, marine fishes that inhabit oceans around the world. They may be included in the family Scorpaenidae.
** &quot;Sebastes&quot;, a commercially important genus of fish in the Sebastidae inhabiting mainly the North Pacific, but with a few species in the North Atlantic and southern oceans
** In Washington State, many species of &quot;Sebastes&quot; and a few of &quot;Sebastolobus&quot; are called rockfish.
* &quot;Acanthoclinus&quot;, a genus of fish from New Zealand
* Bull huss or bull huss (&quot;Scyliorhinus stellaris&quot;), a shark known as rock salmon when used in cuisine
* &quot;Hexagrammos&quot;, a genus of greenling from the North Pacific
* &quot;Hypoplectrodes&quot;, a genus of fish in the family Serranidae
* &quot;Salvelinus&quot;, a genus of fish in the salmon family
* The stonefishes (genus &quot;Synanceia&quot;), venomous fishes from the Indo-Pacific
* Striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), called rockfish on the Atlantic coast of North America from New Jersey south
* Groupers, fish in the subfamily Epinephelinae
* Certain fish of genus &quot;Scorpaena&quot;, such as the Madeira rockfish (&quot;S. maderensis&quot;), a common Mediterranean species
* &quot;Myliobatis goodei&quot;, which is sometimes called &quot;rockfish&quot;

It is owned by POP Media Holdings. Tokyopop&#x27;s parent company&#x27;s offices are in Tokyo, Japan and its sister company&#x27;s office is in Hamburg, Germany.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Tokyopop was founded in 1997 by Stuart J. Levy. In the late 1990s, the company&#x27;s headquarters were in Los Angeles.
Tokyopop published a manga magazine called MixxZine which serialized four classic manga including &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Parasyte&quot;, and &quot;Ice Blade&quot;. Eventually, MixxZine became an Asian pop culture publication entitled Tokyopop Magazine. Additionally, the company published a manga and tech magazine entitled Smile Magazine.

Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn praised Stu Levy for opening up an untapped market for animation with the publication of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and other. Before &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, the belief among entertainment executives was that &quot;girls don&#x27;t watch cartoons.&quot; Due to &quot;Sailor Moon&#x27;s&quot; immense popularity, Tokyopop discontinued the serial from its magazines, and released it separately as its first manga graphic novel. They engineered prominent book distribution via retail stores, standardized book trim size, created a basic industry-wide rating system, and developed the first-ever retail manga displays and introduced the world of graphic novels to an audience of teenage girls. Also, together with Diamond, Tokyopop offered retailers free spinner rack displays for Tokyopop manga, thereby increasing the visibility of the medium in bookstores.

Tokyopop also licensed and distributed Japanese anime. In 1996, Mixx Entertainment acquired the rights to the anime biopic of Japanese poet Kenji Miyazawa, and Stu Levy produced and directed the English version of the anime film, entitled &quot;Spring and Chaos&quot;. The film was directed and scripted by Shōji Kawamori, who created &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; and &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot;. Taste of Cinema ranked &quot;Spring and Chaos&quot; thirteenth in its list of Top &quot;25 Weird Animated Movies That Are Worth Your Time.&quot; From 2000 to 2004, Tokyopop released multiple film and television projects such as &quot;Street Fury&quot;, which Stu Levy created, &quot;GTO&quot; (English version for Showtime TV), &quot;Rave Master&quot; (English version for Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami), and &quot;&quot; (English version for Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim.) Tokyopop also released English version DVDs for: &quot;Initial D&quot;, &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot;, &quot;Saint Tail&quot;, &quot;Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School&quot;, &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;FMW&quot;, &quot;High School Ghostbusters.&quot;

=== &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; ===
In 2002, Tokyopop launched its line of &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot;, which was printed in the original Japanese right-to-left format and included the original Japanese printed sound effects.

In Japan, most published manga is written to read from right to left, but when an English translation was published in the U.S., however, the common practice was to use computer-reversed or mirror images that allowed the books to read from left to right. As a result, this distorted the artwork. Tokyopop&#x27;s decision to use the original right-to-left format allowed the artwork to keep its original form and also enabled Tokyopop to release most graphic novel series on a frequency three-to-six times faster than the industry standard at the time. Tokyopop volumes hit the shelves monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly versus the six months or longer typical of competitors. It also allowed Tokyopop to sell books for an industry-leading price point of $9.99 per book, at a time when most competitors charged $12.99 to $16.99 per book.

Tokyopop was the first U.S. publisher to adopt such a sweeping policy. While some Japanese manga artists had required that the English versions of their manga be published from right to left, Tokyopop was the first American publisher to unilaterally announce that it would maintain the original format for all of its future manga titles.

An &quot;authentic manga&quot; how-to guide was included in each graphic novel to keep readers from accidentally reading the final page first, and the authentic manga also featured special packaging.

=== Rising Stars of Manga ===
Tokyopop launched their Global Manga publishing program in 2003 via the introduction of its &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot; talent competition. The competition called for American manga artists to submit 15–25 page English-language stories of any genre. The top 10 entries, as judged by Tokyopop editors, received cash prizes (between $500 – $2500) and were published in an anthology of the winning works. The grand prize winners were also given the chance to pitch full-length manga projects to Tokyopop for a chance to become professional manga-ka.

Tokyopop launched its first &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot; contest on August 15, 2002, and ended it on December 16, 2002, with more than five hundred American artists submitting their 15–25 page, English-language stories.

The 5th Rising Stars of Manga competition added the People&#x27;s Choice award, where the top-20 finalists had their entire entries judged by the fans on the Tokyopop website. &quot;We are really pleased to open up the Rising Stars judging to the fans,&quot; commented Tokyopop editor Rob Valois. &quot;Since so many people have been vocal on the message boards and at industry conventions, we&#x27;re offering them all a chance to shape the future of manga. I&#x27;m personally excited to see how the fans&#x27; favorite will compare to our own.&quot;

Tokyopop held eight Rising Stars of Manga competitions between 2002 and 2008, as well as one in the UK in 2005.

Several &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot; winners went on to publish full-length graphic novels with Tokyopop, including Josh Elder with &quot;Mail Order Ninja&quot;, M. Alice LeGrow with &quot;Bizenghast&quot;, Mike Schwark and Ron Kaulfersch with &quot;Van Von Hunter,&quot; Lindsay Cibos and Jared Hodges with &quot;Peach Fuzz,&quot; Wes Abbot with &quot;Dogby Walks Alone&quot;, Felipe Smith with &quot;MBQ,&quot; and Nathan Maurer with &quot;Atomic King Daidogan&quot;.

As of July 2022, a new Rising Stars of Manga 25th Year Anniversary edition was announced.

=== Rise of Tokyopop ===
Tokyopop became one of the biggest manga publishers outside Japan, and as such, was attributed with popularizing manga in the United States. By 2004, it boasted the largest market share of manga sales in the U.S., reaching as high as 50% of manga exports to the United States, according to Nissei Weekly.

Tokyopop was also instrumental in the introduction of manhwa to western audiences. Brad Brooks and Tim Pilcher, authors of &quot;The Essential Guide to World Comics. London&quot;, said that Tokyopop &quot;published many Korean artists&#x27; work, possibly without Western fans even realizing the strips don&#x27;t come from Japan. Series like &quot;King of Hell&quot; by Kim Jae-hwan and Ra In-soo, and the Gothic vampire tale &quot;Model&quot; by Lee So-young are both Korean, but could easily be mistaken for manga.&quot; In 2005, Tokyopop began a new, free publication called &quot;Manga&quot; (originally &quot;Takuhai&quot;) to feature their latest releases.

Tokyopop secured newspaper distribution in the form of Sunday comics, featuring its titles Princess Ai, Mail Order Ninja, Peach Fuzz, and Van Von Hunter.

In March 2006, Tokyopop and HarperCollins Publishers announced a co-publishing agreement in which the sale and distribution rights of some Tokyopop manga and books, under this co-publishing license, would be transferred to HarperCollins in mid-June 2006. The agreement enabled Tokyopop to produce original English-language (OEL) manga adaptations of HarperCollins&#x27; books. Meg Cabot&#x27;s books were the first to be adapted into the manga format, along with the &quot;Warriors&quot; series by Erin Hunter. The first line of Tokyopop-HarperCollins OEL manga was released in 2007 with the goal of publishing up to 24 titles each year.

Tokyopop entered a licensing arrangement with Kaplan, a leading provider of educational and training services in 2007, to help students study vocabulary words in preparation for the SATs.

Tokyopop has released several series based on American games, films, and characters, such as &quot;Warcraft&quot;, the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, and Jim Henson films. They released the first volume of a series based on the &quot;&quot; video game in April 2008.

=== CineManga ===
TOKYOPOP pioneered the Cine-Manga format, which took popular animated and live-action series and films and turned them into colored print editions. Titles included popular Nickelodeon cartoon series like Avatar: The Last Airbender and SpongeBob SquarePants. As well as franchises such as Star Wars, Akira, Lizzie McGuire, Card Captor Sakura, Kim Possible, Family Guy, Hannah Montana, amongst many others.

===2008 restructuring===
In June 2008, Tokyopop announced that it was being restructured, with its name being changed to Tokyopop Group, a holding group for several new subsidiaries. The Tokyopop operations in the United States were split into two subsidiaries: Tokyopop, Inc., and Tokyopop Media. Tokyopop, Inc. consisted of the company&#x27;s existing publications business, while Tokyopop Media focused on the company&#x27;s digital and comics-to-film works. Tokyopop Media managed the Tokyopop website, which continued to promote its publications. According to representative Mike Kiley, the divisions would allow the company to &quot;set things up in ways that would very clearly and definitively allow those businesses to focus on what they need to do to succeed. The goals in each company are different and the achievement of those goals is more realistic, more possible if everyone working in each of those companies is very clearly focused.&quot;

During the restructure, Tokyopop laid off 39 positions, equating to 35%–40% of its American workforce. Most of the positions cut were those involved in the direct publication of its books which resulted in a scale back of publication output from Tokyopop, Inc. Tokyopop reported that it would be cutting the volumes released per year by approximately 50%, to an average of 20–22 volumes per month.

Tokyopop&#x27;s Japan division was also to be split, with one unit operating under Tokyopop Media and the other becoming a subsidiary under the overall Tokyopop Group. In response to Tokyopop&#x27;s restructuring, declining sales, and losing 20% of its manga market share, Tokyopop UK cut its publication release schedule from approximately 25 volumes a month to 20.

In December 2008, citing &quot;dramatically low sales&quot; in the publishing industry as a whole, Tokyopop, Inc., laid off eight more employees, including three editors, and noted that the company would have to rearrange some of its upcoming publication schedules.

===Loss of Kodansha licenses===
Licenses from the Japanese manga publisher Kodansha, historically, were a large part of Tokyopop&#x27;s catalog. In the years leading up to 2009, the number of Kodansha titles licensed by Tokyopop decreased. The final new Kodansha title was &quot;Tokko&quot; by Tohru Fujisawa, and the final batch of volumes of Kodansha titles appeared around March 2009. Around that time Kodansha began to consistently give licenses to its manga to competitor Del Rey Manga. Deb Aoki of About.com said &quot;Well, more or less. You get the idea. If you&#x27;re the type who reads the tea leaves of the manga publishing biz, you kinda sensed that things weren&#x27;t quite the same as they used to be.&quot;

On August 31, 2009, Tokyopop announced Kodansha was allowing all of its licensing agreements with both the North American and German divisions of Tokyopop to expire for reasons unknown. Due to this loss in licensing, Tokyopop was forced to leave several Kodansha series unfinished, including the popular &quot;Rave Master&quot;, &quot;Initial D&quot;, &quot;GetBackers&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot; series. It would be unable to reprint any previously published volumes, rendering all Kodansha-owned Tokyopop releases out-of-print.

Several other titles licensed and published by Tokyopop, including best sellers &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, &quot;Chobits&quot;, &quot;Clover&quot;, and &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, were reacquired by Dark Horse Comics, though two other titles Kodansha licensed to Dark Horse had since transferred to Random House by then. &quot;Samurai Deeper Kyo&quot; was relicensed by competitor Del Rey Manga, a division of Random House, which published the remaining volumes of the series.

Tokyopop said that it expected the loss of the licenses to have minimal impact on the company economically due to its diversification of their holdings over the last few years, though they acknowledged the loss would hurt fans of the ongoing series who face uncertainty about the completion of those titles from other companies. ICv2 reported that Tokyopop would continue to publish light novels from Kodansha and that Kodansha appeared to be planning to publish its own titles through its partnership with Random House.

===Resignations and layoffs===

In February 2011, the president and chief operating officer, John Parker, resigned from the company and took the position of vice president of business development for Diamond. This came shortly after Diamond became Tokyopop&#x27;s new distributor, taking the business from HarperCollins. Tokyopop did not name a replacement for Parker. Parker&#x27;s departure left only three remaining executives: the founder and CEO, Stuart Levy; Publisher, Mike Kiley; and Vice President of Inventory, Victor Chin.

On March 1, Tokyopop continued to lay off workers, removing many high-profile employees such as long-time manga editors Lilian Diaz-Przyhyl and Troy Lewter. Tokyopop&#x27;s management also eliminated the position of director of sales operations. In an interview with ICv2, Stuart Levy revealed that the layoffs were due to Borders, Tokyopop&#x27;s largest customer, filing bankruptcy in March 2011, no longer carrying Tokyopop stock, and not paying debts that the company owed to Tokyopop.

===North American publishing shutdown===
On April 15, 2011, Tokyopop announced that it would close its Los Angeles, California–based North American publishing operations on May 31, 2011. According to the release, Tokyopop&#x27;s film and television projects, as well as European publishing operations and global rights sales, would not be closing. The UK branch would cease to operate after May 31 due to their reliance on the importing of the North American branch&#x27;s product. Stuart Levy, Tokyopop&#x27;s founder, released a personal statement reaffirming Tokyopop&#x27;s role in introducing manga to the mainstream North American audience and thanking fans, creators, and employees for their dedication. On May 24, Tokyopop stated that the manga they licensed would revert to their original owners, who may license the titles to other companies.

===New incarnation===

In October 2011, Tokyopop&#x27;s official Twitter account released a message stating that its &quot;ultimate goal is to start publishing manga again.&quot;

On December 10, 2012, Tokyopop&#x27;s website relaunched with a letter from management stating that the company was down to a few select employees who were starting a &#x27;new incarnation&#x27; of the company. Partnered with &#x27;Right Stuf on Demand&#x27;, they began offering ebooks of various titles for which they retained the rights.

Their company blog article stated:

Luckily new technologies that have only very recently become practical are enabling us to re-emerge. Conventional publishing has irrevocably changed, and it is impractical for all but the largest and most established companies to pursue publishing as it has gone on for centuries. But by embracing ebook and print-on-demand technologies, we believe we can move forward and continue to produce some amazing manga as well as bring you Asian Pop Culture in many forms.

A letter from Levy on January 6, 2013, stated:

Digital technology has transformed many industries including publishing. This hit TOKYOPOP very hard since we didn&#x27;t have ebook rights to most of our series (except OEL). Unfortunately our Japanese licensors did not move fast enough to provide a legitimate alternative to piracy, and piracy shows no mercy. As a result, TOKYOPOP had to shut down its LA office and the licenses to Japanese titles expired, reverting to the Japanese licensors.

What that means is TOKYOPOP is evolving as a company. I know many fans would prefer us to return to being a manga publisher like we were for most of our history. However, manga will never disappear – we will do what we can to deliver manga. I plan on experimenting with new ways to bring you Asian pop culture. Please keep an open mind – and give feedback (not just negative when you don&#x27;t like something but also positive when you like something) so we can tweak our approach.

Throughout the publishing closure, Tokyopop Media remained open for business, continuing its efforts to produce film and TV adaptations of Tokyopop&#x27;s manga, as well as reinvigorating the Tokyopop YouTube channel, launching several original web series and adding trailers for Japanese film and TV. In 2013, Tokyopop partnered with MondoMedia to release an animated short film based on the Tokyopop manga &quot;Riding Shotgun&quot;, which was directed by Michael Davis and starred the voices of Yuri Lowenthal and Jessy Schram. The short film garnered over a million views in its first month, and led to an IndieGoGo campaign to finance a full animated series.

In 2015, at Anime Expo and San Diego Comic-Con, Tokyopop announced that it would be relaunching its publishing operations in North America in 2016 and hinted that its first major licensor would be Disney.

In January 2018, Tokyopop announced the release dates for three new properties: &quot;Konohana Kitan&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Hanger&quot;. Additionally, TOKYOPOP initiated &quot;International Woman of Manga&quot; to showcase non-Japanese female manga writers with the publication of five titles: &quot;Ocean of Secrets&quot;, &quot;Goldfisch&quot;, &quot;Kamo&quot;, &quot;Undead Messiah&quot;, and &quot;Sword Princess Amaltea&quot;. Tokyopop&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas: Zero&#x27;s Journey&quot; was nominated for two 2018 Diamond GEM awards in the categories &quot;2018 Best All Ages Series&quot; and &quot;2018 Licensed TP or HC of the Year&quot;.

In 2021, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurants agreed to sell specific Tokyopop Manga by offering Disney&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas adaptation by Jun Asuka in its North American in-store gift shops.

==Divisions and companies==

===Tokyopop GmbH===
Tokyopop&#x27;s European entity is located in Hamburg, Germany and publishes both print and digital titles across a range of content and formats. In 2021, Tokyopop GmbH was one of Germany&#x27;s Top 100 publishing companies. The first manga and manhwa by Tokyopop Germany were published in November 2004, and the first anime in the fall of 2005. In 2006, Tokyopop GmbH entered a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with the Japanese publisher Shueisha, allowing them to publish popular titles such as &quot;Death Note&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot;. The company has also released a number of original German-language manga, including &quot;Gothic Sports&quot;, winner of a 2007 Sondermann award. Tokyopop GmbH continues to operate as a publisher of German-language manga for the international market after the closure of the US publishing office.

In addition to publishing popular manga titles, Tokyopop GmbH also expanded the market by producing new and exciting cross-media content, including licensing popular video game franchises such as &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Zelda&quot; and bestselling novels such as James Patterson and &quot;Warriors&quot;. In 2013, the company launched a prestige project called Manga Library, which adapted classic literary novels into manga.

According to GFK Entertainment, as of 2014 in the core segment of manga, Tokyopop GmbH is currently the second largest provider, with a market share of 27%. Additionally, in the last two years, Tokyopop GmbH had the fastest growth rate out of the big three manga suppliers in the German market, with a growth rate of 29% in 2014. This compares with Egmont Ehapa at 6.5% and Carlsen Verlag at 1.8%.

===Other overseas markets===
In 2004, Tokyopop set up a division in the United Kingdom based in London that mainly imported books from its original American counterpart and distributed them to bookstores in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Tokyopop released an anime collection in both countries in late 2006, including titles such as &quot;Initial D&quot; and &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot;. &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; was released on DVD by MVM Entertainment and the Toonami television channel aired the first half of &quot;Rave Master&quot; in early 2005. It was announced on the official Tokyopop Facebook page that because the British division mainly imported the North American branch&#x27;s translated titles, it would become defunct with the only open branch being the German division.

Tokyopop distributed some of its titles to Australia and New Zealand via Madman Entertainment/Funtastic and in Greece, Tokyopop properties were licensed by Anubis Comics. Tokyopop partnered with IDW International in February 2018 to license its original intellectual property (IP) and manga in overseas markets.

==Imprints==
===Blu Manga===
Blu Manga is an imprint under which Tokyopop published &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; and &quot;yaoi&quot; manga titles. The imprint was launched in 2005. Initially, the company denied that it owned Blu, stating that it was only distributing for another company. The company released no editor names, nor company contact info out of fear there would be backlash and hate mail from &quot;moral crusaders&quot;. In 2006, Tokyopop confirmed Blu was their own imprint. Blu Manga considered that their &quot;non-girly&quot; branding had enabled the imprint, in a genre stereotypically created by women for women, to reach out to a male and gay audience. Early titles published by BLU were &quot;Earthian&quot;, &quot;Love Mode&quot;, and &quot;Shinobu Kokoro&quot;.

=== Love x Love ===
In 2020, Tokyopop introduced a new Inclusive Romance manga lineup, with a focus on providing BL/Yaoi manga, GL/Yuri manga, and male/female romance manga under the same imprint.

==Criticism==
Fans critical of possible mishandling of the &quot;Initial D&quot; property voiced concerns regarding &quot;editorial changes&quot; in the language localization of the manga and anime. The changes included renaming of several characters and the removal of one character&#x27;s involvement in enjo kōsai, a practice in Japan where younger women are paid to provide older men with companionship. In a letter sent to Anime News Network, Tokyopop responded to the criticisms, noting that they felt the edits were necessary because they were marketing the series to a younger target audience than it was originally designed for in Japan. In an interview by Anime News Network, Tokyopop staff stated they also felt that the series would reach a larger audience if it had a broader American appeal.

The company alleviated some of the concerns by noting that the anime series would receive an &quot;unedited, subtitled, Japanese language&quot; DVD release. The manga series remained edited except for the first volume, which was accidentally printed before the editing decisions were made.

== Manga in teen magazine &quot;CosmoGirl&quot; ==
In 2005, Tokyopop partnered with mainstream teen magazine &quot;CosmoGirl&quot; to serialize a manga entitled &quot;The Adventures of CG!&quot;, drawn by Svetlana Chmakova.

== Children&#x27;s books ==
The company published books for younger children including picture books based on Japanese character Stray Sheep.

== Disney manga ==
Tokyopop has licensed several Disney manga titles and series in the US, including &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, &quot;Descendants&quot;, &quot;Kilala Princess&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck Visits Japan&quot;.

<doc id="430735" wikidata="Q5459626" url="?curid=430735" title="Flint–Worcester tornado outbreak sequence">
<text>An extremely devastating and deadly tornado outbreak sequence impacted the Midwestern and Northeastern United States at the beginning of June 1953. It included two tornadoes that caused at least 90 deaths each—an F5 tornado occurring in Flint, Michigan, on June 8 and an F4 tornado in Worcester, Massachusetts, on June 9. These tornadoes are among the deadliest in United States history and were caused by the same storm system that moved eastward across the nation.

The Flint-Worcester Tornadoes were the most infamous storms produced by a larger outbreak of severe weather that began in Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin, before moving across the Great Lakes states, and then into New York and New England. Other F3 and F4 tornadoes struck other locations in Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire and Ohio.

==Meteorological synopsis==

On June 6, a surface low-pressure area formed over Northwestern New Mexico and eventually began to move northeastward into the Great Plains. On June 7, the low-pressure system moved into Southwestern Nebraska with a cold front extending a short distance westward into Northeastern Colorado, a dryline that extended south into Southwestern Texas, and a warm front that extended east-northeastward to near Omaha, Nebraska before turning east-southeastward into Southwestern Indiana. Temperatures across Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa that afternoon in the area were up in the upper 70s to lower 90s Fahrenheit while dewpoints were in the lower 60s to lower 70s. With shear values of 55 knots in the upper atmosphere, the environment became extremely ripe for the development of severe weather and tornadoes throughout the afternoon and evening. A jet streak formed later that night after an upper-level low formed, which allowed the outbreak to go well into the overnight hours.

By June 8, the surface low and upper-level low had moved into Canada. The surface low occluded with the warm front over the Eastern Great Lakes into Ontario and New York and the cold front extending southwestward into Southeastern Iowa. A surface boundary formed, spanning from Eastern Upper Michigan southwestward into Southwestern Illinois. Upper-level wind shear values were even stronger on this day, reaching as high as 65 knots. Temperatures were in the upper 70s to upper 80s Fahrenheit with dewpoints in the mid 60s to mid 70s. This allowed for a line of large and violent tornadic supercells to form across Eastern Lower Michigan into Northwestern Ohio. These storms marched eastward throughout the afternoon before weakening that evening. A sounding taken on June 8 revealed 4500+ CAPE.

On June 9, the cold front from the surface low over Eastern Ontario had moved into New England. A shortwave trough had formed over the region in the upper atmosphere, conjuring up extremely strong wind shear values of 100 knots. At the surface, temperatures were in the upper 70s to mid 80s Fahrenheit with dewpoints in the mid 60s to lower 70s. Numerous supercell thunderstorms formed along the cold front, spawning wind, hail, and tornadoes before weakening and moving offshore that evening.

===Flushing–Northern Flint–Beecher–Columbiaville, Michigan===
This catastrophic, large and violent, multi-vortex F5 tornado was one of the deadliest tornadoes ever recorded in the United States, devastating the Flint, Michigan suburb of Beecher. The tornado first formed at about 8:30 p.m. on June 8 north of Flushing, Michigan. The tornado than moved eastward along Coldwater Road, moving directly through Beecher, Michigan with little to no warning, obliterating almost every structure in its path. Multiple deaths were reported in 20 families, and it was reported that papers from Flint were deposited in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, some east of Flint. Large sections of neighborhoods were completely swept away, with only foundations left. Trees were debarked and vehicles were thrown and mangled and the Beecher High School was heavily damaged. Many patrons at the North Flint Drive-in theater evacuated the drive-in in their vehicles. Some got into vehicle crashes in the ensuing panic to flee while others inadvertently drove into the path of the tornado after leaving the theater. The theater itself received only minor damage. The tornado then moved east-northeastward, causing additional damaged before dissipating near Columbiaville. One hundred and sixteen were killed, making it the tenth deadliest tornado in U.S. history. The death toll was surpassed by the 2011 Joplin tornado. It is also one of only two F5 tornadoes ever to occur in Michigan. Another F5 tornado would hit in Hudsonville on April 3, 1956.
===Worcester, Massachusetts===
The storm system that created the Flint tornado moved eastward over southern Ontario and Lake Erie during the early morning hours of June 9. As radar was still primitive (or nonexistent) in 1953, inadequate severe weather predictions resulted. (Even during the Super Outbreak of April 3, 1974, weather radar was still not up to this task; that outbreak resulted in a technological upgrade.) The Weather Bureau in Buffalo, New York merely predicted thunderstorms and said that &quot;a tornado may occur.&quot; As early as 10:00 a.m. EST, however, the Weather Bureau in Boston anticipated the likelihood of tornadic conditions that afternoon but feared the word &quot;tornado&quot; would strike panic in the public, and refrained from using it. Instead, as a compromise, they issued New England&#x27;s first-ever severe thunderstorm watch.

Rain fell across Worcester County throughout the day on June 9. In New York, a strong cluster of thunderstorms began to build, moving eastward into Massachusetts. At approximately 4:25 p.m., a funnel cloud formed near the Quabbin Reservoir near New Salem. Very soon after, the tornado developed in a forest outside of the rural community of Petersham. The tornado then proceeded to pass through a farm field, where it struck a farmhouse and killed two people. As the storm moved eastward at approximately , it hit the towns of Rutland and Holden, where 11 people were killed in total.(Grazulis, 1993)

At about 5:00 p.m., the tornado moved into the city of Worcester, alarming many residents. According to eyewitness accounts, the storm moved in extremely quickly, shocking the townsfolk. &quot;I saw it grow noticeably darker,&quot; said eyewitness George Carlson, &quot;Then it hit. Houses tumbled, trees fell, and it was all over. The tornado was definitely discernible. Like when you can see the lines of rain in an approaching rainstorm,&quot; he added. The tornado, which had grown to in width, destroyed several structures in Northern Worcester, including parts of Assumption College. Other major structures included a newly built factory and a large residential development. Residential areas were devastated and entire rows of homes were swept away at possible F5 intensity.

At approximately 5:20 p.m., the tornado crossed the far north end of Lake Quinsigamond, and began to move through Shrewsbury. Transmission towers were snapped in half, cutting off power to thousands of people in Shrewsbury and the surrounding towns. Dozens of homes between Maple Avenue and Grafton Street were destroyed, some completely swept away. The funnel maintained its width as it passed throughout much of Shrewsbury, and still dealt a high degree of damage when it moved through downtown Westborough, where it began curving towards the northeast in its final leg. In the storm&#x27;s final moments, three were killed when Fayville Post Office in Southborough collapsed. Around the time it ended, at 5:45 p.m., a tornado warning was issued, although by then it was too late.

The final death toll was 94, the highest number of deaths ever resulting from an F4/EF4 tornado. 1,288 other people were injured.

==1953 tornado season in perspective==
The year 1953 saw some of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history, including the Waco tornado that hit on May 11, the Flint tornado of June 8, and the Worcester tornado on June 9. These 3 storms were also unique in occurring within a 30-day period.
Other severe tornadoes of 1953 hit Warner Robins, Georgia in April, San Angelo, Texas in May (same day as Waco), Port Huron, Michigan later in May, Cleveland in June (same day as Flint and the day before Worcester), and Vicksburg, Mississippi in December.

<text>Clapham South () is a station on London Underground&#x27;s Northern line between and Balham. The station is located at the corner of Balham Hill (A24) and Nightingale Lane, at the southern edge of Clapham Common. It is in both Travelcard Zone 2 and Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==
The station was designed by Charles Holden and was opened on 13 September 1926 as the first station of the Morden extension of the City and South London Railway, which is now part of the Northern line. Other proposed names for the station prior to opening were &quot;Balham North&quot; and &quot;Nightingale Lane&quot;.

The apartments above the station, named Westbury Court, were a later addition, built in the mid-1930s. The parade of shops along Balham Hill was extended as part of the same development using the same style as the original three closest to the station.

The station was refurbished in the 1990s, with new flooring, tiling and CCTV – albeit ensuring that original Charles Holden features were restored or reproduced. The restoration work was awarded a National Railway Heritage Award.

It is one of eight London Underground stations with a deep-level air-raid shelter underneath it. In 1948, the deep shelter was used as temporary accommodation for immigrants from the West Indies. The arrived at Tilbury in 1948 carrying 492 immigrants. London had a severe labour shortage after the war and the Colonial Office had sought to recruit a labour force from Jamaica. An advertisement had appeared in Jamaica&#x27;s &quot;Daily Gleaner&quot; on 13 April 1948 offering transport to the UK. The &quot;Windrush&quot; was quickly filled. As there was no accommodation for all of the new arrivals, the Colonial Office housed many of them temporarily in the deep-level shelter at Clapham South. 

The underground shelter has been available to visit through London Transport Museum&#x27;s Hidden London programme of guided tours since 2016.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses routes 50, 155, 249, 355, G1, 690, as well as by night route N155.

<text>Belsize Park () is a London Underground station in Belsize Park, north-west London. It is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Hampstead and Chalk Farm stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 2. It stands at the northern end of Haverstock Hill. In July 2011 it became a Grade II listed building.

The Royal Free Hospital is located a short distance to the north of the station.

==History==

The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway as an intermediate station on its line from to . It is served by three lifts which descend to the platforms. The platforms can also be reached by stairs; there are 219 steps according to the sign in the station, which is equivalent to a 15 story building.

The station was designed by Leslie Green in &quot;Modern Style&quot; and has his familiar facade of ox-blood faience with five round arched windows. It remained largely untouched until the late 1980s when the lifts were replaced and a new ticketing system installed.

It was previously the site of the Trewint Industrial Home for Girls.

==Deep-level air-raid shelter==

Belsize Park is one of eight London Underground stations which have deep-level air-raid shelters underneath them. The shelter was constructed in World War II to provide safe accommodation for service personnel. Entrances to the shelter are at the junction of Haverstock Hill and Downside Crescent and off Haverstock Hill.
==Connections==
London Buses routes 168 and C11 and night route N5 serve the station.

==In Popular Culture==
The staircase at Belsize Park tube station is the scene of the eponymous homicide in Mavis Doriel Hay&#x27;s 1934 murder mystery novel &quot;Murder Underground&quot;. The station also appears in the Coldplay pop video for the song &quot;Paradise&quot;.

<doc id="430772" wikidata="Q1248930" url="?curid=430772" title="Bishop's Waltham">
<text>Bishop&#x27;s Waltham (or Bishops Waltham) is a medieval market town situated at the source of the River Hamble in Hampshire, England. It has a foot in the South Downs National Park and is located at the midpoint of a long-established route between Winchester and Portsmouth. It is home to the ruins of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Palace, a Scheduled Ancient Monument under English Heritage management, and a well-preserved high street with many listed buildings which now house independent shops.

Bishop&#x27;s Waltham&#x27;s long history includes a roll call of Medieval and Tudor kings and queens who visited the town to stay at the palace. The name of the town is derived from the Anglo-Saxon words: &quot;wald&quot; (forest) and &quot;ham&quot; (settlement).

Modern day Bishop&#x27;s Waltham has a population of over 6,723 and is the largest settlement in the Winchester district outside the city itself. It is home to an infant and junior school.

==History==
The town&#x27;s name comprises three parts &#x27;walt&#x27; – forest; &#x27;ham&#x27; – settlement&#x27;; and &#x27;Bishop&#x27;s&#x27;. It started off as a very early Anglo-Saxon settlement between 450 and 550 AD, and steadily grew to become one of Hampshire&#x27;s largest villages, despite being burnt to the ground by Danes in 1001 AD. By the time of the Domesday book (1086 AD), it had a population of around 600 living in 115 households - at the time, the 11th largest settlement in Hampshire. In 904, King Edward the Elder (King Alfred&#x27;s son) exchanged it with Denewulf, Bishop of Winchester, for the Bishop&#x27;s estate at Portchester. In 1136 Henry de Blois, a later bishop, built a new church and in 1158 started the now-ruined Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Palace. It was destroyed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War. Much of the old Palace is still in the town. Apart from the ruins, which are open to the public, material from the Palace was used as building materials in town buildings still standing to this day.

William of Wykeham died in the town, while after the Battle of Trafalgar, some 200 French officers including Admiral Villeneuve were imprisoned there.

There are many Georgian buildings in the town alongside the Norman parish church. The town retains a unique character, with a number of small local businesses (such as a butchers, bakery and fishmonger) including an off-licence which was established in 1617 (Bakers Wine Merchants). The famous High Street in the town is also home to a number of chain stores (such as Co-op) and a large supermarket chain (Sainsbury&#x27;s), however, the owners of these and other stores have fought to prevent larger chains from threatening their businesses and, they argue, the character of the town. Unusually for the United Kingdom, there is a vineyard nearby.

During the 19th century, Bishop&#x27;s Waltham was a successful market town, being home to several agricultural suppliers, merchants and a cattle market. The town also had a large brickworks to its north, along with a gasworks that provided town gas for lighting and heating the town. The town had a large enough working population by the late 19th century to support a Working Men&#x27;s Institute, which occupied an ornate brick building on Bank Street, which remained open until 2003, when it was converted into housing. Bishop&#x27;s Waltham was home to Gunner and Company, which was the last provincial private bank in the United Kingdom.

The brickworks was a major employer in Bishop&#x27;s Waltham. The works began as the Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Clay Company, founded by Arthur Helps in 1862. The works, sited west of the town centre across the former palace&#x27;s fishponds, was on a highly geologically suitable site: both the major clay types of the Hampshire Basin – the London Clay and Reading Formation beds – were present at different but easily accessible levels. The company started making clay bricks and tiles, and in 1864 began making terracotta architectural and homeware products to try to compete with the established Staffordshire potteries. Arthur Helps invested the works&#x27; minimal profits and much of his own fortune in building new housing for workers (creating the district of Newtown south of the brickworks in the process) and the unsuccessful attempt to build the Bishops Waltham Railway (see below). Economic recession finally caused the collapse of the business in 1867. The defunct works was acquired by the Blanchard family of London, already owners of a terracotta works in Lambeth, and restarted operations in 1871. In 1880 the Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Clay Company was merged with Blanchard &amp; Co., which made Bishop&#x27;s Waltham the centre of its new operation and invested heavily in the works. Blanchard terracotta made at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham became world-famous for its even bright red colour and rare combination of hard, smooth external texture and great strength.

Buildings using Blanchard terracotta include Buckingham Palace and the Natural History Museum, London, plus buildings as far away as Peru and Egypt. Blanchard continued to produce various types of brick and tile at Bishops Waltham as well, which were used extensively on railway construction and other civil engineering projects in the county. Both the Hockley Railway Viaduct and Privett railway tunnel on the Meon Valley Railway – each the longest of their type in Hampshire – used Blanchard bricks. Much of the Victorian housing stock in Newton, Waltham Chase, Swanmore and as far afield as Southampton and Portsmouth is made from bricks fired at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham. In 1918 the Blanchard brothers, lacking heirs to pass the business to, sold the works to the prominent Southampton-based builders&#x27; merchants Elliott Brothers. They continued to run the business throughout the inter-war period but the relatively small scale of the Bishop&#x27;s Waltham works, the lack of room for expansion and the dwindling amount of viable clay deposits on the site caused a decline in fortunes. There was also competition from larger brickworks in the Midlands owned by the London Brick Company, making more bricks each day than the Blanchards works made in a year (1.5 million bricks and 650,000 tiles in 1956) meant that the operation became increasingly unviable. The site received major bomb damage during the Second World War and Elliotts closed the Bishop Waltham works (still widely known as &#x27;Blanchards&#x27;) in 1957. The site is now the Claylands industrial estate and business park – there is still an Elliotts builders&#x27; merchant branch on the former brickworks site.

==Bus services==
There is one main bus stop in Bishop&#x27;s Waltham - The Square. This stop has an average of three services an hour in each direction.
Bishop&#x27;s Waltham has two bus companies that operate from Bishop&#x27;s Waltham square: Stagecoach South and Xelabus.

==Closed railway line==
Bishop&#x27;s Waltham&#x27;s commercial status warranted the construction of the Bishops Waltham branch line railway to the town from Botley in 1862. The railway became part of the London and South Western Railway in the 1870s, who operated distinctive steam railcars on the line for passenger services, although the majority of traffic was goods – with bricks leaving the town and coal for the gasworks coming in. The LSWR laid on special services to allow farmers to bring their cattle to market at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham, with trains made up of a mix of cattle trucks and passenger carriages. The line was closed to regular passenger traffic in 1932, but goods services remained, becoming ever less frequent and regular before finally stopping in the 1960s. Bishop&#x27;s Waltham station was a distinctive brick/half-timbered design with numerous architectural details produced in terracotta by the local brickworks, which stood where the main roundabout in the town – now known as the &quot;Old Station Roundabout&quot; – at the junction of the B2177 and the B3035 towards Corhampton now is. A short section of the line and a pair of level crossing gates next to the roundabout have been preserved.

==Culture and attractions==
Bishop&#x27;s Waltham is twinned with Saint-Bonnet-le-Château in France. The Palace grounds are frequently used to hold festivals and other events. The town has a small museum.

The Bishop&#x27;s Waltham Youth Theatre is run by local theatre directors associated with the Theatre Royal, Winchester.

==The Moors==

The Moors, Bishop&#x27;s Waltham is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is a nationally significant tract of alkaline wetland and open waters located south of the Chalk outcrop in southern Hampshire at the head of River Hamble displaying a good diversity of habitat types, plant and animal communities and rare species. As a result, not only is the majority of the site designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) under the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act, but also as a Nature Conservation Review (NCR) site, in recognition of its special national interest.

The land comprises some mainly of hydrologically sensitive fen, fen meadow and wet woodland dissected by a series of south and west flowing streams and drains totalling some in length. Some of the drains originate from one-time watercress beds fed by clear chalk water springs and feed into either the Western Stream arising off the &#x27;Sand Boils&#x27; or the Eastern Stream arising off Alexanders Moors. Both streams flow into Waltham Mill Pond and from where the water passes to The Moors Stream, a headwater of the River Hamble. The &#x27;Sand Boils&#x27; is an area at the head of the West Stream in which upwelling spring water creates swirling sandy patches in the gravelly streambed.

The Moors comprises the wetland area fed by springs and surface watercourses within the SSSI and adjacent land and which discharge into the Waltham Mill Pond. Water from the mill pond passes through Chase Mill and then downstream as The Moors Stream tributary to join the Northbrook Stream tributary of the River Hamble.

Dundridge Meadows is a Local Nature Reserve near Bishop&#x27;s Waltham.

==River Hamble==
The country town and parish of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham lies in the Hamble Valley at the junction of chalk downs and coastal plains which gives rise to the tributary of the River Hamble at Northbrook on the northern edge of the town. The river then flows south, through the North and South Ponds, and then out towards Botley, where the Moors Stream tributary joins the Northbrook Stream tributary on the southern edge of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham. The river then flows through Curdridge to the head of the tidal estuary at Fairthorne.

==The Waltham Blacks==

The Waltham Blacks were a group of deer poachers operating and terrorising local people, and were famous, not only for deer stealing, but also for having an Act of Parliament the Black Act 1723 passed to stop them. The Act, passed in 1723, made it a felony to &quot;appear armed, disguised or with a blackened face, being so designed to kill deer, rob a warren or to steal fish&quot;.

It was the last provincial private bank in the United Kingdom, from 1921 until it was bought out by Barclays Bank in 1953. The Gunner family continued to run the legal practice of Gunner &amp; Carpenter until 1973.

<doc id="430776" wikidata="Q657484" url="?curid=430776" title="Black Ruthenia">
<text>Black Ruthenia (), or Black Rus&#x27;(; ; ), is a historical region on the Upper Neman, including Novogrudok, Grodno and Slonim. Besides these, other important parts of Black Rus&#x27; are Vawkavysk and Białystok. The region was inhabited by the Baltic Yotvingians from ancient times and the name &quot;Black Russia&quot; appeared relatively late.

On the 1712 map of French cartographer Henri Chatelain &quot;Russie noire&quot; (Black Ruthenia) is placed in region of Eastern Galicia (today Western Ukraine), which is traditionally known as &quot;Russie rouge&quot; (Red Ruthenia).

==History==
The convention of distinguishing different Ruthenian regions by colours was first done by Medieval Western and Central European historians from the 14th to 17th centuries. It was first done circa 1360 by , referring to the Black and Red Ruthenia (placing them in modern Ukraine). Some researchers claim that this color naming convention was influenced by the Mongol invaders, who used them for the cardinal directions.

Sometimes in the 16th century, the names Black, White and Red Ruthenia were given respectively to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Lithuanian-owned Ruthenian lands that were given to Poland during the Union of Lublin.

According to Bancks&#x27; book from 1813, Black Russia was composed of the Governorates of Kaluga, Moscow, Tula, Ryazan, Vladimir and Yaroslav.

According to Alfred Nicolas Rambaud in the late 19th century:The Lithuanian territories of Grodno, Novogrodek and Belostok were sometimes called &quot;Black Russia&quot;.
On some Polish maps &quot;Black Ruthenia&quot; (Rus Czarna) covered areas of modern Belarus, which were labeled &quot;White Rutihenia&quot; on other maps.

<doc id="430779" wikidata="Q2166873" url="?curid=430779" title="Royal National Lifeboat Institution">
<text>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is the largest of the lifeboat services operating around the coasts of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man, as well as on some inland waterways.

Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, it soon afterwards became the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck because of the patronage of King George IV. Royal patronage has continued up to the present day with King Charles III. The organisation changed its name to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution on 5 October 1854 and was granted a royal charter in 1860.

The RNLI is a charity based in Poole, Dorset. It is principally funded by legacies (65%) and donations (30%). Most of its lifeboat crews are unpaid volunteers. They operate more than 400 lifeboats from 238 stations. Paid lifeguards provide services at nearly 250 beaches. The RNLI also provides free safety advice to many different groups of people, and has been involved in international cooperation since 1924.

==History==
Shipwrecks on the coast of the Isle of Man in 1822 inspired local resident and philanthropist William Hillary to &quot;appeal to the British nation&quot; to establish &quot;a national institution for the preservation of life and property from shipwreck&quot;. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty, however George Hibbert, a merchant, and Thomas Wilson, a Member of Parliament, helped to bring support from some influential people including King George IV and other royalty, leading politicians and merchants. A public meeting was convened at the London Tavern on 4 March 1824, chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A resolution was passed to form the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck. King George IV gave approval for the word &quot;Royal&quot; to be added to the title on 20 March 1824, thus becoming the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck.
The institution&#x27;s committee set itself three objectives:
#To award medals and/or cash to those involved in rescuing people from shipwrecks.

#To provide lifeboats to as many places on the coast as possible.

A committee was formed to examine different types of lifeboats. An &#x27;unimmergible&#x27; based on a 1785 patent by Lionel Lukin continued to be built but was heavy and expensive. A lighter boat designed by George Palmer became the standard design until the 1850s.

In 1824, the year it was founded, the RNIPLS raised £9,706 but the funds soon dwindled. By 1835 annual income was down to just £806 and during the 1840s no appeals were made to the public for new funds.

===Financial improvement===
By 1850, annual income had dropped to £354, but a new committee then started to turn around the Institution and appointed Richard Lewis as Secretary. Over the next 33 years he travelled around the country and used his skills to increase the funds:by 1859 annual receipts had climbed to over £10,000 and by 1882 they reached £43,117.

Other changes saw 4th Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s appointed the president in 1851 while well-meaning dukes and archbishops on the committee were replaced by experienced naval officers who brought more rigour to its operations. Captain John Ross Ward was appointed Inspector of Lifeboats and was responsible for the design and introduction of cork lifejackets for lifeboat volunteers.
The Duke of Northumberland instigated a competition to design a &quot;pulling and sailing&quot; lifeboat that could use both oars and sails so they operated further from their stations. 280 entries were received and the self-righter by James Beeching considered the best but James Peake, a master shipwright at the Royal Woolwich Dockyard, was asked by the RNLI to develop the design further in 1851. Peake-designed lifeboats and improved versions were the preferred choice for both new and replacement boats at most stations until the 1890s and beyond.

The lifeboats operated by other local committees under the Duke of Northumberland were transferred to the RNIPLS and in 1854 an arrangement was made with the Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners&#x27; Benevolent Society (SFMBS). The RNIPLS would concentrate on saving lives while the SFMBS would look after people who were rescued and brought ashore. This saw the RNIPLS drop the word &#x27;shipwreck&#x27; from its name, and the SFMBS transfer its lifeboats to what would now be known as the RNLI. The RNLI was still underfunded so accepted an annual government subsidy of £2,000, but this resulted in the Board of Trade having say in the RNLI&#x27;s operations. By 1869, they no longer needed to rely on the government subsidy so terminated the agreement.

Although the lifeboats were built by commercial boatbuilders, the RNLI had a need to supply stores and replace worn out or damaged equipment. This included reserve lifeboats and carriages. A depot for this was established at Poplar, London in 1882.

The loss of 27 lifeboat crew from Southport and St Annes in 1886 inspired local committee member Charles Macara to campaign for more funds to support the families of volunteers who were killed during rescues. As a result, in the summer of 1891 over £10,000 was raised through newspaper campaigns in Yorkshire. He then went on to organise the first &#x27;Lifeboat Day&#x27;. This was held in Manchester on 1 October 1891. Two lifeboats were paraded through the streets as volunteers collected money from the public. The boats were then launched on a lake in a park to give demonstrations. More than £5,000 was raised on the day.

=== Mechanisation and two world wars ===

Six steam-powered lifeboats were built between 1890 and 1901. A number of lifeboat stations used commercial steam tugs to tow lifeboats to where they were needed, but the only tug owned by the RNLI was the &quot;Helen Peele&quot; which operated at from 1901 to 1929. Petrol-engined lifeboats saw wider use. Initial examples were converted from &#x27;pulling and sailing&#x27; lifeboats but purpose-built motor lifeboats started to appear from 1908. Production was severely restricted during the First World War.

During the First World War, lifeboat crews launched 1,808 times, rescuing 5,332 people. With many younger men on active service, the average age of a lifeboatman was over 50. Many launches were to ships that had been torpedoed or struck mines, including naval or merchant vessels on war duty; a notable example was the hospital ship which foundered in 1914 and was attended by six lifeboats, saving 144 lives over a 50-hour rescue mission.

The creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 resulted in the RNLI operating in two countries, however the new Irish government was glad to see the lifeboat service continue as it was.

The first International Lifeboat Conference was held in London in 1924 on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the RNLI. Eight other countries sent delegations and it resulted in the establishment of the International Lifeboat Federation later that year. This is now known as the International Maritime Rescue Federation and has member organisations (including the RNLI) from more than 50 countries.

Construction of motor lifeboats, first petrol-engined but later with specialised diesel engines, resumed after the war. The switch to diesel power was because these used less fuel and could cover much larger distances. The Second World War again brought restrictions, but by now the fleet was largely motorised. In 1918 there had been 233 &#x27;pulling and sailing&#x27; lifeboats and 23 steam or petrol. In 1939, there were just 15 unpowered lifeboats, and the greater range of the motor lifeboats meant that only 145 were needed.

The RNLI&#x27;s depot was moved from Poplar to Borehamwood in July 1939, a few months before the outbreak of the Second World War. The headquarters staff were also moved from London to Borehamwood during the war.

The war placed considerable extra demands on the RNLI, particularly in south and east England where the threat of invasion and enemy activity was ever-present, rescuing downed aircrew a frequent occurrence, and the constant danger of mines. During the war, 6,376 lives were saved.

Nineteen RNLI lifeboats sailed to Dunkirk between 27 May and 4 June 1940 to assist with the Dunkirk evacuation. Lifeboats from , (RNLB &quot;Prudential&quot; (ON 697)), and , (), went directly to France with their own crews, Ramsgate&#x27;s crew collecting 2,800 troops. Both coxswains, Edward Parker from Margate and Howard Primrose Knight from Ramsgate were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their &quot;gallantry and determination when ferrying troops from the beaches&quot;. Of the other lifeboats and crews summoned to Dover by the Admiralty, the first arrivals questioned the details of the service, in particular the impracticality of running heavy lifeboats on to the beach, loading them with soldiers, then floating them off. The dispute resulted in the first three crews being sent home. Subsequent lifeboats arriving were commandeered without discussion, much to the disappointment of many lifeboatmen. A later RNLI investigation resulted in the dismissal of two Hythe crew members, who were nevertheless vindicated in one aspect of their criticism, as Hythe&#x27;s &quot;Viscountess Wakefield&quot; was run on to the beach at La Panne and unable to be refloated; she was the only lifeboat to be lost in the operation. Some RNLI crew members stayed in Dover for the emergency to provide repair and refuelling facilities, and after the end of the evacuation most lifeboats returned to their stations with varying levels of damage and continued their lifesaving services.

=== Developments after the war ===

The diesel engines used in lifeboats continued to be developed after the war. A standard Gardner engine was found to work well in the marine environment and became the RNLI&#x27;s standard from 1954. Using a commercial engine made maintenance and obtaining spare parts much easier than with the specialised engines used previously.

Faster lifeboats were developed from the 1960s by adopting new hull shapes. The first was the based on an American design, but the RNLI developed the concept with the in the 1970s. Faster craft allowed the location of stations to be reviewed with the aim of being able to reach 95% of casualties within 30minutes of launch. This meant than some stations could be closed as there were others nearby, but it also showed some gaps in coverage which required new stations to be opened.

For more than 100 years, most lifeboat launches had been to commercial vessels that were in distress. Improved engines and safety equipment, along with a reduction in coastal traffic, saw a reduction in these demands, however more leisure users were taking to the water. These people generally had less experience of the sea and were close to shore. The RNLI considered the use of small inflatable rescue boats. One was purchased for trials and the work of the lifesaving society in Brittany was studied. The first of these lifeboats was deployed in 1963 and by 1969, there were 108 in service which had been launched 1,210 times and saved 541 lives. Larger inshore lifeboats were developed with the entering service in 1970.

The headquarters and depot were both moved to Poole in 1974. A new Lifeboat Support Centre and College were opened on the adjacent site 2004.

=== New services for a new century ===

The RNLI made a study of its operations during the 1990s and concluded that little more could be done to save people after accidents at sea, but there was scope to reduce the number of accidents happening. This entailed establishing some new services that do not directly involve traditional lifeboats stationed around the coast. A &#x27;Sea Safety&#x27; campaign produces various short guides with advice and safety information for different types of user such as divers, sailors and users of personal water craft. &#x27;Sea Check&#x27; volunteers also provide inspections and advice for leisure boat owners.

Attention was also paid to people on beaches. The RNLI started to provide lifeguards on certain beaches in May 2001. By the end of the decade, the service was provided at 100 beaches and more than 10,000 people were being given aid each year. 2001 also saw the first lifeboat stations established on inland waters. Enniskillen Lifeboat Station on Lough Erne was opened in May 2001 and several stations were established on the River Thames in 2002.

The RNLI received attention in 2021 for its actions during the European migrant crisis as the lifeboats were increasingly called upon to rescue migrants attempting to cross the English Channel in small boats. The British government praised its &#x27;vital work&#x27; but politician Nigel Farage criticised the organisation as being a &#x27;taxi service&#x27; for human trafficking gangs. There was a 3,000% rise in daily donations and a 270% increase in people viewing its website&#x27;s volunteering opportunities page after the RNLI&#x27;s chief executive disclosed the verbal abuse received by its volunteers from members of the public due to its rescuing of migrants.

In 2023, the RNLI released details regarding rescues in the English Channel. As has been the case for 200 years, the RNLI will go to the aid of anyone in difficulty at sea, without judgement or preference. In 2022, the RNLI launched 290 times, with every launch of the lifeboat being at the request of H.M. Coastguard. This figure represented just 3% of the 9,312 call-outs nationally in 2022. These 290 calls resulted in saving the lives of 108 people. The RNLI definition of a life saved, is one where the person would have died if not for an intervention by the RNLI or other third party/emergency service.

==Rescues, losses and medals==
===Rescues and lives saved===

The RNLI was formed in 1824 and in that year 124 lives were saved. By 1829 more than 1,000 people had been saved and by the end of the century the total had risen to 41,820. Between 1900 and 1999 there were 91,952 saved, the greatest number in a single year being 1,837 in 1973. Fewer people have need to be saved in recent years; in 2022 269 lives were saved and another 10,734 people aided.

The biggest rescue in the RNLI&#x27;s history was on 17 March 1907, when the 12,000 tonne liner SS &quot;Suevic&quot; hit the Maenheere Reef near Lizard Point in Cornwall. In a strong gale and dense fog, RNLI lifeboat volunteers rescued 456 passengers, including 70 babies. Crews from , , and rowed out repeatedly for 16 hours to rescue all of the people on board. Six silver RNLI medals were later awarded, two to &quot;Suevic&quot; crew members.

While the RNLI exists to &#x27;save lives at sea&#x27;, it does not salvage ships and cargoes. It will tow a boat to safety when that is appropriate but does not charge a salvage fee, however it does encourage voluntary contributions to their funds. This stance was demonstrated at in 2009, when the RNLI was criticised for not launching a lifeboat in order to aid an uncrewed fishing vessel that had run aground. A spokesperson for the RNLI declared that &quot;We are not a salvage firm and our charity&#x27;s aim is to provide immediate assistance for people in trouble at sea and lives are at risk.&quot; There have been a few isolated cases where individual lifeboat crew members have claimed salvage. There is no legal reason why crew members of the RNLI could not salvage a vessel, since they frequently tow small vessels to safety, often over long distances.

===Lifeboat and crew losses===

One of William Hillary&#x27;s concerns in setting up the NIPLS in 1824 was that people were putting their lives in danger to rescue people from shipwrecks. Since then, more than 600 people have died in the service of the RNLI.

A memorial was unveiled outside the RNLI&#x27;s Poole headquarters in 2009. It was designed by Sam Holland and bears William Hillary&#x27;s motto: &quot;with courage, nothing is impossible&quot;. The names of all those who have lost their lives are inscribed around it. There is also an RNLI memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas.

=== Medals ===
The RNLI awards gold, silver and bronze medals to its crews for bravery. The &#x27;Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum&#x27; may also be awarded for significant contributions. In the 180 years to 2004 some 150 gold, 1,563 silver and 791 bronze medals had been presented. Significant activities may also be recognised by a &#x27;Framed letter of thanks&#x27; from the Chairman or a &#x27;Letter of appreciation&#x27; from the Chief Executive or Operations Director.

The &quot;Ralph Glister Award&quot; was inaugurated in 1968 for the most meritorious inshore rescue boat service each year. The &quot;Walter Groombridge Award&quot; was established in 1986 in memory of Brighton Lifeboat Station&#x27;s Administration Officer has been renamed the &quot;Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award&quot; in memory of his wife who died in 1989.

The most decorated lifeboatman was Henry Blogg GC BEM, coxswain of for 37 years, with three gold medals and four silver. He was also awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal in 1924, converted to a George Cross in 1941, and the British Empire Medal, and is known as &quot;The Greatest of all Lifeboatmen&quot;. Some other lifeboat crew who have received multiple medals include:

*William Henry Tregidgo received silver medals in 1853, 1858 and 1860 for rescues at , Boscastle and .
*Robert Hook, coxswain at from 1853 to 1883, was awarded a silver medal in 1859, and again in 1873.
*Daniel Shea, coxswain at , was awarded a silver medal for two services in 1859, another in 1860 and a third in 1866.
*Henry Freeman, the coxswain for 22 years, was awarded silver medals in 1861 and 1880.
*Patrick Power, coxswain at , was awarded the bronze medal four times, in 1941, 1951, 1961 and 1964.
*Richard Evans BEM of was awarded a bronze medal in 1943 and two gold medals in 1959 and 1966, both for rescues in hurricanes.
*Daniel Kirkpatrick BEM, coxswain of the lifeboat, was given silver medals for rescues in 1959, 1964 and 1968. This meant that he was the only person at that time with three silver medals. He would be one of 8 crew lost in the Longhope lifeboat disaster, when the lifeboat capsized in a storm on 17 March 1969.
*Coxswain Brian Bevan MBE of the lifeboat is the only crew member to be awarded with bronze, silver and gold medals for gallantry, and have them presented at the same awards ceremony. This was for three medal services carried out over just a 7-week period between December 1978 and February 1979.
*Coxswain Hewitt Clark MBE of the lifeboat was awarded the bronze medal on three occasions, 1983, 1989 and 1993, followed by a silver medal in 1995, all aboard the lifeboat 52-10 &quot;Soldian&quot; (ON 1057). This would be followed by a gold medal for the service to the &quot;Green Lily&quot; in 1997.

One lifeboat has received an award: for the Daunt lightship rescue in 1936 the RNLB &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; and her entire crew were decorated.
In 2022, Helmsman Lee Duncan became the first crew member of an lifeboat to be awarded the RNLI silver medal for the rescue of a surfer in extreme weather conditions. His three other crew members, Dafydd Griffiths, Leigh McCann and Michael Doran, were each awarded the RNLI bronze medal.

==Organisation==

The RNLI was granted a Royal Charter of incorporation 1860 which has been revised several times since then. It is governed by a Trustee Board which receives advice and assistance from a Council and specialist committees. Day-to-day operations are managed by an Executive Team of 8 senior managers led by a chief executive.

The RNLI is split into six administrative regions:

The RNLI&#x27;s headquarters are in Poole, Dorset, adjacent to Holes Bay in Poole Harbour. The site includes the Lifeboat Support Centre and Lifeboat College (the RNLI&#x27;s training centre). The support centre and college were opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. The college includes a survival pool and lifeboat simulators. Crews are trained here to operate their lifeboat in many situations including capsizes and working with helicopters. RNLI Ireland has a headquarters at Airside in Swords, County Dublin.

The institution has enjoyed royal patronage since its foundation. The patrons have been King George IV (1824–1830), King William IV (1830–1837), Queen Victoria (1837–1901), King Edward VII (1901–1910), King George V (1910–1936), Queen Mary (1911–1953), Queen Alexandra (1913–1925), King Edward VIII (1936), King George VI (1937–1952), Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (1937–2002), and Queen Elizabeth II (1952–2022) and, since 14 May 2024, King Charles III.

==Operations==
The RNLI provides lifeboat services around the coasts and on certain inland waterways throughout the United Kingdom, Ireland and offshore islands. In 2023 this involved operations from 238 lifeboat stations with a fleet of 432 rescue craft that launched 9,192 times. There are also 242 lifeguard units who aided 19,979 people. These services are provided by nearly 10,000 lifeboat volunteers and about 2,500 paid staff including lifeguards.

===Lifeboat stations===
The RNLI operated 238 RNLI lifeboat stations in 2023 around the coasts of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Stations will be equipped with all-weather lifeboats and/or inshore lifeboats to suit their local needs. Launch methods vary too, generally having larger boats moored afloat or launched on a slipway while smaller boats are often put in the water on trolleys propelled by tractors.

Tower Lifeboat Station on the River Thames in London is the RNLI&#x27;s busiest; in 2013 crews rescued 372 people and saved 25 lives.

Many other stations have been operated by the RNLI but have since closed as demands changed. Some of these locations now have an independent lifeboat service.

===Lifeboats and other rescue craft===

The RNLI operated 432 lifeboats and other rescue craft in 2023, although the number changes from time-to-time as older boats are retired and new ones provided, and the needs of the lifeboat stations change. The names of lifeboats are prefixed &#x27;RNLB&#x27; (for Royal National Lifeboat). All display an Operation Number so that they can be easily identified; all-weather lifeboats are also allocated a sequential Official Number (ON) which is used in RNLI records.

There are two broad types of lifeboat:
*All-weather lifeboats (ALBs) are large boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and can go out in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are five classes of ALBs with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. They are classed as , , , and .
*Inshore lifeboats (ILBs) are inflatable and rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RIBs) that operate closer to the shore and in shallower waters than ALBs. The smaller ones are known as D-class and the larger as B-class. Special boats work on the River Thames. All are built and maintained at the RNLI&#x27;s Inshore Lifeboat Centre at Cowes, Isle of Wight.
Other craft include hovercraft, small inflatable rescue boats, personal water craft and boarding boats
===Personnel and equipment===

97% of lifeboat crews are volunteers. There were more than 5,700 in 2022 and they are supported by more than 4,000 volunteer shore crew and station management. The lifeguard service is mostly seasonal paid staff but there were 98 volunteer lifeguards in 2023.

In the early days of the service, lifeboat launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women crewing the boats – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. Lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92 per cent in 2013, falling to 90 per cent in 2022) but increasing numbers of women are now found in the lifeboat and shore crews.

The first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt at in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman member of an all-weather lifeboat crew at in 1981. Aileen Pritchard at Porthcawl was the first female lifeboat crew member to receive a medal for bravery. Lauren McGuire at became the youngest station manager in 2011. In 2017, Di Bush at Harwich Lifeboat Station became the RNLI&#x27;s first female full-time mechanic and four years later she was appointed as the first female full-time coxswain. launched an all-female crew in 2011, believed to be a first in Wales. In 2022, Cullercoats RNLI station launched its first all-female lifeboat crew. Figures published in 2022 show lifeguards comprise 29 per cent women, and the RNLI total workforce to be 34 per cent women.

Lifeboat crews are trained at their stations and at the Lifeboat College in Poole. They are provided with safety clothing. The first cork lifejackets were introduced in the 1850s but lighter, less bulky, kapok lifejackets were introduced in 1904. Inflatable &#x27;Beaufort&#x27; lifejackets were introduced in 1972 but &#x27;Crewsaver&#x27; lifejackets are now used with different designs for inshore or all-weather lifeboat crews.

===Water safety===

Volunteers (1,000 in 2023) provide water safety advice and training to various water users, ranging from schools to commercial boat users.

The RNLI offers safety advice in person and in publications to boat and beach users when the opportunity arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The RNLI runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly those in at-risk communities. It extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas.

===International work===
The RNLI was asked to help transport aid following Floods in Bangladesh during 1970. 20 craft and 57 crew were air lifted to the country. Similar operations happened in Bangladesh again in 1988, in Mozambique in 2000 and Guyana in 2005.

RNLI lifeboats that have been replaced by more modern boats are often sold to other countries including Iceland, Uruguay, Chile and China. Training and education support is also provided to many countries including Bangladesh and Tanzania.

==Finances==

The RNLI is a registered charity that &#x27;saves lives at sea&#x27;. Its income in 2022 was £231.1million:

Its charitable expenditure in 2023 was £191.2million. It also spent £43.9million (19% of its income) on fundraising.

Much of the funding comes from legacies, trusts and institutional donors. One of the biggest is the Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund (known simply as &#x27;The Lifeboat Fund&#x27;). This was established in 1886 for civil servants to collectively support the RNLI and has provided 53 lifeboats.

Volunteers operate shops in many towns and take part in street collections and open days. Many forms of collection boxes have been placed in lifeboat stations but are sometimes targeted by thieves. A typical cast iron collection box in Porthgwarra, Cornwall, is Grade II listed as is an unusual fish-shaped one in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

==Heritage and museums==
The RNLI Heritage Collection Trust 2012 is responsible for the organisation&#x27;s historic objects and archives. It runs a number of museums:

*RNLI Historic Lifeboat Collection, Chatham Historic Dockyard 
*Grace Darling Museum, Bamburgh 
*Henry Blogg Museum, Cromer
*Eastbourne Lifeboat Museum, Eastbourne
*Moelfre Sea Watch Centre, Moelfre, Anglesey
*Poole Old Lifeboat Museum, Poole
*Salcombe Lifeboat Museum, Salcombe
*Whitby Lifeboat Museum, Whitby

Other independent lifeboat museums can be found, many of which will have RNLI memorabilia:
*East Durham Heritage and Lifeboat Centre, Seaham
*Harwich Lifeboat Museum, Harwich
*Longhope Lifeboat Museum, Longhope, Orkney
*Sheringham Museum at The Mo.
*Zetland Lifeboat Museum and Redcar Heritage Centre, Redcar (the world&#x27;s oldest intact lifeboat)

The RNLI 200th anniversary and Isle of Man’s maritime heritage exhibition &#x27;All at Sea&#x27; is at House of Manannan, Peel, Isle of Man, from 17 February 2024 to 26 January 2025. It is supported by the RNLI Heritage Collection Trust 2012.

The &#x27;Women of the RNLI&#x27; exhibition to celebrate the RNLI 200th anniversary is at The National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, from 2 March 2024 to 1 December 2024. It features the work of photographer Jack Lowe, who uses the Victorian Collodion wet plate process to create the images.

Many old lifeboats have been preserved by enthusiasts. They often appear at events including historic lifeboat gatherings at Fowey which have been held most years since 2002. The Lifeboat Enthusiast&#x27;s Society was established in 1964 and supports the work of the RNLI Heritage Collection Trust and all aspects of lifeboat study including collecting ephemera and modelling.

==Media and image==
Newspapers often include reports about lifeboats, their rescues and losses. Since the 1890s they have also played their part in fund raising.

The first appearance of an RNLI lifeboat on television was in 1947 when the pulling and sailing lifeboat was filmed as it was about to be replaced by a motor lifeboat. Since then many programmes have been made about lifeboats and their crews. Some were featured on &quot;This is Your Life&quot; and viewers of Blue Peter have raised funds to buy many lifeboats.

The Mumbles Lifeboat Station took centre stage in the BBC drama series &quot;Ennal&#x27;s Point&quot; in 1982 which starred Philip Madoc as a lifeboat coxswain. The series was based on a book by Alun Richards who wanted to show lifeboat crews as &quot;ordinary men who became extraordinary because of their very nature of their task, saving life in any weather&quot;.

Documentary series have been made about the lifeboat stations at in 1984 and Salcombe in 1993. The long-running BBC series, &quot;Saving Lives at Sea&quot; first aired in 2016.

On 2 August 2024, a song commemorating the 200th anniversary of the service titled &quot;Brave Volunteers&quot; was released by Seth Lakeman and Fisherman&#x27;s Friends.

===&quot;Life-Boat&quot; journal===
The RNLI published the first issue of &quot;The Life-Boat&quot; in March 1852. It was sold for 1½ for &quot;laying before the public all the information respecting the construction and establishment of Life-Boats, the number of Shipwrecks, the exertions made to save Life and Property, and the prizes and medals awarded to those who have been most active in that noble service&quot;. It was sub-titled &quot;Journal of the National Shipwreck Institution&quot; but from Volume 2 in 1855 this was changed to reflect the organisations new name which was adopted the previous year to be the &quot;Journal of the National Life-Boat Institution&quot;. The last issue under this name was volume 31, no. 341 in April 1940; &quot;Life-boat War Bulletins&quot; were published from No. 1 in September 1940; from 1945 to December 1946 simply entitled &quot;Life-boat Bulletin&quot;. From volume 32, no. 342 (June 1947), the journal has been called &quot;The Life-boat&quot;, more recently &quot;The Lifeboat&quot; and then &quot;Lifeboat&quot;.

===RNLI flag===

The first design of the RNLI flag was created by Leonora Preston in 1884 after her brother was rescued by Ramsgate lifeboat volunteers. The design depicts Saint George&#x27;s Cross bordered by a dark blue line and within the white cantons, initials of the charity name coloured red. The first design included the Tudor crown worn by George VI at the centre of the cross with a foul anchor below it, representing the charity&#x27;s dedication to the royal charter and to the sea. The design was formally adopted in 1908 and was flown at every lifeboat station thereafter.

The design of the flag has changed twice to reflect changing royal patronage. In 1953, following Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation, the design was altered to exchange the Tudor crown with St Edward&#x27;s crown to represent the newly appointed monarch. Following the accession of Charles III, the design re-adopted the Tudor crown.

In 1964 the RNLI had a red ensign approved, which is flown from lifeboats.

<text>The Mosquito Coast is a 1986 American drama film directed by Peter Weir and starring Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Andre Gregory, and River Phoenix. It is based on the 1981 novel by Paul Theroux. The film tells the story of a family that leaves the United States and tries to find a happier and simpler life in the jungles of Central America. However, their jungle paradise quickly turns into a dystopia as their stubborn father&#x27;s behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive. It was shot in the cities of Cartersville and Rome in Georgia, in addition to Baltimore, Maryland and Belize.

==Plot==
Allie Fox is a brilliant but stubborn inventor who has grown fed up with the American Dream and consumerism. Furthermore, he believes that a nuclear war is on the horizon as a result of American greed and crime. After Allie and his eldest son Charlie acquire the components at a local dump, he finishes assembling his latest creation, an ice machine known as Fat Boy. Mr. Polski, an asparagus farm owner, has hired Allie to create a cooling system for his barn to keep his crop from spoiling. He complains that Allie has not delivered the cooling system and his asparagus is rotting. Allie, Charlie, and Allie&#x27;s youngest son, Jerry, meet Mr. Polski, and Allie shows him &quot;Fat Boy.&quot; The machine leaves Polski unimpressed. As he drives past the fields, a dejected Allie comments on immigrants picking asparagus, and says that where they come from, they might think of ice as a luxury.

The next morning, Allie throws a party for the immigrant workers before telling his family that they&#x27;re leaving the United States. On board a Panamanian barge, the family meets Reverend Spellgood, a missionary, his wife, and their daughter, Emily. Allie and the Reverend clash due to their opposing religious views. When the barge docks in Belize City, the families disembark and go their separate ways. From a drunken German, Allie purchases a small village called Jeronimo in the rainforest along the river.

Mr. Haddy takes Allie and his family upriver to Jeronimo. Allie meets the inhabitants and proceeds to build a new, &quot;advanced&quot; civilization, inventing many new things in the process. The locals, including Mr. Haddy, a boatman who takes the Fox family to Jeronimo, take kindly to Allie and his family. However, Allie&#x27;s will to build a utopian civilization keeps them working to their limits. Reverend Spellgood arrives to convert Jeronimo&#x27;s citizens. In the process, Allie and Spellgood angrily denounce each other, leading to a permanent schism: Allie believes Spellgood to be a religious zealot; Spellgood believes Allie to be a communist. Allie sets to construct a huge version of &quot;Fat Boy&quot; that can supply the town with ice. Upon completing the machine, Allie hears rumors of a native tribe in the mountains that has never seen ice. Allie recruits his two sons to carry a load of ice into the jungle to supply the tribe. Upon arriving, Allie finds that the load has melted and that the tribe has already been visited by missionaries.

When Allie returns to Jeronimo, he learns that Spellgood has left with much of the populace, scaring them with stories of God&#x27;s biblical destruction. The near-empty town is visited by three rebels, who demand to use Jeronimo as a base. Allie and his family agree to accommodate them while Allie concocts a plan to be rid of them. Set on freezing them to death, Allie bunks the rebels up in the giant ice machine, tells Charlie to lock its only other exit, and activates it. The rebels, waking in panic, try to shoot their way out. To Allie&#x27;s horror, the rebels&#x27; gunfire sets off an explosion within the machine. By the next morning, both the machine and the family&#x27;s home is in ruins, and chemicals from the destroyed machine have severely polluted the river.

Forced downstream, Allie and his family arrive at the coast. Mother and the children rejoice, believing they can return to the United States. Allie, refusing to believe his dream has been shattered, announces that they have all they need on the beach and tells them that the United States has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Settling on the beach in a houseboat he has built, and refusing assistance from Mr. Haddy, Allie believes that the family has accomplished building a utopia. One night, the storm surge from a tropical cyclone nearly forces the family out to sea until Charlie reveals that he has been hiding motor components (secretly given to him by Mr. Haddy), allowing them to start the motor on the boat.

Forced to travel upstream once again, Charlie and Jerry grow resentful of their father. Coming ashore when the family stumbles across Spellgood&#x27;s compound, Allie sees barbed wire and mutters that the settlement is a Christian concentration camp. While the rest of the family sleeps, Charlie and Jerry sneak over to the Spellgood home. They find out that the United States was not destroyed and that Emily will assist them in escaping from Allie. Before Charlie can persuade Mother and his sisters to leave, Allie sets Spellgood&#x27;s church on fire. Spellgood shoots Allie, paralyzing him from the neck down. The family escapes aboard the boat.

The family begins traveling downriver again, with Allie drifting in and out of consciousness. Allie asks his wife if they are going upstream. She lies to him for the first time. Charlie&#x27;s narration reports the death of Allie but gives hope that the rest of the family can live their lives freely from now on.

==Production==
Producer Jerome Hellman bought the rights to Theroux&#x27;s novel as soon as it was published, and Weir committed to filming it. Jack Nicholson was originally offered the lead role, but backed out over salary disputes.

As the film went into pre-production, and Weir was in Central America scouting for locations, the financial backing for the film fell through and the project was suspended indefinitely. In the meantime, Weir was approached to direct &quot;Witness&quot; starring Harrison Ford. The film, which was Weir&#x27;s first American production, was a critical and commercial success, garnering eight Academy Award nominations including Weir for Best Director, Ford for Best Actor, and the film itself for Best Film. During the production of &quot;Witness&quot;, Weir discussed &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; with Ford who became interested in the role of Allie Fox (though Ford&#x27;s agent was less enthusiastic). With Ford attached to the project, financial backing and distribution for the film was easier to find (ultimately from Saul Zaentz and Warner Bros.).

Filming began the week of February 7, 1986, in Belize and finished there on April 26 before moving to Georgia. Weir and Ford famously missed the Academy Awards ceremony for which they had both been nominated for &quot;Witness&quot;, which won two Oscars, for Best Screenplay and Best Film Editing.

The film contains the last feature film role of Butterfly McQueen, who had a prominent role in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. She plays a lapsed churchgoer, and in real life was a vocal atheist.

==Reception==
The film was initially a critical and commercial disappointment but has since received much stronger modern reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Harrison Ford capably tackles a tough, unlikable role, producing a fascinating and strange character study.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade B− on an A+ to F scale.

Siskel &amp; Ebert were split, Siskel giving the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot; and Ebert giving it a &quot;thumbs down,&quot; criticizing Allie Fox for being &quot;boring.&quot; However, he did compliment Ford&#x27;s performance. Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;utterly flat.&quot; In her review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote: Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;He&#x27;s orchestrated &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;&#x27;s action to match Fox&#x27;s progressive mental state, from rage to explosion to squalls and finally to hurricane velocity; however, the film leaves us not with an apotheosis, but exhaustion.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott wrote, &quot;&quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; is a work of consummate craftsmanship and it&#x27;s spectacularly acted, down to the smallest roles ... but its field of vision is as narrow and eventually as claustrophobic as Allie&#x27;s.&quot; The negative reviews the film received prompted Harrison Ford to defend the film in the media: 

With a production budget of $25 million, the film made a little over $14 million in North America. Despite being one of his least commercially successful films, Ford has defended it, saying in a 1992 interview:
Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan viewed this film at Camp David on November 22, 1986.

<text>The Athens Metro () is a rapid transit system serving the Athens urban area in Greece. Line 1 opened as a single-track conventional steam railway in 1869 and was electrified in 1904. Beginning in 1991, Elliniko Metro S.A. constructed and extended Lines 2 and 3.
It has significantly changed Athens by providing a much-needed solution to the city&#x27;s traffic and air pollution problem, as well as revitalising many of the areas it serves.
Extensions of existing lines are under development or tender, like the Line 2 extension to Ilion where tender started in 2023, as well as a new Line 4, whose central section began construction in October 2021.
The Athens Metro is actively connected with the other means of public transport, such as buses, trolleys, the Athens Tram and the Athens Suburban Railway. The Athens Metro is hailed for its modernity (mainly the newer lines 2, 3), and many of its stations feature works of art, exhibitions and displays of the archaeological remains found during its construction. Photography and video-taking is permitted across the whole network and street photographers often work in Athens Metro. This was the only metro system in Greece, before the Thessaloniki Metro began operations on 30 November 2024.

==History==

===Piraeus–Kifissia Railway (Line 1)===
Until 28 January 2000, Line 1 was the only rapid-transit line in Athens. The Athens and Piraeus Railway Company (SAP) opened a steam single-track mixed cargo and passenger railway line on 27 February 1869 and was run between and . It was electrified in 1904. On 4 February 1885 Lavrion Square-Strofyli steam narrow gauge single-track mixed cargo and passenger railway line opened and was run at the time from Attiki Square to Kifissia through Iraklio. These originally mixed cargo and passenger railway lines gradually merged and converted to a rapid-transit system. The section between Kifissia and Strofyli was abandoned.

From 1869 to 1926 the line was operated by SAP. From 1926 to 1976 the line was operated by Hellenic Electric Railways (EIS). In 1976 the EIS was nationalized and renamed Athens-Piraeus Electric Railway Company (ISAP), which continued to operate what became line 1 of the Athens Metro until 16 June 2011.

===1990s projects===
Since the current Line 1 opened, the government has proposed many expansions to the subway network, including a 1963 plan for a fourteen-line subway network. Construction of Lines 2 and 3 began in November 1992 to decrease traffic congestion and improve Athens&#x27; air quality by reducing its smog level. Both lines were constructed underground. Lines 2 and 3, built by Attiko Metro S.A. and operated until 2011 by Attiko Metro Operations Company, are known respectively as the red and blue lines and were inaugurated in January 2000. Line 3 was extended to the Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport in summer 2004, and Line 2 was extended to Anthoupoli and Elliniko in 2013.

===Consolidation===
Until 17 June 2011, the operational management of the Athens Metro network was similar to that of the London Underground network before the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board and the absorption of the Metropolitan Railway on 1 July 1933. The Greek government attempted to absorb ISAP into Attiko Metro operation company under Law 2669/1998 so the latter would be responsible for the whole network, but this initiative failed. Athens Metro operations were consolidated when the Greek government enacted Law 3920/2011, replacing AMEL, ISAP and Tram S.A. with Urban Rail Transport S.A. (STASY S.A.) (), a subsidiary of OASA S.A. (Athens Urban Transport Organisation S.A.).

===Timeline===
==Infrastructure==

===Lines and stations===

The Athens Metro consists of three lines totalling and 66 stations: Line 1 (Green) is long with 24 stations, Line 2 (Red) is long with 20 stations, and Line 3 (Blue) is long with 24 stations. STASY owns and operates 62 of the 66 stations: three other stations (, and ) belong to GAIAOSE and the station belongs to the operator of the Athens International Airport.

The system has five interchanges, at , , , and , allowing all three to interchange with each other at least once. Each line also has at least one connection with the Athens Suburban Railway, and the Athens Tram.

Line 2 is entirely underground. Line 1 is mostly overground, with an underground section spanning between the Monastiraki and Attiki stations, and an additional underground station (Kato Patisia) in central Athens. Line 3 is mostly underground; Trains that run an overground route are only those with the airport as final destination. The overground section of Line 3, east of the tunnel portal near , is open. In the tunnel sections up and down lines share a common tunnel, except for approaches to stations with an island platform (such as Egaleo). Train maintenance facilities are located at Attiki, Faliro, Irini, Piraeus, Kifissia and Thissio for Line 1, and Doukissis Plakentias, Eleonas and Sepolia for Lines 2 and 3.

The Athens Metro&#x27;s three lines carried approximately 1,353,000 passengers daily in 2010.

A network map of the Athens Metro system, that includes the three current lines, the under construction line 4, the tramway, the suburban railway and all the future under design extensions.

== Rolling stock ==

The network uses standard gauge electric trains which in most places run on 750 V DC third rail, but the section of Line 3 running to the airport requires trains which can use overhead lines of 25 kV AC, 50 Hz.

The Athens Metro classifies rolling stock by &quot;batch&quot; for Line 1 and &quot;generation&quot; for Lines 2 and 3 because ISAP and AMEL used different classification systems for rolling stock before consolidation. Six types of rolling stock operate on the network, all equipped with third rail current collection systems; however, only seven second-generation trains have the necessary overhead line equipment to serve Line 3 from to .

The eighth batch (introduced in 1983) is the oldest rolling stock in passenger service, while the third generation (introduced in 2013) is the latest rolling stock in passenger service. The eighth- and tenth-batch stock is externally similar, but the former has split-flap headsigns in Johnston typeface and a cream-and-green interior colour scheme. An extensive refurbishment programme is in progress for the 8th batch (as of 2023), and to cover for trains undergoing refurbishment, up to five 1st generation Line 2/3 trains have been borrowed to operate on Line 1.
Line 1 halfsets have driving cabs at both ends, unlike the Line 2/3 halfsets which have a driving cab at the outer ends, but only basic driving apparatus for shunting purposes only at the inner ends; thus, they can only operate on their own inside depots.

=== Line 1 ===
=== Lines 2 &amp; 3 ===
===Signalling===

Line 1 uses two-aspect red/green home signals, yellow/green distant signals and a passenger information system (PIS). The current system replaced 1950s-era semaphore signals. The automatic train protection (ATP) system of Line 1 was fully installed in 2023 which replaced the previous Indusi system.

Lines 2 and 3 use the Alstom automatic train supervision system (ATS) and a passenger information system (PIS). Two-aspect red/white colour signals are used at points and junctions only.

==Fares==
Fares are prepaid, either as short term tickets valid for 90 minutes, 24 hours, three days, five days, or as long term tickets. As of September 2020, there are two types of fare products, the ATH.ENA Ticket and ATH.ENA Card, both of which are validated using a contactless system (by scanning the ticket or card at the electronic validating machines). The tickets are valid on all modes of public transport in Athens except on trains and buses to the airport. Passengers cannot buy a fare on board the bus. To travel to or from the airport, passengers may buy a one-way ticket for €9 or a 3-day ticket for €20 which also includes unlimited local trips and a return trip to the airport. Arrival at the airport without having paid the appropriate fare will incur a €72 fine, reduced to €36 if paid within 10 days. Term tickets are available in 30, 90, 180, and 365 day periods and are available only with a personalized ATH.ENA Card. Reduced fares are available for university students, seniors, disabled and persons under 18. During a fare control the passengers that are entitled to a reduced fare have to show ID card, student card or passport. Children under the age of 6 are entitled to travel for free with all means of transportation. On buses and trams the ticket or card must be validated only when entering the vehicle/car by scanning the ticket at the electronic validating machines. At metro or Suburban Railway stations, the ticket or card must be validated at the electronic gates when entering and exiting the station.
== Archaeological excavations and exhibits ==

During construction of the metro tunnels, artifacts of archaeological interest were discovered and rescue archaeology was employed. Teams of archaeologists worked ahead of, then with, engineers for six years, protecting and recording archaeological finds (streets, houses, cemeteries, sanctuaries, public workshops, foundry pits, kilns, aqueducts, wells, cisterns, drains and sewage tunnels). This afforded new insight into the city&#x27;s ancient topography, through unprecedented infrastructure development combined with the study and preservation of archaeological data. Exhibitions of ancient artifacts or replicas are found at a number of metro stations, including Monastiraki, Akropoli and Syntagma.

==Future==
The Athens Metro masterplan, as presented in October 2022, consists of the following projects:

*The current Kifissia terminal will be demolished and rebuilt as an underground station.

**The Development Plan refers it as Line 4 branch but there are unofficial plans that this branch is part of the future Line 5.

If and when these projects are completed, the Athens Metro is expected to reach in length and serve a total of 110 stations by 2040.

===Line 4===

A fourth line is planned for the Athens Metro and it has been incorporated in the roadmap for the development and expansion of public transport in Athens since 2005. The new line in its totality will extend over a length of , adding thirty five (35) new stations to the Athens Metro system. The cost of the entire project is estimated at 3.3 billion EUR. The recommendation is for lighter rolling stock than the type used in existing lines of Athens Metro which would operate automatically without a driver. In November 2020, Alstom was chosen to supply the line with 20 4-car automated Metropolis trains, operated under Urbalis 400 signalling system.

The first phase of Line 4 will be between &quot;Alsos Veikou&quot; and &quot;Goudi&quot; stations, predicting fifteen (15) new stations and a length of of new track. An invitation to tender for the construction of the first phase of Line 4 was issued in September 2018. The construction started in mid to late-2021 and is scheduled to be completed in 2029 or 2030. The estimated cost for constructing the first phase of the new line is 1.51 billion EUR. Currently, the project of the first phase is considered to follow a PPP scheme which might be extended for constructing the whole new line. An alternative solution is a mixed funding between the EIB and the Greek State. It is also a high-profile candidate project to be included in the Juncker Plan of EU that will include also the second phase of Line 4 of Athens Metro.

The European Investment Bank is allocating a €730 million loan over 30 years to finance the building of the first segment of the Line 4 metro, which will connect Alsos Veikou and Goudi. The initiative will also assist Athens by reducing the number of private automobiles on the road by 53 000, resulting in 318 tonnes fewer CO2 released daily.

===Long-term plan===

==== Extensions ====

==== Line 1 ====
Since 2020 the northern extension has been decided to consist of an underground part (including a new underground Kifissia station) and the initial extension until Nea Erythrea, with the stations between Agios Stefanos and Nea Erythrea utilising the Suburban railways of OSE, with a further extension towards Varympompi Junction.

When the topographical survey was done it was decided that for the Southern Extension there would be an underground diversion from the station of Thiseio branching out to 3,5km consisting of 4 stations: Ano Petralona, Plateia Davaki, Lofos Filaretou ending at Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center near Delta Falirou.
==== Line 2 ====
The northern extension may consist initially of a 4.0 km (2.5 mi) line (Anthoupoli to Agios Nikolaos) in 2031, with intermediate stations at Palatiani and Ilion (for Line 4). With a second phase (Aghios Nikolaos - Acharnai) , with intermediate stations at Kamatero and Zefyri (for Athens Suburban Railway trains).

The southern extension may consist of a line from to Glyfada, with intermediate stations at Ano Glyfada and Grigoriou Lampraki.
==== &quot;Souflias Plan&quot; ====
On 15 November 2008, Greek newspaper &quot;Ta Nea&quot; reported that the Greek government was considering a circular line from Ano Ilisia to Faros, via and , as part of a &quot;&quot; network. This proposal evolved to form part of what is now the long-term Athens Metro Future Regulatory Plan (or the Souflias plan) on 13 April 2009, which called for an network of eight lines and 200 stations.

The Souflias plan was last revised in January 2012, and saw limited activity until October 2020, when Elliniko Metro announced that they were reconsidering some extensions from the plan, including the extension of Line 1 from to Nea Erythraia, the extensions of Line 2 to and Glyfada and Line 6 from Melissia to Perama. In December 2021, a part of the southern branch of Line 6 was reconsidered as a branch of Line 1 from to the SNFCC in Kallithea, with intermediate stations at Hamosternas, Plateia Davaki, and Lofos Filaretou.

==== Line 5 (Haidari - Kalamaki) ====
Originally considered by the Souflias plan as line 7, but since the consideration of new branches for line 4 it has been reappeared and been renamed to line 5 and its part from Akadimia to Evangelismos being considered as an part of Line 4 with the lines spliting in Evangelismos, the line 4 part continuing until Goudi and the Line 5 one until Kalamaki.

<text>George Douglas Howard Cole (25 September 1889 – 14 January 1959) was an English political theorist, economist, historian, and novelist. As a believer in common ownership of the means of production, he theorised guild socialism (production organised through worker guilds). He belonged to the Fabian Society and was an advocate for the co-operative movement.

==Early life==
Cole was born in Cambridge to George Cole, a jeweller who later became a surveyor; and his wife Jessie Knowles.

Cole was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he achieved a First in Classical Moderations in 1910 and a First in Literae Humaniores (&#x27;Greats&#x27;, a combination of Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1912.

== First World War and early career ==

In the autumn of 1912 Cole accepted a post as lecturer in philosophy at Armstrong College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Conditions were far from ideal, since Cole&#x27;s students were mainly students studying technical subjects who attended his lectures merely because they were compulsory. In the same year, however, he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, which ran for seven years; he had an annual income of several hundred pounds and no obligation to teach. He could research and write.

Cole, personally a pacifist, took a pragmatic approach to the 1914-18 war. In 1915, however, he became an unpaid research officer at the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He advised the union on how to respond to wartime legislation including the Munitions of War Act 1915. This role enabled him to escape conscription on the grounds that he was conducting work of national importance.

Cole&#x27;s involvement in the campaign against conscription introduced him to a co-worker, Margaret Postgate, whom he married in 1918.

Having secured exemption from military service, Cole was practically active first with his union work and with journalism in defence of workers&#x27; rights; he also found time to develop a political theory of guild socialism. which had first engaged his attention during his undergraduate years.

Cole&#x27;s Prize Fellowship ended in 1919. He needed employment. He moved to London. His first job, provided by Arthur Henderson, was as part-time secretary to the Advisory Committees which had been established by the Labour Party in 1918 to create a clear and comprehensive political programme, a programme for a full-fledged political party and not a pressure group. The work was congenial and satisfactory but the requirements of the job proved too much for Cole&#x27;s part-time commitment.

He then secured a job with the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; as its Labour Correspondent. He did not stay with the paper for long. His wife commented:

== Professional life ==
Cole authored several economic and historical works including biographies of William Cobbett and Robert Owen.

In 1925, he became reader in economics at University College, Oxford.

In 1929, he was appointed to the National Economic Advisory Council when it was set up by the second Labour government. In 1944, Cole became the first Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at Oxford. He was succeeded in the chair by Isaiah Berlin in 1957.

Cole&#x27;s pacifism of 1914-18 was abandoned by 1940 when he said: &quot;Hitler cured me of pacifism&quot;. During the 1930s, Cole sought to construct a British popular front against fascism. He identified the extent of the military threat before many of his colleagues had abandoned their pacifism. Cole lent strong support to the republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.

He was listed in Nazi Germany&#x27;s Black Book of prominent subjects to be arrested in the case of a successful invasion of Britain.

In 1941, Cole was appointed sub-warden of Nuffield College, Oxford. He was central to the establishment of the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey which collected a large amount of demographic, economic and social data. This information was used to advocate for an extensive programme of social reform.

== Socialism ==
Cole became interested in Fabianism while studying at Balliol College, Oxford. He joined the Fabian Society&#x27;s executive under the sponsorship of Sidney Webb. Cole became a principal proponent of guild socialist ideas, a libertarian socialist alternative to Marxian political economy. These ideas he put forward in &quot;The New Age&quot; before and during the First World War and also in the pages of &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, the weekly founded by the Beatrice Webb and George Bernard Shaw.

Cole said his interest in socialism was kindled by his reading &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;, the utopian novel by William Morris, writing:
Neither a Marxist nor a social democrat, Cole envisioned a guild socialism of decentralised association and active, participatory democracy, whose basic units would be sited at the workplace and in the community rather than in any central apparatus of the state. Cole criticized both state socialism and syndicalism as leaving open the possibility of tyranny, and envisioned a form of socialism where all enterprises would be democratically run by the workers through trade unions with the state remaining to guarantee consumers&#x27; rights and civil liberties. Cole&#x27;s ideas were influential in intellectual circles but were generally dismissed by Labour Party leaders such as Ramsay MacDonald.

In the 1920s, Hugh Gaitskell, a student of Cole, became active supporter of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike. Cole also was a powerful influence on the life of the young Harold Wilson, whom he taught, worked with and convinced to join the Labour Party.

Cole formed the Society for Socialist Inquiry and Propaganda to advance his views, which combined with former members of the Independent Labour Party defecting to the mainstream Labour Party after its disaffiliation to form the Socialist League in 1932. In 1936, Cole began calling for a popular front movement in Britain in which the Labour Party would ally with other political parties against appeasement and the threat of fascism.
Cole wrote at least seven books for the Left Book Club, all of which were published by Victor Gollancz Ltd. They are marked with LBC in the list of his books given below. He and his wife, Margaret Cole, together wrote 29 popular detective stories, featuring the investigators Superintendent Wilson, Everard Blatchington and Dr. Tancred. Cole and his wife created a partnership but not a marriage. Cole took little interest in sex and he regarded women as a distraction for men. Margaret documented this comprehensively in a biography she wrote of her husband after his death.

Although Cole admired the Soviet Union for creating a socialist economy, he rejected its dictatorial government as a model for socialist societies elsewhere. In a 1939 lecture, Cole stated:

In his book &quot;Europe, Russia and the Future&quot; published in 1941, Cole claimed that however immoral the new Nazi-dominated Europe was in some ways it was better than the &quot;impracticable&quot; system of sovereign states that had preceded it. In economic terms, it could be said that &quot;it would be better to let Hitler conquer all Europe short of the Soviet Union, and thereafter exploit it ruthlessly in the Nazi interest, than to go back to the pre-war order of independent Nation States with frontiers drawn so as to cut right across the natural units of production and exchange&quot;. Cole also stated:

==Co-operative studies==
Cole was also a theorist of the co-operative movement and made a number of contributions to the fields of co-operative studies, co-operative economics and the history of the co-operative movement. In particular, his book &quot;The British Co-operative Movement in a Socialist Society&quot; examined the economic status of the English CWS (the predecessor of the modern Co-operative Group), evaluated its possibility of achieving a Co-operative Commonwealth without state assistance and hypothesised what the role the co-operative might have in a socialist state.

A second book, titled &quot;A Century of Co-operation&quot;, examined the history of the movement from the very first co-operatives to the contribution of the Chartists and Robert Owen, through to the Rochdale Pioneers as well as the movement&#x27;s development (in Great Britain) over the following century.

Cole contributed to &quot;An Outline of Modern Knowledge&quot;, ed. William Rose (Victor Gollancz, 1931) along with other leading authorities of the time, including Roger Fry, C. G. Seligman, Maurice Dobb and F. J. C. Hearnshaw.

== Personal life ==

In August 1918, Cole married Margaret Isabel Postgate (1893–1980). Margaret was the daughter of the classical scholar John Percival Postgate.

The couple had one son and two daughters in a marriage that lasted forty-one years. However, the marriage does not seem to have been especially happy. Cole expressed little interest in actual romantic attachment and even less in sexual relations. Friends observed that emotional attachments tended to be with men rather than women. Cole was very fond of some of his male students. They included the future leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell. There is no evidence of any homosexual encounters either before or during his marriage.

Cole and his wife jointly wrote a number of books and articles, including twenty-nine detective stories.

Cole could not accept the idea of a &quot;determinate human superior&quot;. His wife recalled that &quot;he... never gave orders except in a purely routine and non-significant sense&quot;. His dislike of all forms of hierarchy and hatred of ritual led to atheism at an early age, though he never engaged in anti-religious polemics. While no luddite, he greatly admired everything produced by William Morris including his affection for the Cotswolds. Though he enjoyed classical music, he regarded the radio as making a horrible noise Almost allergic to higher mathematics (he did not understand Algebra) he distrusted science, as he believed it was being used to quantify things that were best left to interpretation.

In literature and poetry he enjoyed (after Morris) Defoe, Swift, William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, Henry James, William Cobbett, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Butler, but he found Edmund Burke and Thomas Carlyle pretentious. He disliked the &quot;imperialism&quot; of Shakespeare and hated D. H. Lawrence.

He was admired by his students, but Gaitskell said he was much too sensitive, self-critical and sardonic to play the part of the master at all willingly.

In the spring of 1929 the Coles returned to London, living in West Hampstead for six years until buying a &quot;rambling Victorian&quot; house called &quot;Freeland&quot; in Hendon where he lived for most of the last three decades of his life. In early 1957 he and his wife moved to a flat in Holland Park, Kensington. He died after going into a diabetic coma in the early hours of 14 January 1959 in hospital in Hampstead. In lieu of religious rites his brother-in-law, Raymond Postgate, read two passages from the works of William Morris at his funeral in Golders Green Crematorium. His estate was offered for probate at £46,617 (equivalent to £1,097,364 in 2020).

<text>The Chanur novels are a series of five science fiction novels, forming three separate stories, written by American author C. J. Cherryh and published by DAW Books between 1981 and 1992. The first novel in the series is &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; (1981), which was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1983. &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;, originally a stand-alone story, was followed by the Chanur&#x27;s Venture trilogy (also referred to as &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Revenge&quot;), &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Venture&quot; (1984), which was shortlisted for a Locus Award in 1985; &quot;The Kif Strike Back&quot; (1985) and &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Homecoming&quot; (1986). These were followed by a later sequel, &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Legacy&quot; (1992). The five novels were also published in two omnibus editions: the first three in &quot;The Chanur Saga&quot; in 2000 and the next two in &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Endgame&quot; in 2007.

An abridged version of &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; was published in the &quot;Science Fiction Digest&quot; in 1983.

==The Compact==
The series is set in the same Alliance-Union universe of &quot;Downbelow Station&quot;, but in a region of space in the opposite direction from Earth as the Alliance and Union. It is occupied by a number of spacefaring civilizations bound by a set of trade treaties into a so-called &quot;Compact&quot;. The Compact is not a political organization, and has no government; it deals only with open trade, leaving the component civilizations to resolve conflicts between themselves.

Human space borders kif and knnn territory, the most aggressive and enigmatic species of the Compact respectively. First contact ensues when an ambitious kif &quot;hakkikt&quot; (prince) captures a human exploration ship. The last surviving crew member, Tully, escapes while the kif ship is docked at a station and winds up on &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;, a hani merchant vessel commanded by Pyanfar Chanur. This triggers the events of the first novel in the series and its three-part sequel.

==Species of the Compact==

===Oxygen-breathers===

====Hani====
Homeworld: Anuurn

&quot;Hani&quot; are a feline-like species, maned, bearded, usually of red or tawny fur. Females are smaller than humans, males much larger (for much the same reason as Earth lions). They were discovered by the mahendo&#x27;sat and helped into space; most of their technology is therefore derived from mahen.

They live in autonomous clans, each consisting of related females, children, and a single male, the clan lord. A male takes over a clan by defeating the previous lord in personal combat. Most males are not that lucky. Male offspring are thrown out of their clan when they become strong enough to pose a threat to the lord. They live in exile among others like themselves, honing their fighting skills and waiting for the opportunity to challenge for a clan. For this reason and because males are stereotyped as being emotionally unstable, only females go into space (until Pyanfar Chanur changes the rules). Females do all the work on clan lands and in space ventures, although Cherryh does describe some able and intelligent males who become involved in the world around them.

Clans are united into amphictionies for control of scarce resources; the biggest one is their homeworld itself, governed by a mahen-inspired council of clans called the &quot;han&quot;. Hani politics are tradition-bound, based on such concepts as allegiance, honor, blood feud and parole.

One of the hani languages became the basis for the Compact&#x27;s pidgin, because it was grammatically and phonetically easy for other species (but not as easy for humans).

====Mahendo&#x27;sat====
Homeworld: Iji

&quot;Mahendo&#x27;sat&quot; (singular &quot;mahe&quot;) are black or brown primate-like creatures, human-size or larger. They are very curious, innovative and politically oriented. The Mahendo&#x27;sat political system is based on the concept of &quot;Personage&quot;, a charismatic figure with a lot of social credit; a Personage&#x27;s power is determined by the number of its followers, but a supporter can either weaken or strengthen its Personage, depending on whether its actions in its Personage&#x27;s name prove to be beneficial or not. To an outsider, this can (and frequently does) look like a Personage&#x27;s mahen agents are promoting mutually contradictory policies at the same time. Mahendo&#x27;sat are idiosyncratically bad at learning other species&#x27; languages—many of them can not even master the pidgin used by Compact spacers—although they are quite eloquent in their own numerous languages. Mahendo&#x27;sat are the &quot;glue&quot; of the Compact, always trying to maintain the balance of power so peace can be kept and no species dominates. They are in constant search of new powers, recently including humans.
Homeworld: Llyene

 are slight, slender, fragile, crested bird-like white herbivores (even their eyes are pearly white), xenophobic and non-aggressive. They permit no other oxygen-breathing species in their territory and keep the location of their home world a secret. rely on wealth, trade, and alliances to maintain their position within the Compact. They hire other species for protection and maintaining order on their space stations, usually the mahendo&#x27;sat. They prefer delicate pleasures and pastel colors, their speech is exceedingly ceremonial and politically correct; their identities are prone to change (&quot;Phase&quot;) under great stress, which has many legal implications. They have three genders, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;, which can change with Phasing. Only the (indeterminate sex) deal with other species. There is a fourth state, &#x27;, in which the individual is addressed as a &quot;holiness&quot;. This is a sexless state usually achieved by an aged, honorable . A who is in the process of Phasing from one state to another is &quot;.

====Kif====
Homeworld: Akkht.

 are bare-skinned, wrinkled, ash-grey, long-snouted rat-like bipedal carnivores. They are the tallest species in the Compact, slender, fast and deadly. They are strictly predators, unable to eat anything but live prey; they have two sets of teeth (outer for biting and inner for pulping—their throats are unfit for swallowing solid food) and retractable claws.

Their social and political revolves about a personal quality called &#x27;, which combines face, authority, and ferociousness. &#x27; is gained through victory in combat, or possession of something of value, or just the respect of others: followers with their own strong &#x27; strengthen the &#x27; of their leader. A that loses &quot; is likely to have its followers either defect or kill it. As a result, the are prone to change sides at the first sign of weakness. They seem to have no other moral values; they are pirates and cannibals, and are generally deemed troublesome and dangerous by the other species.

Occasionally, a strong leader gains enough &#x27; to achieve the status of &#x27;. These individuals are viewed by the &#x27; as serious destabilizing factors. During the time of the Chanur cycle, several &#x27; seek to become the &#x27;, the leader of all the &#x27;, a status no &#x27; has ever attained, a possibility that greatly disturbs other species, especially the &#x27;.

 are very linguistically adept and adaptable. They are also color blind and the colors of their clothes and habitats are generally shades of black and grey. They use dot codes instead of color codes for their hardware. Unlike other Compact oxygen-breathers, they are capable of remaining awake and physically active during the &quot;no-time&quot; of &quot;Jump&quot; – a fact which (like most other things about themselves) they prefer to keep secret.

===Methane-breathers===

====Tc&#x27;a and Chi====
 are large methane-breathing five-eyed yellow snakelike beings, and the chi are yellow arthropod-like creatures. The two species are related in a way none of the oxygen breathers understand, but are (presumably) symbiotic. They are very technologically advanced and powerful, although understanding them is tricky at best, since their brains are multi-part and their speech decodes as complex matrices of intertwined meanings. They run the methane side of most space stations.

====Knnn====
, the third methane-breathing species, multi-legged tangles of wiry black hair, are the most technologically advanced in the Compact. Unlike other known species, they can maneuver in hyperspace and carry other ships with them. Only can communicate with them (or claim they can); the are incomprehensible and therefore deemed dangerous by the other species, not to be provoked. They trade by taking whatever they want and leaving whatever they deem sufficient as payment behind; it is an improvement over their prior habit of just taking trader ships apart.

==Technology of the Compact==

There are three main kinds of space ships in Compact&#x27;s employ: surface-to-orbit shuttles, miners, and jump ships. The first and the second use only reaction engines for propulsion; shuttles can land on planets while miners and jump ships need space stations to dock. Only the jump ships can cross interstellar distances by using a jump drive. They are also the fastest in-system transports because they can move at sub-light speeds without entering a jump. Most of these are traders and freighters; some are heavily armed hunter-ships.

Compact jump ships do not enter hyperspace proper; they aim at a star and &quot;glide&quot; along the so-called &quot;interface&quot; between space and hyperspace until the mass at the other end of the jump goal makes them drop out. They exit at light speed and must dump velocity with help of the same jump engine; a ship failing to do so is doomed, and usually a high hazard. There is a limit on maximum jump distance, depending on the ship&#x27;s drive power and mass; a ship overstretching a jump may &quot;fade&quot;, never exiting it. A jump takes several weeks of objective time. Subjectively it can take hours or even several days; this tends to exhaust the body, and the crews need to take rest between jumps. Hani and stay marginally conscious during jump, but unable to act; usually, they dream. must drug themselves unconscious to survive jump. Humans can survive it undrugged, but it is a terrible experience to them. No one knows what the other species feel during it, though it is hinted that kif maintain more of their faculties than hani during jump. Jumps can be strung together, but at a commensurate increase in crew discomfort.

Ships and space stations communicate by radio, which poses time-lag difficulties. To alleviate them somewhat, heavily trafficked systems usually keep buoys near the jump exit points that serve incoming ships with system-wide scan and traffic information, and also mail.

The space stations are universally built as huge doughnuts, the spin maintaining artificial gravity provided by centrifugal force; the Compact has no gravitational-control technology. The spin poses a difficulty when docking, as the ship must precisely coincide with the rotating station wheel. When docked, two sets of grapples, its own and the station&#x27;s, hold it in place and in mutual clinch: a ship can undock forcibly, but that is bound to damage the station and is subject to substantial fines. Tankers and miners dock at the central hub for the transfer of materials. Dockside transport is mostly electric carts and trucks of all sizes, but many move around on the docks on foot. If a ship ignites its jump engine while docked, the energy released will blow the whole compound to pieces.

Different species build ships in different fashions; the methane-breather ships seem haphazardly constructed to the oxygen breathers. Hani ships such as &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; are based on mahendo&#x27;sat technology. The dock grapples are at the prow of the ship. Behind it is the habitat area with a rotating carousel which provides &quot;gravity&quot; during inertial flight and in jump; the bridge, galley and living quarters – including crew and passenger quarters – are all located in that ring. Then come the pressurized and &quot;cold&quot; holds for cargo canisters, loading machinery and a separate cargo access hatch; then the jump drive assembly with three vanes constructed of modular panels and mounted on support columns, with wire struts; these form the &quot;hyperspace bubble&quot; needed to cross the interface. At the rear of the ship is the main engine, used for ballistic flight. Hunter ships have less cargo space and more weaponry and crew accommodation, and often have detachable holds; even a freighter can &quot;blow its holds&quot; when necessary to lighten the ship to allow for more speed. This is only done &quot;in extremis&quot;, as the entire purpose of a freighter is to trade in goods and make a profit.

Weapons include lasers, automatic cannons, and missile batteries for the ship; personal armaments include small beam weapons, pistols, and &quot;AP guns&quot;, which fire explosive shells, not unlike a small grenade launcher. Knives are also mentioned. Hani and kif, as predators, also have sharp retractile claws and sharp teeth. The mahendo&#x27;sat have tough, non-retractable claws, which are often used for utilitarian purposes, but using these in a fight is seen as a sign of madness in their culture.

==Plots and characters==

===&quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;===
The balance of power and economic stability of the Compact are threatened when an Outsider, a human named Tully, escapes from his kif captors at Meetpoint Station and seeks refuge on a hani merchant ship, &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;, captained by Pyanfar Chanur. Pyanfar&#x27;s refusal to surrender Tully to the kif makes an enemy of their ambitious leader, Akukkakk. The kif had captured Tully&#x27;s ship and tried to force the four surviving humans to divulge all they knew about their previously unknown species, but the humans resisted. Tully was the only survivor. Aboard &quot;The Pride&quot;, Tully persuades an initially reluctant Pyanfar to accept him as a member of her otherwise all-female crew. The kif chase &quot;The Pride&quot; back to the hani homeworld, but the unpredictable and powerful knnn drive the kif away. The knnn also transport a human ship they found, the &quot;Ulysses&quot;, into hani space, and Tully is reunited with his species.

Main characters
* Pyanfar Chanur (hani): captain of &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;
* Tully (human): fugitive from the kif and crewmember of &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;
* Ana Ismehanan-min a.k.a. Goldtooth (mahendo&#x27;sat): captain of &quot;Mahijiru&quot;
* Akukkakk (kif): &quot;hakkikt&quot; and captain of &quot;Hinukku&quot;

===&quot;Chanur&#x27;s Venture&quot; / &quot;The Kif Strike Back&quot; / &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;===
Two years after the events of &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot;, Pyanfar Chanur returns to Meetpoint Station with &quot;The Pride&quot;, where Goldtooth presents the surprised hani captain with Tully, returned from Earth. A fleet of human ships is on the way, though Tully does not make it clear whether they are coming to establish trade relations with the Compact or attack the kif. This threatens to break the uneasy balance of power within the Compact. At the same time, two kif, Akkhtimakt and Sikkukkut, are engaged in a power struggle, both trying to become the &quot;mekt-hakkikt&quot; and finally unite the kif, a prospect that inspires dread among most of the rest of the species in the Compact. Sikkukkut persuades a reluctant Pyanfar into becoming his ally, which raises the suspicions of an already hostile agent of the planet-oriented, conservative hani government. The kif conflict spills over into hani space, threatening the hani homeworld, but Goldtooth and the human fleet arrive and the two &quot;hakkikts&quot; are defeated. A small delegation of Compact ships return with the human ships to human space to investigate trade. Pyanfar offers Tully the opportunity to return with the human ships, but he elects to remain on &quot;The Pride&quot; as a crew member.

* Stle-stles-stlen (): stationmaster of Meetpoint Station

===&quot;Chanur&#x27;s Legacy&quot;===
The Compact is at peace, thanks to a treaty brokered by Pyanfar Chanur, elevating her to a newly created position as President of Compact Space to go with her status as &quot;mekt-hakkikt&quot; of the kif. Eight years later, Hilfy Chanur, Pyanfar&#x27;s niece, former crew member of &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; and captain of her own ship, &quot;Chanur&#x27;s Legacy,&quot; arrives at Meetpoint Station. There No&#x27;shto-shti-stlen, the stationmaster, offers her a million-credit contract to deliver a precious &quot;oji&quot; (cultural artifact) to Atli-lyen-tlas, the ambassador at Urtur Station. Hilfy, wanting to not offend the powerful stationmaster and tempted by the enormous payment, reluctantly accepts the contract and takes aboard the &quot;oji&quot; and its guardian. &quot;Legacy&#x27;s&quot; ordeal begins when they reach Uther, only to find Atli-lyen-tlas has fled. A mahen faction that many mahendo&#x27;sat believe to have &quot;the Momentum&quot; (a mystical force) wants the &quot;oji&quot; and is hunting for the ambassador. Vikktakkht, a kif &quot;hakkikt&quot;, rescues Atli-lyen-tlas and &quot;shelters&quot; &#x27; in kif space, persuading Hilfy to come and fetch &#x27;. Hilfy rescues Atli-lyen-tlas, but discovers that &#x27;, due to the stress of &#x27; ordeal and old age, has become &#x27;, or neuter, and cannot accept the &quot;oji&quot;, which turns out to constitute a marriage proposal from No&#x27;shto-shti-stlen. With the help of Vikktakkht, Hilfy returns to Meetpoint, now under the control of the mahen faction, and frees No&#x27;shto-shti-stlen, presenting &#x27; with Atli-lyen-tlas and the &quot;oji&quot;, thus completing a complex politically oriented marriage contract. The mahendo&#x27;sat are ousted from Meetpoint and control is returned to the .

<text>The Federal Writers&#x27; Project (FWP) was a federal government project in the United States created to provide jobs for out-of-work writers and to develop a history and overview of the United States, by state, cities and other jurisdictions. It was launched in 1935 during the Great Depression. It was part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a New Deal program. It was one of a group of New Deal arts programs known collectively as Federal Project Number One or Federal One.

FWP employed thousands of people and produced hundreds of publications, including state guides, city guides, local histories, oral histories, ethnographies, and children&#x27;s books. In addition to writers, the project provided jobs to unemployed librarians, clerks, researchers, editors, and historians.

==History==
Funded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, FWP was established July 27, 1935, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Henry Alsberg, a lawyer, journalist, playwright, theatrical producer, and human-rights activist, directed the program from 1935 to 1939. In 1939, Alsberg was fired, federal funding was cut, and the project fell under state sponsorship led by John D. Newsom. FWP ended completely in 1943 after the US entered World War II and funds were diverted to the war effort.

An estimated 10,000 people found employment in the FWP. The project was intended not only to provide work relief for unemployed writers, but also to create a unique &quot;self-portrait of America&quot; through publication of histories and guidebooks. From 1935 to 1943, the project cost about $27,000,000 – 0.002% of all WPA appropriations.

== American Guide Series and other publications ==
The &quot;American Guide&quot; Series, the most well-known of FWP&#x27;s publications, consisted of guides to the then 48 states, the Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. The books were written and compiled by writers from individual states and territories, and edited by Alsberg and his staff in Washington, D.C. The format was generally uniform: each guide included detailed histories of the state or territory, with descriptions of every city and town, automobile travel routes, photographs, maps, and chapters on natural resources, culture, and geography. The inclusion of essays about the various cultures of people living in the states, including immigrants and African Americans, was unprecedented. City books, such as &quot;The New York City Guide&quot;, were also published as part of the series. Some full-length books are available online at the Internet Archive.

The FWP also published another series, &quot;Life In America&quot;, and numerous individual titles. Many FWP books were bestsellers, including &quot;New England Hurricane: A Factual, Pictorial Record&quot;, a rapidly produced volume about the devastation wreaked by the 1938 New England hurricane. Others, such as &quot;Cape Cod Pilot&quot;, written by author Josef Berger using the pseudonym Jeremiah Digges, received critical acclaim.

In each state, a Writers&#x27; Project non-relief staff of editors was formed, along with a much larger group of field workers drawn from local unemployment rolls. The people hired came from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from former newspaper workers to white-collar and blue-collar workers without writing or editing experience.

== Ancillary projects ==

Notable FWP projects included the Slave Narrative Collection, a set of interviews that culminated in more than 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and-white photographs of former slaves. Many of these narratives are available online from the above-named collection at the Library of Congress website. Folklorist Benjamin A. Botkin was instrumental in insuring the survival of these manuscripts. Among the many researchers and authors who have used this collection are Colson Whitehead, who drew from it for his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot;.

Other programs that emerged from Alsberg&#x27;s desire to create an inclusive &quot;self-portrait of America&quot; were the Life History and Folklore projects. These consisted of first-person narratives and interviews (collected and conducted by FWP workers), which represented people of various ethnicities, regions, and occupations. According to the Library of Congress website, &quot;American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, 1936 to 1940&quot;, the documents &quot;chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others.&quot;

Among several projects within these first-person narratives was the Southern Life History Project created by William Couch, head of the University of North Carolina Press, and Southeast Regional Director of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project. In &quot;These Are Our Lives&quot;, the only book published by the Southern Life History project, Couch explained that their goal was to &quot;get life histories which are readable and faithful representations of living persons, and which taken together, will give a fair picture of the structure and working of society.&quot;

The Illinois Writers&#x27; Project, was one of the few racially integrated project sites. Among its directors was Jacob Scher. The Chicago project employed Arna Bontemps, an established voice of the Harlem Renaissance, and helped to launch the literary careers of African-American writers such as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Katherine Dunham, and Frank Yerby.

The Virginia Negro Studies Project employed 16 African-American writers and culminated in the publication of &quot;The Negro in Virginia&quot; (1940). Notably, it included photographs by Robert McNeill, now remembered as a groundbreaking African-American photographer. African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston was employed by the Florida Writers&#x27; Project. Years after her death, her unpublished works from this time were compiled in &quot;Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers&#x27; Project&quot; (1999).

A short-lived FWP project was called America Eats, a proposed book of the regional foodways of the United States. Writers in each state were tasked with gathering information about foods and food-related events unique to their area, and preparing essays about these. The country was divided into five regions: the Northeast, the South, the Middle West, the Far West, and the Southwest. While materials, in various quantities, were gathered from all five regions, the book &quot;America Eats!&quot; was never completed and published. The United States entry into World War II in 1943 resulted in a loss of funding for the FWP and its projects. Materials from the America Eats project are held in various archives and libraries around the country, including at the Library of Congress and the Montana State University Archives and Special Collections. A large digital archive called What America Ate has been created to house the digitized remains of the project.

== Controversies ==

For most of its lifetime, the FWP faced a barrage of criticism from American conservatives. When &quot;Massachusetts: A Guide to its Places and People&quot;, was published, it was lauded by government officials, including Governor Charles F. Hurley. But the day after its publication, &quot;conservatives attacked the book over its essays on the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and other labor issues. Such critics were even more scathing about the coverage of the Sacco and Vanzetti affair.&quot; Scholars called the questionable passages fair accounts; the controversy helped increase book sales.

The most poisonous attacks against the FWP came from the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and its chair, Congressman Martin Dies Jr. of Texas. Alsberg and Hallie Flanagan, his counterpart at the Federal Theatre Project, faced tremendous scrutiny from the committee. The Dies HUAC committee, like the McCarthy committee of the 1950s, &quot;used inquisitorial scare tactics, innuendo, and unsupported accusations.&quot; Alsberg, Flanagan, and others who were accused of supporting the communist agenda could not &quot;examine evidence against them, could not produce their own witnesses, could not cross-examine accusers.&quot; Accusations that communist activities were carried out openly, and that Soviets funded labor unions, which took control of the arts&#x27; projects, were found to be false. Author Richard Wright, a future Guggenheim scholar, was often under attack, with his writings pronounced as &quot;vile&quot;. Among the many charges leveled by HUAC against the FWP and its workers, was that Richard Wright was not born in the United States. (He was born in Mississippi.) Alsberg wrote a long court brief and provided supporting documents to refute each charge.

First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt supported the FWP, as did such mainstream publishing companies such as Viking Press, Random House, and Alfred A. Knopf, each of which published some of the books.

By 1939, HUAC&#x27;s tactics seemed to work, and the newly elected Congress cut the WPA budget while increasing HUAC&#x27;s funding. In January 1939, 6,000 people were laid off from Federal One. By July 1939, Congress voted to eliminate the Theatre Project, which had been criticized for communist influence. Federal sponsorship for the Federal Writers&#x27; Project ended in 1939. The program was permitted to continue under state sponsorship, with some federal employees, until 1943. In the last months of the FWP&#x27;s operation, Henry Alsberg was fired.

He continued to work past his firing date in order to meet contractual arrangements with the publishers of three upcoming &quot;American Guide&quot; books. By the time of his departure in 1939, the FWP had published 321 works; hundreds more remained in various stages of publication. Some were published in the years leading up to 1943 under the renamed Writers&#x27; Program. Others were never completed. Over the lifetime of the FWP and the Writers&#x27; Program, 10,000 people were estimated to be employed.

In the 1937 musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, funded by the Federal Theater Project, composer Marc Blitzstein incorporated some of opponents&#x27; efforts to prevent this production.

==Film==
In September 2009 a documentary about FWP, &quot;Soul of a People: Writing America&#x27;s Story&quot;, premiered on the Smithsonian Channel . It was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.The film includes interviews with American authors Studs Terkel and Stetson Kennedy, and American historian Douglas Brinkley. A companion book was published by Wiley &amp; Sons as &quot;Soul of a People: The WPA Writers&#x27; Project Uncovers Depression America&quot;.

The Slave Narrative Collection was featured in the HBO documentary, &quot;Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives&quot;. The film includes actors Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson performing dramatic readings of selected transcripts.

The 1999 film &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot;, by Tim Robbins, while depicting the events of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), dramatizes the attacks against Federal One by HUAC. Its efforts resulted in closing both the FTP and the FWP.

== Proposal for a new Federal Writers&#x27; Project ==
In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and consequent global economic disruption, several writers and politicians called for a new U.S. Federal Writers&#x27; Project. In May 2021, on the anniversary of the original project, Congressman Ted Lieu and Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez introduced legislation to create a new FWP, to be administered by the Department of Labor, that would hire unemployed and underemployed writers. Supporters of the legislation included writers James Fallows, Ruth Dickey, and Jonathan Lethem.

<text>The Emperor&#x27;s Club is a 2002 American drama film directed by Michael Hoffman and starring Kevin Kline. Based on Ethan Canin&#x27;s 1994 short story &quot;The Palace Thief&quot;, the film follows a prep school teacher and his students at a fictional East Coast boys&#x27; prep school, St. Benedict&#x27;s Academy.

==Plot==
In the early 1970s, William Hundert is a revered classics teacher at Saint Benedict&#x27;s, a boys&#x27; boarding school for the sons of wealthy families. Hundert attempts to impart wisdom and a sense of honor to his students. He begins the new school year by making student Martin Blythe read a plaque that hangs over his door. It contains a statement by an ancient Mesopotamian ruler, Shutruk Nahunte. The plaque sings Shutruk Nahunte&#x27;s praises, but Hundert explains that he contributed nothing of value to his kingdom, and as a result is virtually forgotten today.

Hundert&#x27;s disciplined life and classroom are shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, is enrolled in the middle of the term. Sedgewick, the underachieving, spoiled son of a U.S. senator from West Virginia, frequently disrupts class and does poorly in his homework, even breaks rules by traveling off campus, across the lake to St. Mary&#x27;s, a girls&#x27; boarding school. Hundert meets with Sedgewick&#x27;s father, Hiram Bell, to talk about his behavior, only to discover that Hiram has minimal interest in Sedgewick&#x27;s education beyond the passing of his classes.

Hundert decides to help Sedgewick, and as they develop a friendship, Sedgewick&#x27;s grades show improvement. Sedgewick works very hard to earn a spot in the school&#x27;s annual &quot;Mr. Julius Caesar contest&quot;, in which the top three students compete in a classics quiz in front of the entire school. However, Sedgewick only qualifies in fourth place. Hundert, not wanting his efforts with Sedgewick to be all for naught, raises his grade to qualify, which effectively excludes Martin, the rightful third-place contestant. During the competition, Hundert spies Sedgewick using crib notes, but Mr. Woodbridge, the headmaster orders Hundert to ignore it, as Sedgewick&#x27;s father is a major donor for the school. Hundert then deliberately asks Sedgewick a question on Hamilcar Barca which was not covered in class; it is answered correctly by another contestant who was reading about Roman wars on his own time, Deepak Mehta, who is crowned &quot;Mr. Julius Caesar&quot;. The cheating is never made public, but the trust Sedgewick and Hundert had in each other is broken. Sedgewick returns to his old ways and barely graduates in 1976, with Hundert expressing deep disappointment that he failed Sedgewick.

Twenty-five years later, Mr. Woodbridge dies, and Hundert is poised to become the new headmaster, but resigns in shock when a less experienced colleague gets the position due to his fundraising ability. Hundert is later told that Sedgewick, now a wealthy corporate CEO, will make a large donation to Saint Benedict&#x27;s, contingent upon Hundert hosting a Mr. Julius Caesar rematch at Sedgewick&#x27;s resort hotel on the Gold Coast, Long Island. The other members of Sedgewick&#x27;s graduating class are also invited, and all enjoy the reunion. The three original contestants begin the competition, but as it progresses, Hundert realizes that Sedgewick is once again cheating by being fed answers through an earpiece. Hundert asks a question about Shutruk Nahunte, which all the students find laughably easy; however, Sedgewick is unable to answer it. Deepak answers correctly and once again wins. Afterward, Sedgewick formally announces that he is following in the footsteps of his father, now deceased, by running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. While the men applaud, Hundert is appalled that he was used for political grandstanding.

After the announcement, Hundert and Sedgewick run into each other in the mens’ room, leading to a confrontation between the two. Sedgewick tells Hundert that in the real world, dishonesty trumps principles, and that Hundert has let life pass him by. Sedgewick&#x27;s words are overheard by his young son, who is shocked to learn the truth about his father. That evening at the hotel bar, Hundert apologizes to Martin and admits that he gave his spot to Sedgewick in the competition years ago. Martin tentatively forgives him. The following morning, the resort is apparently empty; however, Hundert is then greeted by a surprise party held in his honor by his former students, who present to him an award engraved with a quote about education. The men wave goodbye to Hundert as he departs in a helicopter, and he reflects that while he failed with Sedgewick Bell, he succeeded with other students.

Hundert returns to his old job teaching classics in the present-day Saint Benedict&#x27;s, now coeducational and more diverse. His class includes Martin&#x27;s son, Martin Blythe IV. Hundert peers outside the window to see the older Blythe gladly waving to his old teacher. Hundert has the younger Blythe read the plaque above the door.

==Cast==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
The film, originally titled &quot;The Palace Thief&quot;, was first developed at Fine Line Features, with Kevin Kline reportedly in talks to star and direct. The production went into turnaround and was acquired by Universal Pictures. Michael Hoffman, who had previously collaborated with Kline on &quot;Soapdish&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, was announced to direct.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography took place in New York City from May to June 2001. The school campus scenes were filmed at the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Club&quot; holds a 50% approval rating based on 128 reviews with an average rating on 5.80/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though Kline is excellent in his portrayal of Hundert, the movie is too dull and sentimental to distinguish itself from other titles in its genre.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 49 out of 100, based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

The performances of Kline and Hirsch were lauded, with some saying the former &quot;manages a mix of quiet joy and melancholic disillusionment within the confines of a very reserved role&quot;, and others noting the latter plays Sedgewick with &quot;a intuitive brew of cunning, charm and malice&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and praised the complexity of Hundert&#x27;s flawed character, noting that as &quot;a portrait of the escalator that speeds the sons of the rich upward toward power, it is unusually realistic&quot;. However, multiple critics pointed out the film is weakened by its sentimentality and muddled messaging. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Michael Wilmington said the film &quot;boasts lots of talent&quot; and has the potential to explore &quot;some unusual themes&quot; about ethics and values, but ultimately gives in to plot contrivances and improbabilities.

David Stratton of &quot;At the Movies&quot; opined, &quot;It&#x27;s decently made, decently acted and moderately interesting but, in the end, pretty forgettable. When it finally gets to the point, which is a potentially interesting one about the duplicity of some sections of the Establishment, interest has waned.&quot; Many also opined the film hews too closely to the clichés of the &quot;inspirational teacher&quot; film genre.

A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The younger actors, especially Mr. Dano and Jesse Eisenberg, as a bright, skittish boy named Masoudi, have the right mix of anxiety and bravado, but the St. Benedict&#x27;s boys are as thinly conceived as the minor adult characters.&quot; He added Hundert &quot;is less a person than a walking moral problem and is in fact more interesting as an ethical puzzle than as a psychological study&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; noted that in the film&#x27;s third act, the casting of the older students &quot;doesn’t jibe physically with their younger selves.&quot;

Others lamented the changes from the original short story. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Stephen Hunter commented, &quot;Where complexity within the characters is suggested, it&#x27;s quickly milled out in the generic spirit of sentimentality about the school experience. Where the original ending may have been bittersweet and full of self-recrimination, this ending is triumphant and self-congratulatory. You walk out yearning for the rebellious, grungy untidiness of real kids&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
At the 24th Young Artist Awards in 2003, the film received nominations for Best Family Feature Film – Drama, and for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actor for Emile Hirsch.

<doc id="430790" wikidata="Q105580" url="?curid=430790" title="Gauge boson">
<text>In particle physics, a gauge boson is a bosonic elementary particle that acts as the force carrier for elementary fermions. Elementary particles whose interactions are described by a gauge theory interact with each other by the exchange of gauge bosons, usually as virtual particles.

Photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons are gauge bosons. All known gauge bosons have a spin of 1 and therefore are vector bosons. For comparison, the Higgs boson has spin zero and the hypothetical graviton has a spin of 2.

Gauge bosons are different from the other kinds of bosons: first, fundamental scalar bosons (the Higgs boson); second, mesons, which are composite bosons, made of quarks; third, larger composite, non-force-carrying bosons, such as certain atoms.

==Gauge bosons in the Standard Model==
The Standard Model of particle physics recognizes four kinds of gauge bosons: photons, which carry the electromagnetic interaction; W and Z bosons, which carry the weak interaction; and gluons, which carry the strong interaction.

Isolated gluons do not occur because they are colour-charged and subject to colour confinement.

===Multiplicity of gauge bosons===
In a quantized gauge theory, gauge bosons are quanta of the gauge fields. Consequently, there are as many gauge bosons as there are generators of the gauge field. In quantum electrodynamics, the gauge group is U(1); in this simple case, there is only one gauge boson, the photon. In quantum chromodynamics, the more complicated group SU(3) has eight generators, corresponding to the eight gluons. The three W and Z bosons correspond (roughly) to the three generators of SU(2) in electroweak theory.

===Massive gauge bosons===
Gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons are described mathematically by field equations for massless particles. Otherwise, the mass terms add non-zero additional terms to the Lagrangian under gauge transformations, violating gauge symmetry. Therefore, at a naïve theoretical level, all gauge bosons are required to be massless, and the forces that they describe are required to be long-ranged. The conflict between this idea and experimental evidence that the weak and strong interactions have a very short range requires further theoretical insight.

According to the Standard Model, the W and Z bosons gain mass via the Higgs mechanism. In the Higgs mechanism, the four gauge bosons (of SU(2)×U(1) symmetry) of the unified electroweak interaction couple to a Higgs field. This field undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the shape of its interaction potential. As a result, the universe is permeated by a non-zero Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV). This VEV couples to three of the electroweak gauge bosons (W, W and Z), giving them mass; the remaining gauge boson remains massless (the photon). This theory also predicts the existence of a scalar Higgs boson, which has been observed in experiments at the LHC.

==Beyond the Standard Model==
===Grand unification theories===
The Georgi–Glashow model predicts additional gauge bosons named X and Y bosons. The hypothetical X and Y bosons mediate interactions between quarks and leptons, hence violating conservation of baryon number and causing proton decay. Such bosons would be even more massive than W and Z bosons due to symmetry breaking. Analysis of data collected from such sources as the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector has yielded no evidence of X and Y bosons.

===Gravitons===
The fourth fundamental interaction, gravity, may also be carried by a boson, called the graviton. In the absence of experimental evidence and a mathematically coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unknown whether this would be a gauge boson or not. The role of gauge invariance in general relativity is played by a similar symmetry: diffeomorphism invariance.

=== W′ and Z′ bosons ===

W′ and Z′ bosons refer to hypothetical new gauge bosons (named in analogy with the Standard Model W and Z bosons).

<doc id="430792" wikidata="Q6985582" url="?curid=430792" title="Necklace polynomial">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the necklace polynomial, or Moreau&#x27;s necklace-counting function, introduced by , counts the number of distinct necklaces of &quot;n&quot; colored beads chosen out of α available colors, arranged in a cycle. Unlike the usual problem of graph coloring, the necklaces are assumed to be aperiodic (not consisting of repeated subsequences), and counted up to rotation (rotating the beads around the necklace counts as the same necklace), but without flipping over (reversing the order of the beads counts as a different necklace). This counting function also describes the dimensions in a free Lie algebra and the number of irreducible polynomials over a finite field.

==Definition==
The necklace polynomials are a family of polynomials formula_1 in the variable formula_2 such that
:formula_3

By Möbius inversion they are given by
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the classic Möbius function. 

A closely related family, called the general necklace polynomial or general necklace-counting function, is:
:formula_6
where formula_7 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

==Applications==
The necklace polynomials formula_1 and formula_9 appear as:
* The number of aperiodic necklaces (or equivalently Lyndon words), which are cyclic arrangements of &quot;n&quot; colored beads having &quot;α&quot; available colors. Two such necklaces are considered equal if they are related by a rotation (not considering reflections). &quot;Aperiodic&quot; refers to necklaces without rotational symmetry, having &quot;n&quot; distinct rotations. Correspondingly, formula_9 gives the number of necklaces including the periodic ones: this is easily computed using Pólya theory.
* The dimension of the degree &quot;n&quot; component of the free Lie algebra on &quot;α&quot; generators (&quot;Witt&#x27;s formula&quot;), or equivalently the number of Hall words of length &quot;n&quot;. Correspondingly, formula_9 should be the dimension of the degree &quot;n&quot; component of a free Jordan algebra.
* The number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot; over a finite field with &quot;α&quot; elements (when formula_12 is a prime power). Correspondingly, formula_9 is the number of polynomials which are primary (a power of an irreducible).
* The exponent in the cyclotomic identity: formula_14.
Although these various types of objects are all counted by the same polynomial, their precise relationships remain unclear. For example, there is no canonical bijection between the irreducible polynomials and the Lyndon words. However, there is a non-canonical bijection as follows. For any degree &quot;n&quot; monic irreducible polynomial over a field &quot;F&quot; with &quot;α&quot; elements, its roots lie in a Galois extension field &quot;L&quot; with formula_15 elements. One may choose an element formula_16 such that formula_17 is an &quot;F&quot;-basis for &quot;L&quot; (a normal basis), where &quot;σ&quot; is the Frobenius automorphism formula_18. Then the bijection can be defined by taking a necklace, viewed as an equivalence class of functions formula_19, to the irreducible polynomialformula_20 for formula_21.Different cyclic rearrangements of &quot;f&quot;, i.e. different representatives of the same necklace equivalence class, yield cyclic rearrangements of the factors of formula_22, so this correspondence is well-defined.

==Relations between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;==
The polynomials for &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are easily related in terms of Dirichlet convolution of arithmetic functions formula_23, regarding formula_2 as a constant.
* The formula for &quot;M&quot; gives formula_25,
* The formula for &quot;N&quot; gives formula_26.
* Their relation gives formula_27 or equivalently formula_28, since the function formula_29 is completely multiplicative.

Any two of these imply the third, for example:
:formula_30
by cancellation in the Dirichlet algebra.

==Examples==

<doc id="430795" wikidata="Q3182450" url="?curid=430795" title="John Seward Johnson II">
<text>John Seward Johnson II (April 16, 1930 – March 10, 2020), also known as J. Seward Johnson Jr. and Seward Johnson, was an American artist known for &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painted bronze statues. He was a grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, the co-founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and of Colonel Thomas Melville Dill of Bermuda.

He designed life-size bronze statues that were castings of living people, depicting them engaged in day-to-day activities. A large staff of technicians did the fabrication of the works he designed. Computers and digital technology often were used in the manufacturing process. Sometimes the manufacture was contracted in China. He was the founder of Grounds For Sculpture, a sculpture park and museum located in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey.

==Early life and education==
Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on April 16, 1930. His father was John Seward Johnson I, and his mother was Ruth Dill, the sister of actress Diana Dill, making him a first cousin of actor Michael Douglas. Johnson grew up with five siblings: Mary Lea Johnson Richards, Elaine Johnson, Diana Melville Johnson, Jennifer Underwood Johnson, and James Loring &quot;Jimmy&quot; Johnson. His parents divorced around 1937. His father remarried two years later, producing his only brother, Jimmy Johnson, making him an uncle to film director Jamie Johnson.

Johnson attended Forman School for dyslexics. Later, he attended the University of Maine, where he majored in poultry husbandry, but did not graduate. Johnson also served four years in the United States Navy during the Korean War.

==Career==



Johnson worked for Johnson &amp; Johnson until 1962, when he was fired by his uncle Robert Wood Johnson II, who had turned the family business into one of the world&#x27;s largest healthcare corporations.

Johnson maintained a studio in Princeton, New Jersey and later, another at a site in Mercerville, New Jersey that formerly had been used for the New Jersey State Fair.

His early artistic efforts focused on painting, after which he turned to sculpture in 1968. Examples of his statues include:
* &quot;Spring&quot; (1979), a bronze dedicated in 1979, set in the Crim Dell Woods section of the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. Other examples of &quot;Spring&quot; castings include the East Brunswick, New Jersey public library and the Fitton Center for Creative Arts in Hamilton, Ohio.
* &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1980), his largest and most dramatic work, a five-part statue that depicts a giant trying to free himself from underground. The sculpture was located at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. for nearly twenty-eight years while still owned by Johnson. It was moved to Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland in February, 2008, and an attempt was made by the new curator to correct some of the scale distortions of the original installation by altering some implied underground connections and placing the parts in different relationships to each other.
* &quot;Double Check&quot; (1982), a statue of a businessman checking his attaché case, formerly located in Liberty Plaza Park across an intersection from the World Trade Center, as part of the public space required by a zoning variance granted to the developer of the adjoining skyscraper. Widely published photographs of the debris-battered and dust-covered statue were taken following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The statue, scars and all, was returned to a prominent corner of the restored and renamed Zuccotti Park in 2006, again open to the public. Periodically, the statue has been adorned by tourists, pranksters, and even Occupy Wall Street protesters. &quot;Makeshift Memorial&quot; is an adapted 2nd casting of &quot;Double Check&quot;, placed in 2004 along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in Jersey City, New Jersey opposite the original World Trade Center site, and is a component of the Jersey City 9/11 Memorial
* &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; (1983), a statue at Hofstra University, at the California Avenue gate, near a road leading away from campus.
* &quot;Allow Me&quot; (Portland, Oregon) (1984), a statue of man holding an umbrella, in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, part of the &quot;Allow Me&quot; series.
* &quot;Lunch Break&quot; (1983), a statue of a worker sitting on a bench, taking a break for lunch with a cigar in hand and lunch box at his side. Statues are known to be placed in Zichron Ya&#x27;akov, Israel (originally in Morristown, New Jersey and brought to Israel by the Jerusalem Foundation), in Edmonton, Canada, and Key West, Florida.
* &quot;Competition&quot; (1984), a statue of Julie Wier, Fairview Heights, Illinois, chosen to represent the spirit of the people of St. Louis as winner of the &quot;picture yourself as a work of art&quot; contest. Dedicated on June 16, 1984 unsigned St. Louis County Library in St. Louis, Missouri.
* &quot;Waiting&quot; (1988), a statue of a man reading a paper, in Australia Square, Sydney, Australia
* &quot;Waiting&quot; (1992), a statue of a man reading a paper, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
* &quot;Déjeuner Déjà Vu&quot; (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, a facility founded by Johnson, is a three-dimensional restaging of Édouard Manet&#x27;s painting, &quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;
* &quot;Copyright Infringement&quot; (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture (a facility founded by Johnson) is a sculpture that he named to flaunt his disdain for criticism of his copies of the iconic works of fine art artists with international recognition. It represents the fine artist Édouard Manet, whose work he has copied.
* &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; (a series with several material versions begun in 2005), a spokesperson for Johnson has stated that this series is based on a photograph that is in the public domain, &quot;Kissing the War Goodbye&quot;, by Victor Jorgensen, however, the Jorgensen photographic image does not extend low enough to include the lower legs and shoes of the subjects, revealed in Alfred Eisenstaedt&#x27;s famous photograph, &quot;V–J day in Times Square&quot;, that are represented identically in the statue. A spokesperson for &quot;Life&quot; has called it a copyright infringement of the latter image. Nonetheless, the first version, a bronze statue in life-size, was placed on temporary exhibition during the 2005 anniversary of V-J Day at the Times Square Information Center near where the original photographs were taken in Manhattan.

:Several slightly differing twenty-five-feet-tall-versions have been constructed in styrofoam and aluminum with little detail, painted, and put on display by Johnson in San Diego, California, Key West, Florida, Snug Harbor in New York, and Sarasota, Florida. Their immensity has drawn crowds of viewers at each site although the view of them from nearby is severely limited, essentially allowing a vista of the legs and up the skirt. The statues have been described as kitsch by one critic. Johnson later would dub the statue &quot;Embracing Peace&quot;, which he treated as a double entendre when spoken.

:A proposal to establish a permanent location for a copy on the Sarasota bay front generated a heated controversy about the suitability of the statue to the location, suitability as a military service memorial, the permanent placement of any statue on that public property, as well as the particular issues of lack of originality, mechanical construction, copyright infringement, and the kitsch allegations about the statue. In final agreement documents with the purchaser (a private person), Johnson committed the purchase price to cover copyright liability damages in order to have the statue placed. The city was wary of accepting a gift from the purchaser that might result in a financial loss from a possible legal battle that evidenced merit, according to the city attorney.

:In October 2014, French feminist group Osez La Feminisme ! petitioned to have a copy of the statue, erected at a World War II memorial in Normandy in September 2014, removed and sent back to the United States, criticizing it as &quot;immortali[zing] a sexual assault&quot;
:Controversies surrounding the statue still existed in Sarasota at the close of 2021, when the question of whether to place a sign addressing them was presented to the city commission at a public meeting in Sarasota on December 6.
* &quot;Big Sister&quot;, just outside the Pig &#x27;N&#x27; Whistle pub and Michael&#x27;s Restaurant at 123 Eagle Street, part of the &quot;Celebrating the Familiar&quot; series
*&quot;Morris Frank and Buddy&quot; (2005) - a statue of the co-founder of The Seeing Eye and the first guide dog for the blind trained in the US stands in the Morristown Green in New Jersey. Frank is shown giving the &quot;forward&quot; command to his dog.
* &quot;First Ride&quot; (2006), a statue of a father helping his young daughter learn to ride a bike, in Carmel, Indiana.
* &quot;Newspaper Reader&quot; (1981), at the entrance to Steinman Park, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The gentleman is looking at three Newspapers - &quot;The Lancaster New Era&quot; reporting the Apollo 11 Moon landing (July 21, 1969), &quot;The Intelligencer Journal&quot; reporting Three Mile Island nuclear accident (March 29, 1979) and the paper he is holding, the September 16, 1923 edition, reporting that the Steinman brothers challenged the no-work-on-Sunday blue laws by publishing the Sunday News for the first time.
* &quot;Forever Marilyn&quot; (2011), a , 17-ton representation of Marilyn Monroe standing over a gusty subway grate in her appearance in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;. Until 2012, the statue was located at Pioneer Court in Chicago, where it attracted many visitors and some controversy for its risque features. It was moved to downtown Palm Springs, California in 2012. In July 2013 plans were announced that it would be moved to New Jersey for a 2014 exhibit honoring Johnson at the Grounds For Sculpture. The statue returned to Palm Springs in 2019 and is now displayed in a central location. 

&quot;Magic Fountain&quot; stands outside The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children&#x27;s Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The fountain features metallic children playing in the fountain and splashing around.

For statues made in a series named, &quot;Iconic&quot;, by Johnson, many of which are very large, a computer program is employed that translates two-dimensional images into statues that are constructed by a machine driven by the program. Often, these subjects are images that already are well known as the works of others, generating heated ethical controversies regarding copyright infringement and derivative works due to substantial similarity issues.

Johnson&#x27;s works were selected by the United States Information Agency to represent the freedoms of the United States in a public and private partnership enterprise representation sponsored by General Motors and many other US corporations at the World EXPO celebration in Seville, Spain during 1992.

===Criticism===
Johnson&#x27;s work was labeled as &quot;kitsch&quot; in a 1984 article by an art professor and critic at Princeton University, who explained its rejection as he was commenting on a controversy raging about the work in New Haven, Connecticut.

His 2003 show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, &quot;Beyond the Frame: Impressionism Revisited&quot;, which presented his statues imitating famous Impressionist paintings, was a success with audiences, but was panned nationally by acknowledged art critics such as Blake Gopnik writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and drew strong criticism from curators at other museums about a prominent museum of fine art presenting an exhibit of his work.

==Philanthropy==
Johnson was the chairman and CEO of The Atlantic Foundation, the foundation created by his father, John Seward Johnson I, in 1963. Johnson created the Johnson Atelier Technical Institute of Sculpture, an educational, nonprofit casting and fabrication facility in 1974 as a means of fostering young sculptors&#x27; talents, while creating a foundry designed to construct his statues that is so well-equipped and staffed that it is chosen by many renowned sculptors. Educational programs at the Atelier ceased in 2004. The Johnson Atelier now operates as a division of The Sculpture Foundation. Johnson continued to make his sculpture at the facility but casting often was performed off premises, with some of his larger works being cast in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

He also founded an organization named &quot;The Sculpture Foundation&quot;, to promote his works. In 1987, he published &quot;Celebrating the Familiar: The Sculpture of J. Seward Johnson, Jr&quot;.

Under Johnson&#x27;s direction, The Atlantic Foundation purchased the old New Jersey Fairgrounds in Hamilton, New Jersey and in 1992 founded the Grounds For Sculpture to display work completed at the Johnson Atelier and other outdoor exhibitions. In 2000 park operations were transferred to a new public charity with the same intent that continues to operate the park.

He was president of the International Sculpture Center of Hamilton, New Jersey, which publishes a magazine out of offices in Washington, D.C.

Johnson also was the president of a large oceanographic research institution in Florida that had been founded by his father. The institution published a science magazine.

Johnson and his wife funded the construction of The Joyce and Seward Johnson Theater for the Theater for the New City, an Off-Broadway theater in New York City.

==Personal life==
Johnson was excluded from his father&#x27;s will, which left the bulk of his fortune to Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his father&#x27;s wife and former art curator. He and his siblings sued on grounds that their father was not mentally competent at the time he signed the will. It was settled out of court, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune.

Johnson was formerly married to Barbara Kline. She often engaged in extramarital affairs in their home, driving Johnson to attempt suicide. In 1965, he acknowledged paternity to Jenia Anne &quot;Cookie&quot; Johnson to speed up the divorce process. Years later, Johnson&#x27;s family had a legal battle regarding Cookie Johnson&#x27;s eligibility for a share in the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune. The court ruled in favor of Cookie.

Johnson later married Joyce Horton, a novelist. They had two children, John Seward Johnson III and actress Clelia Constance Johnson, who is credited as &quot;India Blake.&quot;

Johnson died from cancer at his home in Key West, Florida on March 10, 2020, at the age of 89.

<text>Joseph William Ashton (9 October 1933 – 30 March 2020) was a British Labour Party politician who was the MP for Bassetlaw from 1968 to 2001. He took his seat in by-election, winning with a majority of just 1.72%; in his last election before retiring, he won it by a majority of 36.4%.

==Early career==

Ashton was born and brought up in Sheffield; he attended High Storrs Grammar School and Rotherham Technical College. He was an engineer, and entered electoral politics when he was elected to Sheffield City Council in 1962.

==Parliament==

Ashton was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw in a by-election in 1968, when he struggled to hold the seat (which had been Labour-held since 1929) at a time when the government of Harold Wilson was unpopular. The close result saw it become a marginal seat, won by Ashton with a majority of just 740 (1.72%). The previous MP, Captain Frederick Bellenger was said to have built a personal vote through his Labour canvassing, and in the local newspapers. Having been an MP since 1935, Bellenger died mid-term in May 1968 at the age of 73. He had just been awarded the Freedom of Worksop (a town in the constituency) two days before his death.

Pit closures were an important issue in a seat with a large mining sector vote. Ashton argued that the Labour government&#x27;s approach, which included redundancy payments to miners over the age of 55, was better than the terms of the Conservatives when they were in power (1951–1964). Ashton was associated with the party&#x27;s left early in his career, but gradually moved away over time.

In 1977, Ashton published &quot;Grass Roots&quot;, a novel about a tough steelworker who becomes a rebellious Labour MP. During his time in parliament, he regularly contributed to newspapers as a columnist.

==Later life==
In March 1999, Northamptonshire&#x27;s Chief Constable noted that Ashton had given misleading information to officers when in the same premises of the arrests of the perpetrators of immigration and sexual offences at a Northampton Thai massage parlour. This occurred during a police raid in November 1998. He was interviewed voluntarily and not accused of committing any offence. Ashton threatened to raise a data protection complaint. The police robustly denied that it had leaked Ashton&#x27;s name; their statement said, &quot;there were a great many other people with knowledge of this case - defendants, witnesses, legal representatives, other organisations and other individuals.&quot; A director of Sheffield Wednesday football club since 1990, he resigned as a director shortly after his presence at the parlour was established.

Following his retirement at the 2001 general election, he was succeeded by John Mann. In 2007, Ashton was appointed an OBE.

Ashton was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project. His memoir, &quot;Red Rose Blues&quot;, was published in 2000. He published two volumes of memoirs in 2010 and 2014.

==Personal life and death==
In 1957, Ashton married Maggie Lee; they were married until her death in 2015, and had one daughter.

Ashton died from dementia at a care home in Sheffield on 30 March 2020, at the age of 86.

<doc id="430803" wikidata="Q6609418" url="?curid=430803" title="List of choking deaths">
<text>This is a list of notable people who have died by choking.

* 405 BC: Sophocles (91), Diodorus Siculus claims Sophocles choked on a grape-seed in a cup of wine.
* circa 200: Lucius Fabius Cilo, Pliny the Elder claims &quot;Chilo&quot; perished from choking on a single hair in a draught of milk.
* 453: Attila the Hun (47), although cause of death is disputed.
* 1065: Godwin, Earl of Wessex (~55), reported (by Aelred of Rievaulx) to have choked to death at a Winchester banquet with Edward the Confessor after asking God to witness his claimed innocence in the death of Edward&#x27;s brother.
* 1946: Alexander Alekhine (53), autopsy indicates heart attack, but supposed witness claimed choking.
* 1956: Tommy Dorsey (51)
* 1957: Raymond Griffith (62)
* 1960: Air Marshal Subroto Mukerjee (49), first Chief of the Air Staff of the Indian Air Force (IAF), died on 8 November 1960 at Tokyo by choking on a piece of food lodged in his windpipe.
* 1963: Skinnay Ennis (55)
* 1967: Jimmie Foxx, famous Major League Baseball player, died by choking on a bone on 21 July 1967 aged 59.
* 1970: Jimi Hendrix (27), choked on his aspirated vomit while unconscious with barbiturates.
* 1971: T. V. Soong (76), former premier of Republic of China
* 1978: Dingle Foot (72), well known British politician and brother to future Labour Party Leader Michael Foot died in a Hong Kong hotel after choking on bone in a chicken sandwich.
* 1980: John Bonham (32), Led Zeppelin drummer. Bonham had consumed around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka in a 24 hour period, after which he vomited and choked (a condition known as pulmonary aspiration). The finding was accidental death.
* 1980: Bon Scott (33) the lead vocalist and lyricist of the hard rock band AC/DC The official report of the coroner concluded that Scott had died of &quot;acute alcohol poisoning (which made him choke to death on his own vomit)&quot; and classified it as &quot;Death by misadventure&quot;.
* 1981: Christy Brown (49)
* 2009: Christopher Nolan (43), Irish poet and author.
* 2015: Praful Bidwai (66), Indian journalist and activist, died by choking on food on 23 June 2015 at a conference in Amsterdam.

* 2024: Venezuelan olympic track cyclist Daniela Larreal (50), died by choking on food in Las Vegas, on 11 August 2024.

==In popular culture==
* Singer Cass Elliot did not die from choking on a ham sandwich, as has been alleged.
* In the mockumentary film &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;, the band&#x27;s former drummer, Eric &quot;Stumpy Joe&quot; Childs, is said to have died after he &quot;choked on vomit&quot; and that &quot;it was actually someone else’s vomit&quot;. (This is almost certainly a parody of the deaths of real-life rock stars John Bonham and Bon Scott, as cited above.)

<text>The Conservative Party of Canada was a major federal political party in Canada that existed from 1867 to 1942. The party adhered to traditionalist conservatism and its main policies included strengthening relations with Great Britain, nationalizing industries, and promoting high tariffs.

The party was founded in the aftermath of Canadian Confederation and was known as the &quot;Liberal-Conservative Party&quot; until it dropped &quot;Liberal&quot; from its name in 1873. Primarily under the leadership of John A. Macdonald, the Conservatives governed Canada from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 to 1896. During these two periods of governance, the party strengthened ties with Great Britain, oversaw the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, significantly expanded Canada&#x27;s territorial boundaries, and introduced the National Policy of high tariffs to protect domestic industries.

During its third period of governance from 1911 to 1921, the Conservative Party introduced the income tax and women&#x27;s suffrage for federal elections, and most notably oversaw Canada&#x27;s involvement in World War I. In 1917, the party introduced conscription, triggering a national divide known as the Conscription Crisis. As a result of the crisis, the party joined with pro-conscription Liberals to become the &quot;Unionist Party&quot;, which existed until 1920. The Conservatives were defeated in the 1921 election.

The Conservatives briefly formed government in 1926 and from 1930 to 1935. During the latter period, the Conservatives were faced with the Great Depression, although the party was widely unpopular for its handling of it, leading to their defeat in 1935. In 1942, the Conservatives attempted to broaden their base by electing Manitoba Progressive Premier John Bracken as their new leader at that year&#x27;s leadership convention. Bracken agreed to become the party&#x27;s leader on the condition that it change its name to the &quot;Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&quot;.

==Origins==

===Liberal-Conservative Party===
The roots of the party are in the pre-Confederation Province of Canada. In 1853, the &quot;bleus&quot; from Canada East and the Tories and moderate reformers from Canada West joined together in a coalition government under the dual premiership of Allan MacNab and A.-N. Morin. It was out of this coalition that the Liberal-Conservative Party was formed.

==Confederation==
Macdonald became the leader of the Conservative Party and formed the first national government in 1867. The party brought together ultramontane Quebec Catholics, pro-tariff businessmen, United Empire Loyalists, and Orangemen. One major accomplishment of Macdonald&#x27;s first government was the creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway which also led to the Pacific Scandal that brought down the government in 1873.

The Liberal-Conservatives under Macdonald returned to power in 1878 by opposing the policy of free trade or reciprocity with the United States and promoting, instead, the National Policy which sought to promote business and develop industry with high tariff protectionist measures as well as settle and develop the west.

The principal difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals in this period and well into the twentieth century was that Conservatives were in favour of &quot;imperial preference&quot; (a protectionist system in which tariffs would be levied against imports from outside the British Empire) and strong political and legal links with Britain while Liberals promoted free trade and continentalism (that is closer ties to the United States) and greater independence from Britain.
Macdonald died in 1891 and, without his leadership, the Conservative coalition began to unravel under the pressure of sectarian tensions between Catholic French Canadians and British imperialists who tended to be anti-French and anti-Catholic. The government&#x27;s mis-handling of the grievances that aroused the Red River Rebellion and the North-West Rebellion, and its hanging of their leader Louis Riel), and the Manitoba Schools Question exacerbated tensions within the Conservative Party and suppressed much of the support among Quebecois for the Conservative party, a problem only smoothed over by the 1980s.

Free trade between Canada and the U.S. was the major issue of the 1911 election. Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals, in favour of increased trade with the U.S., were swept from power. Robert Borden led a new Tory administration that emphasised a revitalised National Policy and continued strong links to Britain. Borden had built a base in Quebec by allying with anti-Laurier Quebec nationalists, but, in government, tensions between Quebec nationalists and English Canadian imperialists made any grand coalition untenable.

==Borden and the Conservative revival==
World War I created a further strain as most Quebecers (plus pacifists and many workers, farmers and socialists across the country, especially immigrants) were unenthusiastic about Canadian involvement in what they saw as a foreign, and particularly British, conflict, while Borden&#x27;s supporters, most living in English Canada, supported Canada&#x27;s war effort and its policy of conscription of men for the war (see Conscription Crisis of 1917).

==The Unionist Party, 1917–1922==
==National Liberal and Conservative Party==

The attempt to turn the Conservatives into a hegemonic party by merging with Liberal-Unionists failed as most Liberals either joined the new Progressive Party of Canada or rejoined the Liberals under its new leader William Lyon Mackenzie King. One critical issue in this split was free trade - farmers were particularly hostile to Tory tariff policy and free trade was a key issue in the creation of the Progressives while the Conscription Crisis destroyed any remaining Conservative base in Quebec for generations, leaving them with even less support than they had before the Union government.

Borden&#x27;s successor, Arthur Meighen formally attempted to make the Unionist coalition permanent by creating the &quot;National Liberal and Conservative Party&quot; but most Liberals ended up returning to their old party and some Conservatives balked at what they saw as an attempt to destroy the Conservative Party. John Hampden Burnham, MP for Peterborough West, quit the government caucus to sit as an Independent Conservative and resigned his seat in order to contest it in a by-election on his position.

Meighen&#x27;s party was defeated by the Liberals in the election of 1921 coming in third behind the Progressives. At March 1922 caucus meeting the party voted to revert to its original name of the Liberal-Conservative Party.

The Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1925 election. The Conservatives won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, but King was able to stay in power with the support of the Progressives and form a minority government. King&#x27;s government was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons within months and Prime Minister King asked Governor General Byng to call a new election, but Byng refused and asked Meighen to form a government.

Meighen&#x27;s government was defeated three days after taking office by a vote in the Commons, leaving no choice but a new election. The general election produced a Liberal victory. Wiseman argues that Liberals emphasized Canadian nationalism while Conservatives &quot;exuded British imperialist pride&quot;. The &quot;King–Byng Affair&quot; played primarily to Canadian nationalist sentiment because it was felt the Governor General, a British government appointee, had overstepped his bounds and that this was a sign of excessive British influence in Canadian politics. The political impact of the King–Byng Affair therefore favoured the Liberals.

==Bennett and the Great Depression==
Meighen was replaced as Tory leader by R. B. Bennett, a millionaire Calgary businessman at the 1927 leadership convention, the first time a Tory leader was chosen by this method. Bennett led the Conservatives to power in the 1930 election, largely as a result of the inability of the Liberal government (or any government in the western world) to deal with the Great Depression. Bennett promised to end the economic crisis in three days by implementing the old Conservative policy of high tariffs and imperial preference. 
When this policy failed to generate the desired result Bennett&#x27;s government had no alternative plan. The party&#x27;s pro-business, pro-bank inclinations provided no relief to the millions of unemployed who were now becoming increasingly desperate and agitated. The Conservatives seemed indecisive and unable to cope and rapidly lost the confidence of Canadians becoming a focus of hatred, ridicule and contempt. Car owners who could no longer afford gasoline reverted to having their vehicles pulled by horses and dubbed them &quot;Bennett buggies&quot;.

R. B. Bennett faced pressure for radical reforms from within and without the party:
*The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), formed in 1932, prepared to fight its first election on a socialist program. The Social Credit movement was gaining supporters in the west and shocked the country by winning the Alberta provincial election and forming government in September, 1935. Bennett&#x27;s own government suffered a defection as his Trade minister, Henry Herbert Stevens, left the Conservatives to form the Reconstruction Party of Canada when Bennett refused to enact Stevens&#x27; plans for drastic economic reform and government intervention in the economy to deal with the crisis.

Bennett attempted to prevent social disorder by evacuating the unemployed to relief camps far away from the cities but this only exacerbated social tensions leading to the &quot;On-to-Ottawa Trek&quot; of unemployed protesters who intended to ride the rails from Vancouver to Ottawa (gathering new members along the way) in order to bring their demands for relief to Bennett personally. The trek ended in Regina on July 1, 1935, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, on orders from the Prime Minister, attacked a public meeting of 3,000 strikers leaving two dead and dozens injured.

In desperation, Bennett had attempted to save his government by reversing its &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies and, belatedly, implementing &quot;Bennett&#x27;s New Deal&quot; based on the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Bennett proposed progressive income taxation, a minimum wage, a maximum for work week hours, unemployment insurance, health insurance, an expanded pension program, and grants to farmers. The Conservatives&#x27; conversion to the concept of a welfare state came too late, and the Conservatives were routed in the October 1935 election, winning only 40 seats to 173 for Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals.

The Bennett years left the Conservatives in the worst shape they had ever been – not only did enmity towards the Conservatives continue in Quebec as a legacy of the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but they were now reviled in the West for their perceived insensitivity to the needs of farmers in the Dust Bowl and Westerners turned to Social Credit or the CCF making the Conservatives their fourth choice. The Conservatives would have to wait twenty years before their fortunes in Western Canada revived.

==National Government label==
Bennett&#x27;s successor, Robert Manion, was chosen at the 1938 leadership convention which also officially changed the name of the party from the Liberal-Conservative Party to the National Conservative Party. The Conservatives fought the 1940 election under Manion with a different name, &quot;National Government&quot;.

With the election taking place during World War II, the party ran on a platform of forming a wartime national unity government. Manion proposed to have Liberal and Labour supporters of the coalition concept run as &quot;National Government&quot; candidates nominated through open riding conventions in which members of any party would be allowed to vote. The concept did not pan out and, in practice, the National Government candidates were all Conservatives. Despite the new name, the party failed to gain any seats, and Manion was personally defeated in his riding.

The idea for running under a &quot;National Government&quot; platform was likely inspired by the Union Government which the Conservatives formed during World War I in coalition with some dissident Liberals.

==Decline and reinvention as Progressive Conservatives==
After Manion&#x27;s defeat, the Conservatives again turned to Arthur Meighen for leadership. Senator Meighen was appointed the party&#x27;s leader for the duration of the war in November 1941 by a unanimous vote at a national conference of several hundred party delegates after a motion to hold a leadership convention was defeated. He resigned from the Senate and attempted to enter the House of Commons from a safe Conservative seat but was trounced by the CCF in a February 1942 by-election in York South. His party&#x27;s agitation for a re-enactment of conscription in World War II only further alienated Quebec from the Conservatives. Meighen resigned as leader following his defeat.

Later that year, the Conservatives attempted to broaden their base by electing Manitoba Progressive Premier John Bracken as their new leader at the 1942 leadership convention. Bracken agreed to become the party&#x27;s leader on the condition that it change its name to the &quot;Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&quot;.

<text>A Doctor of Science (; most commonly abbreviated DSc or ScD) is a science doctorate awarded in a number of countries throughout the world.

== Africa ==

=== Algeria and Morocco ===
In Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia, all universities accredited by the state award a &quot;Doctorate&quot; in all fields of science and humanities, equivalent to a PhD in the United Kingdom or United States.

Some universities in these four North African countries award a &quot;Doctorate of the State&quot; in some fields of study and science. A &quot;Doctorate of the State&quot; is slightly higher in esteem than a regular doctorate, and is awarded after performing additional in-depth post-doctorate research or achievement.

== Asia ==

=== Japan ===

Similarly to in the US and most of Europe, Japanese universities offer both the PhD and the ScD as initial doctorates in science.

=== India ===
In India only a few prestigious universities offer ScD/DSc in science which is obtained in Graduate School after satisfactory evaluation of knowledge, research accomplishment, and a doctoral defence. The oldest institute to award a DSc degree in India is Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta.

=== Thailand ===
Higher education institutes in Thailand generally grant PhD as a doctoral research degree, some universities including Chulalongkorn University award DSc. In exception, Mahidol University can grant both PhD and DSc. Doctoral students in Faculty of Science are always awarded PhD, but some other programs award DSc.

=== Uzbekistan ===
DSc or PhD degrees are awarded after dissertation and fulfilling the required publication number. In order to qualify for DSc, one is required to have attained a PhD. The higher education institutes in Uzbekistan also grant DSc degrees. As an example, the National University of Uzbekistan and the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences offer DSc in various fields.

== Europe ==

=== Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ===
In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking region of Switzerland, the most common doctoral degrees in Natural Sciences are the following:
* Dr. rer. nat.: Doctor rerum naturalium, literally &quot;Doctor of the things of nature&quot;
* Dr. rer. medic.: Doctor rerum medicarum, Doctor of medical sciences
* Dr. sc. med.: Doctor scientiarum medicarum, Doctor of science in medicine
* Dr. sc. nat.: Doktor der Naturwissenschaften, Doctor of Natural Sciences
* Dr. sc. ETH: Doktor der Naturwissenschaften ETH, Doctor of Natural Sciences, awarded by ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
* Dr. phil. nat.: Doctor philosophiae naturalis, used only by Goethe University Frankfurt instead of Dr rer. nat; Doctor of Natural Sciences, awarded by Swiss universities.
* Dr.-Ing.: Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften (Doctor of Engineering), awarded by German universities in areas of technology and engineering.
* Dr. mont.: Doctor rerum montanarum, awarded by the University of Leoben instead of Dr. techn.
* Dr. techn.: Doctor technicae, awarded by Austrian technical universities.
* Dr. nat. techn.: Doctor rerum naturalium technicarum, awarded by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna instead of Dr. techn.

In these countries there are some related doctoral degrees with very similar names, these are the:

* Dr. sc. agr.: Doctor scientiarum agrariarum, Doctor of Agricultural science
* Dr. sc. hum.: Doctor scientiarum humanarum, Doctor of Humanistic Sciences
* Dr. sc. inf.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum, Doctor of Science in Informatics
* Dr. sc. inf. med.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum medicæ, Doctor of Science in Medical Informatics
* Dr. sc. inf. biomed.: Doctor scientiarum informaticarum biomedicæ, Doctor of Science in Biomedical Informatics
* Dr. sc. math.: Doctor scientiarum mathematicarum, Doctor of Mathematics
* Dr. scient. med.: Doctor scientiæ medicæ, Doctor of Medical Sciences
* Dr. sc. mus.: Doctor scientiae musicae, Doctor of Musicology
* Dr. sc. oec.: Doctor scientiarum oeconomicarum, Doctor of Economics
* Dr. sc. pol.: Doctor scientiarum politicarum, Doctor of Political Sciences
* Dr. rer. pol.: Doctor rerum politicarum, Doctor of economics, business administration, or political science
* Dr. sc. soc.: Doctor scientiae socialis, Doctor of Social Sciences

All of these doctoral degrees are equivalent to the PhD or ScD of the American system. Until German Reunification, universities in East Germany also awarded the Dr Sc. However, the East German Dr Sc was not equivalent to the PhD since it was adopted to replace the German Habilitation and therefore was equivalent to this higher-level qualification. After reunification the Habilitation was reintroduced at universities in Eastern Germany.

The procedure of habilitation is normally required to receive officially the &quot;venia docendi&quot;, which entitles the candidate to lecture at universities (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;, for men, or &quot;Privatdozentin&quot;, for women). The academic degree after the successful habilitation is e.g. Dr. rer. nat. habil., by adding the suffix &quot;habil.&quot; to the earlier received Doctors degree.

In Switzerland, the Dr sc. is a doctoral degree awarded only by the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (EPFL and ETHZ), the University of Fribourg and the Department of Informatics of the University of Zurich. The Swiss Dr sc., like the DSc in the US, is equivalent to the PhD. It is earned with the approval of a committee on the basis of original research, publications, and extensive applied professional contributions and is awarded in doctoral level science and technology programs. Since 2004 the Dr sc. is the only doctoral degree awarded by the ETH Zurich. The awards the degree &quot;Docteur ès sciences&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Dr ès sc.&quot;and translated into English as PhD.

=== Poland ===
In Poland higher doctorate is &quot;Habilitation&quot; (habilitated doctor, doctor with habilitation) ( or in Polish) is the degree higher than PhD and it is awarded for substantial accomplishments in academic teaching, research and service after getting the PhD degree (usually up to 8 years of original research and multiple publications in peer reviewed scientific journals and monograph, habilitation dissertation after PhD). It is similar to habilitation degree in Germany and Austria. It is also similar (in terms of requirements) to associate professor with tenure.

After achieving high degrees and rich research or artistic achievements, including as an academic teacher, lecturer, one can apply to become a professor.

The President of Poland awards a scientist also in engineering (engineer) or artist the scientific title of professor () and the title of professor of art (), respectively, in recognition of their scientific achievements and contributions to science, technology, and respectively their achievements in art and contributions to art. These titles are not academic/scientific or art degrees. However, possession of high degrees is required to receive the title.
Habilitation has been a mandatory requirement for many years to apply for professorship in Poland.

=== United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan and the Commonwealth ===

In Ireland, the United Kingdom and the countries of the Commonwealth, such as Australia and India (in the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay), the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD) is one of the Higher Doctorates. In some older universities it typically has precedence after Divinity, Laws or Civil Law, Medicine, and Letters, and above Music. The degree is conferred on a member of the university who has a proven record of internationally recognised scholarship. A candidate for the degree will usually be required to submit a selection of their publications that follow a consistent theme to the board of the appropriate faculty, which will decide if the candidate merits this accolade. Quite often they will need to be a doctoral graduate of at least ten years&#x27; standing and have a substantial research association with the awarding university.

The first University to admit an individual to this degree was the University of London in 1860. In 1893 Maria Gordon (née Ogilvie) was the first woman to receive this degree.

In former times the doctorate in science was regarded as a greater distinction than a professorial chair and hence a professor who was also a DSc would be known as Doctor. The Doctor of Science may also be awarded as an honorary degree, that is, given to individuals who have made extensive contributions to a particular field and not for specific academic accomplishments. It is usual to signify this by adding DSc h.c. (for &quot;honoris causa&quot;).

=== Other European Union countries ===
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; (DrSc behind the name), established in 1953, is equivalent to the degree of Doctor of Science in the sense in which the DSc is used in the Commonwealth. It is the highest academic qualification, different from both PhD and PhDr. titles. In the Czech Republic, DrSc has not been awarded since 2001; instead, since 2006, a &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; degree (DSc behind the name) has been awarded, not by universities but by the Czech Academy of Sciences mostly for research in the field of natural or formal science. In Slovakia, &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; (DrSc) is awarded by the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

In Hungary, &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; (DSc) is a higher doctorate degree and it is awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

In Finland, most doctoral degrees awarded in the fields of natural sciences, technology and economics are termed DSc degrees in English, with a suffix indicating the field of study. However, there is no translation of the term &quot;Doctor of Science&quot; to Finnish. For example, the proper translation for the doctorate in technology (&quot;tekniikan tohtori&quot;) would be DSc (Tech), whereas a doctorate in economics and business administration (&quot;kauppatieteiden tohtori&quot;) would be translated as DSc (Econ). When conversing or writing in English, the prefix &quot;Dr&quot; may be used to address a holder of a doctoral degree awarded in Finland. The degrees are equivalent to &quot;filosofian tohtori&quot; (FT, English: PhD), but FT is usually awarded only in general sciences, not in specializations like engineering, economics or medicine.

In France, the Doctor of Sciences degree (&quot;doctorat ès sciences&quot; also called &quot;doctorat d&#x27;État&quot;) was a higher doctorate in the fields of experimental and natural sciences, superseded in 1984 by the habilitation.

In Denmark, Dr Scient. is a higher doctorate.

In Bulgaria, &quot;Doctor&quot; (PhD) is the highest education level and first science degree. Doctor of Sciences (DrSc) is the second and the highest science degree.

=== Russia and other post-communist states ===

In Russia, the status of Russian &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; (literally &#x27;Doctor of Sciences&#x27;) is considered a higher scientific degree. The equivalent to PhD is &quot;Candidat Nauk&quot;

=== Other European countries ===
In the former Yugoslavia, (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Slovenia, North Macedonia), title &quot;doktor nauka&quot; or &quot;doktor znanosti&quot; (literally &quot;doctor of science&quot;) is used in a much broader sense than DSc, simply referring to a field of academic study – from art history (&quot;doktor znanosti/nauka povijesti umjetnosti&quot;), philosophy (&quot;doktor znanosti/nauka filozofije&quot;), and literary studies (&quot;doktor znanosti/nauka književnosti&quot;) to hard sciences such as molecular biology (&quot;doktor znanosti/nauka molekularne biologije&quot;). It is therefore formally recognized as a PhD degree.

Starting in 2016, in Ukraine Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, ) is the highest education level and first science degree. &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; (DSc ) is the second and the highest science degree, awarded in recognition of a substantial contribution to scientific knowledge, origination of new directions and visions in science. Since 2016, a PhD degree is one of the prerequisites for heading a university department in Ukraine. 

In Belarus &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; (DSc, ) is the highest level of education that follows a PhD. Is awarded by The Higher Attestation Commission under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

== North America ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, the formally recognized traditional &quot;Doctor of Science&quot; is an academic research doctoral degree awarded by research universities. The academic research ScD (or DSc) is not higher than a PhD as is the case in some European countries.

The first North American ScD was inaugurated by Harvard University in 1872, when graduate studies first began at Harvard, and where the PhD and ScD degrees were introduced in the same year. The Doctor of Science research degree is earned with the formal dissertation defense and approval of a committee on the basis of original research and publications, and it is awarded predominantly in doctoral-level science programs, such as engineering, medical and health sciences, and health economics.

Although rarer than the Doctor of Philosophy, the Doctor of Science is awarded by institutions including:

* Harvard University
* Columbia University
*Chapman University
* Middle Georgia State University 
* Johns Hopkins University 
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
* Capitol Technology University
* Bowie State University 
* Towson University 
* Tulane University 
* University of Baltimore 
* Marymount University
* Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions
* Aspen University in Computer Science 
* University of Massachusetts Lowell in public health (epidemiology) 
* Jacksonville State University in emergency management
* Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership in Jewish studies.
* The George Washington University (although as of 2011 the university decided to offer only the more widely recognized PhD degree)

A few university doctoral research programs offer both the ScD and PhD degrees in the same academic field, such as Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with identical requirements for obtaining either. Research programs that offer the formal research ScD but not the PhD degree for a given field include several doctoral programs at Harvard University, Boston University, Capitol Technology University, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The University of Baltimore, School of Information Arts and Technologies offers an ScD degree in Information and Interaction Design, a program focused on usable design/user experience (UX) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).

There are programs where the ScD and PhD have different degree requirements, though the two degrees are officially considered equivalent. The Engineering school at Washington University in St. Louis, for example, requires four more graduate courses in the DSc program, which can be completed in one year in conjunction with research duties, while the PhD requires teaching assistance services. The Johns Hopkins University also offers both PhD and ScD in certain programs, with only minor differences in university administration of the degrees. In some institutions, the ScD has been converted to the PhD. For instance, the doctoral degree in biostatistics at Harvard recently converted from ScD to PhD, even though the doctoral degree structure and requirements have remained identical.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico the PhD level is considered a doctoral degree (level 8) similar to the doctorate degrees in Canada and the United States. The &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; degree is instead recognized as a &quot;Higher Degree&quot; (Grado Propio).

=== Costa Rica ===
In Costa Rica, doctorates are the highest academic degrees awarded by a university. They are focused on research and accessible only after the study of an academic Master&#x27;s degree (as opposed to a professional Master&#x27;s degree, intended for practical subjects). The University of Costa Rica, for example, offers a general &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; degree for students of all natural and exact sciences, a &quot;Doctor of Engineering&quot; degree for students of Engineering (in cooperation with the Costa Rica Institute of Technology), and a few other doctorate programs on applied sciences (for example, in Agricultural Sciences or Informatics).

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina the formal title &quot;Doctor of Science&quot; would be attributed to different fields of the hard or soft sciences. To get into an Argentine PhD program the applicant must have experience in research and at least an Engineering, Licentiate or master&#x27;s degree:

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil only the Doctor in Sciences (DSc) category is recognized as a higher doctorate, generally followed by the concentration area (program field).

This kind of doctorate is obtained in Graduate School after satisfactory evaluation of knowledge, research accomplishment, and thesis defense. This doctorate is comparable to a PhD program found in other countries. In the state of São Paulo, the doctorate title is the second highest academic title given by the state&#x27;s universities (University of São Paulo (USP), State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and São Paulo State University (UNESP)) and most Federal Universities, such as the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The highest academic title is the , which is not equivalent to the German Habilitation, since is not a requisite to be a professor in Brazilian universities, and German Habilitation is a requisite to be a professor in German universities. However, is a requisite to be promoted to Associate Professor / &quot;full&quot; Professor () at several of those public research Universities.

<doc id="430831" wikidata="Q3067869" url="?curid=430831" title="Federal Project Number One">
<text>Federal Project Number One, also referred to as Federal One (Fed One), is the collective name for a group of projects under the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal program in the United States. Of the $4.88 billion allocated by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, $27 million was approved for the employment of artists, musicians, actors and writers under the WPA&#x27;s Federal Project Number One. In its prime, Federal Project Number One employed up to 40,000 writers, musicians, artists and actors because, as Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins put it, &quot;Hell, they’ve got to eat, too&quot;. This project had two main principles: 1) that in time of need the artist, no less than the manual worker, is entitled to employment as an artist at the public expense and 2) that the arts, no less than business, agriculture, and labor, are and should be the immediate concern of the ideal commonwealth.

The five divisions of Federal One were these:

* Federal Art Project
* Federal Music Project
* Federal Theatre Project
* Federal Writers&#x27; Project 
* Historical Records Survey (originally part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project)

All projects were supposed to operate without discrimination regarding race, creed, color, religion, or political affiliation.

Federal Project Number One ended in 1939 when, under pressure from Congress, the theater project was cancelled and the other projects were required to rely on state funding and local sponsorship.

==Controversy==
Many people were opposed to government involvement in the arts. They feared that government funding and influence would lead to censorship and a violation of freedom of speech. Members of the House Un-American Activities Committee believed the program to be infiltrated by communists.

However, with support from Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt signed the executive order to create this project because the government wanted to support, as &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine stated, “the kind of raw cultural material—the raw material of new creative work—which is so necessary to artists and particularly to artists in a new country.”

==Legacy==
At its peak Federal One employed 40,000 writers, musicians, artists and actors and the Federal Writers&#x27; project had around 6,500 people on the WPA payroll. Many people benefitted from these programs and some FWP writers became famous, such as John Steinbeck and Zora Neale Hurston. These writers were considered to be federal writers. Furthermore, these projects also published books such as &quot;New York Panorama&quot; and the WPA &quot;Guide to New York City&quot;.

<doc id="430836" wikidata="Q7417057" url="?curid=430836" title="Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council">
<text>Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, or Sandwell Council, is the local authority of the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell in the West Midlands, England. It is a metropolitan borough council and provides the majority of local government services in the borough. The council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority since 2016.

The council has been under Labour majority control since 1979. It is based at the Council House in Oldbury.

==History==
The metropolitan district of Sandwell and its council were created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the combined area of the former county boroughs of Warley and West Bromwich, which were both abolished at the same time. It was the second major overhaul of local government structures in the area in eight years; the borough of Warley had only been created in 1966 as a merger of the old boroughs of Oldbury, Rowley Regis and Smethwick, whilst the borough of West Bromwich had been enlarged in 1966 to absorb the area of the abolished boroughs of Tipton and Wednesbury (along with more minor adjustments to the boundaries with other neighbours).

The new district was named Sandwell and it was one of the seven districts in the new metropolitan county of the West Midlands. The first election to the new council was held in 1973. For its first year the council acted as a shadow authority alongside the area&#x27;s outgoing authorities. The new metropolitan district and its council formally came into being on 1 April 1974, at which point the old districts and their councils were abolished. The metropolitan district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

From 1974 until 1986 the council was a lower-tier authority, with upper-tier functions provided by the West Midlands County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 and its functions passed to the county&#x27;s seven borough councils, including Sandwell, with some services provided through joint committees.

Since 2016 the council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which has been led by the directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands since 2017. The combined authority provides strategic leadership and co-ordination for certain functions across the county, but Sandwell Council continues to be responsible for most local government functions.

In 2022 the government appointed commissioners to oversee the operation of certain functions at the council due to concerns about its performance. The commissioners were withdrawn in 2024 following improvements to the way the council operated.

==Governance==
Sandwell Council provides metropolitan borough services. Some strategic functions in the area are provided by the West Midlands Combined Authority; the leader and deputy leader of the council sit on the board of the combined authority as Sandwell&#x27;s representatives. There no civil parishes in the borough.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 1979.

Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Sandwell. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1997 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2004, the council has comprised 72 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office.

==Premises==
The council&#x27;s headquarters are at the Council House on Freeth Street in the town centre of Oldbury. The building opened in 1989.
Prior to 1989, the council met and had its main offices at West Bromwich Town Hall, which had been completed in 1875 and had been the headquarters of the old West Bromwich Borough Council prior to 1974. Additional offices were spread across several buildings, including Smethwick Council House, which had been completed in 1907 for the old Smethwick Borough Council, and had subsequently been the headquarters of the short-lived Warley Borough Council between 1966 and 1974.

<doc id="430838" wikidata="Q2910784" url="?curid=430838" title="London deep-level shelters">
<text>The London deep-level shelters are eight deep-level air-raid shelters that were built under London Underground stations during World War II.

==Background==
Each shelter consists of a pair of parallel tunnels in diameter and long. Each tunnel is subdivided into two decks, and each shelter was designed to hold up to 8,000 people. It was planned that after the war the shelters would be used as part of new express tube lines paralleling parts of the existing Northern and Central lines. Existing tube lines typically had diameter running tunnels and about at stations; thus the shelter tunnels would not have been suitable as platform tunnels and were constructed at stations the new lines would have bypassed. However, they would have been suitable as running tunnels for main-line size trains. (One existing tube, the Northern City Line opened in 1904, used a similar size of tunnel for this reason, although in fact main-line trains did not use it until 1976.)

Ten shelters were originally planned, holding 100,000 people — 10,000 in each shelter. However, the final capacity was around 8,000 people in each shelter, and only eight were completed: at Chancery Lane station on the Central line and Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Stockwell, Clapham North, Clapham Common, and Clapham South on the Northern line. The other two were to be at St Paul&#x27;s station on the Central line, which was not built because of concerns about the stability of the buildings above, and at Oval station on the Northern line, not built because of difficult ground conditions encountered as the work started. The working shaft for the shelter at Oval now functions as a ventilation shaft for the station.

The shelters were started in 1940 during the Blitz in response to public demand to shelter in the London Underground stations. However, they were not completed until 1942 after the Blitz was over, so they were initially all used by the government, but as bombing intensified five of them were opened to the public in 1944: Stockwell, Clapham North, Camden Town, Belsize Park and Clapham South. The Goodge Street shelter was used by General Eisenhower, and the Chancery Lane shelter was used as a communications centre.

== Post-war use ==
After the war, the Goodge Street shelter continued to be used by the army until a fire on the night of 21 May 1956, after which the government decided the shelters were not suitable for use by large numbers of the public or military.
The Chancery Lane shelter was converted into Kingsway telephone exchange.
In 1948 the Clapham South shelter was used to house 200 of the first immigrants from the West Indies who had arrived on the HMT &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; for four weeks until they found their own accommodation. In 1951, it became the Festival Hotel providing cheap stay for visitors to the Festival of Britain, but was closed after the aforementioned fire in the Goodge Street shelter. The shelter was used for archival storage for some years, but is now a Grade II listed building with pre-booked tours arranged by the London Transport Museum via its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme.

All the shelters, with the exception of Chancery Lane, were sold by the government to Transport for London in 1998.
The Clapham Common shelter was leased in 2014 by the Zero Carbon Food company, who use the shelter as a hydroponic farm.

==In popular culture==
The Goodge Street shelter appeared in studio mock-up form in the 1968 BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;. The surface entrance to the Goodge Street shelter appears as itself in the 1988 feature film &quot;Hidden City&quot;, written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, although interiors were actually shot at Clapham South.

The Camden Town shelter was used to represent parts of Oval tube station in the 1976 two-part story &quot;The Lights of London&quot; in the BBC television series &quot;Survivors&quot;. The director of the second episode was Pennant Roberts, who subsequently directed the 1977 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Sun Makers&quot;, in which the same shelter was used for scenes set in tunnels under Pluto. Roberts subsequently worked on the BBC series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, in which the shelter was used for the interior of the titular artificial planet in the 1980 story &quot;Ultraworld&quot;, although the episode itself was directed by Vere Lorrimer. The shelter was also used to represent parts of a secret underground facility in the vicinity of Down Street tube station in the 2005 feature film &quot;Creep&quot;.

Reference is a made to a fictional deep-level air-raid shelter at Holland Park tube station in Ben Aaronovitch’s novel Whispers Under Ground, third in the Rivers of London series.

In the penultimate mission of the video game &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot;, the Stockwell deep-level shelter is featured as the hideout of the main antagonist, Zero Day.

The Kingsway Telephone Exchange features prominently in the early part of the apocalyptic horror novel &quot;Domain&quot; (1984) by British author James Herbert.

<doc id="430840" wikidata="Q1567505" url="?curid=430840" title="The Awakening (Chopin novel)">
<text>The Awakening is a novel by Kate Chopin, first published on 22 April 1899. Set in New Orleans and on the Louisiana Gulf coast at the end of the 19th century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle between her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South. It is one of the earlier American novels that focuses on women&#x27;s issues utilizing narrative techniques. It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism, generating a mixed reaction from contemporary readers and critics.

The novel&#x27;s blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes &quot;The Awakening&quot; a precursor of American modernist literature; it prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern works of Faulkner, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams.

==Summary==
The novel opens with the Pontellier family—Léonce, a New Orleans businessman of French Louisiana Creole heritage; his wife Edna; and their sons Etienne and Raoul as they take a vacation on Grand Isle at a resort on the Gulf of Mexico managed by Madame Lebrun and her sons Robert and Victor.

Edna spends a lot of her time with her close friend Adèle Ratignolle, who cheerily and boisterously reminds Edna of her duties as a wife and mother. At Grand Isle, Edna eventually forms a connection with Robert Lebrun, a charming, earnest young man who actively seeks Edna&#x27;s attention and affections. When they fall in love, Robert senses the doomed nature of such a relationship and flees to Mexico under the guise of pursuing a nameless business venture. The narrative focus moves to Edna&#x27;s shifting emotions as she reconciles her maternal duties with her desire for social freedom and for Robert.

When summer vacation ends, the Pontelliers return to New Orleans. Edna gradually reassesses her priorities and takes an active role in her own happiness. She starts to isolate herself from New Orleans society and to withdraw from some of the duties traditionally associated with motherhood. Léonce eventually talks to a doctor about diagnosing his wife, fearing she is losing her mental faculties. The doctor advises Léonce to let her be and assures him that things will return to normal.

When Léonce prepares to travel to New York City on business, he sends the boys to his mother. Being left home alone for an extended period gives Edna physical and emotional room to breathe and reflect on various aspects of her life. While her husband is still away, she moves out of their home and into a small bungalow nearby and begins a dalliance with Alcée Arobin, a persistent suitor with a reputation for being free with his affections. Edna is shown as a sexual being for the first time in the novel, but the affair proves awkward and emotionally fraught.

Edna also reaches out to Mademoiselle Reisz, a gifted pianist whose playing is renowned but who maintains a generally hermetic existence. Her playing had moved Edna profoundly earlier in the novel. Mademoiselle Reisz focuses her life on music and herself instead of on society&#x27;s expectations, acting as a foil to Adèle Ratignolle, who encourages Edna to conform. Reisz is in contact with Robert while he is in Mexico, receiving letters from him regularly. Edna begs Reisz to reveal their contents, which she does, proving to Edna that Robert is thinking about her.

Eventually, Robert returns to New Orleans. At first aloof (and finding excuses not to be near Edna), he eventually confesses his passionate love for her. He admits that the business trip to Mexico was an excuse to escape a relationship that never could work.

Edna is called away to help Adèle with a difficult childbirth. Adèle pleads with Edna to think about her children and what she would be forgoing if she did not behave appropriately. When Edna returns home, she finds a note from Robert stating that he has left forever because he loves her too much to shame her by engaging in a relationship with a married woman.

In devastated shock, Edna rushes back to Grand Isle, where she had first met Robert Lebrun. Edna seeks escape by committing suicide, drowning herself in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

==Main characters==
*Edna Pontellier – a respectable Presbyterian from Kentucky, living in Creole society in Louisiana. She rebels against conventional expectations and discovers an identity independent from her role as a wife and mother.
*Léonce Pontellier – Edna&#x27;s husband, a successful businessman who is oblivious to his wife&#x27;s unhappiness.
*Mademoiselle Reisz – Her character symbolizes what Edna could have been if she had grown old and had been independent from her family. Despite viewing Reisz as disagreeable, Edna sees her as an inspiration to her own &quot;awakening.&quot;
*Madame Adèle Ratignolle – Edna&#x27;s friend, who represents the 19th-century woman as she is totally devoted to her husband and children.
*Alcée Arobin – known for seducing married women, he pursues a short-lived affair with Edna, satisfying her while her husband is away.
*Robert Lebrun – has a history of charming women he cannot have but finds something different with Edna and falls in love. Robert&#x27;s flirting with Edna catalyzes her &quot;awakening&quot;, and she sees in him what has been missing in her marriage.

==Style==
Kate Chopin&#x27;s narrative style in &quot;The Awakening&quot; can be categorized as naturalism. Chopin&#x27;s novel bears the hallmarks of French short story writer Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s style: a perceptive focus on human behavior and the complexities of social structures. This demonstrates Chopin&#x27;s admiration for Maupassant, yet another example of the enormous influence Maupassant exercised on 19th-century literary realism.

However, Chopin&#x27;s style could more accurately be described as a hybrid that captures contemporary narrative currents and looks forward to various trends in Southern and European literature.

Mixed into Chopin&#x27;s overarching 19th-century realism is an incisive and often humorous skewering of upper-class pretension, reminiscent of contemporaries such as Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Edith Wharton, and George Bernard Shaw.

Also evident in &quot;The Awakening&quot; is the future of the Southern novel as a distinct genre, not only in setting and subject matter but in narrative style. Chopin&#x27;s lyrical portrayal of her protagonist&#x27;s shifting emotions is a narrative technique that Faulkner would expand in novels like &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;. Chopin portrays her experiences of the Creole lifestyle, in which women were under strict rules and limited to the role of wife and mother, which influenced her &quot;local color&quot; fiction and focus on the Creole culture. Chopin adopted this style in her early short stories and her first novel &quot;At Fault&quot;, which also deals with some of the issues of Creole lifestyle. By using characters of French descent, she was able to get away with publishing these stories because the characters were viewed as &quot;foreign&quot;, without her readers being as shocked as they were when Edna Pontellier, a white Protestant, strays from the expectations of society.

The plot anticipated the stories of Eudora Welty and Flannery O&#x27;Connor and the plays of William Inge, and Edna Pontellier&#x27;s emotional crises and her eventual tragic fall look ahead to the complex female characters of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s plays. Chopin&#x27;s life, particularly in terms of having her own sense of identity—aside from men and her children—inspired &quot;The Awakening&quot;. Her upbringing also shaped her views as she lived with her widowed mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, all of whom were intellectual, independent women. After her father was killed on All Saints&#x27; Day and her brother died from typhoid on Mardi Gras, Chopin became skeptical of religion, a view that she presents through Edna, who finds church &quot;suffocating&quot;. Being widowed and left with six children to look after influenced Chopin&#x27;s writing, which she began at this time. Emily Toth argues against the view that Chopin was ostracized from St. Louis after the publication of &quot;The Awakening&quot;, stating that many St. Louis women praised her; male critics condemned her novel.

Aspects of Chopin&#x27;s style also prefigure the intensely lyrical and experimental style of novelists such as Virginia Woolf and the unsentimental focus on female intellectual and emotional growth in the novels of Sigrid Undset and Doris Lessing. Chopin&#x27;s most important stylistic legacy is the detachment of the narrator.

==Topics==

===Solitude===

One of the more prominent themes in &quot;The Awakening&quot; is solitude. As referenced previously, Chopin&#x27;s work once contained the word in its title when it was originally called &quot;A Solitary Soul&quot;.

Through Edna Pontellier&#x27;s journey, Kate Chopin sought to highlight the different ways that a woman could be in solitude because of the expectations of motherhood, ethnicity, marriage, social norms, and gender. Chopin presents Edna&#x27;s autonomous separation from society and friends as individually empowering while still examining the risks of self-exploration and subsequent loneliness. In an attempt to shed her societal role of mother and wife, Edna takes charge of her limited life and makes changes to better discover her true self. For example, Edna leaves her husband and moves into a new house to live by herself, a controversial action because a true woman never would leave her husband. Although Edna&#x27;s journey ultimately leads to an unsustainable solitude due to lack of societal support, &quot;her death indicates self-possession rather than a retreat from a dilemma.&quot; She takes control over what she still has agency over: her body and her self.

By making Edna&#x27;s experiences critically central to the novel, Chopin is able to sound a cautionary note about society&#x27;s capacity to support women&#x27;s liberation. As shown through Edna&#x27;s depressing emotional journey, isolation, and eventual suicide, Chopin claims that the social norms and traditional gender roles of the 19th century could not tolerate an independent woman. Chopin&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening&quot; questions the value of solitude and autonomy within a society unable to positively sustain women&#x27;s freedom.

===Gender roles and social constraints===

The themes of romance and death in &quot;The Awakening&quot; aid Chopin&#x27;s feminist intent of illuminating the restrictive and oppressive roles of women in Victorian society. Edna&#x27;s longing for Robert Lebrun and affair with Alcée Arobin explicitly show Edna&#x27;s rejection of her prescribed roles as housewife and mother as she awakens to her sexuality and sense of self. Edna has an emotional affair with Robert, who leaves in order to avoid shaming her in society. Afterward, Edna has a physical affair with Alcée. Through these affairs, Edna exercises power outside of her marriage and experiences sexual longing for the first time. However, through these affairs Edna also discovers that no matter which man she is with, there is no escape from the general oppression women face; Edna&#x27;s society has no place for a woman like her, as she must either be an exemplary housewife and mother like Adèle Ratignolle or an isolated outsider like Mademoiselle Reisz. Edna&#x27;s suicide at the end of the novel exemplifies how few options women had in society at this time. Leaving society all together was Edna&#x27;s way of rejecting and escaping this oppressive dichotomy. One critic stated that the book leaves one sick of human nature, and another one stated that the book is morbid because it is about an unholy love that tested traditional gender roles of the late 1800s and that the book belongs to the overworked field of sex fiction. When the book was re-evaluated years later, it was considered a canonical contribution to feminist literature. This later view resulted in many other women writers of the 19th being re-evaluated.

===Musical romanticism===
When Edna first hears Mademoiselle Reisz play, she develops a strong appreciation toward music and art. At the ball at the Grand Isle, when Edna is seen with Robert listening to Mademoiselle Reisz play a piece by Frédéric Chopin (who is not related to Kate Chopin), Edna is affected tremendously. Camastra states that

 The emotional fluidity of music is not solely responsible for Edna&#x27;s evolving constitution. Such an assertion would deny any individual agency on her part and misrepresent the synthesis of artistic form and content that serves as a musical parallel to Edna&#x27;s experiences. Chopin&#x27;s music successfully integrates the opposition of &quot;the &#x27;classical&#x27; concern for form and the &#x27;romantic&#x27; urge of inspiration.&quot; Edna ostensibly adheres to prescribed feminine standards before witnessing an iconoclastic revelation of her senses.

Therefore, due to Edna&#x27;s fascination with romantic melodies, it causes Edna to &quot;awaken&quot; and desire new things to free herself from confinement. The theme of solitude also is related with musical romanticism. Camastra states that Edna comes to the same despondency to which the writer Maupassant arrived. Maupassant attempts to commit suicide a few months before his actual death in 1893. Maupassant fictionalized spirits and Frederic Chopin internalized them in his music. In &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Edna is fascinated by the musical poet&#x27;s repertoire, and she is forced to confront the spectral presence of a deeper yearning for something that eventually drives her to commit suicide.

==Publication and critical reception==
&quot;The Awakening&quot; was particularly controversial upon publication in 1899. Although the novel never was technically banned, it was censored. Chopin&#x27;s novel was considered immoral for its comparatively frank depictions of female sexual desire and for its depiction of a protagonist who chafed against social norms and established gender roles. The public reaction to the novel was similar to the protests that greeted the publication and performance of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s landmark drama &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1879), a work with which &quot;The Awakening&quot; shares an almost identical theme. Both contain a female protagonist who abandons her husband and children for self-fulfilment.

However, published reviews ran the gamut from outright condemnation to the recognition of &quot;The Awakening&quot; as an important work of fiction by a gifted practitioner. Divergent reactions of two newspapers in Kate Chopin&#x27;s hometown of St. Louis reflect these polarities. The &quot;St. Louis Republic&quot; labeled the novel &quot;poison&quot; and &quot;too strong a drink for moral babes&quot;, and the &quot;St. Louis Mirror&quot; stated &quot;One would fain beg the gods, in pure cowardice, for sleep unending rather than to know what an ugly, cruel, loathsome Monster Passion can be when, like a tiger, it slowly awakens. This is the kind of awakening that impresses the reader in Mrs. Chopin&#x27;s heroine.&quot; Later in the same year, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; praised the novel in &quot;A St. Louis Woman Who Has Turned Fame Into Literature.&quot;

Some reviews clucked in disappointment at Chopin&#x27;s choice of subject: &quot;It was not necessary for a writer of so great refinement and poetic grace to enter the over-worked field of sex-fiction&quot; (&quot;Chicago Times Herald&quot;). Others mourned the loss of good taste; &quot;The Nation&quot; claimed that the book opened with high expectations, &quot;remembering the author&#x27;s agreeable short stories,&quot; and closed with &quot;real disappointment,&quot; suggesting public dissatisfaction with the chosen topic: &quot;we need not have been put to the unpleasantness of reading about her.&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot; also called Chopin &quot;one more clever writer gone wrong.&quot;

Some reviews indulged in outright vitriol as when &quot;Public Opinion&quot; stated &quot;We are well-satisfied when Mrs. Pontellier deliberately swims out to her death in the waters of the gulf.&quot;

Chopin&#x27;s work also garnered qualified, but still negative, reviews. &quot;The Dial&quot; called &quot;The Awakening&quot; a &quot;poignant spiritual tragedy&quot; with the caveat that the novel was &quot;not altogether wholesome in its tendencies.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Congregationalist&quot; called Chopin&#x27;s novel &quot;a brilliant piece of writing&quot; but concludes &quot;We cannot commend it.&quot; In the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot;, Willa Cather set &quot;The Awakening&quot; alongside &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s equally notorious and equally reviled novel of suburban ennui and unapologetic adultery—but Cather was no more impressed with the heroine than were most of her contemporaries. Cather &quot;hope[d] that Miss Chopin will devote that flexible, iridescent style of hers to a better cause.&quot;

==Legacy and historical context==
Chopin did not write another novel after &quot;The Awakening&quot; and had difficulty publishing stories after its release. Emily Toth believes this disruption was in part because Chopin &quot;went too far: Edna&#x27;s sensuality was too much for the male gatekeepers.&quot; Chopin&#x27;s next book was cancelled, and health and family problems consumed her. When she died five years later, she was on her way to being forgotten. Per Seyersted, a Norwegian literary scholar, rediscovered Chopin in the 1960s, leading &quot;The Awakening&quot; to be regarded as a landmark in feminist fiction.

In 1991 &quot;The Awakening&quot; was dramatized in the film &quot;Grand Isle&quot;, directed by Mary Lambert and starring Kelly McGillis as Edna, Jon DeVries as Leonce, and Adrian Pasdar as Robert.

In &quot;Wish Someone Would Care&quot;, the ninth episode of the first season of the HBO series &quot;Treme&quot; that aired in 2010, professor Creighton Bernette (John Goodman) assigns the novel to his class and briefly discusses it with his students.

&quot;The Awakening&quot; serves as a structural and thematic background for Robert Stone&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Children of Light,&quot; in which an assortment of doomed characters, including an alcoholic writer and a mentally unstable actress, gather in Mexico to make a film of Chopin&#x27;s novel.

In the 1890s, when Chopin wrote &quot;The Awakening&quot;, a range of social changes and tensions that brought &quot;the woman question&quot; into public discussion influenced Chopin&#x27;s novel.

Louisiana, the setting for &quot;The Awakening&quot;, was a largely Catholic state where divorce was extremely rare, and women were expected to stay loyal and faithful to their husbands, and men to their wives. This explains some reactions &quot;The Awakening&quot; received in 1899.

Linda Wagner-Martin writes &quot;sometimes being considered &#x27;European&#x27; (or at least certainly &#x27;French&#x27;) rather than American, these types of works were condemned for the very ambivalence that made them brilliant and prescient pieces of writing.&quot; Chopin&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening&quot; and other novels in the 19th and early 20th centuries were censored due to their perceived immorality, which included sexual impropriety, an argument supported by the initial reviews of the book found in newspapers at the time. Nevertheless, Margo Culley stresses that Kate Chopin was not the only woman challenging gender ideologies in this period; writing a novel brought her views into public prominence.

One of the main issues that 19th-century readers had with the novel was the idea of a woman&#x27;s abandoning her duties as a wife and mother. For example, an etiquette/advice book of the time proclaimed: &quot;if she has the true mother-heart the companionship of her children will be the society which she will prefer above that of all others.&quot;

<doc id="430849" wikidata="Q44458" url="?curid=430849" title="Paul Breitner">
<text>Paul Breitner (; born 5 September 1951) is a German former professional footballer who played as a midfielder and left-back. Considered one of the best full-backs and midfielders of all time, and one of the best players of his era, Breitner was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team. In 2004 he was named one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration.

Breitner was capped 48 times for West Germany and was an integral part of the team that won the 1974 FIFA World Cup, scoring in the final. 

He also scored in the final of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, making him one of only five players to have scored in two different World Cup final matches, the others being Pelé, Vavá, Zinedine Zidane and Kylian Mbappé.

He was known for his partnerships with Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck and Berti Vogts in defence for the national team, and his midfield combination with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge for Bayern Munich.

Breitner has been working as a commentator, pundit and columnist in Germany since retiring and is also an advisor to the Bayern management board.

==Playing career==
Breitner&#x27;s football career lasted from 1970 until 1983, mainly playing for Bayern Munich (1970–74 and 1978–83) and Real Madrid (1974–77), with one season playing for Eintracht Braunschweig. His early success was as a free roaming left back, as likely to score from the right midfield as to stop an attacker in his own penalty area. Later in his career he moved to midfield and became one of the top midfielders through the early 1980s.

The early peak of Breitner&#x27;s long and successful career was at age 21 in 1972 as part of the winning German European Championship team. Two years later he won the 1974 FIFA World Cup. The final was played in Munich against the Netherlands, and Breitner scored the first German goal on a penalty kick. In the final, he, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck and Berti Vogts formed a formidable unit at the back, their resolute defense preventing the Dutch from getting many scoring chances. He moved to Real Madrid for a fee of over 1 million Deutsche Marks following the World Cup and withdrew from the West German squad, remaining off the side until enticed to return by Jupp Derwall in 1981. Breitner is one of only five footballers to have achieved the feat of scoring in two different World Cup final matches, sharing that honour with Pelé, Vavá, Zinedine Zidane, and Kylian Mbappe. He achieved this in 1974 against the Netherlands and in 1982 against Italy.
During his club career, Breitner won seven National Championships with Bayern Munich (1972, 1973, 1974, 1980, 1981) and Real Madrid (1975, 1976), the Champions&#x27; Cup (1974) as well as the German (1971, 1982) and Spanish cups (1975). During his spell with Bayern Munich, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were often called &quot;Breitnigge&quot;.

Outside the pitch, Breitner self identified as part of the &quot;68ers&quot; (the 1968 protest movement in West Germany and elsewhere). He was often decried by the more traditional or conservative football fans for his radicalism and &quot;revolutionary&quot; attitude, as well as his tendency for voicing strong opinions on major political and social issues, especially during a time when Germany was still divided by the Berlin Wall. He was seen bringing Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Book&quot; to training. However, after 1974, Breitner abruptly brushed aside his leftist leanings. While his Dutch World Cup rival Johan Cruyff had publicly declared to never play for a club associated with &quot;fascist&quot; General Franco, Breitner yearned to play for Real Madrid and signed the transfer documents in 1974. Subsequently, he gained notoriety for spending lavishly on houses and cars, as well as participating in lucrative commercials.

Before the 1982 World Cup in Spain he caused a major uproar in West Germany when he accepted an offer by Pitralon, a German cosmetics company to pay him the – what many Germans regarded at that time as a &quot;scandalously high&quot; – sum of 150,000 Deutsche Mark if he shaved off his fluffy full beard, used their aftershave and advertised for the company. In the previous years his long hair had been perceived as a show of rebellion. Breitner had previously infuriated many fans with his move to Spanish club giants Real Madrid. He returned to West Germany after the successful spell in Madrid and retired as a player in 1983. About the aftershave incident, Breitner said that he was mistakenly labelled as Maoist after, talking with a journalist about communism, the Soviet Union and France, mentioning that he had Mao Zedong&#x27;s Little Red Book. He stated &quot;&quot;When the atrocities became known, I had nothing to regret about because I never declared myself as a Maoist&quot;.

==Post-retirement==
In 1998, Breitner was announced as the new national team manager by DFB president Egidius Braun. However, after some steam from fellow association officials, Braun reconsidered 17 hours later, making Breitner the infamous &quot;17 Stunden Bundestrainer&quot; (&quot;the 17-hour coach&quot;).

Today, Breitner mainly works as a TV pundit and newspaper columnist. In March 2007, he entered into a contract with Bayern Munich and acts as an advisor on various issues. He occasionally still plays for the &quot;Bayern All-Stars&quot; in charity games, captaining the team on several occasions.

<doc id="430851" wikidata="Q974094" url="?curid=430851" title="Earl of Holland">
<text>Earl of Holland was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1624 for Henry Rich, 1st Baron Kensington. He was the younger son of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick, and had already been created Baron Kensington in 1623, also in the Peerage of England, having married Isabelle Cope, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Walter Cope (c.1553-1614), of Cope Castle in Kensington, Middlesex. His eldest son, the second Earl, succeeded his first cousin as fifth Earl of Warwick in 1673. All the titles became extinct on the death of the eighth Earl of Warwick and fifth Earl of Holland in 1759 (see Earl of Warwick for a more detailed description of the descent of the titles).

Lady Mary Rich, daughter of the first Earl of Holland, married Sir John Campbell, 5th Baronet, who was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland in the Peerage of Scotland in 1681. Also, Lady Elizabeth Rich, only daughter and heiress of the fifth Earl of Warwick and second Earl of Holland, married Francis Edwardes. Their son William Edwardes succeeded to parts of the Rich estates and was created Baron Kensington in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776.

The name &quot;Holland&quot; in the title refers to the area of Lincolnshire historically known as Holland.

<text>The Frisco RoughRiders (often shortened to &#x27;Riders) are a Minor League Baseball team of the Texas League and the Double-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers. Based in Frisco, Texas, the team is named after the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment during the Spanish–American War, headed by future American President Theodore Roosevelt, nicknamed &quot;The Rough Riders&quot; by the American press. They play their home games at Riders Field, which opened in 2003 and seats 10,316 people.

The RoughRiders have served as an affiliate of the Rangers since their establishment in 2003 as members of the Texas League. They moved to the Double-A Central in 2021, but this was renamed the Texas League in 2022. Frisco has reached the postseason on seven occasions. They have won five division titles and two league championships. Their first Texas League title was won in 2004, and the RoughRiders secured their second title in 2022.

==History==
In 2001, the Texas League&#x27;s Shreveport SwampDragons (previously the Shreveport Captains) of Shreveport, Louisiana, were purchased by Mandalay Entertainment in connection with Tom Hicks, former owner of the Texas Rangers and the Southwest Sports Group. Mandalay Baseball moved them to the North Texas city of Frisco and changed their name to the RoughRiders. The team would play at Dr Pepper Ballpark, a newly constructed stadium, and be the Double-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers.

The RoughRiders played their first home game on April 3, 2003. The game was a sellout with over 10,000 fans in attendance. They qualified for the Texas League playoffs in their inaugural season by winning the first-half title, 40–30. They advanced past the Wichita Wranglers before being defeated by the San Antonio Missions, four games to one, in the finals. Frisco saw 675,620 fans come through the turnstiles at Dr Pepper Ballpark, which ranked fourth overall in all of minor league attendance.

The &#x27;Riders finished off a remarkable second-half run and clinched the 2004 second-half Eastern Division title at home with a 45–25 record. They defeated the Tulsa Drillers to win the Eastern Division title and moved on to face the Round Rock Express, winners of the Western Division in the championship series. Frisco beat the Express, four games to one, and captured its first Texas League championship in just its second year of existence.

Frisco hosted the 2005 Texas League All-Star Game in which Andre Ethier lead the East All-Stars over the West, 5–0, with a key RBI-single. On July 28, 2005, A. J. Murray, Steve Karsay, and Scott Feldman combined to pitch a perfect game for the RoughRiders against the Corpus Christi Hooks in Corpus Christi. The final score was 3–0. They finished the season with a 58–82 record.

Pitchers Thomas Diamond and John Danks, infielder Adam Morissey, and outfielder Anthony Webster were selected for the 2006 Texas League All-Star Game. The &#x27;Riders finished the season in third place with a 72–68 record.

Frisco returned to postseason play in 2007 by virtue of winning the first-half title, 47–23, but were defeated in the first round by San Antonio, three games to none. Their final 2007 season record was 85–55, the best ever in RoughRiders&#x27; history. First-year Manager Dave Anderson was named Texas League Manager of the Year, the first such honor for a Frisco manager. &quot;Baseball America&quot; selected Frisco as the 2007 Bob Freitas Award winner for the top Double-A franchise.

The RoughRiders defeated the Texas Rangers in a preseason exhibition game on March 29, 2008. On May 18, Matt Harrison tossed a 2–0 7-inning no-hitter against the San Antonio Missions at Dr. Pepper Ballpark. The team once again captured the first-half division title, 43–27, but also won the second-half title, 41–29, with an overall record of 84–56. They swept San Antonio to win the South Division, but fell to the Arkansas Travelers, 3–2, in the championship finals. Frisco manager Scott Little won the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year Award.

Frisco hosted the 2009 Texas League All-Star Game in which five of its players were selected to compete: pitchers Jumbo Díaz and Kasey Kiker, catcher Manny Piña, outfielder Craig Gentry, and first baseman Justin Smoak. The &#x27;Riders lost the final game of the season to the Midland RockHounds, thus eliminating them from postseason contention.

Former Rangers third baseman Steve Buechele led Frisco to clinch the 2010 first-half South Division title, 38–31, behind Tanner Roark who earned the win pitching 5.1 innings as the RoughRiders topped the Corpus Christi Hooks, 7–3, at Whataburger Field. The RoughRiders lost the best-of-five divisional round to the Midland RockHounds, three games to one. Blake Beavan won the Texas League Pitcher of the Year Award after posting a 10–5 record and a 2.78 ERA over 17 starts.

Cuban defector Leonys Martín signed a five-year major-league contract with the Rangers worth $15.5 million and was assigned to Frisco to begin the 2012 season. Martín and eight other players (Mike Bianucci, José Félix, José Ruiz, Tommy Mendonca, Renny Osuna, Adalberto Flores, Justin Miller, and Martín Pérez were named Texas League All-stars that year. Though Frisco qualified for the postseason, they lost the best-of-five division series to San Antonio, three games to one. The &#x27;Riders ended the regular season with 79 wins and 61 losses.

Making his first pitching performance in the Metroplex since signing with Texas for $60 million (after the Rangers paid a $51.7 million posting fee to the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters), Yu Darvish struck out top Frisco prospect Jurickson Profar to begin four scoreless innings in a 6–1 exhibition win over the RoughRiders at Dr Pepper Ballpark on April 4, 2012. On May 18, the youngest player in all of Double-A baseball, shortstop Jurickson Profar extended his hit streak to 29 games in a 13–0 victory over San Antonio. The 19-year-old&#x27;s streak ended the next night, but he kept his on-base streak going until it reached 50 straight games (the longest such streak in Minor League Baseball for 2012) on June 2. Power hitting prospect Mike Olt finished his biggest homer binge of the season, hitting two home runs in a June 3 game for the third-straight game. Olt went on to lead the Texas League in home runs with 28 despite getting called up to the big leagues in early August. Nine RoughRiders were named to the Texas League All-Star team. After winning the first half, 41–29, Frisco won the South Division title against Corpus Christi, 3–0, to advance to the league championship, but lost the league crown to the Springfield Cardinals, 3–1. The 2013 team finished with an even 70–70 record, but failed to win either half of the season.

On June 16, 2014, Mandalay Baseball Properties LLC, who owned the Frisco RoughRiders, entered into a definitive agreement with the CEO and Managing Partner of the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, Chuck Greenberg, as well as RoughRiders President Scott Sonju, for the sale of the Frisco RoughRiders franchise. Greenberg became Chairman, CEO, as well as the Managing Partner of the newly formed Frisco RoughRiders LP, which is a partnership of local investors who acquired the RoughRiders. Sonju is a Co-Managing Partner and continued to serve as RoughRiders&#x27; president to oversee the day-to-day operations of the team under Greenberg&#x27;s leadership. The team qualified for the 2014 postseason by winning both halves (40–29 and 40–30), but lost the South Division title to Midland, three games to one. Losing seasons from 2015 to 2019, including back-to-back last-place finishes in 2017 and 2018, have kept the RoughRiders out of the postseason recently.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the RoughRiders were organized into the Double-A Central. They won the 2021 Southern Division title with a first-place 64–55 record. Despite winning the division, their record was third-best in the league, and only the two teams with the highest winning percentages in the regular season competed for the league championship. Cole Winn won the league&#x27;s Pitcher of the Year Award. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<text>Alastair Robertson Goodlad, Baron Goodlad, (born 4 July 1943), is a British politician who served as Chief Whip of the parliamentary Conservative Party from 1995 to 1997, and British High Commissioner to Australia from 2000 to 2005. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Northwich and later for Eddisbury from 1974 to 1999. Goodlad sat in the House of Lords as a life peer from 2005 to 2024.

==Early life==
Born in 1943, Goodlad attended Marlborough College and read law at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Parliamentary career==
He first stood for Parliament in 1970 when he contested Crewe, but was beaten by Labour&#x27;s Scholefield Allen.

Goodlad was Member of Parliament successively for Northwich (1974–83) and Eddisbury (1983–99). He also served as a junior Foreign Office Minister then as Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip, for which in the 1997 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG). Following the 1997 election, he served in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, Shadow Secretary of State for International Development and Opposition Chief Whip.

===Membership of Lloyd&#x27;s of London===
Goodlad was an underwriting member of the Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market, commencing in 1977 and ceasing in 1990. His membership coincided in the latter years with the rising tide of asbestos losses and his share is estimated to have been about £90,000.

==High Commissioner to Australia==
Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair then appointed Goodlad as High Commissioner to Australia. Goodlad accepted the office of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds on 28 June 1999 to formally vacate his parliamentary seat, triggering the 1999 Eddisbury by-election.

Goodlad took up office as High Commissioner in 2000. At the end of his term in 2005, he was replaced by former Secretary of State for Scotland, Helen Liddell.

==House of Lords==
On 19 July 2005, he was created a life peer as Baron Goodlad, of Lincoln in the County of Lincolnshire, and was introduced in the House of Lords the following day. He sits on the Conservative benches and was chairman of the Constitution Select Committee from 2008 to 2010.

In 2007, Goodlad was appointed Chairman of the Britain–Australia Society.

==Personal life==
Goodlad married Cecilia Hurst in 1968 and has two sons.

<doc id="430866" wikidata="Q326992" url="?curid=430866" title="Eddie Murray">
<text>Eddie Clarence Murray (born February 24, 1956), nicknamed &quot;Steady Eddie&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman, designated hitter, and coach. Spending most of his MLB career with the Baltimore Orioles, he ranks fourth in team history in both games played and hits. Though Murray never won a Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, he finished in the top ten in MVP voting several times. He had 996 runs batted in in the 1980s, more than any other player. After his playing career, Murray coached for the Orioles, Cleveland Indians, and Los Angeles Dodgers.

Murray is one of only seven players in MLB history to be in both the 3,000 hit club and the 500 home run club. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2003 in his first year of eligibility. In the &quot;New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot; (2001), Murray is described as the fifth-best first baseman in major league history. He was 77th on the list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot; by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
Murray was the eighth child of twelve and still has five sisters and four brothers. He has often quipped that as a child he did not have to go far for a pick-up baseball game. The games were quite fierce and his older brothers never let him win. Murray played Little League baseball under coach Clifford Prelow, an ex-Dodger minor leaguer. (In his Hall of Fame induction speech, Murray thanked Prelow for teaching him not just the game of baseball, but love for the game as well.) Prelow remembers that young Murray was a well behaved player. Murray attended Locke High School in Los Angeles, where he batted .500 as a senior and was a teammate of Ozzie Smith.

==Playing career==
===Baltimore Orioles (1977–1988)===
Murray was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the third round of the 1973 amateur draft and had several successful seasons in the minor leagues. He debuted at the major league level on April 7, 1977, and played in 160 games for the Orioles in his first season. In 160 games, he hit for .283 while contributing 88 RBIs, 27 home runs, 29 doubles, and 173 hits while also striking out 104 times during the season. This was the only season in which he struck out over 100 times. He won the American League Rookie of the Year award. In his next season, he played in 161 games while raising his totals, hitting for .285 along with having 95 RBIs, 27 home runs, 32 doubles, 174 hits along with being named to his first All-Star Game and finishing 8th in the MVP balloting. In the 1979 season, he hit .295 along with driving in 99 runs, 25 home runs, 30 doubles and 179 hits in 159 games. Though he was not named to the All-Star Game, he finished 11th in the MVP balloting. He participated in his first postseason. In the 1979 American League Championship Series, he hit 5-for-12 for a .417 batting average along with one home run and 5 RBIs as they beat the California Angels in four games. In the 1979 World Series, he hit 4-for-26 for a .154 average with one home run and 2 RBIs but also four strikeouts as the Orioles lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games.

With the Orioles from 1977 until 1988, Murray averaged 28 home runs and 99 RBI, making him a perennial candidate for the MVP award, twice finishing second in the voting. Murray&#x27;s close-knit friendship with fellow Oriole Cal Ripken Jr. was highly publicized in Baltimore at the time. In fact, Ripken has credited Murray with teaching him his work ethic.
In the 1980 season, he hit .300 (a career first), having 116 RBIs, 32 home runs, 36 doubles, and 179 hits in 158 games. He finished 6th in the MVP balloting that year. While only playing in 99 games due to the player&#x27;s strike, in 1981 Murray hit .294 along with 78 RBIs (which led the American League), 22 home runs (tied for the American League lead), 21 doubles and 111 hits while being named to the 1981 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and finishing 5th in the MVP balloting. He returned to full form the following year, hitting for .316 along with 110 RBIs, 32 home runs, 30 doubles, and 174 hits in 151 games. He was named to the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game along with being awarded his first-ever Gold Glove Award and finishing 2nd in the MVP balloting.

His 1983 season was not much different, as he hit .306/.393/.538 along with 111 RBIs, 33 home runs (a career-high), 30 doubles, and 178 hits in 156 games. He was named to the 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game along with winning a second consecutive Golden Glove and his first Silver Slugger Award. Though a spectacular season, he finished second in the MVP voting to teammate Cal Ripken, Jr.. In the 1983 American League Championship Series against the Chicago White Sox, he hit 4-for-15 for a .267 batting average, hitting one home run and three RBIs as the Orioles advanced in four games to go to the 1983 World Series. In that series, he hit 5-for-20 for a .250 average while also hitting two home runs and three RBIs as the Orioles beat the Philadelphia Phillies in five games. This was his only world championship along with his last postseason appearance for 12 years.

In the 1984 season, he played in all 162 games (a career-high), while hitting for .306 and having 110 RBIs, 29 home runs, 26 doubles, and 180 hits. He also was walked a career-high 107 times. He was named to a fourth straight All-Star Game, while being awarded a third straight Gold Glove and second straight Silver Slugger Award and finishing 4th in the MVP balloting. The following year, he hit for .297 while having 124 RBIs, 31 home runs, 37 doubles (a career-best) and 173 hits in 156 games. He was named to his fifth straight All-Star Game while finishing 5th in the MVP balloting. The 1986 season (his tenth with the Orioles) was a slight regression, though he hit .305 with 84 RBIs, 17 home runs, 25 doubles and 151 hits in 137 games. He was named to the All-Star Game once again.. This was his last selection until 1991. The following year, he hit for .277 while having 91 RBIs, 30 home runs, 28 doubles, and 171 hits in 160 games. This was the first season in which he had more strikeouts than walks (78 to 75) since 1983 (a 90:86 ratio). In the 1988 season, he hit for .284 while having 84 RBIs, 27 doubles and 171 hits in 161 games.

Murray&#x27;s relationship with Orioles management began to sour during spring training in 1986 when he accused team officials of pressuring him to return prematurely from an ankle injury. His request to be traded in late-August of that year was fueled by criticism from team owner Edward Bennett Williams who questioned his off-season work habits, defense and lack of extra base hits, a veiled attempt at accusing Murray of laziness. 
He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ken Howell, Brian Holton and Juan Bell on December 4, 1988. The Orioles also paid $1 million of the $8 million he was owed for the final three years of his contract. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; sports columnist Mike Preston called Murray&#x27;s departure from Baltimore in 1988 &quot;one of the lowest moments in this city&#x27;s sports history, as sad as the Colts leaving for Indianapolis, and as embarrassing as Colts officials allowing quarterback John Unitas to wear a San Diego Chargers uniform.&quot;

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1989–1991)===
In his first season with the team, he hit for a career-low .247 while having 88 RBIs, 20 home runs, 29 doubles and 147 hits in 160 games. The following year, he improved to a .330 average while having 95 RBIs, 26 home runs, 22 doubles and 184 hits in 155 games. He had 64 strikeouts (his lowest since 49 in 1986) while having 87 walks, the most since he had 84 in 1985. He was awarded the Silver Slugger Award for the third and final time while finishing 5th in the MVP balloting. He lost the NL batting title to Willie McGee by a narrow margin; McGee had been traded from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Oakland Athletics but had enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title, hitting .335 to Murray&#x27;s .330, though McGee hit .274 with the A&#x27;s (making his season average .324), which meant that Murray led the major leagues in batting despite not winning the NL batting title. The 1991 season was his last with the Dodgers. He hit for .260 while having 96 RBIs, 19 home runs, 23 doubles and 150 hits in 153 games. He had 74 strikeouts along with 55 walks (the lowest since having 40 in the injury-shortened year of 1981). Despite this, he was named to the 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. On October 29, 1991, he was granted free agency.

===New York Mets (1992–1993)===
On November 27, 1991, Murray signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets. Murray was one of several acquisitions the Mets made (including Bobby Bonilla, Willie Randolph, and Bret Saberhagen) to try to regain their winning ways. However, in Murray&#x27;s two years with the team they finished with 90 and 103 losses, respectively. He hit for .261 while having 93 RBIs, 16 home runs, 37 doubles and 144 hits in 156 games for 1992. Murray hit his 400th career home run on May 3 against Marvin Freeman of the Atlanta Braves. In the following year, he hit for .285 while having 100 RBIs (a team-high and his first 100 RBI season since having 124 in 1985), 27 home runs (second on the team only to Bonilla), 28 doubles and 174 hits in 154 games. Murray was one of three Mets to hit 20 or more home runs that year, with Bonilla hitting 34 and Jeff Kent hitting 20. This was the last time in his career that Murray hit the 100 RBI mark.

On November 1, 1993, he was granted free agency by the Mets.

===Cleveland Indians (1994–1996)===
Murray was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians on December 2, 1993. In the 1994 season, he played in 108 games and had a .254 batting average along with 76 RBIs, 17 home runs and 110 hits before the season was cut short due to the strike. The following year, he played in 113 games while having a .323 batting average for 82 RBIs, 21 home runs, and 141 hits. Murray reached the 3,000-hit plateau as an Indian on June 30, 1995, at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome with a single to right field off Minnesota Twins pitcher Mike Trombley. In the 1995 American League Division Series, he hit 5-for-13 for a .385 batting average while having one home run and 3 RBIs as they swept the Boston Red Sox in three games. In the 1995 American League Championship Series, he hit 6-for-24 while having a home run and 3 RBIs as the Indians beat the Seattle Mariners to advance to the 1995 World Series. In that series, he hit 2-for-19 for a .105 batting average. One of his hits was a single in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 3 off of Alejandro Peña to score Álvaro Espinoza and give the Indians a crucial win. He had two other RBIs along with a home run shot in Game 2 that scored two runs. However, the Indians lost to the Atlanta Braves in six games. Murray&#x27;s 1996 season was shared between two teams, the Indians and the Orioles. He played a total of 152 games, hitting for .260 with 79 RBIs, 22 home runs along with 147 hits. He played in 88 total games for the Indians, hitting for .262 along with 45 RBIs, 12 home runs and 88 hits. The Indians traded Murray back to Baltimore on July 21, 1996, for pitcher Kent Mercker.

===Last seasons (1996–1997)===
He played in 64 games for the Orioles, hitting for .257, 34 RBIs, 10 home runs and 59 hits. On September 6, 1996, he hit his 500th career home run off Felipe Lira—fittingly, the home run came as a member of the Orioles, and also came exactly one year to the day that Ripken had broken Lou Gehrig&#x27;s streak of 2,130 consecutive games played. Having already reached the 3,000 hits plateau the previous season, Murray joined Willie Mays and Hank Aaron as the only players ever to have hit at least 500 home runs and amassed 3,000 or more hits in their careers. Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, and Miguel Cabrera have since joined the club. He participated in the Orioles&#x27; playoff run, as the team advanced to the ALCS against the Yankees after having beat his old team Cleveland in the ALDS. In nine total postseason games, he went 10-for-30 while hitting one home run. After being granted free agency by the Orioles, Murray was signed as a free agent by the Anaheim Angels on December 18, 1996. He played 55 total games in the 1997 season, 46 with the Angels and 9 with the Dodgers. He had a .219 batting average along with 15 RBIs, 3 home runs, and 35 hits. His last home run was with the Angels, hitting one off Bob Tewksbury in the second inning in a 4–3 loss. He was released by the Angels on August 14. On August 20, he was signed by the Dodgers. In nine total games with the Dodgers, he had a .286 batting average, 3 RBIs and 2 hits. On October 30, he was granted free agency. He retired after the 1997 season with 504 home runs; as of 2021, Mickey Mantle is the only switch-hitter who has hit more home runs (536). Murray hit a home run from both sides of the plate in 11 games; he retired tied with Chili Davis for first place in this category. This co-record has since been broken by Mark Teixeira.

==Coaching career==
After playing 21 major-league seasons. Murray became a coach, first with the Baltimore Orioles, serving as bench coach in 1998 and 1999 and as first-base coach in 2000 and 2001.

Murray then served as the hitting coach for the Cleveland Indians from 2002 to 2005. He was with the Indians when inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Murray accepted the position of hitting coach with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2006. On June 14, 2007, Murray was fired. Former Dodger player Bill Mueller was named as interim replacement.

==Outside baseball==
In the 1980s, Murray made a donation to the Baltimore City Parks and Recreation Department which led to the establishment of the Carrie Murray Nature Center, named after Murray&#x27;s late mother. In 2008, Murray released a charity wine called Eddie Murray 504 Cabernet, a nod to his 504 career home runs, with all of his proceeds donated to the Baltimore Community Foundation.

On August 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Murray with insider trading. The SEC alleged, in a civil claim, that Murray had &quot;made approximately $235,314 in illegal profits after Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories Inc. publicly announced its plan to purchase Advanced Medical Optics through a tender offer.&quot; Specifically, the SEC alleged that Murray had received a &quot;tip&quot; about the impending purchase offer before the offer was publicly announced, bought stock in Advanced Medical Optics because of the tip, and then sold the stock for the profits after the stock increased in value after Abbott Laboratories&#x27; plans were publicly announced. According to the SEC, Murray received the tip from former Baltimore Orioles teammate Doug DeCinces, with whom he remained close friends after their playing careers ended. One year earlier, DeCinces had agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle the SEC&#x27;s civil insider trading charges against him in the same case. Murray agreed to settle the SEC&#x27;s civil charges by paying a total of $358,151, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.

==Legacy==

In 1998, he ranked number 77 on The Sporting News list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

On Sunday, July 27, 2003, Murray, along with Gary Carter, was inducted into Major League Baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame. More than 30,000 people heard Murray talk about how hard it was to get to the Hall of Fame. He said that he was never about one person, but about the team. He thanked the &quot;sea of black and orange&quot; in the crowd and then pointed to the kids farthest in the back; (more than 300 inner-city little leaguers had come from Baltimore&#x27;s Northwood Baseball League) and told them that one day &quot;they would be here too&quot;.

Murray was named the fifth best first baseman in major league history in the &quot;New Bill James Historical Abstract&quot; (2010).

A bronze statue of Eddie Murray&#x27;s left-handed-hitting stance was unveiled at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on August 11, 2012.

Union Craft Brewery in Baltimore makes &quot;Steady Eddie,&quot; a wheat IPA named after Murray.

<text>Catherine Joséphine &quot;Katia&quot; Krafft (née Conrad; 17 April 1942 – 3 June 1991) and her husband, Maurice Paul Krafft (25 March 1946 – 3 June 1991) were French volcanologists and filmmakers who died in a pyroclastic flow on Mount Unzen, Nagasaki, Japan, on 3 June 1991. The Kraffts became well known as pioneers in the filming, photographing, and recording of volcanoes, often coming within feet of lava flows. Their obituary appeared in the &quot;Bulletin of Volcanology&quot;. Since their deaths, their work has been featured in two documentary films by Werner Herzog, &quot;Into the Inferno&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft&quot; (2022), and a further film, &quot;Fire of Love&quot; (2022), depicted their lives, relationship and careers using their archived footage.

==Early life and education==
===Katia===
Katia Conrad was born on 17 April 1942 in Guebwiller, France, to Charles and Madeleine Conrad. She graduated from the University of Strasbourg with degrees in physics and chemistry. 

===Maurice===
Maurice Krafft was born on 25 March 1946 in Mulhouse, France. He first became interested in volcanoes during a family holiday to Naples and Stromboli when he was seven years old. He joined the Société géologique de France when he was 15, and went on to study geology, first at the University of Besançon, and later at the University of Strasbourg.

===Together===
The two met while students at the University of Strasbourg, and married in 1970. The couple honeymooned at Stromboli, where they photographed its near-continuous eruption. Recognising the public interest in the documentation of volcanic eruptions, they began to make a career of filming them.

==Career==
The Kraffts were often the first to arrive at the scene of an active volcano, and became well known in the volcanologist community. Their footage of the effects of volcanic eruptions on the surrounding areas often played a considerable part in gaining the cooperation of local authorities faced with volcanic threats. Following the onset of activity at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, the Kraffts&#x27; footage of the impact of the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz lahar in Colombia, which had caused the Armero tragedy, was shown to large numbers of people, including the then president of the Philippines, Corazon Aquino, and was attributed to convincing a number of sceptics that an evacuation of the area was necessary. 

Katia started her career by taking gas samples of volcanoes and documenting eruptions by observing them in person, writing books on her findings to fund her trips; her books pioneered a new area of volcanic coverage. The Kraffts&#x27; close-up footage of volcanic eruptions has been attributed to enhancing geologists&#x27; understanding and knowledge of the topic, while Katia has been cited as a pioneer in the field of female volcanologists. In addition to their observations, the Kraffts also took measures, gas readings, and samples, often feet away from pyroclastic and lava flows, and documented how the eruptions affected the local ecosystem. The Kraffts documented the formation of new volcanoes, in addition to the effects of acid rain and ash clouds.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Kraffts documented various volcanoes and volcanic eruptions; often Maurice would film them while Katia took photographs. In 1987, the Kraffts featured in &quot;The Volcano Watchers&quot;, an episode in the sixth season of the PBS series &quot;Nature&quot;.

One of the Kraffts&#x27; final projects was &quot;Understanding Volcanic Hazards and Reducing Volcanic Risks&quot;, in which they produced informational films and educational materials on the science of volcanic eruptions and the need of evacuations.

==Mount Unzen eruption and deaths==
On 3 June 1991 at 4pm local time, Mount Unzen erupted, forming pyroclastic flows that rushed down its slopes, killing 43 people including the Kraffts, as well as their fellow volcanologist Harry Glicken, who had accompanied them to observe the eruption. On 5 June 1991, the bodies of the Kraffts and Glicken were recovered. Katia and Maurice were found near their rental car, lying side by side under a layer of pyroclastic ash; Glicken&#x27;s body was located nearby. The bodies were burned beyond recognition and were identified using personal items, including Maurice&#x27;s watch and camera. The bodies&#x27; position suggested that Glicken had attempted to flee from the flow, while the Kraffts had remained where they were. Material they filmed of the approaching flow was destroyed by the volcanic heat.

The remains of the Kraffts were cremated during a Catholic funeral service, and were placed at the Anyo-ji Shrine in Shimabara, which was dedicated to the victims of the 1792 Unzen earthquake and tsunami. Their ashes were subsequently interred at Katia&#x27;s family plot in France.

After his death, Maurice was quoted in the &quot;Associated Press&quot; as stating that he wanted to die pursuing his work &quot;at the edge of a volcano.&quot;

==Legacy==
A volcanic crater, &quot;M. and K. Krafft Crater&quot;, on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano in Réunion, France, is named after the couple. The crater is located at . Lava erupted from this crater in March 1998.

The Krafft Medal honours the Kraffts&#x27; memory and is awarded every four years by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s Interior to someone who has made significant contributions to volcanology through service to communities affected by volcanic activity.

The Centre for the Study of Active Volcanoes at the University of Hawai&#x27;i at Hilo established a fund remembering the Kraffts, the Maurice and Katia Krafft Memorial Fund. Donations are directed to educate people in countries of high volcanic risk about the hazards active volcanoes pose.
