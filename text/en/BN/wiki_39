<text>John David Pugh (born 28 June 1948) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Southport from 2001 to 2017. He stood down at the 2017 snap election. In November 2017, he was elected to Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council as a councillor for Duke&#x27;s Ward.

==Early life and career==
Pugh was educated at Prescot Grammar School and Maidstone Grammar School. He graduated from Durham University, attending St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society, where he studied Philosophy.

Formerly a religious studies teacher and Head of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Crosby, Pugh has lived in Southport since 1974. He also taught at Salesian College (later Savio High School) in Bootle.

Pugh joined the Liberal Party in 1977. Pugh served on Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, representing Birkdale, from 1987 until his election to Parliament. At the time of his election, Pugh was leader of the council (from 1992), and of the Sefton Liberal Democrats.

==Parliamentary career==

First elected to the House of Commons in the 2001 general election, in his first parliamentary term, Pugh served on the Transport, Local Government and Regions Select Committee and was Liberal Democrat education spokesperson with responsibility for schools. Following his re-election to Parliament in 2005, he served as shadow spokesperson for Transport and Health, and, subsequent to the election of Nick Clegg as party leader worked with Vince Cable as Shadow Treasury spokesperson. In the 2007 leadership election, Pugh supported Clegg in preference to Chris Huhne.

With the formation of the coalition government in 2010 he was appointed as Co-Chair of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Committee for Health and Social Care, a position he relinquished at the end of 2013 to focus on producing a report examining the social and economic issues facing the North.

In his party&#x27;s 2015 leadership election, John Pugh supported Tim Farron in preference to Norman Lamb.

In December 2015, Pugh voted to extend the bombing of ISIL targets in Iraq to Syria.

On 19 April 2017, Pugh announced that he would not be standing in the 2017 general election.

===Campaign interests===
Amongst Pugh&#x27;s campaigning interests was public sector IT, specifically around the role Open Source Software might play. Pugh has argued that the public sector could reduce costs by increasing use of Open Source Software and has accused the BBC of effectively giving Microsoft illegal state aid in only making their iPlayer download service available on Windows computers (at the time).

Pugh has interests in mental health policy. In October 2009, Pugh introduced a private members&#x27; bill under the 10-minute rule calling for more local control over the NHS.

Locally in Southport, Pugh was interested in saving local pubs, and also in the drinking culture of the UK. Pugh saw cheap alcohol deals in supermarkets as one of the major problems causing pub closures, and fuelling the culture. He also took the fight for Local Post Offices to 10 Downing Street.

In Transport, Pugh had long campaigned for the reinstatement of the Burscough Curves, and worked with local groups such as the Ormskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers&#x27; Association (OPSTA) and the Southport Rail Transport Forum (SRTF) to save services from to 

Pugh supports Amnesty International, with whom he is reported to have had close ties with the Formby &amp; Southport Group over a number of years.

In 2013, he became one of only four Liberal Democrat MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

==Personal life==
He is married to Annette with three daughters and a son. He moved to Southport in 1974.

Pugh&#x27;s interests include philosophy, computers, weight-lifting and supporting Liverpool F.C.

<doc id="433888" wikidata="Q333543" url="?curid=433888" title="James Purnell">
<text>James Mark Dakin Purnell (born 2 March 1970) is a British former broadcasting executive and Labour Party politician who served as a Cabinet minister in the Brown Government from 2007 to 2009. In October 2016, he became the BBC&#x27;s Director of Radio, in addition to his other role as the BBC&#x27;s Director of Strategy and Digital, a job he had held since March 2013. In 2020, he left the BBC to become vice-chancellor of University of the Arts London.

Purnell was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stalybridge and Hyde from the general election of 2001 until the that of 2010. He served as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport from 2007 to 2008 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from 2008 to 2009. He resigned from the Government on 4 June 2009, criticising the leadership of Gordon Brown.

He became the director of the Open Left project for Demos in 2009. Purnell chaired the Institute for Public Policy Research until 2010, and was a senior advisor in the Public Sector practice of the Boston Consulting Group. He is also a film producer, and a former Senior Producer at Rare Day, who produced the film &quot;One Mile Away&quot;.

==Early life==
Purnell was born in the City of London; he received most of his education in France before returning to study for his A-Levels at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Balliol College, Oxford. While a student, he worked during summer vacations as a researcher for Tony Blair between 1989 and 1992. After graduating from Oxford with a first class degree, he worked as a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research before moving to the BBC to become its Head of Corporate Planning.

Between May 1994 and October 1995, he was a Labour councillor in Islington, representing Canonbury East ward. In 1997, Purnell returned to work as a special adviser at 10 Downing Street, remaining in the post until 2001. He has also served as a consultant at Hydra Associates and as a board member of the Young Vic theatre as well as of the Royal National Theatre and the British Film Institute, and as a senior advisor to Boston Consulting Group.

==Member of Parliament==
Purnell was selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of Stalybridge and Hyde in 2001, and won the seat in that year&#x27;s general election with a majority of 8,859. While a Labour MP, he was a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee in the House of Commons from 2001 to 2003, the Chair of the All-Party Group on Private Equity and Venture Capital between 2002 and 2003, and the Chair of Labour Friends of Israel from 2002 to 2004.

===In government===

In 2003, Purnell became Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Ruth Kelly in the Cabinet Office, and in December 2004 he joined the Government as a Whip in the government reshuffle following the resignation of David Blunkett.

After Labour was returned to power in the 2005 general election, he was appointed to the position of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Creative Industries and Tourism in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, where he was in charge of preparing the legislation that liberalised the alcohol licensing laws of England and Wales and created tax breaks for the film industry. In May 2006, he was promoted to be Minister of State for Pensions in the Department for Work and Pensions, replacing Stephen Timms.

In 2007, he was named Consumer Champion of the Year by &quot;Which?&quot; magazine for his work on pensions. &quot;Which?&quot; cited his &quot;commitment to consumers in the development of the national pensions saving scheme&quot;, particularly for listening to stakeholders and for his contributions to the personal accounts for low and middle earners.

In June 2007, Purnell entered the Cabinet as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; he was its youngest member. He was promoted to Work and Pensions Secretary after the resignation of Peter Hain on 24 January 2008.

===Faked photograph===
In September 2007 Tameside General Hospital inserted Purnell into a photograph, as part of a press release for a Private finance initiative (PFI) deal. Tameside Trust claimed that he agreed to the insertion being late for the original photo call, Purnell denied this. Tom Levitt, a Labour MP who was present for the photoshoot, stated that he and other MPs left a gap for Purnell when the photograph was taken, knowing that Purnell&#x27;s image would be added.

===Interest on crisis loans proposal===
In December 2008, Purnell proposed charging interest on crisis loans to the unemployed and pensioners made by the Department for Work and Pensions, which were interest-free, at a rate of up to 26.8% per annum. This was met with great hostility and was blocked by the intervention of the prime minister, Gordon Brown.

===Expenses scandal===
Purnell was one of many MPs involved in political difficulties following the revelations of the 2009 expenses scandal. He told the parliamentary authorities that his main home was in Manchester and claimed the &quot;second home&quot; allowance for his flat in London. In October 2004, he sold his London flat but told HM Revenue and Customs it was his &quot;principal home&quot;, not his &quot;second home&quot;. A spokesman on behalf of Purnell said that &quot;Any allegation that James avoided capital gains tax is completely untrue. When he bought his constituency home, the sale of his London flat fell through, but it was sold within the period that HMRC continue to treat it as not being liable for CGT ... This would have been true for any taxpayer – there was no special treatment&quot;. Also in 2004, Purnell claimed £395 for an accountant&#x27;s bill which included &quot;tax advice provided in October 2004 regarding sale of flat&quot;.

Whilst renting a flat between 2004 and 2006, Purnell claimed £100 a month for cleaning expenses and £586 for repairs. At the end of the lease, the landlord kept the £2,520 deposit, claiming the flat to have been in a poor state. A spokesman for Purnell stated: &quot;James felt frustrated that the landlord refused to return the deposit. He initially pursued the matter through legal channels but let it rest as the costs of fighting it further would far outweigh recouping the deposit&quot;. Allegation were made by a Sunday newspaper that Purnell claimed more than £1,500 a month rent for the flat although he was responsible for paying half of the £1,820 a month rent and his fiancée was paying the rest. A spokesman for Purnell said &quot;Despite being entitled to claim in full for the whole rental cost incurred by him and his partner, James claimed less than the amount he himself spent. The rules of the House of Commons make it clear that an MP is entitled to be reimbursed for the rent or mortgage paid by the MP and their partner. Nevertheless, James went out of his way to ensure overall he claimed less for accommodation than he himself paid&quot;. Purnell also claimed £247 for 3,000 fridge magnets.

===Resignation from the Cabinet===
On 4 June 2009, Purnell announced his resignation from the Cabinet, and called upon Gordon Brown to resign as Prime Minister. His resignation came only days after the resignations of Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, whose expenses had been the subject of negative comments, and Communities Secretary Hazel Blears, who had also avoided paying capital gains tax on her property.
The news came just minutes after polls closed in the local and European elections, in which Labour performed badly.
His letter to the Prime Minister, which was also sent to &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, read:

==Post-parliamentary career==
On 19 February 2010, Purnell announced he would be standing down as an MP later that year, saying &quot;I have decided that I no longer wish to be an MP. I have spent all my working life in or about Westminster. And while this has been a huge privilege, I&#x27;ve realised I don&#x27;t want to have spent all my life in frontline politics.&quot; He pointed to his work with Demos as occupying him in the immediate future.

After leaving parliament, Purnell became the chair of the Institute for Public Policy Research. It was touted that he would stand for the Labour candidacy to become Mayor of London, but he decided against this option. He supported David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership election and worked for his campaign, although he was subsequently offered the job of chief of staff to the new leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, a job he turned down.

Purnell became linked with the Blue Labour movement within the Labour Party and in April 2011 he was appointed by the Boston Consulting Group as a Special Advisor to their Public Sector Group. In July 2011, he appeared on &quot;Newsnight&quot; with proposals for welfare reforms, as part of his involvement in Blue Labour. He called for a National Salary Insurance, a job guarantee and free universal childcare, but also said that &quot;freebies&quot; such as Winter Fuel Allowance and free bus passes should not become sacred. He did not rule out returning to Parliament in 2015, but declared his support for Ed Miliband and his leadership.

===BBC career===
In February 2013 Purnell left the IPPR in order to rejoin the BBC as its Director of Strategy, on a salary of £295,000; he assumed this position on 20 March. As a senior BBC employee he had to resign his membership of the Labour Party.

An Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal was brought by the BBC&#x27;s former Chief Technology Officer, John Linwood, when he lost his job in 2013 after the Corporation&#x27;s £100m Digital Media Initiative failed. During the case an email from Purnell was cited in evidence, which read: &quot;We need a clear line on [John Linwood] on whether he is resigning or being fired and why&quot;. The tribunal&#x27;s response to this was: &quot;It was notable that there was no third option in Purnell&#x27;s mind, such as a different disciplinary outcome.&quot; The tribunal found the BBC&#x27;s processes to have given an &quot;apparently cavalier disregard for any of the accepted norms of a fair disciplinary process&quot;, and that there was a &quot;deeply ingrained cultural expectation within the organisation of sacrificial accountability&quot;. Linwood was awarded £80,000 in damages, and it was later revealed that the BBC had spent £498,000 defending the claim.

In late September 2016, Purnell was appointed as the BBC&#x27;s Director of Radio and Education, in succession to Helen Boaden. He took up his new position in late October 2016. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described a key facet of his role as attracting younger listeners and viewers to the BBC.

In September 2020 the new director-general Tim Davie removed Purnell from his new smaller executive board. Purnell left the BBC that year to become president and vice-chancellor of University of the Arts London in spring 2021.

<text>NMT (&quot;Nordic Mobile Telephony&quot;) is an automatic cellular phone system specified by Nordic telecommunications administrations (PTTs) and opened for service on 1 October 1981. NMT is based on analogue technology (first generation or 1G) and two variants exist: NMT-450 and NMT-900. The numbers indicate the frequency bands used. NMT-900 was introduced in 1986 and carries more channels than the older NMT-450 network.

The NMT specifications were free and open, allowing many companies to produce NMT hardware and pushing prices down. The success of NMT was important to Nokia (then Mobira) and Ericsson. The first Danish implementers were Storno (then owned by General Electric, later taken over by Motorola) and AP (later taken over by Philips). Initial NMT phones were designed to mount in the trunk of a car, with a keyboard/display unit at the driver&#x27;s seat. &quot;Portable&quot; versions existed, though they were still bulky, and with battery life a big problem. Later models, such as Benefon&#x27;s, were as small as and weighed only about 100 grams.

== History ==
NMT stands for &quot;Nordisk MobilTelefoni&quot; or &quot;Nordiska MobilTelefoni-gruppen&quot;.
The NMT network was opened in Sweden and Norway in 1981, and in Denmark and Finland in 1982. It was a response to the increasing congestion and heavy requirements of the manual mobile phone networks: ARP (150 MHz) in Finland, MTD (450 MHz) in Sweden and Denmark, and OLT in Norway. Iceland joined in 1986. However, Ericsson introduced the first commercial service in Saudi Arabia on 1 September 1981 to 1,200 users, as a pilot test project, one month before they did the same in Sweden. By 1985 the network had grown to 110,000 subscribers in Scandinavia and Finland, 63,300 in Norway alone, which made it the world&#x27;s largest mobile network at the time.

The NMT network has mainly been used in the Nordic countries, Baltic countries, Switzerland, France, Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Turkey, Croatia, Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine and in Asia. The introduction of digital mobile networks such as GSM has reduced the popularity of NMT and the Nordic countries have suspended their NMT networks. In Estonia the NMT network was shut down in December 2000. In Finland TeliaSonera&#x27;s NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2002. Norway&#x27;s last NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2004. Sweden&#x27;s TeliaSonera NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2007. The NMT network (450 MHz) however has one big advantage over GSM which is the range; this advantage is valuable in big but sparsely populated countries such as Iceland. In Iceland, the GSM network reaches 98% of the country&#x27;s population but only a small proportion of its land area. The NMT system however reaches most of the country and a lot of the surrounding waters, thus the network was popular with fishermen and those traveling in the vast empty mainland. In Iceland the NMT service was stopped on 1 September 2010, when Síminn closed down its NMT network.
In Denmark, Norway and Sweden the NMT-450 frequencies have been auctioned off to Swedish Nordisk Mobiltelefon which later became Ice.net and renamed to Net 1 that built a digital network using CDMA 450. During 2015, the network has been migrated to 4G.

France also developed an NMT network in 1988 (in parallel with Radiocom 2000) but with slight variations. As a result, it could not roam with other NMT networks around the world.

In Russia Uralwestcom shut down their NMT network on 1 September 2006 and Sibirtelecom on 10 January 2008. Skylink, subsidiary company of Tele2 Russia operates NMT-450 network as of 2016 in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Perm Krai. These networks are used in sparsely populated areas with long distance. License for the provision of services was valid until 2021.

== Technology ==
The cell sizes in an NMT network range from 2 km to 30 km. With smaller ranges the network can service more simultaneous callers; for example in a city the range can be kept short for better service. NMT used full duplex transmission, allowing for simultaneous receiving and transmission of voice. Car phone versions of NMT used transmission power of up to 15 watt (NMT-450) and 6 watt (NMT-900), handsets up to 1 watt. NMT had automatic switching (dialing) and handover of the call built into the standard from the beginning, which was not the case with most preceding car phone services, such as the Finnish ARP. Additionally, the NMT standard specified billing as well as national and international roaming.

=== Signaling ===
NMT voice channel is transmitted with FM (Frequency Modulation) and NMT signaling transfer speeds vary between 600 and 1,200 bits per second, using FFSK (Fast Frequency Shift Keying) modulation. Signaling between the base station and the mobile station was implemented using the same RF channel that was used for audio, and using the 1,200 bit/s FFSK modem. This caused the periodic short noise bursts, e.g. during handover, that were uniquely characteristic to NMT sound.

=== Security ===
In the original NMT specification the voice traffic was not encrypted; it was possible to listen to calls using e.g. a scanner or a cable ready TV. As a result, some scanners have had the NMT bands blocked so they could not be accessed. Later versions of the NMT specifications defined optional analog scrambling which was based on two-band audio frequency inversion. If both the base station and the mobile station supported scrambling, they could agree upon using it when initiating a phone call. Also, if two users had mobile (phone) stations supporting scrambling, they could turn it on during conversation even if the base stations didn&#x27;t support it. In this case, audio would be scrambled all the way between the 2 mobile stations. While the scrambling method was not at all as strong as encryption of current digital phones, such as GSM or CDMA, it did prevent casual listening with scanners. Scrambling is defined in NMT Doc 450-1: System Description (1999-03-23) and NMT Doc 450-3 and 900-3: Technical Specification for the Mobile Station (1995-10-04)&#x27;s Annex 26 v.1.1: Mobile Station with Speech Scrambling – Split Inversion Method (Optional) (1998-01-27).

=== Data transfer ===
NMT also supported a simple but robust integrated data transfer mode called DMS (Data and Messaging Service) or NMT-Text, which used the network&#x27;s signaling channel for data transfer. Using DMS, text messaging was also possible between two NMT handsets before SMS service started in GSM, but this feature was never commercially available except in Russian, Polish and Bulgarian NMT networks. Another data transfer method was called NMT Mobidigi with transfer speeds of 380 bits per second. It required external equipment.

<text>Salvia officinalis, the common sage or sage, is a perennial, evergreen subshrub, with woody stems, grayish leaves, and blue to purplish flowers. It is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae and native to the Mediterranean region, though it has been naturalized in many places throughout the world. It has a long history of medicinal and culinary use, and in modern times it has been used as an ornamental garden plant. The common name &quot;sage&quot; is also used for closely related species and cultivars.

==Description==

Cultivars are quite variable in size, leaf and flower color, and foliage pattern, with many variegated leaf types. The Old World type grows to approximately tall and wide, with lavender flowers most common, though they can also be white, pink, or purple. The plant flowers in late spring or summer. The leaves are oblong, ranging in size up to long by wide. Leaves are grey-green, rugose on the upper side, and nearly white underneath due to the many short soft hairs. Modern cultivars include leaves with purple, rose, cream, and yellow in many variegated combinations. The common sage gives its name to the grayish-green color sage, due to the distinctive color of its leaves.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Salvia officinalis&quot; was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It has been grown for centuries in the Old World for its food and healing properties, and was often described in old herbals for the many miraculous properties attributed to it. The binary name, &quot;officinalis&quot;, refers to the plant&#x27;s medicinal use—the &quot;officina&quot; was the traditional storeroom of a monastery where herbs and medicines were stored. &quot;S. officinalis&quot; has been classified under many other scientific names over the years, including six different names since 1940 alone. It is the type species for the genus &quot;Salvia&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
The specific epithet &quot;officinalis&quot; refers to plants with a well-established medicinal or culinary value.

&quot;Salvia officinalis&quot; has numerous common names. Some of the best-known are sage, common sage, garden sage, golden sage, kitchen sage, true sage, culinary sage, Dalmatian sage, and broadleaf sage. Cultivated forms include purple sage and red sage.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Native to the Mediterranean region, it has been naturalized in many places throughout the world.

== Cultivation ==
In favourable conditions in the garden, &quot;S. officinalis&quot; can grow to a substantial size (1 square metre or more), but a number of cultivars are more compact. As such they are valued as small ornamental flowering shrubs, rather than for their herbal properties. Some provide low ground cover, especially in sunny dry environments. Like many herbs they can be killed by a cold wet winter, especially if the soil is not well drained. But they are easily propagated from summer cuttings, and some cultivars are produced from seeds.

Named cultivars include:
* &#x27;Alba&#x27;, a white-flowered cultivar
* &#x27;Aurea&#x27;, golden sage
* &#x27;Berggarten&#x27;, a cultivar with large leaves, which rarely blooms, extending the useful life of the leaves
* &#x27;Extrakta&#x27;, has leaves with higher oil concentrations
* &#x27;Icterina&#x27;, a cultivar with yellow-green variegated leaves
* &#x27;Lavandulaefolia&#x27;, a small leaved cultivar
* &#x27;Purpurascens&#x27; (&#x27;Purpurea&#x27;), a purple-leafed cultivar
* &#x27;Tricolor&#x27;, a cultivar with white, purple and green variegated leaves
&#x27;Icterina&#x27; and &#x27;Purpurascens&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==

=== Historical uses ===
&quot;Salvia officinalis&quot; has been used since ancient times for treating snakebites, increasing women&#x27;s fertility, and more. The Romans referred to sage as the &quot;holy herb,&quot; and employed it in their religious rituals. Theophrastus wrote about two different sages, a wild undershrub he called &quot;sphakos&quot;, and a similar cultivated plant he called &quot;elelisphakos&quot;. Pliny the Elder said the latter plant was called &quot;salvia&quot; by the Romans, and used as a diuretic, a local anesthetic for the skin, a styptic, and for other uses. Charlemagne recommended the plant for cultivation in the early Middle Ages, and during the Carolingian Empire, it was cultivated in monastery gardens. Walafrid Strabo described it in his poem &quot;Hortulus&quot; as having a sweet scent and being useful for many human ailments—he went back to the Greek root for the name and called it &quot;lelifagus&quot;.
The plant had a high reputation throughout the Middle Ages, with many sayings referring to its healing properties and value. It was sometimes called &quot;S. salvatrix&quot; (sage the savior). Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen all recommended sage as a diuretic, hemostatic, emmenagogue, and tonic. &quot;Le Menagier de Paris&quot;, in addition to recommending cold sage soup and sage sauce for poultry, recommends infusion of sage for washing hands at table. John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; (1597) states that sage &quot;is singularly good for the head and brain, it quickeneth the senses and memory, strengtheneth the sinews, restoreth health to those that have the palsy, and taketh away shakey trembling of the members.&quot; Gervase Markham&#x27;s &quot;The English Huswife&quot; (1615) gives a recipe for a tooth-powder of sage and salt. It appears in recipes for Four Thieves Vinegar, a blend of herbs which was supposed to ward off the plague. In past centuries, it was also used for hair care, insect bites and wasp stings, nervous conditions, mental conditions, oral preparations for inflammation of the mouth, tongue and throat, and also to reduce fevers.

=== Culinary ===


In Britain, sage has for generations been listed as one of the essential herbs, along with parsley, rosemary, and thyme (as in the folk song &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;). It has a savory, slightly peppery flavor. Sage appears in the 14th and 15th centuries in a &quot;Cold Sage Sauce&quot;, known in French, English and Lombard cuisine, probably traceable to its appearance in &quot;Le Viandier de Taillevent&quot;. It appears in many European cuisines, notably Italian, Balkan and Middle Eastern cookery. In Italian cuisine, it is an essential condiment for saltimbocca and other dishes, favored with fish. In British and American cooking, it is traditionally served as sage and onion stuffing, an accompaniment to roast turkey or chicken at Christmas or Thanksgiving Day, and for Sunday roast dinners. Other dishes include pork casserole, Sage Derby cheese and Lincolnshire sausages. Despite the common use of traditional and available herbs in French cuisine, sage never found favor there.

===Essential oil===

Common sage is grown in parts of Europe for distillation of an essential oil, although other species such as &quot;Salvia fruticosa&quot; may also be harvested and distilled with it.

===Research===
In 2014 and 2017, extracts of &quot;Salvia officinalis&quot; and &quot;S. lavandulaefolia&quot; were under preliminary research for their potential effects on human brain function. The thujone present in &quot;Salvia&quot; extracts may be neurotoxic.

<text>Salvia sclarea, the clary or clary sage (clary deriving from Middle English &quot;clarie&quot;, from Anglo-Norman &quot;sclaree&quot;, from Late or Medieval Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;clear&quot;), is a biennial (short-lived) herbaceous perennial in the genus &quot;Salvia&quot;. It is native to the northern Mediterranean Basin and to some areas in north Africa and Central Asia. The plant has long been cultivated as an herb and is currently grown for its essential oil.

==Description==
&quot;Salvia sclarea&quot; reaches in height, with thick, square stems covered in hairs. The leaves are approximately long at the base, and long higher up on the plant. The upper leaf surface is rugose, and covered with glandular hairs. The flowers are in verticils, with between two and six flowers in each verticil, and are held in large colorful bracts that range in color from pale mauve to lilac or white-to-pink with a pink mark on the edge. The lilac or pale-blue corolla is approximately , with the lips held wide open. The cultivar &quot;S. sclarea&quot; &#x27;Turkestanica&#x27; bears pink stems, petiolate leaves, and white, pink-flecked blossoms on spikes that grow up to tall.

==History==
The plant’s medicinal uses are described as far back as the 4th century BCE, in the writings of Theophrastus, as well as in the 1st century CE writings of Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder).

Clary seeds have a mucilaginous coat, which is why some centuries-old herbal guides recommend placing a seed into the eye of someone with a foreign object in it so that it could adhere to the object and make it easy to remove. This practice is noted by Nicholas Culpeper in his &quot;Complete Herbal&quot; (1653), who referred to the plant as &quot;clear-eye&quot;.

It has also long been used as an additive to wine and beer. In 16th-century Germany elderflower-infused clary was added to Rhine wines to make a more potent beverage known as Muscatel.

==Uses==
The distilled essential oil of &quot;Salvia sclarea&quot; is used widely in perfumes and as a muscatel-like flavoring for vermouths, wines, and liqueurs. It is also used in aromatherapy.

In the United States, this oil is mostly produced on a large scale in and around Bertie County in northeastern North Carolina.

The chemical sclareol contained in clary sage oil has a low molecular weight and is absorbed transdermally. In an experiment in which sclareol was dissolved in jojoba oil and applied to mice, (1) it was detected in the blood 30 minutes after application and (2) higher concentrations of sclareol were detected in the liver but did not cause liver dysfunction.

<text>The superfamily Ichneumonoidea contains one extinct and three extant families, including the two largest families within Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae and Braconidae. The group is thought to contain as many as 100,000 species, many of which have not yet been described. Like other parasitoid wasps, they were long placed in the &quot;Parasitica&quot;, variously considered as an infraorder or an unranked clade, now known to be paraphyletic.

==Etymology==

The name is derived from Latin &#x27;ichneumon&#x27;, from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, &quot;tracker&quot;), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, &quot;track, footstep&quot;). The name is shared with the Egyptian mongoose, &quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;.

==Description==

The superfamily is defined by fusion of the costal and radial veins of the fore wing, and almost all species have more than 11 antennal segments. Both included families have a cosmopolitan distribution. Ichneumonoids have morphological similarities with relatives within the order Hymenoptera, including ants and bees. Ichneumonoidea contains a great deal of morphological diversity, with species ranging in size from long. Most are slender, and the females of many species (particularly in the genus &quot;Megarhyssa&quot;) have extremely long ovipositors for laying eggs.

The ichneumonid wasps may be more familiar to non-entomologists than braconids, as they are generally larger. The two families are distinguished from each other primarily by details of wing venation.

=== Braconidae ===
Most are brownish or black, not brightly colored. Forewings lack vein 2m-cu.

=== Ichneumonidae ===
Ichneumonids vary greatly in size and their color varies from brightly colored to uniform black. Forewings with vein 2m-cu present and tubular.

==Evolution==

Parasitoidism evolved only once in the Hymenoptera during the Permian, leading to a single clade which contains the Apocrita and the Orussoidea, but has been secondarily lost multiple times. The Apocrita emerged from that clade during the Jurassic.

==Parasitic life cycle==
Ichneumonoids are solitary insects, and the vast majority are parasitoids; the larvae feed on or in another insect until it finally dies. Most hosts are holometabolous insect larvae, but there are many exceptions. In general, ichneumonoids are host specific, and only attack one or a few closely related host species. Many species use polydnaviruses to suppress the immune systems of their host insects. Due to the wide variety in hosts and lifestyles, see subfamily pages for more detail.

The female ichneumonoid finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host&#x27;s body. The ovipositor of ichneumonoids generally cannot deliver a sting as many wasps or bees do. It can be used to bore wood and lay eggs on hosts deep inside, or reach hosts hidden inside leaf shelters. Upon hatching, the larva feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when it is ready to pupate.

Various ichneumonoids are used as biological control agents in controlling horticultural or forest pests. An example is the relationship between the species &quot;Ichneumon eumerus&quot; and its host butterfly &quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot;. The butterfly larva is a parasite within &quot;Myrmica&quot; ant nests. The adult &quot;I. eumerus&quot; searches for ant nests and only enters when they contain &quot;P. rebeli&quot; caterpillars. Once inside, they oviposit within the caterpillars and escape the nest by releasing a chemical which causes the worker ants to fight each other rather than the intruding wasp. The wasp eggs then hatch inside the caterpillar and eventually consume and kill the host.

<doc id="433909" wikidata="Q3137429" url="?curid=433909" title="History of the Jews in the Soviet Union">
<text>The history of the Jews in the Soviet Union is inextricably linked to much earlier expansionist policies of the Russian Empire conquering and ruling the eastern half of the European continent already before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. &quot;For two centuries – wrote Zvi Gitelman – millions of Jews had lived under one entity, the Russian Empire and its successor state the USSR. They had now come under the jurisdiction of fifteen states, some of which had never existed and others that had passed out of existence in 1939.&quot; Before the revolutions of 1989 which resulted in the end of communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, a number of these now sovereign countries constituted the component republics of the Soviet Union.

==Armenia==

The history of the Jews in Armenia dates back more than 2,000 years. After Eastern Armenia came under Russian rule in the early 19th century, Jews began arriving from Poland and Iran, creating Ashkenazic and Mizrahi communities in Yerevan. More Jews moved to Armenia during its period as a Soviet republic finding more tolerance in the area than in Russia or Ukraine. After World War II, the Jewish population rose to approximately 5,000. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many left due to inadequate services and today the country&#x27;s Jewish population has shrunk to 750. Despite small numbers, a high intermarriage rate, and relative isolation, a great deal of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs. There are about 100 Jews presently living in Armenia, mainly in the capital Yerevan. They are mostly of Ashkenazi origin and some are Mizrahi Georgian Jews.

==Azerbaijan==

The History of the Jews in Azerbaijan (; ; ; ) dates back to Late Antiquity. Historically Jews in Azerbaijan have been represented by various subgroups, mainly Mountain Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Georgian Jews. After Sovietization all Zionism-related activities including those of cultural nature that were carried out in Hebrew were banned. In the early 1920s, a few hundred Mountain Jewish families from Azerbaijan and Dagestan left for Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. The next aliyah did not take place until the 1970s, after the ban on Jewish immigration to Israel was lifted (see Refusenik). Between 1972 and 1978 around 3,000 people left Azerbaijan for Israel. 1970 was the demographic peak for Azerbaijani Jews after World War II; according to the census, 41,288 Jews resided in Azerbaijan that year.

Many Jewish émigrés from Azerbaijan settled in Tel-Aviv and Haifa. There are relatively large communities of Mountain Jewish expatriates from Azerbaijan in New York City and Toronto. Similar to many immigrant communities of the Czarist and Soviet eras in Azerbaijan, Ashkenazi Jews appear to be linguistically Russified. The majority of Ashkenazi Jews speak Russian as their first language with Azeri sometimes being spoken as the second. The number of Yiddish-speakers is unknown.

==Belarus==

By the end of the 19th century, many Belarusian Jews were part of the general flight of Jews from Eastern Europe to the New World due to conflicts and &quot;pogroms&quot; engulfing the Russian Empire and the anti-Semitism of the Russian &quot;czars&quot;. Millions of Jews, including tens of thousands of Jews from Belarus, emigrated to the United States of America and South Africa. A small number also emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. During the first years of Soviet occupation of Belarus, Jews were able to get powerful positions in the country&#x27;s government and intelligentisa. 
In WWII, atrocities against the intelligentisa in the German-conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (task groups).
The Jews in Belarus, then known as Byelorussian SSR were the third largest ethnic group in the country in the first half of the 20th century. Before World War II, Jews were the third among the ethnic groups in Belarus and comprised more than 40% of the population in cities and towns. The population of cities such as Minsk, Pinsk, Mahiliou, Babrujsk, Viciebsk, and Homiel was more than 50% Jewish. In 1897 there were 724,548 Jews in Belarus, or 13.6% of the total population. Some 800,000 Jews—90% of the Jewish population—were killed in Belarus during the Holocaust. According to the 2009 census, there were 12,926 Jews in Belarus (0.1% of the population). The Jewish Agency estimates the community of Jews in Belarus at 70,000. Marc Chagall, Mendele Mocher Sforim, Chaim Weizmann and Menachem Begin were born in Belarus. 

In the second half of the 20th century, there was a large wave of Belarusian Jews immigrating to Israel (see &quot;Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s&quot;), as well as to the United States. In 1979, there were 135,400 Jews in Belarus; a decade later, 112,000 were left. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Belarusian independence saw most of the community, along with the majority of the former Soviet Union&#x27;s Jewish population, leave for Israel (see &quot;Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s&quot;). The 1999 census estimated that there were only 29,000 Jews left in the country. However, local Jewish organizations put the number at 50,000, and the Jewish Agency believes that there are 70,000. About half of the country&#x27;s Jews live in Minsk. Despite general antisemitism, national Jewish organizations, local cultural groups, religious schools, charitable organizations, and organizations for war veterans and Holocaust survivors have been formed. Since the mass immigration of the 1990s, there has been some continuous immigration to Israel. In 2002, 974 Belarusians moved to Israel, and between 2003 and 2005, 4,854 followed suit.

==Estonia==
The history of the Jews in Estonian SSR starts with individual reports of Jews in what is now Estonia from as early as the 14th century. However, the process of permanent Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, especially after they were granted the official right to enter the region by a statute of Russian Tsar Alexander II in 1865. This allowed the so-called Jewish &#x27;Nicholas soldiers&#x27; (often former &quot;cantonists&quot;) and their descendants, First Guild merchants, artisans, and Jews with higher education to settle in Estonia and other parts of the Russian Empire outside their Pale of Settlement. The &quot;Nicholas soldiers&quot; and their descendants, and artisans were, basically, the ones who founded the first Jewish congregations in Estonia. The Tallinn congregation, the largest in Estonia, was founded in 1830. The Tartu congregation was established in 1866 when the first fifty families settled there. Synagogues were built, the largest of which were constructed in Tallinn in 1883 and Tartu in 1901. Both of these were subsequently destroyed by fire in World War II.

The life of the small Jewish community in Estonia was disrupted in 1940 with the Soviet occupation of Estonia. Cultural autonomy together with all its institutions was liquidated in July 1940. In July and August of the same year all organisations, associations, societies and corporations were closed. Jewish businesses were nationalized. A relatively large number of Jews (350–450, about 10% of the total Jewish population) were deported into prison camps in Russia by the Soviet authorities on 14 June 1941. In WWII, more than 75% of Estonia&#x27;s Jewish community, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all the remainder (between 950 and 1000 men, women and children) had been killed by the end of 1941. The four Estonians held most responsible for the murders at Kalevi-Liiva were accused at war crimes trials in 1961. Two were later executed; the others avoided sentencing by having gone to exile. From 1944 until 1988 the Estonian Jewish community had no organisations, associations, or clubs. In March 1988, as the process towards regaining Estonia&#x27;s independence was beginning, the Jewish Cultural Society was established in Tallinn. It was the first of its kind in the late Soviet Union. Unlike in other parts of the Soviet Union, there were no problems with registering either the society or its symbols. The Society began by organising concerts and lectures. Soon the question of founding a Jewish school arose. As a start, a Sunday school was established in 1989. The Tallinn Jewish Gymnasium on Karu Street was being used by a vocational school. In 1990, a Jewish School with grades 1 through 9 was established.

==Georgia==

The Georgian Jews () are from Georgia, in the Caucasus. Georgian Jews are one of the oldest communities in Georgia, tracing their migration into the country during the Babylonian captivity in 6th century BC. In 1801, the Russian Empire annexed Eastern Georgia. In the beginning of the 19th century, Ashkenazi Russian Jews were forced to move to Georgia by the Russian government. The Ashkenazi Jews and the Georgian Jews began establishing contact with each other, but relations were strained. Georgian Jews viewed the Ashkenazim as godless and secular, while the Ashkenazim looked down on the Georgian Jews. Zionism was a uniting cause for the two groups. Beginning in 1863, groups of Jews began making aliyah, mostly for religious reasons. The Red Army invaded Georgia in February 1921, prompting a mass exodus from the region.
==Russia==

==Ukraine==
Jews living in the Ukrainian SSR underwent Sovietization, together with the rest of the population of the Soviet Union.

Like all Ukrainians, Ukrainian Jews were targeted and murdered during the Holocaust when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. Although calculation is difficult, Jewish scholars estimate a total of 1.5 million Ukrainian Jews were killed, leaving only 40% of the Jewish population prior to the war. In 1941, when Western Ukraine was taken over by Germany, Jews were put into ghettos and later sent to death camps where they were murdered. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were responsible for the mass murder of up to a million Ukrainian Jews.

The number of Jews in Ukraine has drastically decreased since the late 20th century. The 2001 census showed that 380,000 Jews left Ukraine since 1989, which was of the entire Jewish population.

<doc id="433911" wikidata="Q1331918" url="?curid=433911" title="2004 European Parliament election">
<text>The 2004 European Parliament election was held between 10 and 13 June 2004 in the 25 member states of the European Union, using varying election days according to local custom. The European Parliamental parties could not be voted for, but elected national parties aggregated in European Parliamental parties after the elections.

Votes were counted as the polls closed, but results were not announced until 13 and 14 June so results from one country would not influence voters in another where polls were still open; however, the Netherlands, voting on Thursday 10, announced nearly complete provisional results as soon as they were counted, on the evening of its election day, a move heavily criticized by the European Commission.

342 million people were eligible to vote, the second-largest democratic electorate in the world after India. It was the biggest transnational direct election in history, and the 10 new member states elected MEPs for the first time. The new (6th) Parliament consisted of 732 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).

Results showed a general defeat of governing parties and an increase in representatives from eurosceptic parties. No majority was achieved. The balance of power in the Parliament remained the same (largest party EPP-ED, second largest PES) despite the 10 new member states.

The English Democrats party appeared in England for the first time in 5 of the 9 English Constituencies, campaigning for an English Parliament and against English &#x27;European&#x27; regions.
* A European Union-wide political party, the European Greens, was established in Rome on 21 February 2004 to contest this election.
* Swedish Junilistan (the June list) formed early in the year, meant to provide social democratic and right wing voters an EU sceptic alternative.
* In the Netherlands Europa Transparant of Paul van Buitenen got two seats.
* In Austria the &quot;Liste Hans-Peter Martin&quot; obtained two seats.

==New inclusion==

Gibraltar participated as a result of the judgement in Matthews v. United Kingdom

== Political group reshuffle after the 2004 election ==

* &quot;Liberals:&quot; The European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party created a new grouping by allying with MEPs from the French party Union for French Democracy (previously part of the EPP-ED), the Margherita Party (Italy) (previously part of the EPP-ED), other Italian members, the Lithuanian Labour Party and the Belgian MR-MCC (previously EPP-ED). The new allies formed the EDP and a new combined group, between the ELDR and the EDP, was formed with the name ALDE: the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
* &quot;Eurosceptics:&quot; Sweden&#x27;s Junilistan, the anti-abortion League of Polish Families, and the French Combats Souverainistes joined the existing Europe of Democracies and Diversities group, which already included the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The group renamed itself Independence and Democracy (ID).

<text>Border Morris is a collection of individual local dances from villages along the English side of the Wales–England border in the counties of Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. They are part of the Morris dance tradition.

== History ==

This was a village dance done in winter for fun and a bit of money. It usually includes three to twelve dancers.

Some of the earliest accounts of a border morris tradition are provided by E.C. Cawte. There is reference to questions about &quot;any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers, or mum&#x27;ers&quot; to St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Church in Shrewsbury in 1584 and an amazing account of morris dancers at Hereford races in 1609, describing &quot;two musicians, four whifflers, and twelve dancers, including hobby horse and maid marian&quot;, all from villages within of Hereford. The account claimed, &quot;Hereford-shire for a morris-daunce puts downe, not onely all Kent, but verie neare (if one had line enough to measure it) three quarters of Christendome&quot;.

Cawte quotes further accounts describing complaints to the local magistrates about disruptive morris dancers in Longdon, Worcestershire, disrupting the Sabbath day from 1614 to 1617 and another account of dancers in Much Wenlock in 1652, causing a disturbance in an ale house at Nordley. Later records from Shrewsbury mention payment to the &quot;Bedlam Morris&quot; in 1688 and 1689.

The dance depends on the numbers available, as at Brimfield. The dances collected from a particular place sometimes differ quite markedly between informants, as at White Ladies Aston, reflecting the flexibility from year to year. Sometimes a gang would only have one dance, sometimes two, or as at Malvern and Pershore an indeterminate set of figures.
The common features are the rather short sticks and sometimes a stick and handkerchief version of the same dance, also usually a high single step akin to the local country dance step. Such detail as starting foot rules and phrase endings are notable for their apparent absence.

Some of these village sides blackened their faces . There is no record of any sides dancing together. A few – both Upton-on-Severn dances for example – matched the complexity of Cotswolds Morris, but many – e.g. Bromsberrow Heath – had a stark simplicity of one figure and one chorus repeated forever.

== Revival ==

In the 1960s, E.C. Cawte, the folklorist, proposed that these dances from the English side of the Welsh borders – Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire – constituted a Welsh border tradition.


Since the 1960s and with further collecting in the 1970s by people such as Dave Jones (late of Silurian Morris, founded 1969, and later the Not For Joes) and Keith Francis (of Silurian Morris) a distinctive border morris style has grown. The tradition is characterised by black faces, tattered shirts or coats, much stick-clashing and a big band traditionally comprising melodeons, fiddles, concertinas, triangles and tambourines, although they now often also feature a tuba or sousaphone, and flute or oboe.

Under the guidance of Dave Jones and Keith Francis, Silurian Border Morris sought to interpret the collected dance material, preserving as much of the traditional styles and features as can be deduced. By contrast, in 1975, John Kirkpatrick created a new border tradition with the Shropshire Bedlams, which seeks to capture the spirit of the border sides, but not recreate any specific tradition or dance. Their dances feature much &quot;whooping&quot; and this has become characteristic amongst many other border sides. Perhaps in keeping with the original tradition, the Original Welsh Border Morris (founded 1973) meet only once a year, at Christmas, and dance the traditional dances of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. With many of the newer sides, the dances have often become complex, involving many invented and evolved steps, figures and choruses.

Many dances were collected by Cecil Sharp and later collectors, and several were included in Bacon&#x27;s book, but border morris was largely neglected by revival morris sides until late in the 20th century. The Silurian Morris Men of Ledbury, Herefordshire, included border dances in performances from the early 1970s and changed exclusively to border morris in 1979, and the Shropshire Bedlams were founded in 1975; both became pioneers of a resurgence of border morris among revival sides in the following decades.
The Leominster Morris were reformed in 1988, split from The Breinton Morris (who disbanded after a further ten years.) Through contact with E.C. Cawte, with reference to notes made in Leominster, his talking with former dancer, Tom Postons, and his recollections of the dancing of the time as having &quot;lots of bowing, hat-raising, and clashing of sticks on the ground&quot; led to the &quot;revival&quot; of Postons&#x27; stick dance. Cecil Sharp visited the town on 27 December 1909 with local folklorist Ella Mary Leather, and collected tunes from the prolific local gypsy fiddler John Locke. The Leominster men use several of Locke&#x27;s tunes in their repertoire today.

Border morris dancing was different on the Welsh side of the border, and a team on the Welsh side was formed in 1992. Initially the side was named Morys ar y Clwt but it was changed to Carreg-las in 1997. They use traditional Welsh and English folk and morris dance tunes. &quot;Carreg-las&quot; translates from the Welsh as &#x27;bluestone&#x27;, a rock found in the Preseli Mountains, in Pembrokeshire, of which it is said Stonehenge was constructed.

<text>Kensington Market is a distinctive multicultural neighbourhood in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Market is an older neighbourhood and one of the city&#x27;s best-known. In November 2006, it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Robert Fulford wrote in 1999 that &quot;Kensington today is as much a legend as a district. The (partly) outdoor market has probably been photographed more often than any other site in Toronto.&quot;

Its approximate borders are College St. on the north, Spadina Ave. on the east, Dundas St. W. to the south, and Bathurst St. to the west. Most of the neighbourhood&#x27;s eclectic shops, cafes, and other attractions are located along Augusta Ave. and neighbouring Nassau St., Baldwin St., and Kensington Ave. In addition to the Market, the neighbourhood features many Victorian homes, the Kensington Community School, Bellevue Square and Toronto Western Hospital.

==History==
===Early history===
George Taylor Denison, after serving in the Canadian Militia during the War of 1812, purchased an area of land in 1815 from Queen Street West to Bloor Street, roughly between where Augusta and Lippincott Streets now run. Denison used the area now known as Bellevue Square Park as a parade ground for his volunteer cavalry troop, which he commanded during the Upper Canada Rebellion. This troop later became the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards. 
 In 1837 a brewery opened in the area of St Andrew Street and Kensington Avenue (marked in 1858 map of the area) and after several ownership changes ceased operations in 1894.

The Denison estate was subdivided in the 1850s. During the 1880s, houses were built on small plots for Irish and Scottish immigrant labourers coming to Toronto; much of the housing is in the style of Victorian architecture row houses, which are moderate in size and exemplify true Victorian architecture. Many of these houses still stand along Wales Avenue and elsewhere, and these homes have been inhabited by many waves of immigrants in the decades that followed. Housing found closer to the market area tends to feature retail at the front of the house.

During the early twentieth century, Kensington became populated by eastern European Jewish immigrants and some Italians, who moved there from &quot;The Ward&quot;, an overcrowded immigrant-reception area between Yonge Street and University Avenue. The Ward was a cluster of densely packed houses and was one of the poorer areas of the city. The Ward&#x27;s residents moved west of Spadina Ave to enjoy less population density, better housing conditions, and opportunities to create storefront businesses. 

In the 1920s, the area became known as &quot;the Jewish Market&quot;. Jewish merchants operated small shops as tailors, furriers and bakers. Around 60,000 Jews lived in and around Kensington Market during the 1920s and 1930s, worshipping at over 30 local synagogues. From the beginning, the market sold items imported from the homelands of many immigrant communities.

===Post-war developments===
After the Second World War, most of the Jewish population moved north to neighbourhoods uptown or in the suburbs. During the 1950s, a large number of immigrants from the Azores, fleeing political conflict with the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, moved into the area and further west along Dundas Street. The arrival of new waves of immigrants from the Caribbean and East Asia changed the community, making it even more diverse as the century wore on. The Vietnam War brought a number of American political refugees to the neighbourhood, and particularly to nearby Baldwin Village, adding a unique utopian flavour to local politics. As Chinatown is located just east of Kensington, the Chinese are now the largest ethnic group. During the 1980s and 1990s, identifiable groups of immigrants came from Central America, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Iran, Vietnam, Chile and other global trouble spots.

In the 1960s there were plans to tear down the densely packed small houses and replace them with large, apartment-style housing projects, as was done to neighbouring Alexandra Park. These plans came to an end with the election of David Crombie as Mayor of Toronto. Crombie was strongly opposed to the massive urban restructuring plans that had been in vogue in previous decades.

===Recent development===
The market resisted the recession of the 1980s partially thanks to a floating population of students attending George Brown College, which was where the Kensington Lofts are today. George Brown College sold the property in the mid-1990s and without the extra student traffic, many stores were victims of the recession of the mid to late 90s. In addition, many Portuguese store owners were by that time too old to continue working their small shops, which led to abundant vacancy and invited a new wave of immigrant entrepreneurs. Businesses like La Perola, El Emporio Latino and El Buen Precio took advantage of the growing wave of Latin American immigrants and opened the door to offering ethnic street foods. Jumbo Empanadas was one of the first to spice up the flavours of the market from a cart; later moved into a basement close to Nassau, and then to its current location. All other Latin shops started selling their Pupusas, and by 2000, a young couple of entrepreneurs opened the first taqueria in Canada, calling it &quot;El Trompo&quot;.

All this movement lead to a rebirth of Augusta Avenue. However, there were seedy spots whose patrons scared away the fiercest yuppies. A Nike store tried to open up in the market and the community rejected it very strongly by dumping dozens of running shoes splattered with red paint in protest for the treatment Nike&#x27;s workers receive around the world. Eventually, such businesses (both too seedy and too mainstream) transformed or moved out. The Nike store was a tremendous corporate failure.

Today the neighbourhood is a noted tourist attraction, and a centre of Toronto&#x27;s cultural life as artists and writers moved into the area. Land prices in the area have increased sharply, but despite its increased appeal to professionals, Kensington remains a predominantly working-class, immigrant community. In 2021, after a year of neighbourhood organizing to resist the eviction and displacement of residents of a 3-storey building, a local Community Land Trust was able to purchase the building and preserve the affordable rents provided. The Kensington Market Community Land Trust continues to own and operate the building as of 2024.

Kensington is protected by a variety of policies, mainly to enhance the atmosphere that is unique to the neighbourhood. In November 2006, Kensington Market was proclaimed a National Historic Site of Canada. Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Official Plan&quot;, which is the vision for the city until 2026, does not designate much change for the neighbourhood as seen in its land use map for the neighbourhood. With no major change, one can assume that Kensington is very much a stable neighbourhood.

In addition to the Official Plan, Kensington is subject to &quot;Site and Area Specific Policy.&quot; The policies which relate to proposed developments state, &quot;Any public or private developments and work should be consistent with the special characteristics of the area.&quot; The new developments must adhere to these guidelines which include:
*low-scale buildings with retail at grade (street level);
*minimal setbacks;
*open-air display of goods on the boulevard.
Through city policy, the Kensington uniqueness will be upheld for all to enjoy.

==Characteristics==
===Cars and pedestrians===

Narrow streets make the market challenging for those driving and especially parking in the neighbourhood. On Saturdays and some late afternoons, pedestrians walk freely down the middle of the street or between slow-moving cars. In the 2006 Canadian Census, 34.59% of Kensington residents walked to work, compared to 7.10% of City of Toronto residents. When considering the car, 15.70% of Kensington residents used a vehicle to get to work, whereas 49.39% City of Toronto residents drove a vehicle to commute to work.

Since 2004, residents and businesses have organized a series of Pedestrian Sunday events. Parts of Augusta St., Baldwin St. and Kensington Ave. are closed to motorized traffic and the streets become a pedestrian mall. Live music, dancing, street theatre and games are among the special events on the closed streets. Typically taking place on the last Sunday of every month, this type of event has been organized on half a dozen weekends a year since 2005.

===Commercial gentrification===
A small supermarket, Zimmerman&#x27;s Freshmart, opened in the Market in February 2005, leading to some controversy. Danny Zimmerman, the cousin of Freshmart&#x27;s owner and the owner of a rival store across the street, expressed concern it would compete with smaller businesses, or would otherwise lead to a more &quot;corporate&quot; market. Zimmerman&#x27;s Freshmart closed in 2016. The arrival of COBS Bread in 2006 continues this potential trend, though COBS shuttered in 2014 and was replaced by the independent Black Bird Bakery.

===Landmarks===

Some notable landmarks include the Number 8 Fire Station, Tom&#x27;s Place, Bellevue Square Park with a statue of actor Al Waxman, and St. Stephen&#x27;s Community House. Percy Faith, the 1950s composer and band leader, lived as a child at 171 Baldwin Street. His uncle, Louis Roterbergh, a master violinist, taught him the violin, and was reputed to play at the house at Baldwin as crowds gathered below to listen. Bellevue Square contains a plaque given to Kensington Market in 2006 officially recognizing it as a national historic site.

A non-permanent landmark of Kensington Market is the Garden Car, which has been a staple of the neighbourhood since 2007. Originally built in 2006 by local advocacy group Streets are for People, the car is a public art piece that doubles as a community garden. There have been 3 cars since the inception of the first Garden Car.

===Shops===
The area is filled with a mix of food stores selling an immense variety of meats, fish and produce. There are also several bakeries, spice and dry goods stores, and cheese shops. Stores sell a wide variety of new and used clothing, and there are discount and surplus stores. It is also home to many restaurants covering a wide variety of styles and ethnicities. A unique architectural feature of the neighbourhood are the extensions built onto the front of many buildings (which would be against by-laws in other places).
In recent years, the neighbourhood has seen a small explosion of upscale cafés, restaurants and clubs, replacing many of the older ethnic businesses. There has been much speculation that Kensington&#x27;s long history as an immigrant working-class neighbourhood is near its end.

====Counterculture====

Businesses such as Manifestudio, a photo gallery and eco-politics community space run by GlobalAware Independent Media, help create an environment friendly to radical politics. Trotskyists are sometimes seen handing out pamphlets at the corner of Baldwin and Kensington. Over the past two decades, several alternative bookstores have flourished in Kensington Market, including Who&#x27;s Emma, the Anarchist Free Space, and Uprising Books.

One of Canada&#x27;s most famous independent bookstores, This Ain&#x27;t the Rosedale Library, also moved to Kensington from Church and Wellesley in 2008. It later closed in June 2010, failing to pay rent.

Performance spaces like Bread &amp; Circus (2009–2011), Double Double Land (2009–2018) and Videofag (2012–2016) have helped cultivate Kensington Market&#x27;s vibrant independent arts scene.

==Culture==
===Festivals===

The annual &quot;Kensington Market Festival of Lights&quot;, which is now known as the Kensington Market Winter Solstice Festival, is celebrated as a parade on the streets of Kensington Market during the Winter Solstice in December. This carnival parade of giant puppets, firebreathers, stiltwalkers and samba musicians was created and founded by Ida Carnevali in 1987 as a way of beckoning the return of the sun on the longest night of the year. Artists and groups such as the Samba Squad, Shadowland Theatre, Clay &amp; Paper Theatre, Richard Underhill, the Befana Choir and the Kensington Horns participate in this event. For many years, the parade ended in a post-sunset concert and spectacle in Bellevue Square; since 2009, the parade has ended at Alexandra Park to handle the larger crowd.

The Pedestrian Sundays festival is a car-free festival where the streets close to cars in several Sundays in the summer. The festival ran for five years, attracting many people to party on the streets of Kensington Market, including bands, street foods, etc.

Bellevue Square Park hosts many concerts and festivals throughout late spring and summer. In addition, the Chiaroscuro Reading Series is held the second Tuesday of each month at Augusta House. Prominent science fiction, fantasy, and horror authors offer readings of their works.
===Kensington in popular culture===

Former Toronto mayor Mel Lastman and actor Al Waxman (who starred in the CBC Television series &quot;King of Kensington&quot;) were both born and raised in the Kensington Market neighbourhood. After Waxman&#x27;s death in 2001, he was honoured with a statue in the north-west corner of Bellevue Square Park. In addition to &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, Kensington Market has been the setting for the television series &quot;Twitch City&quot;, which was filmed above the record store Paradise Bound, and &quot;Katts and Dog&quot; as well as the street riot scenes of the 1984 comedy &quot;Police Academy&quot;. Kensington Market was the primary setting for Cory Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town&quot;.

Canadian singer-songwriter Murray McLauchlan mentions Kensington Market in his 1975 song &quot;Down By The Henry Moore.&quot;

&quot;Kids&#x27; CBC&quot;, the daily children&#x27;s programming block on CBC Television, includes some interstitial segments featuring Mamma Yamma, who owns a vegetable stand in Kensington Market. Played by puppeteer Ali Eisner, Mamma Yamma teaches children about food-related subjects such as nutrition, table manners and basic mathematics, and also often incorporates celebrity and musical guests.

2011 GNR % 29.4

Kensington has a lot of diversity, particularly a large Chinese ethnicity due to its close proximity to Chinatown. 47.5% of Kensington&#x27;s population is Chinese, compared to 10% in Toronto overall. 7% of Kensington Market&#x27;s population is from other parts of Asia, 3% Latin, 0.5% Arab, 3% Black, and 39% of the population is Caucasian. The diversity of Kensington Market&#x27;s population is seen in the generation status of its population in Census Tract 535.0038.00. In 2011 the National Household Survey found, 58% of Kensington Market&#x27;s population were first-generation Canadians, 17% were second-generation Canadians and 25% were third-generation Canadians or more. Kensington Market in 2011 had 2240 first-generation Canadians, 655 second-generation Canadians and 985 third-generation Canadians or more.

The Global Non-Response Rate (GNR) for the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) for census tract 5350038.00, Kensington Market, was 29.4% (Census 2011).

According to Stats Canada, the population of Kensington Market increased by approximately 300 people (or 7%) from 3,740 in 2006 to 4,029 in 2011. Breaking this number down into generation status, it has been found that first-generation residents increased by 75 and second-generation residents increased by 20. The remaining 200 or so residents of the area are placed in the third generation or more category. Thus, the number of third-generation or more residents increased significantly from 2006 to 2011. In terms of percentages, from 2006 to 2011, first-generation residents dropped about 7% from 64.92% to 57.73%. Second generation residents decreased slightly from 19.04% in 2006 to 16.88% in 2011 while the percentage of third-generation or more residents increased dramatically from 16.04% in 2006 to 25.39% in 2011, which represents approximately a 10% increase in residents from this generation status. (Census/NHS 2011, Census 2006)

=== Canadian Citizenship ===
According to the 2006 Canadian Census (0038.00 census tract), approximately 76% of the residents at Kensington Market are Canadian citizens. Of that 76%, 9% are under the age of 18. This means that 24% of Kensington Market&#x27;s population is non-Canadian citizens, a figure that speaks to Kensington Market&#x27;s character as a hub for multiculturalism. Furthermore, in 2011 the National Household Survey reported very similar data. Although the population accounted by citizenship status increased from 2006 and 2011, the percentage of those with Canadian citizenship versus those without the citizenship remained the same. In 2006, 2800 residents reported that they were Canadian citizens whereas 870 residents reported they did not hold Canadian citizenship.

In 2011, 2950 residents reported they were Canadian citizens whereas 930 residents reported that they did not hold Canadian citizenship. Comparing this to the Canadian ratio between Canadian and non-Canadian citizenship data from the census for 2006 and 2011 the ratio changed by 0.4% resulting in an increase in non-Canadian citizens within the population that received the long-form survey and the National Household Survey (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS). Although this per cent increase is small, when speaking on the national scale, this 0.4% increase in ratio involved 32,852,320 respondents for 2011 and 31,241,030 respondents for 2006 (Census 2006; Census 2011). Comparing that with the minimal increase which was 0.3% in ratio for Kensington where the population was not as substantial, this increase is not as substantial as well (Census 2006; Census 2011 NHS).

=== Housing status ===
Census tract 0038.00 of the 2006 Canadian Census and 2011 Canadian census revealed information about the population&#x27;s housing status in the Kensington Market neighbourhood. According to the former source, 59% of the population or 940 out of 1595 people were renting their homes. The latter source reported that the percentage increased to 64% (1135 out of 1765 people).

===Religion===

Two synagogues remain in the Market from the early 20th-century period when the area was the centre of Toronto&#x27;s Jewish community: Anshei Minsk on St. Andrews Street and the Kiever Synagogue on Bellevue Avenue.

In recent years Kensington Market has been associated with the Rastafari movement. There are several stores situated around the Market that sell Rastafarian cultural items, including a small flea-market. The winter solstice festival, formally known as the Kensington Market Festival of Lights, occurs annually and is an important gathering of Ontario&#x27;s pagan community.

<text>The Ichneumonidae, also known as ichneumon wasps, ichneumonid wasps, ichneumonids, or Darwin wasps, are a family of parasitoid wasps of the insect order Hymenoptera. They are one of the most diverse groups within the Hymenoptera with roughly 25,000 species described . However, this likely represents less than a quarter of their true richness as reliable estimates are lacking, along with much of the most basic knowledge about their ecology, distribution, and evolution. It is estimated that there are more species in this family than there are species of birds and mammals combined. Ichneumonid wasps, with very few exceptions, attack the immature stages of holometabolous insects and spiders, eventually killing their hosts. They play an important role as regulators of insect populations, both in natural and semi-natural systems, making them promising agents for biological control.

The distribution of the ichneumonids was traditionally considered an exception to the common latitudinal gradient in species diversity, since the family was thought to be at its most species-rich in the temperate zone instead of the tropics, but numerous new tropical species have now been discovered.

==Etymology and history==
Insects in the family Ichneumonidae are commonly called ichneumon wasps, or ichneumonids. However, the term ichneumon wasps can refer specifically to the genus &quot;Ichneumon&quot; within the Ichneumonidae and thus can cause confusion. A group of ichneumonid specialists have proposed Darwin wasps as a better vernacular name for the family. Less exact terms are ichneumon flies (they are not closely related to true flies) and scorpion wasps due to the extreme lengthening and curving of the abdomen (scorpions are arachnids, not insects).

The name is derived from Latin &#x27;ichneumon&#x27;, from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, &quot;tracker&quot;), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, &quot;track, footstep&quot;). The name first appeared in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;History of Animals&quot;, c. 343 BC. Aristotle noted that the ichneumon preys upon spiders, is a wasp smaller than ordinary wasps, and carries its prey to a hole which they lay their larvae inside, and that they seal the hole with mud. Aristotle&#x27;s writing, however, more accurately describes the mud daubers than the true ichneumon wasps, which do not construct mud nests and do not sting.

==Description==
Adult ichneumonids superficially resemble other wasps. They have a slender waist, two pairs of wings, a pair of large compound eyes on the side of the head and three ocelli on top of the head. Their size varies considerably from a few millimetres to seven or more centimetres.

The ichneumonids have more antennal segments than typical, aculeate wasps (Aculeata: Vespoidea and Apoidea): ichneumonids typically possess 16 or more, while most other wasps have 13 or fewer. Unlike aculeate wasps, which have an ovipositor modified for prey capture and defense, and do not pass their eggs along the stinger, ichneumonid females have an unmodified ovipositor which they use to lay eggs inside or on their host. Ichneumonids generally inject venom along with the egg, but only larger species (some in the genera &quot;Netelia&quot; and &quot;Ophion&quot;) with relatively short ovipositors use the ovipositor in defense. Males do not possess stingers or ovipositors in either lineage.
Ichneumonids are distinguished from their sister group Braconidae mainly on the basis of wing venation. The fore wing of 95% of ichneumonids has vein 2m-cu (in the Comstock–Needham system), which is absent in braconids. Vein 1rs-m of the fore wing is absent in all ichneumonids, but is present in 85% of braconids. In the hind wing of ichneumonids, vein rs-m joins Rs apical to (or rarely opposite) the split between veins Rs and R1. In braconids, vein rs-m joins basal to this split. The taxa also differ in the structure of the metasoma: about 90% of ichneumonids have a flexible suture between tergites 2 and 3, whereas these tergites are fused in braconids (though the suture is secondarily flexible in Aphidiinae).

==Distribution==
Ichneumonids are found on all continents with the exception of Antarctica. They inhabit virtually all terrestrial habitats, wherever there are suitable invertebrate hosts.

The distribution of ichneumonid species richness is subject to ongoing debate. Long believed to be rare in the tropics, and at its most species rich in the temperate region, the family became a classic textbook example of an &#x27;exceptional&#x27; latitudinal diversity gradient. Recently this belief has been questioned, after the discovery of numerous new tropical species.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1098/rspb.2012.1664&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1371/journal.pone.0032101&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction and diet==
A very few ichneumonid species lay their eggs in the ground, but the vast majority inject eggs either directly into their host&#x27;s body or onto its surface, and this may require penetration of substrate around the host, as in wood-boring host larvae that live deep inside of tree trunks, requiring the ichneumon to drill its ovipositor through several centimeters of solid wood (e.g., &quot;Megarhyssa&quot; species). After hatching, the ichneumonid larva consumes its still living host. The most common hosts are larvae or pupae of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Some species in the subfamily Pimplinae also parasitise spiders. Hyperparasitoids such as Mesochorinae oviposit inside the larvae of other ichneumonoids. The hosts of some species are agricultural pests, therefore ichneumons are sometimes valuable for biological pest control, but the hosts of most species are unknown; host information has been reviewed and summarized by various researchers, e.g. Aubert, Perkins. and Townes.

Ichneumonids use both idiobiont and koinobiont strategies. Idiobionts paralyze their host and prevent it from moving or growing. Koinobionts allow their host to continue to grow and develop. In both strategies, the host typically dies after some weeks, after which the ichneumonid larva emerges and pupates. 

Adult ichneumonids feed on a diversity of foods, including plant sap and nectar; females of some species also feed on their hosts by sipping body fluids released during oviposition, or even stabbing host and non-host insects to imbibe their body fluids. They spend much of their active time searching, either for hosts (female ichneumonids) or for emerging females (male ichneumonids).
The parasitism pressure exerted by ichneumonids can be tremendous, and they are often one of the major regulators of invertebrate populations. It is quite common for 10-20% or more of a host&#x27;s population to be parasitised (though reported parasitism rates often include non-ichneumonid parasitoids).

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The taxonomy of the ichneumonids is still poorly known. The family is highly diverse, containing 24,000 described species. Approximately 60,000 species are estimated to exist worldwide, though some estimates place this number at over 100,000. They are severely undersampled, and studies of their diversity typically produce very high numbers of species which are represented by only a single individual. Due to the high diversity, the existence of numerous small and hard to identify species, and the majority of species being undiscovered, it has proven difficult to resolve the phylogeny of the ichneumonids. Even the relationships between subfamilies are unclear. The sheer diversity also means DNA sequence data is only available for a tiny fraction of the species, and detailed cladistic studies require major computing capacity.

Extensive catalogues of the ichneumonids include those by Aubert, Gauld, Perkins, and Townes. Due to the taxonomic difficulties involved, however, their classifications and terminology are often confusingly contradictory. Several prominent authors have gone as far as to publish major reviews that defy the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

The large number of species in Ichneumonidae may be due to the evolution of parasitoidism in Hymenoptera, which occurred approximately 247 million years ago. Ichneumonidae is the basal branch of Apocrita, which together with Orussoidea makes up the lineage in which parasitoidism in Hymenoptera evolved, and some ichneumonids are thought to have been in stasis for millions of years and closely resemble the common ancestor in which parasitoidism evolved. This common ancestor was likely an Ectoparasitoid woodwasp that parasitized wood-boring beetle larvae in trees. However, this has been disputed as early fossil ichneumonoids (such as Praeichneumonidae, Tanychorinae, Eoichneumoninae, and Protorhyssalinae) have ovipositors that are only a few milimeters long. Therefore, it has been proposed that they make unlikely candidates for parasitoids of wood-boring hosts. The family has existed since at least the Early Cretaceous ( 125 mya), but probably appeared already in the Jurassic (c. 181 mya), soon after the appearance of its major host groups. It diversified during the Oligocene.

===Subfamilies===
In 1999, the extant ichneumonids were divided into 39 subfamilies, whose names and definitions have varied considerably. In 2019, combined morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family resulted in the following 41 subfamilies being recognized, in addition to the extinct Labenopimplinae.

==Darwin and the Ichneumonidae==

The perceived cruelty of the ichneumonids troubled philosophers, naturalists, and theologians in the 19th century, who found the parasitoid life cycle inconsistent with the notion of a world created by a loving and benevolent God. Charles Darwin found the example of the Ichneumonidae so troubling that it contributed to his increasing doubts about the nature and existence of a Creator. In an 1860 letter to the American naturalist Asa Gray, Darwin wrote:

 I own that I cannot see as plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.

<text>Ilya Grigoryevich Ehrenburg (, ; – August 31, 1967) was a Soviet writer, revolutionary, journalist and historian.

Ehrenburg was among the most prolific and notable authors of the Soviet Union; he published around one hundred titles. He became known first and foremost as a novelist and a journalist – in particular, as a reporter in three wars (First World War, Spanish Civil War and the Second World War). His incendiary articles calling for violence against Germans during the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; won him a huge following among front-line Soviet soldiers, but also caused much controversy due to their perceived anti-German sentiment. Ehrenburg later clarified that his writings were about &quot;German aggressors who set foot on Soviet soil with weapons&quot;, not the whole German people.

The novel &quot;The Thaw&quot; gave its name to an entire era of Soviet politics, namely, the liberalization which occurred after the death of Joseph Stalin. Ehrenburg&#x27;s travel writing also had great resonance, and to an arguably greater extent, so did his memoir &quot;People, Years, Life&quot;, which may be his best known and most discussed work. The &quot;Black Book&quot;, edited by him and Vasily Grossman, has special historical significance, it describes the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, the genocide which was committed against Soviet citizens of Jewish ancestry by the Nazis; It was denounced as &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; and banned from publication. It was first published in Jerusalem in 1980.

In addition, Ehrenburg wrote a succession of works of poetry.

==Life and work==

Ilya Ehrenburg was born in Kiev, Ukraine, in the Russian Empire to a Lithuanian–Jewish family; his father was an engineer. Ehrenburg&#x27;s household was not religiously observant; he came into contact with the religious practices of Judaism only through his maternal grandfather. Ehrenburg never practiced Judaism. He learned no Yiddish, although he edited the &quot;Black Book&quot;, which was written in Yiddish. He considered himself a Russian and, later, a Soviet citizen, and wrote in Russian even during his many years abroad. Ehrenburg also took strong public positions against antisemitism, and left all his papers to Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem.

When Ehrenburg was four years old, the family moved to Moscow, where his father had been hired as director of a brewery. At school, he met Nikolai Bukharin, who was two grades above him. The two remained friends until Bukharin&#x27;s execution in 1938 during the Great Purge.

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1905, both Ehrenburg and Bukharin got involved in illegal activities of the Bolshevik organisation. In 1908, when Ehrenburg was seventeen years old, the tsarist secret police (Okhrana) arrested him for five months. He was beaten up and lost some teeth. Finally he was allowed to go abroad and chose Paris for his exile.

In Paris, he started to work in the Bolshevik organisation, meeting Vladimir Lenin and other prominent exiles. But soon he left these circles and the party. Ehrenburg became attached to the bohemian life in the Paris quarter of Montparnasse. He began to write poems, regularly visited the cafés of Montparnasse and got acquainted with a lot of artists, especially Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Jules Pascin, and Amedeo Modigliani. Foreign writers whose works Ehrenburg translated included those of Francis Jammes.

During World War I, Ehrenburg became a war correspondent for a St. Petersburg newspaper. He wrote a series of articles about the mechanized war that later on were also published as a book (&quot;The Face of War&quot;). His poetry now also concentrated on subjects of war and destruction, as in &quot;On the Eve&quot;, his third lyrical book. Nikolai Gumilev, a famous symbolistic poet, wrote favourably about Ehrenburg&#x27;s progress in poetry.

In 1917, after the revolution, Ehrenburg returned to Russia. At that time he tended to oppose the Bolshevik policy, being shocked by the constant atmosphere of violence. He wrote a poem called &quot;Prayer for Russia&quot; which compared the storming of the Winter Palace to rape. In 1920 Ehrenburg went to Kiev where he experienced four different regimes in the course of one year: the Germans, the Cossacks, the Bolsheviks, and the White Army. After antisemitic pogroms, he fled to Koktebel on the Crimea peninsula where his old friend from Paris days, Maximilian Voloshin, had a house. Finally, Ehrenburg returned to Moscow, where he soon was arrested by the Cheka but freed after a short time.

He became a Soviet cultural activist and journalist who spent much time abroad as a writer. He wrote avant-garde picaresque novels and short stories popular in the 1920s, often set in Western Europe (&quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of Julio Jurenito and his Disciples&quot; (1922), &quot;Thirteen Pipes&quot;). Ehrenburg continued to write philosophical poetry, using more freed rhythms than in the 1910s. In 1929 he published &quot;The Life of the Automobile&quot;, a communist variant of the it-narrative genre.

In 1935, Ehrenburg attended the first International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, which opened in Paris in June. He had written a pamphlet which said, among other things, that surrealists shunned work, favouring parasitism, and that they endorsed &quot;onanism, pederasty, fetishism, exhibitionism, and even sodomy&quot;. André Breton — along with all fellow surrealists — felt insulted and accosted Ehrenburg on the street and slapped him several times, which resulted in surrealists being expelled from the Congress.

===Spanish Civil War===

As a friend of many of the European Left, Ehrenburg was frequently allowed by Stalin to visit Europe and to campaign for peace and socialism. He arrived in Spain in late August 1936 as an &quot;Izvestia&quot; correspondent and was involved in propaganda and military activity as well as reporting. In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers&#x27; Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war, held in Valencia, Barcelona, and Madrid and attended by many writers including André Malraux, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Spender, and Pablo Neruda.

===World War II===

Ehrenburg was offered a column in &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot; (the Red Army newspaper) days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During the war, he published more than 2,000 articles in Soviet newspapers. He saw the Great Patriotic War as a dramatic contest between good and evil. In his articles, moral and life-affirming Red Army soldiers faced off against a dehumanized German enemy. In 1943, Ehrenburg, working with the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, began to collect material for what would become &quot;The Black Book of Soviet Jewry&quot;, documenting The Holocaust. In a December 1944 article in &quot;Pravda&quot;, Ehrenburg declared that the Germans&#x27; greatest crime was the murder of six million Jews.

His incendiary articles calling for vengeance against the German enemy won him a huge following among front-line Soviet soldiers, who sent him much fan mail. As a consequence, he is one of many Soviet writers, along with Konstantin Simonov and Alexey Surkov, who many have accused of &quot;[lending] their literary talents to the hate campaign&quot; against Germans. Austrian historian Arnold Suppan argued that Ehrenburg &quot;agitated in the style of Nazi racist ideology&quot;, with statements such as: 

This pamphlet, titled &quot;Kill&quot;, was written during the Battle of Stalingrad. Ehrenburg later accompanied the Soviet forces during the East Prussian Offensive and criticized the indiscriminate violence against German civilians, for which he was reprimanded by Stalin. However, his previous writings had already been interpreted as license for atrocities against German civilians during the Soviet invasion of Germany in 1945. Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels accused Ehrenburg of advocating the rape of German women. However, Ehrenburg denied this and historian Antony Beevor claims that it was a Nazi fabrication. In January 1945, Adolf Hitler stated that &quot;Stalin&#x27;s court lackey, Ilya Ehrenburg, declares that the German people must be exterminated&quot;. After criticism by Georgy Aleksandrov in &quot;Pravda&quot; in April 1945, Ehrenburg responded that he never meant wiping out the German people, but only German aggressors who set foot on Soviet soil with weapons, because &quot;we are not Nazis who fight with civilians”. Ehrenburg fell into disgrace at that time and it is estimated that Aleksandrov&#x27;s article was a signal of change in Stalin&#x27;s policy towards Germany.

===The &#x27;Anti-Cosmopolitan&#x27; Campaign===
On 21 September 1948, at the behest of Politburo members Lazar Kaganovich and Georgy Malenkov, Ehrenburg published an article in &quot;Pravda&quot; which signified Stalin&#x27;s absolute political break with Israel, which he had been supporting through enormous shipments of Czech arms. After this break with Israel, hundreds of Jews became targets of the so-called anti-cosmopolitan campaign. The chairman of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, Solomon Mikhoels, was murdered, and many Soviet Jewish intellectuals were imprisoned or executed.

Ilya Ehrenburg&#x27;s name was high on a list presented to Stalin by the chief of police, Viktor Abakumov, of people selected for arrest. He was accused of having &quot;made attacks on Comrade Stalin&quot; when talking to the French writer André Malraux in Spain in 1937. While Stalin agreed to the arrests of most of the names on the list, he put a question mark by Ehrenburg&#x27;s. It appears that Ehrenburg was allowed to continue publishing and travelling abroad to obscure the anti-Semitic campaign at home. During a press conference in London in 1950, attended by over 200 journalists, he was challenged about the fate of the writers David Bergelson and Itzik Feffer, and said that &quot;If anything unpleasant had happened to them, I would have known&quot;, knowing that they were both under arrest. He was accused of informing on his comrades, but there is no evidence to support this theory. In February 1953, he refused to denounce the supposed doctors&#x27; plot and wrote a letter to Stalin opposing collective punishment of Jews.

===Postwar writings===
Ehrenburg received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1948.

In 1954, Ehrenburg published a novel titled &quot;The Thaw&quot; that tested the limits of censorship in the post-Stalin Soviet Union. It portrayed a corrupt and despotic factory boss, a &quot;little Stalin&quot;, and told the story of his wife, who increasingly feels estranged from him, and the views he represents. In the novel, the spring thaw comes to represent a period of change in the characters&#x27; emotional journeys, and when the wife eventually leaves her husband, this coincides with the melting of the snow. Thus, the novel can be seen as a representation of the thaw, and the increased freedom of the writer after the &#x27;frozen&#x27; political period under Stalin. In August 1954, Konstantin Simonov attacked &quot;The Thaw&quot; in articles published in &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, arguing that such writings are too dark and do not serve the Soviet state. The novel gave its name to the Khrushchev Thaw.

Ehrenburg is particularly well known for his memoirs (&quot;People, Years, Life&quot; in Russian, published with the title &quot;Memoirs: 1921–1941&quot; in English), which contain many portraits of interest to literary historians and biographers. In this book, Ehrenburg was the first legal Soviet author to mention positively a lot of names banned under Stalin, including Marina Tsvetaeva. At the same time he disapproved of the Russian and Soviet intellectuals who had explicitly rejected communism or defected to the West. He also criticized writers like Boris Pasternak, author of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, for not having been able to understand the course of history.

Ehrenburg&#x27;s memoirs were criticized by the more conservative faction among the Soviet writers, concentrated around the journal &quot;Oktyabr&quot;. For example, when the memoirs were published, Vsevolod Kochetov reflected on certain writers who were &quot;burrowing in the rubbish heaps of their crackpot memories&quot;. In January 1963, the critic Vladimir Yermilov wrote a long article in &quot;Izvestia&quot; in which he picked up on Ehrenburg&#x27;s admission that he had suspected that innocent people were being arrested in 1937 and 1938 but had &quot;gritted his teeth&quot; in silence.

Yermilov alleged that this proved that Ehrenburg had been in a privileged position in those years but said nothing, when others, less privileged, had spoken out when they believed an innocent person had been arrested. Ehrenburg retorted that he had never been to a single meeting nor read a single article in which anyone had protested about the arrests, whereupon Yermilov accused him of having insulted a &quot;whole generation of Soviet people&quot;.

For the contemporary reader though, the work appears to have a distinctly Marxist-Leninist ideological flavor characteristic of a Soviet-era official writer.

He was also active in publishing the works by Osip Mandelstam when the latter had been posthumously rehabilitated but still largely unacceptable for censorship. Ehrenburg was also active as a poet till his last days, depicting the events of World War II in Europe, the Holocaust and the destinies of Russian intellectuals.

===Death and legacy===

Ehrenburg died in 1967 of prostate and bladder cancer, and was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, where his gravestone is etched with a reproduction of his portrait drawn by his friend Pablo Picasso. 

In 1968, Polish-American writer and journalist S.L. Shneiderman published a Yiddish biography of Ehrenburg, whom he had met in interwar Paris and in Spain. In his biography, Shneiderman defended Ehrenburg from accusations of collaboration with Stalin in the destruction of Soviet Yiddish culture.

<text>Catalan myths and legends are the traditional myths and legends of the Catalan-speaking world, especially Catalonia itself, passed down for generations as part of that region&#x27;s popular culture.

==Mythological figures==
Among the figures of Catalan mythology are:
*Aloja - In Catalan mythology an Aloja, also known as Dona d&#x27;aigua, Goja, or Paitida, is a feminine being that lives in places with fresh water. This &quot;water-woman&quot; can turn into water blackbirds.
*Banyoles monster
*Bubota
*Catalan mythology about witches - Catalan tradition distinguished between bruixeria (&quot;witchcraft&quot;) based on an explicit compact with the Devil, and fetilleria (deriving from a word related to &quot;fetish&quot;, and Old Portuguese feitiço), magic worked through charms and fetishes. The former was considered inherently evil, while the latter might include the working of magical cures. In Catalan popular culture, there are a large number of legends about witches. In the popular imagination, a witch is a woman who, by means of a pact with the Devil, has acquired supernatural power, which she uses for her own benefit and for evil purposes.
*Carnestoltes
*Cocollona
*Comte Arnau
*Comte Estruch
*Cucafera
*Dip - In Catalan myth, Dip is an evil, black, hairy dog, an emissary of the Devil, who sucks people&#x27;s blood.
*Dona d&#x27;aigua - (See Aloja)
*Donyet
*Dragons
**Drac (a dragon, generally male)
**Víbria (specifically female)
*Encantaria
*Follet
*Gambutzí
*Goja - (See Aloja)
*Fada - Hada
*Home del sac (man of the sack)
*Home dels nassos (man of the noses)
*Marraco
*Martinet
*Minairó
*El Moro Musa
*Muladona
*Negret
*Nitus
*Paitida - (See Aloja)
*Papu
*Peix Nicolau - Peje Nicolao
*Pellofa
*Pesanta
*Puigmal
*Tió de Nadal
*The Three Wise Men or Tres Reis Mags d&#x27;Orient
**Page Gregory
**Page Fumera
*Tombatossals
*Vella Quaresma
*Víbria

==Generic figures==
In Catalonia those characters that are invoked to induce fear in children for practical purposes, for example to avoid speaking to strangers or leaving home alone, are called &quot;Espantamainades&quot;. At the anthropological level, sometimes they are manifestations of the fears of the unknown and inexplicable in nature. Some are local representations related to those figures also existing in other cultures, such as witches, goblins, and the bogeyman. Others are purely local variations, such as Marraco the peasant and the dips.

<text>The Promised Land (, translit.: &quot;ha&#x27;aretz hamuvtakhat&quot;; , translit.: &quot;ard al-mi&#x27;ad&quot;) is Middle Eastern land in the Levant that Abrahamic religions (which include Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and others) claim God promised and subsequently gave to Abraham (the legendary patriarch in Abrahamic religions) and several more times to his descendants.

== Abrahamic narrative ==

The concept of the Promised Land originates from a religious narrative written in the Hebrew religious text the Torah.

=== Original promises in Genesis ===
God is claimed to have spoken the following promises to Abraham in several verses of Genesis (the first book of the Torah), which a modern English Bible translates to:
:The LORD had said to Abram, &quot;Leave your country, your people and your father&#x27;s household and go to the land I will show you.&quot; – 
:The LORD appeared to Abram and said, &quot;To your offspring [or seed] I will give this land.&quot; – 

Later in what is called the covenant of the pieces, a verse is said to describe what are known as &quot;borders of the Land&quot; (&quot;Gevulot Ha-aretz&quot;):
:On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, &quot;To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates – the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.&quot; – 

These allegedly divine promises were given prior to the birth of Abraham&#x27;s sons. Abraham&#x27;s family tree includes both the Ishmaelite tribes (the claimed ancestry of Arabs and of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) through Abraham&#x27;s first son Ishmael and the Israelite tribes (the claimed ancestry of Jews and Samaritans) through Abraham&#x27;s second son Isaac.

=== Subsequent confirmations ===
God later confirms the promise to Abraham&#x27;s son Isaac (), and then to Isaac&#x27;s son Jacob () in terms of &quot;the land on which you are lying&quot;. Jacob is later renamed &quot;Israel&quot; () and his descendants are called the Children of Israel or the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

The Torah&#x27;s subsequent Book of Exodus describes it as &quot;land flowing with milk and honey&quot; () and gives verses on how to treat the prior occupants and marks the borders in terms of the Red Sea, the &quot;Sea of the Philistines&quot;, and the &quot;River&quot;, which a modern English Bible translates to:
: &quot;I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you. Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods. Do not let them live in your land or they will cause you to sin against me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.&quot; – 

The Israelites lived in a smaller area of former Canaanite land and land east of the Jordan River after the legendary prophet Moses led the Israelite Exodus out of Egypt (). The Torah&#x27;s Book of Deuteronomy presents this occupation as their God&#x27;s fulfillment of the promise (). Moses anticipated that their God might subsequently give the Israelites land reflecting the boundaries of the original promise – if they were obedient to the covenant ().

== Hinduism ==
While not believed to be a promised land like the others, some Hindus believe that Bharata is a holy land.

==Interpretations==
===Jewish interpretation===
The concept of the Promised Land is a central religious belief of the Jewish People and a key tenet of Zionism, the Jewish national movement which established the State of Israel.

Mainstream Jewish tradition regards the promise made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as applying to anyone a member of the Jewish people, including proselytes and in turn their descendants and is signified through the &quot;brit milah&quot; (rite of circumcision).

===Christian interpretation===
In the New Testament, the descent and promise is reinterpreted along religious lines. In the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul the Apostle draws attention to the formulation of the promise, avoiding the term &quot;seeds&quot; in the plural (meaning many people), choosing instead &quot;seed,&quot; meaning one person, who, he understands to be Jesus (and those united with him). For example, in Galatians 3:16 he notes: 
: &quot;The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say &quot;and to seeds,&quot; meaning many people, but &quot;and to your seed,&quot; meaning one person, who is Christ.&quot;

In Galatians 3:28–29 Paul goes further, noting that the expansion of the promise from singular to the plural is not based on genetic/physical association, but a spiritual/religious one: 
:&quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&#x27;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.&quot;

In it is written: 
:&quot;It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.&quot;
German Lutheran Old Testament commentator Johann Friedrich Karl Keil states that the covenant is through Isaac, but notes that Ishmael&#x27;s descendants have held much of that land through time.

==== American colonialism ====
Many European colonists saw America as the &quot;Promised Land&quot;, representing a haven from religious conflicts and persecution. For instance, Puritan minister John Cotton&#x27;s 1630 sermon gave colonizers departing England to Massachusetts repeated references to the Exodus story, and later German immigrants sang: &quot;America ... is a beautiful land that God promised to Abraham.&quot;

In a sermon celebrating independence in 1783, Yale president Ezra Stiles implied Americans were chosen and delivered from bondage to a Promised Land: &quot;the Lord shall have made his American Israel &#x27;high above all nations which he hath made&#x27;,&quot; reflecting language from Deuteronomy of the promise.

Shawnee/Lenape scholar Steven Newcomb argued in his 2008 book &quot;Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery&quot; that Christendom&#x27;s discovery doctrine was also the same claim of &quot;the right to kill and plunder non-Christians&quot; found in this covenant tradition, whereby &quot;the Lord&quot; in Deuteronomy told his chosen people how they were to &quot;utterly destroy&quot; the &quot;many nations before thee&quot; when &quot;He&quot; brought them into the land &quot;He&quot; had discovered and promised to &quot;His&quot; &quot;Chosen People&quot; to &quot;possess&quot;, and that this &quot;right&quot; was woven into US law through the 1823 Johnson v. McIntosh Supreme Court ruling.

===== Mormonism =====

Mormonism teaches that the United States is the Biblical promised land, the U.S. Constitution divinely inspired, and Mormons God&#x27;s chosen people.

=== Muslim interpretation ===
1st century Roman–Jewish historian Flavius Josephus postulated that Ishmael was the founder of the Arab race. And according to Muslim tradition, Islam&#x27;s founding prophet Muhammad was a Hanif (true monotheistic believer of the religion of Abraham). His tribe, the Quraysh, traces its ancestry to Ishmael.

===Palestinian interpretation===

Some Palestinians claim partial descent from the Israelites and Maccabees, as well as from other peoples who have lived in the region.

=== African-American spirituals ===
African-American spirituals invoke the imagery of the &quot;Promised Land&quot; as heaven or paradise and as an escape from slavery, which could often only be reached by death. The imagery and term also appear elsewhere in popular culture, in sermons, and in speeches such as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1968 &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot;, in which he said:

I just want to do God&#x27;s will. And He&#x27;s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I&#x27;ve looked over. And I&#x27;ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I&#x27;m happy, tonight. I&#x27;m not worried about anything. I&#x27;m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

== Boundaries from the Book of Numbers ==
:Boundaries of the &#x27;Promised Land&#x27; given in the Book of Numbers (chapter 34)
::The South border. —(v. 3) &quot;Then your &quot;south&quot; quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your &quot;south border&quot; shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward : (v. 4) And your border shall turn from the south to the &quot;ascent of Akrabbim&quot;, and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon : (v. 5) And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.&quot;
::The Western border. —(v. 6) &quot;And as for the &quot;western border&quot;, ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border.&quot;

::The East border. —(v. 10) &quot;And ye shall point out your &quot;east border&quot; from Hazar-enan to Shepham : (v. 11) And the coast shall go down from Shepham to &quot;Riblah&quot;, on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the &quot;sea of Chinnereth&quot; eastward : (v. 12) And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land &quot;with the coasts thereof&quot; round about.&quot;
:Boundaries of the &#x27;Promised Land&#x27; given by Jerome c.400
::You may delineate the Promised Land of Moses from the Book of Numbers (ch. 34): as bounded on the south by the desert tract called Sina, between the Dead Sea and the city of Kadesh-barnea, [which is located with the Arabah to the east] and continues to the west, as far as the river of Egypt, that discharges into the open sea near the city of Rhinocolara; as bounded on the west by the sea along the coasts of Palestine, Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, and Cilicia; as bounded on the north by the circle formed by the Taurus Mountains and Zephyrium and extending to Hamath, called Epiphany-Syria; as bounded on the east by the city of Antioch Hippos and Lake Kinneret, now called Tiberias, and then the Jordan River which discharges into the salt sea, now called the Dead Sea.

* 1845: Salomon Munk, &quot;Palestine, Description Géographique, Historique et Archéologique,&quot; in &quot;L&#x27;Univers Pittoresque&quot;:
Under the name &quot;Palestine&quot;, we comprehend the small country formerly inhabited by the Israelites, and which is today part of Acre and Damascus pachalics. It stretched between 31 and 33° N. latitude and between 32 and 35° degrees E. longitude, an area of about 1300 . Some zealous writers, to give the land of the Hebrews some political importance, have exaggerated the extent of Palestine; but we have an authority for us that one can not reject. St. Jerome, who had long traveled in this country, said in his letter to Dardanus (ep. 129) that the northern boundary to that of the southern, was a distance of 160 Roman miles, which is about 55 . He paid homage to the truth despite his fears, as he said himself, of availing the &quot;Promised Land&quot; to pagan mockery, &quot;&quot; (Latin: &quot;I am embarrassed to say the breadth of the promised land, lest we seem to have given the heathen an opportunity of blaspheming&quot;).

<text>Panayiotis Michael Zavos (), or Panos Zavos (, ), is a physiologist who was born in Cyprus and later emigrated to the United States. Zavos has been the subject of controversy for making unsubstantiated claims that he can clone human beings.

==Academic career==
Zavos received a Bachelor of Science in biology-chemistry in 1970, a Master of Science in biology-physiology in 1972, and an Education Specialist in Science (Ed.S.) in 1976 from Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas. He earned a doctorate in animal physiology in 1978 from the University of Minnesota. He also received an MBA in 2008. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Emporia State University

Zavos is Professor Emeritus in reproductive physiology at the University of Kentucky. He was named as an Honorary Professor by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and as a Professor Emeritus by the Venkateshwara Institute of Medicine in India. He has served as a member of the International Advisory Committee of the Middle East Fertility Society.

==Cloning claims==
Zavos claims to have created and implanted cloned human embryos. However, Zavos&#x27; claims were roundly dismissed after he failed to produce any proof and have been widely condemned by doctors, politicians, and religious and pressure groups.

Professor Hans Evers, chairman of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, stated: &quot;All the scientific evidence so far indicates that it is completely impossible to clone humans. Anyone claiming that he is going to clone a human does not know what he is talking about. All these guys, including Zavos are doing damage to the profession and goodwill we have built up for many years in the area of fertility treatments.&quot;

Professor Robert Winston, emeritus professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, said &quot;I do not know of any credible evidence that suggests Dr Zavos can clone a human being. This seems to be yet another one of his claims to get repeated publicity&quot;.

Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania said of Zavos, &quot;I think he is the most dangerous of the current fringe proponents of cloning, because he knows more, stretches the facts, and seems to be wallowing in a mix of publicity and fund-raising that rests on a foundation of hype.&quot;

UK Health Secretary John Reid condemned Zavos&#x27; attempts to create a cloned human baby as a &quot;gross misuse of genetic science&quot;.

Spyros Simitis, the brother of former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, characterized Zavos&#x27;s claims as &quot;scientific barbarism&quot;. He said that if human cloning were to become reality, it would mean the &quot;end of human freedom and evolution&quot;. He also referred to the possible use of cloning by governments for controlling and shaping society according to the government&#x27;s will.

He is best known for portraying Lando Calrissian in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise and has also appeared in critically acclaimed and popular titles such as &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975), &quot;Scott Joplin&quot; (1977), and &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1981), as Harvey Dent in &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017)&quot;, The Last Angry Man&quot; (1959), &quot;Carter&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1969), &quot;The Final Comedown&quot; and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (both 1972), &quot;Hit!&quot; (1973), &quot;Fear City&quot; and &quot;Terror in the Aisles&quot; (both 1984), &quot;Alien Intruder&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Visit&quot; (2000).

Raised in Harlem, Williams made his Broadway theatre debut at age seven in &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot; (1945). He later graduated from The High School of Music &amp; Art, then won a painting scholarship to the National Academy of Fine Arts and Design, where he won a Hallgarten Prize for painting in the mid-1950s. He returned to acting to fund his art supplies, including stage, films, and television. He continued painting; his work has since been shown in galleries and collections worldwide. Williams’ film debut was in &quot;The Last Angry Man&quot; (1959), but he came to national attention in the television movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971), which earned him an Emmy nomination for Best Actor. In the 1980s, he was cast as Lando Calrissian in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), becoming the first black actor with a major role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He reprised his role in subsequent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and media. Williams&#x27;s television work includes over 70 credits starting in 1966 including recurring roles over the decades in &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossing&quot;; &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Numerous cameos and supporting roles included being paired with Marla Gibbs on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;227,&quot; and &quot;The Hughleys&quot;. Later work included voice acting in the series &quot;Titan Maximum&quot; (2009), and appearing on the reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2014).

His work has earned him numerous awards and honors including three NAACP Image Awards, and the NAACP Lifetime Achievement award. He was inducted into the Black Filmmaker&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1984, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1985.

==Early life and education==
William December Williams Jr. was born in New York City, the son of Loretta Anne (1915–2016), an elevator operator at the Lyceum Theatre and aspiring performer from Montserrat, and William December Williams Sr. (1909–1973), an African-American caretaker, with some Native American ancestry from Texas. He grew up in Harlem on 110th Street, between Lenox and 5th, adjacent to Central Park North–110th Street station. He used to go to Central Park to see the Negro league players and the Cuban baseball league, &quot;They were fantastic, and I wound up working with a lot of those guys,&quot; (in &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot; (1976). He has a twin sister, Loretta, and they were raised by their maternal grandmother while their parents worked several jobs. His mom had studied opera for years, becoming an accomplished opera star who wanted to break into movies; the family was richly cultured, exposing the children early on to drawing, painting, theatre and similar creative experiences; Billy Dee would remain a fan of the arts including opera. In March 1945, he made his Broadway debut at age seven portraying a page in &quot;The Firebrand of Florence&quot;, Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin’s operetta starring Lotte Lenya. His mom, who worked at the theatre, volunteered him for the part which he found boring.

Williams attended Booker T. Washington Junior High School where he had dreams of being a painter. He graduated in 1955 from the LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, where he majored in arts with a focus on visual arts. The school would later be the subject for &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), and its derivative television series. While there he got a two-year scholarship for the National Academy of Fine Arts and Design in New York—which later changed its name to National Academy of Design—to study with a focus on &quot;classical principles of painting&quot;. He was nominated at eighteen or nineteen years old for a Guggenheim Fellowship grant—for &quot;creative ability in the arts,&quot; and won a Hallgarten Prize in the mid-1950s. Although he had scholarships to pay for school tuition, he turned to acting to pay for his paints, supplies, and canvasses. His first Broadway theatre &quot;big break&quot; was a play, &quot;A Taste of Honey.&quot; He continued to struggle as an actor for ten years working as an extra, doing small and large theatre, and &quot;slowly breaking into television and film&quot;. During art school he gained interest in the Stanislavsky Method—experiencing a role in contrast to representing it, to mobilize an actor&#x27;s conscious thought and will to activate emotional response and subconscious behavior—and began studying at the Harlem Actors Workshop. It was run by blacklisted actor Paul Mann who embraced actors of all races; Williams also studied there under Sidney Poitier. Though he first viewed his acting as a way to pay for his art supplies, by the early 1960s he began to &quot;devote all of his energy to performance.&quot; In succession, he got an actor agent through a friend, started getting major Off-Broadway roles, then work on Broadway.

==Career==
=== 1959–1970: Broadway debut and early roles ===

Williams returned to Broadway as an adult in 1960 in the adaptation of &quot;The Cool World&quot;. He appeared in &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; in 1960. Williams made his film debut in 1959 in &quot;The Last Angry Man&quot;, opposite Paul Muni, in which he portrayed a delinquent young man. He was frustrated in the 1960s with the &quot;paucity of parts for leading black men,&quot; the majority of roles he wanted went to Sidney Poitier. He enjoyed doing theater and television, but &quot;his slow-building film career ate at him.&quot; He found LSD, a popular hallucinogenic drug with the era&#x27;s hippie movement to be a cure, &quot;LSD saved my life ... I wasn&#x27;t doing it to get high. It let me get inside of myself.&quot; Otherwise he is anti-drug.

=== 1971–1989: Film stardom and acclaim ===
He rose to stardom after starring in the critically acclaimed television film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971), in which he played Chicago Bears star football player Gale Sayers, who stood by his friend Brian Piccolo (James Caan), during Piccolo&#x27;s struggle with terminal cancer. Both Williams and Caan were nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards for best actor for their performances. Williams said the role was the one of which he was most proud &quot;It was a love story, really. Between two guys. Without sex. ... It ended up being a kind of breakthrough in terms of racial division.&quot; Williams&#x27; success with &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; earned him a seven-year contract with Motown&#x27;s Berry Gordy. He became one of America&#x27;s most well-known black film actors of the 1970s, after starring in a string of critically acclaimed and popular movies, many of them in the &quot;blaxploitation&quot; genre.

In 1972, he starred as Billie Holiday&#x27;s husband Louis McKay in Motown Productions&#x27; Academy Award-nominated Holiday biopic &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; acting opposite Diana Ross as the titular character. Through his portrayal he became &quot;a full-fledged sex symbol, and was dubbed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the black Clark Gable.&#x27;&quot; Williams later stated, &quot;I wanted to be known as one of the best actors of my generation, period, but the opportunities weren’t the same for me as they were for Gable, and I was frustrated.&quot; Motown paired the two of them again three years later in the successful follow-up project &quot;Mahogany&quot;. Williams returned to Broadway in the 1976 production, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, which was directed by Robert Greenwald. Williams portrayed civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. In 1977, he played the eponymous lead role in &quot;Scott Joplin&quot;, biopic of musician&#x27;s life, featuring many of his ragtime pieces in the soundtrack, including an epic piano duel in the early opening scenes. Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), becoming the first African-American actor with a role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. He would reprise the role in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). Williams voiced the character in the audio drama adaption of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1983).

Between the two &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, he starred alongside Sylvester Stallone as a cop in the thriller &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1981). Williams returned to Broadway in the August Wilson play &quot;Fences&quot;, as a replacement for James Earl Jones in the role of Troy Maxson in 1988. Williams co-starred in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; as district attorney Harvey Dent, a role that was planned to develop into Dent&#x27;s alter-ego, the villain Two-Face, in sequels. He was set to reprise the role in the sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, but his character was deleted and replaced with villain Max Shreck. When Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, where Two-Face was to be a secondary villain, Schumacher decided to hire Tommy Lee Jones for the role. There was a rumor that Schumacher had to pay Williams a fee in order to hire Jones, but Williams said that it was not true: &quot;You only get paid if you do the movie. I had a two-picture deal with &quot;Star Wars.&quot; They paid me for that, but I only had a one picture deal for &quot;Batman.&quot;&quot; Williams eventually voiced Two-Face in the 2017 film &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.

=== 1990–present: Television roles ===
Williams&#x27; television work included a recurring guest-starring role on the short-lived show &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. He is also known for his advertisements for Colt 45, a malt liquor, for a five-year period starting in the mid-1980s; he would reprise his spokesperson role in 2016. Williams brushed off criticism—for the subtext of the ad campaign, &#x27;works every time,&#x27; and the target audience—of the choice, &quot;I drink, you drink. Hell, if marijuana was legal, I&#x27;d appear in a commercial for it.&quot; Colt 45 hired Williams &quot;simply because he was so cool,&quot; and went from trailing behind Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company in barrels produced, to &quot;skyrocketing&quot; a year after the 1986 ads ran to two million barrels in the top spot for malt liquor.

In the 1984–1985 season of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, he played Brady Lloyd opposite Diahann Carroll. Williams was paired with actress Marla Gibbs on three situation comedies: &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (Gibbs&#x27;s character, Florence, was a major fan of Williams and challenged him on everything because she thought Williams was an imposter); &quot;227&quot; (her character, Mary, pretending to be royalty, met Williams at a banquet); and &quot;The Hughleys&quot; (Gibbs and Williams portrayed Darryl&#x27;s parents). In 1992, he portrayed Berry Gordy in &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot;. In 1993, Williams made a guest appearance on the spin-off to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, as Langston Paige, a grumpy landlord, in a backdoor pilot for his own series. Williams appeared as himself on &quot;Martin&quot; where he provided Martin Lawrence&#x27;s character with advice on getting back together with Gina.

Williams made a special guest appearance on the hit sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; in 1990. He portrayed Pastor Dan in an episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. In this episode, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t You Do It&quot; (2004), his character is obsessed with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and uses this to help counsel Eric Forman (himself a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan) and Donna Pinciotti about his premarital relationship. Williams made a cameo appearance as himself on the television series &quot;Lost&quot; in the episode &quot;Exposé&quot;. He also appears regularly on short clips on the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; as a semi-parody of himself. In February 2006, Williams guest starred as himself in the season 5 episode &quot;Her Story II&quot; of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, where he plays the godfather of Julie (Mandy Moore). Turk hugs him, calling him &quot;Lando&quot;, even though he prefers to be called Billy Dee.

Williams played the GDI Director Redmond Boyle, in the full-motion video (live-action) cutscenes of the video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot; (2007). This made him the second former &quot;Star Wars&quot; actor to appear in a &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game (with the first being James Earl Jones as GDI General James Solomon in &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Williams played Toussaint Dubois for &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, Williams reprised his role as Lando Calrissian to appear in a video on &quot;Funny or Die&quot; in a mock political ad defending himself for leader of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy against vicious attack ads from Emperor Palpatine. Williams was a cast member of &quot;Diary of a Single Mom&quot;, a web-based original series directed by award-winning filmmaker Robert Townsend. The series debuted on PIC.tv in 2009. Williams reprised his role as Toussaint on &quot;General Hospital&quot; beginning in June 2009. Also in 2009, Williams took on the role of the voice of Admiral Bitchface, the head of the military on the planet Titan, in the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Titan Maximum&quot;. In July 2010, Williams appeared in the animated series &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, where he voiced a fictionalized version of himself in the episode &quot;The Story of Lando Freeman&quot;.

In February 2011, Williams appeared as a guest star on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;White Collar&quot; as Ford, an old friend of Neal Caffrey&#x27;s landlady June, played by Diahann Carroll. In February 2012, Williams was the surprise guest during a taping of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; spotlighting Diana Ross. Ross and Williams were reunited after having not seen each other in 29 years. In October 2012, Williams appeared as a guest star on &quot;NCIS&quot; in Season 10 Episode 5 titled &quot;Namesake&quot;, as Gibbs&#x27;s namesake and his father&#x27;s former best friend, Leroy Jethro Moore. On January 9, 2013, Williams made a cameo appearance as himself on &quot;Modern Family&quot;, season 4, episode 11 &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;. In 2014, Williams competed on the 18th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, a reality show/dancing competition partnered with professional dancer Emma Slater. The couple had to withdraw from the competition on the third week due to an injury to Williams&#x27;s back. He also voiced Colonel Jackson in the 2016 video game &quot;Let It Die&quot;, who acts as the second major boss players face.

Over the years Williams reprised his role of Lando Calrissian in four video games, &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014), two episodes of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; and multiple &quot;LEGO Star Wars&quot; animated specials. He later returned to the role in the &quot;Star Wars: Star Wars Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between onscreen portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. &quot;Episode IX&quot; director J. J. Abrams noted, &quot;Lando was always written as a complex, contradictory, nuanced character. And Billy Dee played him to suave perfection, ... It wasn&#x27;t just that people of color were seeing themselves represented; they were seeing themselves represented in a rich, wonderful, intriguing way.&quot; Over the years, Williams has been a featured guest at fan conventions, mostly science fiction ones for his role. Of his fan interactions he has said they have mostly been positive ones, &quot;I love every single moment of it, I&#x27;ll have an audience for the rest of my life.&quot;

== Ventures and interests ==
=== Painting ===
In the late 1980s, Williams resumed painting, devoting much of his time to the work. He returned to New York to star in August Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Fences&quot;, replacing James Earl Jones in the lead for four months starting in February 1988. It marked a turning point for him, returning home, and for him, the center of the art scene. He also renewed his friendship with Peter Max, who had also trained and sold art in the city, and renewed Williams&#x27; interest in painting. Within a two-year span he &quot;cranked out 120 original works of art&quot;.

Williams is the honorary chairman of Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (formerly Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz) in Washington, D.C., which fosters jazz education. The institution has used his artwork each year for its competition programs since 1990. He had his first solo exhibition in 1991, followed by many throughout North America, and, later, the world. Around 1992, Williams, inspired by his friend and fellow New York artist Peter Max who had a teapot collection, started a cookie jar collection. Being an opera fan, he first found a jar in the shape of a singer in an opera gift shop by artisan couple Michael and Shelley Buonaiuto; later buying more than a dozen from their limited lines including ones of jazz artists Josephine Baker and Fats Waller. His 1993 self-portrait is at the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution (Washington D.C.) with a description that he &quot;specializes in acrylic paintings combining traditional brushwork with an airbrushing technique&quot;; he also works in oils. Williams painted a series of impressionistic portraits of the Tuskegee Airmen, the &quot;African-American pilots whose real-life exploits changed the course of American military history.&quot; He started the series in the 1990s but when officials from National Air and Space Museum (NASM) saw them they wanted more, and to use them in an exhibition. In 1999 they were displayed at the African-American Museum of Art, Culture and History in New Orleans, and in early 2000, the NASM in Washington, D.C.

He was commissioned for four paintings—including one of track and field star Jesse Owens sprinting, and another of a pair of boxers in a fight ring—for Nissan that were displayed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1997, he did paintings for Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Mighty Ducks arena for the Anaheim Ducks. From a description, circa late 1990s, at one of the galleries that carries his work, &quot;Billy&#x27;s paintings are usually acrylic on canvas, applied with brush and airbrush. He also works with collage elements and has even created three-dimensional canvasses incorporating ceramic, Lucite, and neon light.&quot;

He got permission from &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas to sell lithographs of a montage of Williams&#x27; iconic character from the franchise, Lando Calrissian. As of 2001 his paintings sold for an average of $10,000 to $35,000 (). &quot;I call my paintings &#x27;abstract reality,&#x27;&quot; said Williams. &quot;Sometimes I refer to them as &#x27;impressions/expression.&#x27; It&#x27;s the best way I can explain them.&quot; In early 2001 Williams was one of the celebrity artists painting seven-foot angel sculptures as part of the Oscar Academy&#x27;s sponsoring L.A.&#x27;s &quot;A Community of Angels&quot; charity project. The art angels were displayed for months then auctioned to raise funds for L.A. youth programs. In his online gallery biography, he states, &quot;[an] interest in Eastern philosophy characterizes his images, first to record the physical reality, and then to uncover through the application of light, color and perspective. He cites Edward Hopper, M. C. Escher—the Dutch Master, Frida Kahlo, Tamara de Lempicka, Thomas Hart Benton, and the exciting, vibrant forms of African art as some of his strongest influences.&quot; Williams&#x27; work is included at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, and the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.

In a 2001 interview he said, &quot;Either I want to drop dead with a paint brush in my hand or I want to drop dead doing a soliloquy on the stage, I love acting. I love it. I take my acting very seriously, but I also find it fun. To do what children do and get paid for it is a lot of fun. I&#x27;m very fortunate.&quot; In late 2007, he was a guest artist on a ten-day Princess Cruise liner. They bought about eighty pieces which they put on their cruises and then auctioned off. He was commissioned for another set of Disney paintings to be unveiled in 2011 at Disney&#x27;s &quot;D23 Expo&quot;, also in Anaheim, California. For those, he set iconic Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Goofy in jazz music settings. In a 2011 interview he said, &quot;I mostly create abstract paintings. I paint what&#x27;s obvious to the eye and then incorporate an abstract point of view, which allows me a lot of space to play in. I work a lot with acrylic and oils, mostly acrylic right now and do a lot of line drawings.&quot; In a September 2015 interview, he said he finds painting &quot;cathartic&quot; compared to collective film work, &quot;When you&#x27;re painting you just lock yourself up in your little private world. And it&#x27;s all about you and your imagination and nobody else interfering with that. It&#x27;s a great exercise because you really start discovering who you are and what you are without a lot of assistance … and the moment you come up with something interesting it&#x27;s a success that’s really based on your own personal, private sensibility.&quot; As of 2019 he has made around 300 paintings, which Williams sees as his legacy.

===Music===
In 1961, Williams recorded a jazz LP produced by Prestige Records entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Misbehave&quot;, on which he covered swing standards. The album was named after its second track. it included the first-ever vocal recording of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, a song by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow later covered by The Beatles on their 1963 debut album &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Williams was later the first to sing the song in the U.S., on the Broadway stage with Joan Plowright as part of the original Broadway production of the play &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;. The commercial success of his album lalter earned Williams a spot on &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; (1983). Williams said of the album, &quot;Recording it was sort of a lark. I did some singing in clubs, for a moment, and then I stopped. I have too much respect for singers to really think that I&#x27;m a singer.&quot; The album was re-released on CD, download and streaming platforms in 2014.

Thirty years later, in the early 1990s, he sang on a “celebrity-packed charity single,&quot; &quot;Voices That Care,” to honor U.S. troop of Operation Desert Storm, the 1990–1991 Gulf War, and supporting the International Red Cross. The single reached number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number six on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Through sales and plays of the song Williams and the other celebrities became platinum-recording and Billboard-charting artists.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Williams has been married three times, and has three children, and two grandchildren. His first marriage was to Audrey Sellers in 1959. They were divorced some years later, after which he apparently became depressed. He stated that &quot;there was a period when I was very despondent, broke, depressed, my first marriage was on the rocks.&quot; They had a son, Corey Dee Williams, born in 1960. In 1968, Williams married model and actress Marlene Clark in Hawaii. They divorced in 1971. He moved from New York City to California in 1971.

He married Teruko Nakagami on December 27, 1972. She brought a daughter, Miyako (born 1962), from her previous marriage to musician Wayne Shorter. Together they have a daughter, Hanako (born 1973). In 1984, he bought a &quot;Zen-like contemporary&quot; home in the Trousdale Estates neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California; he sold it in 2012. He filed for an amicable divorce from Nakagami in 1993, but they reconciled, and were again living together by 1997.

=== Gender identity ===
In late 2019, Williams talked about his feminine side in an interview, and used masculine and feminine pronouns to refer to himself. Media outlets speculated that Williams might be gender fluid, but he clarified that he was referring to anima and animus: the feminine side of men and the masculine side of women in Jungian psychology.

=== Legal issue ===
Williams was arrested on January 30, 1996, after allegedly assaulting his live-in girlfriend, whom the police did not identify. He posted a US$50,000 bail. L.A. Police said the woman had minor bruises and scratches. The district attorney&#x27;s office filed misdemeanor charges of spousal battery and dissuading a witness. The woman later stated that the incident was her fault and hoped the police would drop the case. In a plea bargain, Williams agreed to undergo 52 counseling sessions. In a 2019 interview, Williams says he never slapped or abused women.

<text>Jan Józef Ignacy Łukasiewicz (; 8 March 1822 – 7 January 1882) was a Polish pharmacist, engineer, businessman, inventor, and philanthropist. He was one of the most prominent philanthropists in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, crown land of Austria-Hungary. He was a pioneer who in 1856 built the world&#x27;s first modern oil refinery.

His achievements included the discovery of how to distill kerosene from seep crude oil, the invention of the modern kerosene lamp (1853), the introduction of the first modern street lamp in Europe (1853), and the construction of the world&#x27;s first modern oil well (1854).

==Life==
===Youth and studies===

Ignacy Łukasiewicz was born on 8 March 1822 in Zaduszniki, near Mielec, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in the Austrian Empire (after the Partitions of Poland) as the youngest of five children. His family was of Armenian origin. His parents were Apolonia, née Świetlik, and Józef Łukasiewicz, a member of the local intelligentsia nobility entitled to use the and a veteran of Kościuszko&#x27;s Uprising. The family rented a small manor in Zaduszniki, but soon after Ignacy&#x27;s birth financial difficulties forced them to relocate to the nearby city of Rzeszów. There Ignacy entered the local secondary school (Konarski&#x27;s Gymnasium), but failed to pass the examinations and left in 1836. In order to help his parents and financially support all the relatives, he moved to Łańcut, where he began work as a pharmacist&#x27;s assistant. Toward the end of his life, Łukasiewicz often described his childhood as happy; the home atmosphere was patriotic and somewhat democratic, and he commonly recalled his first tutor, Colonel Woysym-Antoniewicz, who resided in their house.

===Involvement in political movements===

Upon moving to Łańcut, Łukasiewicz also became involved in several political organizations that supported the idea of restoring Polish sovereignty and independence and participated in many political gatherings around the area. In 1840 he returned to Rzeszów, where he continued working at Edward Hübl&#x27;s private pharmacy. In 1845 he met diplomat and activist Edward Dembowski, who admitted Łukasiewicz to the illegal &quot;Centralization of the Polish Democratic Society&quot;, a party that focused on radical policies and supported a revolt against the Austrian government. The organization&#x27;s aim was to prepare an all-national uprising against all three partitioning powers. Since the movement was seen as a possible danger to the Austrian monarchy, on 19 February 1846 Łukasiewicz and several other members of the party were arrested by the Austrian authorities and imprisoned in the city of Lwów. However, on 27 December 1847 Łukasiewicz was released from prison due to lack of evidence, but for the rest of his life he was regarded as &quot;politically untrustworthy&quot; and often observed by local police that was in possession of his records. He was also ordered to remain in Lwów with his elder brother Franciszek.

===Career as chemist===
On 15 August 1848 he was employed at one of the biggest and best pharmacies in Austrian Galicia (so-called &quot;Austrian Poland&quot;); the Golden Star (&quot;Pod Złotą Gwiazdą&quot;) Pharmacy in Lviv, modern-day Ukraine, owned by Piotr Mikolasch. In 1850, a handheld pharmaceutical almanac and a precious document entitled &quot;manuskrypt&quot;, the joint work of Mikolasch and Łukasiewicz was published. Because of this achievement, the authorities granted him a permit to continue pharmaceutical studies at the Royal Jagiellonian University in Kraków. After several years of studies, financed mostly by Mikolasch, he passed all his university examinations except for that in pharmacognosy, which prevented him from graduating. Finally on 30 July 1852 Łukasiewicz graduated from the pharmacy department at the University of Vienna, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in pharmaceutics. As soon as he returned to the pharmacy of Piotr Mikolasch in Lviv he began a new phase of his life devoted to the studies of exploiting kerosene.

===Petroleum industry and oil lamp===
While oil was known to exist for a long time in the Subcarpathian-Galician region, it was more commonly used as an animal drug and lubricant, but Łukasiewicz, John Zeh and Mikolasch were the first to distill the liquid in Galicia and in the world and were able to exploit it for lighting and create a brand new industry. In autumn of 1852 Łukasiewicz, Mikolasch and his colleague John Zeh analyzed the oil, which was provided in a few barrels by traders from the town of Drohobych. After pharmaceutical methods and processes the purified oil was obtained and sold in the local pharmacies, but the orders were small due to high prices. In early 1854 Łukasiewicz moved to Gorlice, where he continued his work. He set up many companies together with entrepreneurs and landowners. That same year, he opened the world&#x27;s first oil &quot;mine&quot; at Bóbrka, near Krosno (still operational as of 2020). At the same time Łukasiewicz continued his work on kerosene lamps. Later that year, he set up the first kerosene street lamp in Gorlice&#x27;s Zawodzie district. In subsequent years he opened several other oil wells, each as a joint venture with local merchants and businessmen. In 1856 in Ulaszowice, near Jasło, he opened an &quot;oil distillery&quot; — the world&#x27;s first industrial oil refinery. As demand for kerosene was still low, the plant initially produced mostly artificial asphalt, machine oil, and lubricants. The refinery was destroyed in an 1859 fire, but was rebuilt at Polanka, near Krosno, the following year.

===Later life and death===

Łukasiewicz married, in 1857, his niece Honorata Stacherska and after losing their only daughter, Marianna, the couple adopted Walentyna Antoniewicz.

By 1863 Łukasiewicz, who had moved to Jasło in 1858, was a wealthy man. He openly supported the January 1863 Uprising and financed help for refugees. In 1865 he bought a large manor and the village of Chorkówka. There he established yet another oil refinery. Having gained one of the largest fortunes in Galicia, Łukasiewicz promoted the development of the oil industry in the areas of Dukla and Gorlice. He gave his name to several oil-mining enterprises in the area, including oil wells at Ropianka, Wilsznia, Smereczne, Ropa, and Wójtowa. He also became a regional benefactor and founded a spa resort at Bóbrka, a chapel at Chorkówka, and a large church at Zręcin.

As one of the best-known businessmen of his time, Łukasiewicz was elected to the Galician Sejm. In 1877 he also organized the first Oil Industry Congress and founded the National Oil Society. Ignacy Łukasiewicz died in Chorkówka, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, on 7 January 1882 of pneumonia and was buried in the small cemetery at the nearby (3 kilometers) Zręcin, next to the Gothic Revival church he had financed.

Based at the Fox Studios lot in Century City, Los Angeles, FX was originally launched by the first-incarnation News Corporation on June 1, 1994, and later became one of the properties that was included in Disney&#x27;s acquisition of one of News Corporation&#x27;s successor companies, 21st Century Fox, in 2019. The channel&#x27;s original programming aspires to the standards of premium cable channels in regard to mature themes and content, high-quality writing, directing and acting. Sister channels FXM and FXX were launched in 1994 and 2013, respectively. FX also carries reruns of theatrical films and terrestrial-network sitcoms. Advertising-free content was available through the FX+ premium subscription service until it was shut down on August 21, 2019, after which ad free content moved to Hulu with no ads.

, FX is available to approximately 71,000,000 pay television households in the United States - down from its 2011 peak of 99,000,000 households. In addition to the flagship U.S. network, the &quot;FX&quot; name is licensed to a number of related pay television channels in various countries around the world.

==History==

===1994–1997: &quot;TV Made Fresh Daily&quot; ===
FX, originally stylized as &quot;fX&quot;, launched on June 1, 1994. Broadcasting from a large &quot;apartment&quot; in Manhattan&#x27;s Flatiron District, fX was one of the first forays into large-scale interactive television. The channel centered on original programming, which was broadcast live every day from the &quot;fX Apartment&quot;, and rebroadcasts of classic television shows from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; and &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. fX had two taglines during this period: &quot;TV Made Fresh Daily&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s First Living Television Network&quot;. The &quot;f&quot; in the channel&#x27;s name and logo was rendered in lower-case to portray a type of relaxed friendliness; the stylized &quot;X&quot; represented the channel&#x27;s roots: the crossing searchlights of the 20th Century Fox logo.

The live shows were each mostly focused on one broad topic. Shows included &quot;Personal fX&quot; (collectibles and antiques), &quot;The Pet Department&quot; (pets), &quot;Under Scrutiny with Jane Wallace&quot; (news) and &quot;Sound fX&quot; (music). The channel&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, hosted by Laurie Hibberd and Tom Bergeron and inspired by the British morning show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, was formatted like an informal magazine show. &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; and &quot;Personal fX&quot; would regularly feature the channel&#x27;s &quot;roving reporters&quot; – which included Suzanne Whang, John Burke and Phil Keoghan – visiting unique places around the United States live via satellite. Other notable fX personalities included Karyn Bryant and Orlando Jones, who were panelists on &quot;Sound fX&quot;.

The channel prided itself on its interactivity with viewers. fX, in 1994, was an early adopter of the internet, embracing e-mail and the World Wide Web as methods of feedback. Most of the shows would feature instant responses to e-mailed questions, and one show, &quot;Backchat&quot; (hosted by Jeff Probst), was exclusively devoted to responding to viewer mail, whether sent through e-mail or traditional postal mail. Select viewers were allowed to spend a day at the &quot;apartment&quot; and take part in all of the channel&#x27;s shows. Inside the channel&#x27;s syndicated programming blocks, channel hosts would frequently appear during commercial breaks to read news headlines, respond to e-mails from viewers about the episode that was airing, or to promote upcoming programming.

In 1995, Liberty Media purchased a 50% stake in the network as part of their alliance with News Corporation to form Fox Sports Net; as a part of this plan, fX became the national home for Fox Sports programming over the next few years.

The first incarnation of fX was not available on Time Warner Cable, one of the major cable systems in New York City, where its programming originated. TWC would not carry the channel until September 2001.

The live shows gradually disappeared one by one until only &quot;Personal fX&quot; remained. &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; was moved to the Fox network and renamed &quot;Fox After Breakfast&quot; in mid-1996. It underwent several format changes, but never found a substantial audience and was canceled less than a year later. By the time that all live programming (with the exception of &quot;Personal fX&quot;) was dropped, the channel focused entirely on its classic television shows until its relaunch in mid-1997. &quot;Personal fX&quot; remained on the refocused FX until May 1, 1998. FX vacated the &quot;apartment&quot; in the summer of 1998 and the channel&#x27;s operations were streamlined with the other Fox-owned subscription channels.

===1997–2001: &quot;Fox Gone Cable&quot;===
In early 1997, fX was relaunched as &quot;FX: Fox Gone Cable&quot;, refocusing the channel&#x27;s target audience towards men aged 18 to 49. During the first few years after its relaunch, FX was known for little else than airing reruns of such Fox shows as &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, as well as 20th Century Fox-produced shows such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The channel also added Major League Baseball games to its lineup at that time (at one point sharing rights with then-sister network Fox Family), and eventually expanded its sports programming to include NASCAR races in 2001.

In the summer of 1998, FX debuted three original series: &quot;Bobcat&#x27;s Big Ass Show&quot;, &quot;Instant Comedy with the Groundlings&quot; and &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Sin City Spectacular&quot;. All three series were cancelled the following year. Soon after its relaunch, the &quot;Fox Gone Cable&quot; tagline was dropped. By 1999, new original TV shows were added with the debut of shows such as &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; (a &quot;Baywatch&quot; parody that starred Timothy Stack and was executive produced by Howard Stern) and &quot;The X Show&quot; (a male-oriented late night panel talk show). The channel also acquired the pay-TV syndication rights to reruns of series such as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot; for then-record high prices then unseen in the pay-TV industry despite all three 20th Century Fox Television series being under common ownership; when these shows expensively fumbled in primetime, FX predominantly ran movies in its more high-profile time periods, though with the move of premiere film rights from free-to-air broadcast networks to basic cable channels, FX unexpectedly would end up a benefactor of this change.

===2002–2007: emergence in original programming===
Beginning in 2002, FX emerged as a major force in original pay-TV programming, gaining both acclaim and notoriety for edgy dramas. That year, FX debuted the police drama &quot;The Shield&quot;, which became a breakout hit. This trend continued the following year with &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, a drama about two plastic surgeons, and the Denis Leary-helmed &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, about the lives of a crew of firemen from the New York City Fire Department post-9/11. Both shows were lauded by critics, and achieved equal success with viewers. &quot;Rescue Me&quot; was one of the few television series to be given an order for an additional season prior to the broadcast of its most recent season: in June 2009 FX renewed the show for an 18-episode sixth season, although the fifth season had not premiered at the time.

Unlike many broadcast networks, FX has chosen to take risks with its programming and push the envelope of what can be shown on television; as a result, most (though not all) of the channel&#x27;s original series are rated TV-MA, often for strong profanity, sexual content, and/or violence. Family organizations such as the Parents Television Council and American Family Association, have asked advertisers to boycott these shows due to their graphic content. Despite this, FX&#x27;s original programming output, outside of a few shows, has been critically acclaimed for their strong storylines and characters.

Capitalizing on the success of the hit documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock launched a new series, &quot;30 Days&quot;, which debuted on FX in June 2005. The series place its subjects in situations uncomfortable to them for 30 days, such as making millionaires work for minimum wage, and having Christians live in a Muslim community.

In the summer of 2005, FX debuted two new comedy series, &quot;Starved&quot;, about the daily lives of four friends with eating disorders who live in New York City; and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, about the usually very politically incorrect comic misadventures of four people who own a bar in the titular city. Both of these shows feature frank sexual dialogue and strong language, and were pitched as &quot;The Dark Side of Comedy&quot;. &quot;Starved&quot; was derided by groups that sought to publicize eating disorders and was cancelled after its first season due to low ratings. Conversely, &quot;Sunny&quot; quickly became a critical darling, consistently achieved high viewership, and was picked up for a second season within days of its first-season finale. The second season added veteran actor Danny DeVito to the cast, and the show, still airing as of 2024, is the longest-running live-action sitcom in history.

In 2006, FX debuted two new series, the reality series &quot;Black. White.&quot; and the drama &quot;Thief&quot;; neither series was picked up for a second season. During 2007, FX introduced three new dramas: &quot;Dirt&quot;, starring Courteney Cox; &quot;The Riches&quot;, starring Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver; and &quot;Damages&quot;, starring Glenn Close, Ted Danson and Rose Byrne. All three performed well in the ratings and were renewed for second seasons. By 2008, FX was available in 90.6 million homes in the U.S.

===2008–2018: subsequent times===
In 2008, FX launched a new branding campaign built around the theme &quot;There Is No Box.&quot; It alluded to the phrase &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; and referred to how the channel&#x27;s programming goes beyond &quot;the box&quot; concept. In addition, this was a pun related to FX&#x27;s creating original shows to compete against premium channels such as HBO. FX&#x27;s logo was updated on December 18, 2007, retaining only the FX wordmark while removing searchlights placed to its left since the 1997 rebrand. The new branding included an advertising campaign featuring a post-game ad for FX during Fox&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLII. The promo used the James Morrison song &quot;You Give Me Something&quot;.

During 2008, competition with other pay-TV channels increased. This was evident in the second season ratings for series &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;The Riches&quot;, whose ratings decreased significantly from their freshman seasons. During some weeks, viewership for both shows barely exceeded 1 million. Both shows were cancelled in 2008; acquired shows &quot;Dharma and Greg&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and &quot;Fear Factor&quot; were also removed from the schedule.

On September 3, 2008, FX debuted &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, a drama series created by Kurt Sutter (who previously served as executive producer of &quot;The Shield&quot;) about a fictional outlaw motorcycle club devoted to protecting their sheltered California town from corporate developers and drug dealers; its September premiere coincided with that of &quot;The Shield&quot;″s final season. &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; became a critical and commercial success, having aired for seven seasons . In 2010, the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it &quot;FX&quot;″s highest rated series to date. Other new shows that premiered in 2008 included the Kenny Hotz comedy &quot;Testees&quot;, which debuted in October 2008 and was cancelled after its first season. In August 2008, FX relaunched its website, adding streaming of full episodes of its original shows. In 2009, reruns of the former ABC sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; were removed from the schedule (though it was restored early the following year).

In July 2009, FX ordered three new comedy pilots: &quot;Archer&quot;, an animated series featuring a spy agency, which premiered on January 14, 2010; &quot;The League&quot;, with a group of friends who are part of a fantasy football league; and &quot;Louie&quot;, a sitcom starring stand-up comedian and writer Louis C.K., which &quot;blend[s] stand-up material with ... &#x27;extended vignettes&#x27; depicting moments from [the comedian&#x27;s] offstage experiences.&quot; The following year, FX debuted &quot;Wilfred&quot;, a comedy series starring Elijah Wood. It is based on the Australian series &quot;Wilfred&quot;.

In March 2010, the channel debuted &quot;Justified&quot;, a drama series created by Graham Yost based on Elmore Leonard&#x27;s short story &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; (which was the series&#x27; original working title). It starred Timothy Olyphant as U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens – a tough, soft-spoken lawman with a rough side – and chronicles his cases and personal life, including unfinished business with an ex-wife and his aging father. FX also picked up the crime comedy-drama &quot;Terriers&quot;, created by Ted Griffin, for its fall 2010 lineup; in 2011, the channel debuted the boxing drama &quot;Lights Out&quot;, about retired boxing champion Patrick &quot;Lights&quot; Leary who is considering a comeback, despite the serious risks it entails. Despite the critical acclaim that &quot;Terriers&quot; and &quot;Lights Out&quot; received, the two series were cancelled after their first seasons due to low viewership; For &quot;Terriers&quot; specifically, FX Networks president and General Manager John Landgraf would later admit in a 2016 interview with critic Alan Sepinwall that &quot;I cannot think of a more painful moment of my career than the one when I defined &quot;Terriers&quot; as a failure by canceling it.&quot;

On October 1, 2010, parent company News Corporation (which spun off FX and the company&#x27;s other U.S.-based entertainment properties to 21st Century Fox in July 2013) pulled its channels from Dish Network due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent revenue. FX returned to the satellite provider&#x27;s channel lineup on October 29, 2010, after Dish Network and News Corporation signed a long-term carriage agreement. On November 1, 2010, following a similar dispute, FX and its sister channels were restored by New York City-based cable provider Cablevision through a separate carriage agreement.

On October 14, 2011, FX announced it picked up the rights to develop a series based on &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Lords of the Sunset Strip&quot;, the autobiographies of the Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis and his father, Blackie Dammett. HBO had picked up the series, which was to be titled &quot;Spider &amp; Son&quot;, a few years before but never completed the project. &quot;Entourage&quot; writer/producers Marc Abrams and Mike Benson were tapped as its showrunners and Kiedis was to be involved as a co-producer. Dammett said in 2013 that the show has been &quot;mothballed&quot;, and he hopes interest will resume on the project once the Red Hot Chili Peppers wrapped up their world tour that year. As of 2014 there has been no mention from FX, Kiedis or Dammett on the status of the series. On January 30, 2013, FX premiered the 1980s-set Cold War drama &quot;The Americans&quot;.

In 2013, FX underwent a rebranding to accompany its new comedy-focused spin-off channel FXX, including the new slogan &quot;Fearless&quot;; Landgraf explained that the slogan symbolized that viewers of its programming &quot;don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen and that you&#x27;re not in a safe place that is governed by guardrails that are going to keep you from going off.&quot;

=== 2019–present: Disney subsidiary ===

On March 20, 2019, the Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox. Consequently, FX Networks was integrated into the newly renamed Walt Disney Television unit. In a September 2018 interview with &quot;Variety&quot; of the Disney-Fox deal, Landgraf said, &quot;I think this is a necessary step. I have curiosity and a bit of anxiety about how it will work, but I&#x27;m really excited about it.

On April 8, 2019, FX Networks had acquired off-network rights to &quot;Family Guy&quot;, starting with its sixteenth season and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, starting with its ninth season. &quot;Family Guy&quot; began airing on FXX on April 16, 2019, while &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; made its debut on September 24, 2019. FXX shares the rights to &quot;Family Guy&quot; with sister network Freeform. WarnerMedia&#x27;s Adult Swim and TBS held the rights to older seasons of both shows; WarnerMedia&#x27;s rights to &quot;Family Guy&quot; expired on September 18, 2021, at which point reruns are exclusive to FX Networks and Freeform, with the rights to &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; similarly coming under FX Networks&#x27; full control in 2023.

On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division of Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International with Comcast effectively becoming a silent partner. In November 2019, it was announced that FX would produce series for Hulu under the &quot;FX on Hulu&quot; brand. Four series previously in development for the linear FX channel would now premiere on Hulu, including &quot;Devs&quot;, &quot;Mrs. America&quot; and &quot;A Teacher&quot;. Furthermore, episodes aired on the linear FX cable network will be available on Hulu the next day.

On June 11, 2019, Hulu and FX picked up show rights to Lionsgate films released in 2020 and 2021.

In December 2021, Disney renamed the &quot;FX on Hulu&quot; hub to simply &quot;FX&quot; as part of an effort to streamline and extend the brand&#x27;s use. In addition, Disney began to increase the prominence of FX as an imprint on its original programming, especially when carried on Disney&#x27;s international streaming platforms such as Disney+ (Star) and Star+.

In 2024, FX won its first Emmy Award for Best Drama for &quot;Shōgun&quot;, which received a record total of 18 Emmy wins.

==Programming==

FX&#x27;s most popular original shows include &quot;Justified&quot;, &quot;Damages&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;The League&quot;, &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;, &quot;The Strain&quot;, &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;Anger Management&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Better Things&quot;, &quot;Louie&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Worst&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot;, &quot;Snowfall&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot;.

The channel also broadcasts theatrically released feature films from sister companies Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, and 20th Century Studios as well as other film studios such as Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate Films, Relativity Media, Village Roadshow Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation which take up much of FX&#x27;s primetime and the majority of its weekend schedules. It airs repeats of network television sitcoms (such as &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;). From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the acquired shows which FX broadcast consisted largely of series originally broadcast on Fox between the late 1980s and the 2000s (such as &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, and &quot;In Living Color&quot;).

===Sports programming===
FX has served as a supplemental sports outlet for its sister networks, first broadcasting Fox Sports-produced programming under News Corporation&#x27;s and 21st Century Fox&#x27;s ownership, and ESPN-produced programming since the Disney acquisition of FX.

After obtaining the spring broadcast rights to NASCAR, Fox Sports announced that FX would serve as its cable partner for the 2001 inaugural season of race telecasts. As a result, FX covered several races in the series then known as the Busch Series and Winston Cup (including the All-Star Race), as well as select qualifying and final practice sessions. Having FX carry the race telecasts was intended to promote the channel and encourage NASCAR fans to contact their subscription providers to add FX to their lineup. In 2002, Peter Liguori, who was then president of FX, praised NASCAR for its growth; FX increased penetration from 58.5 million to 76.6 million households nationwide. FX was removed from Fox&#x27;s NASCAR coverage in the 2007 season, which saw the Busch Series move exclusively to ESPN, and Fox aired all of Nextel Cup races on broadcast television.

In 1997, FX obtained partial cable rights to Major League Baseball games; FX initially aired game telecasts on Monday nights, before moving them to Saturday nights in 1998. In 2000, FX began sharing the cable rights with then-sister network Fox Family Channel (taking rights to the league&#x27;s Thursday evening games from Fox Sports Net), with games being scheduled on an alternating basis with FX. Starting with the 2001 season, FX also obtained rights to games from the MLB Division Series, the only playoff round to which Fox did not hold television rights. Among the games televised on FX was Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s final home game with the Baltimore Orioles in September 2001.

On April 27, 2011, FX began airing soccer games from the UEFA Champions League as part of the league&#x27;s overall television deal with Fox Sports. In the fall of 2011, FX began broadcasting Big 12, Conference USA and Pac-12 college football games on Saturdays (mainly primetime games, with some daytime games mixed in), as part of Fox Sports&#x27; broadcasting contracts with the three conferences.

With the August 2013 launches of national sports networks Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, FX no longer served as a regular cable outlet for Fox Sports, but it still occasionally aired sporting events in the event of overflow situations, such as the UFC 185 preliminary card, and selected soccer matches.

On September 7, 2019, FX would air the preliminary card for UFC 242. The event was being held in Abu Dhabi, which created conflicts with Saturday afternoon college football games on ESPN and ESPN2; it marked the first ESPN-produced sporting event to air on FX since the Disney acquisition of FX. For similar reasons, FX also aired the preliminary card for UFC 309 on Saturday, November 16, 2024. ESPN called UFC 309 airing on FX &quot;a success&quot; and announced that the subsequent UFC event, UFC 310, would have its preliminary card simulcast on ESPN2 and FX. UFC 311 also saw its prelimnary card air on FX.

On May 17, 2022, Disney announced that it had acquired the exclusive broadcast rights to the XFL beginning with its 2023 season, with games airing on FX, ESPN, and ABC; FX was included in the package to accommodate ESPN and ABC&#x27;s existing programming commitments. With its first XFL broadcast in February 2023, FX introduced an &quot;ESPN on FX&quot; brand for sports broadcasts carried by FX, modelled after the existing ESPN on ABC branding. However, due to low viewership, ESPN quietly discontinued the broadcasts on FX by early-March, and had rescheduled some of them to its own networks, this coverage did not return in 2024 due to a merger with the United States Football League to form the United Football League, in which rights were split between the main ESPN networks and ABC (FX was excluded from this contract) and Fox Sports.

==High definition==
FX began broadcasting a 720p HD channel in 2007, which is available on the majority of pay television providers. The SD channel, as was standard with all of Fox&#x27;s broadcast and pay-TV networks (and also its new Disney siblings, which also all operate in 720p), is now merely downscaled from the HD feed at the provider headend level rather than having a devoted SD feed. 

FX&#x27;s programming on Hulu is streamed at a higher bitrate and resolution, with its FX on Hulu-era shows produced and aired in up to 4k resolution.

==International distribution==

Since 2004, Fox overseen the expansion of FX&#x27;s to international markets, as well as forming several distribution partnerships to syndicate FX programs to other broadcast networks, cable channels, and video services on request outside the United States.

In March 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, after the acquisition Disney would expand the network more by rebranding several Fox networks in the Baltic states, CIS, Greece and Poland as FX, as result of the acquisition.

FX programs in Canada are also distributed through agreement with Rogers Sports &amp; Media.

<doc id="434002" wikidata="Q7793214" url="?curid=434002" title="Thomas Porteous">
<text>Gabriel Thomas Porteous Jr. (December 15, 1946 – November 14, 2021) was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. He served for sixteen years before being impeached and removed from office in December 2010. He died on November 14, 2021, aged 74.

==Education and career==
Porteous was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in 1968 and a Juris Doctor from Louisiana State University Law School in 1971. He was a special counsel to the Office of the State Attorney General, Louisiana from 1971 to 1973. He served as Chief of the Felony Complaint Division in the District Attorney&#x27;s Office, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, from 1973 to 1975.

He was in private practice in Gretna from 1973 to 1980, and in Metairie from 1980 to 1984. He was a city attorney of Harahan from 1982 to 1984. He was elected as a judge on the 24th Judicial District Court of Louisiana in 1984 and served until 1994.

==Federal judicial service==
On August 25, 1994, Porteous was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana vacated by Robert Frederick Collins. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 7, 1994, and received his commission on October 11, 1994.

==Notable rulings==
Porteous ruled in several landmark cases against the state, including one 2002 case in which he ruled that the state of Louisiana was illegally using federal money to promote religion in its abstinence-only sex education programs. He ordered the state to stop giving money to individuals or organizations that &quot;convey religious messages or otherwise advance religion&quot; with tax dollars. Judge Porteous also said there was ample evidence that many of the groups participating in the Governor&#x27;s Program on Abstinence were &quot;furthering religious objectives.&quot; Those who supported such groups objected to his ruling.

Also in 2002, Porteous overturned a federal ban on rave paraphernalia such as glowsticks, pacifiers, and dust masks, originally banned due to the subculture&#x27;s ties to recreational drugs such as Ecstasy, after the American Civil Liberties Union successfully claimed the ban to be unconstitutional. He had previously ruled in 1999 against a Louisiana law aimed at banning the second trimester abortion procedure known as intact dilation and extraction.

==Bankruptcy==
In 2001, Porteous filed for bankruptcy, which led to revelations in the press about his private life, specifically the fact that he was alleged to have had close ties with local bail bond magnate Louis Marcotte III, at the center of a corruption probe. Porteous himself was the subject of investigation by federal investigators.

In May 2006, Porteous, beset by the recent loss of his home due to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, and the death of his wife a few months later, and still under investigation by a federal grand jury, was granted temporary medical leave and began a year-long furlough from the federal bench.

==Impeachment proceedings==

On June 18, 2008, the Judicial Conference of the United States transmitted a certificate to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives expressing the Conference&#x27;s determination that consideration of impeachment of Porteous might be warranted. The certificate stated that there was substantial evidence that Porteous &quot;repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath,&quot; thus concealing &quot;cash and things of value that he solicited and received from lawyers appearing in litigation before him.&quot; 
In a specific case,

he denied a motion to recuse based on his relationship with lawyers in the case . . . and failed to disclose that the lawyers in question had often provided him with cash. Thereafter, while a bench verdict (that is, a verdict by a judge sitting without a jury) was pending, he solicited and received from the lawyers appearing before him illegal gratuities in the form of cash and other things of value

thus depriving &quot;the public of its right to his honest services.&quot; The certificate concluded that this conduct &quot;constituted an abuse of his judicial office&quot; in violation of the Canons of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.

The certificate also stated that there was substantial evidence that Porteous had &quot;repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath&quot; in connection with his bankruptcy, allowing &quot;him to obtain a discharge of his debts while continuing his lifestyle at the expense of his creditors.&quot; Further, he had &quot;made false representations to gain the extension of a bank loan with the intent to defraud the bank.&quot;

===Investigation===
On September 18, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to proceed with an investigation of the bribery and perjury allegations. On October 15, 2008, House Judiciary Chair John Conyers announced that Alan I. Barron had been hired as Special Counsel to lead an inquiry into Porteous&#x27;s impeachment. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) were designated as Chair and Ranking Member, respectively, to lead the task force conducting the inquiry. Three months later, the House passed via voice vote a Conyers-sponsored resolution authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to run an impeachment inquiry into whether the House should impeach Porteous. The resolution was needed because the previous year&#x27;s investigation had ended with the previous Congress. In October 2009, Reps. Conyers and Lamar S. Smith introduced a resolution asking to access the judge&#x27;s tax returns as part of the investigation. The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee and, at the same time, a timeframe was established which called for the investigation to end in November 2009; the Judicial Impeachment Task Force would decide by the end of the year if impeachment would be recommended to the Judiciary Committee. If the recommendation was for impeachment, the Committee would take up the matter in early 2010. The task force scheduled the first hearings on the case for November 17 and 18, with more meetings in December before a final recommendation was made.

===Impeachment===
On November 13, Porteous sued the task force, claiming that the panel was violating his Fifth Amendment rights by using testimony given under immunity in making the case against him. On January 21, 2010, the panel voted unanimously to recommend four articles of impeachment to the full Judiciary Committee, which, on January 27, voted to send the articles of impeachment to the full House. On March 4, 2010, the full Committee reported , a resolution of impeachment of Porteous, to the full House. The full House considered the impeachment resolution on March 11, 2010, and voted to adopt all four articles, all of which passed unanimously, becoming the third of only three unanimous impeachment votes; the first was Harry E. Claiborne and the second was Walter Nixon. The subjects of the articles of impeachment, and the corresponding vote of the House of Representatives, appear below:
:Article I – engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge – Passed the House by a vote of 412–0.
:Article II – engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court Judge – Passed the House by a vote of 410–0.
:Article III – knowingly and intentionally making false statements, under penalty of perjury, related to his personal bankruptcy filing and violating a bankruptcy court order – Passed the House by a vote of 416–0.
:Article IV – knowingly made material false statements about his past to both the United States Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to obtain the office of United States District Court Judge – Passed the House by a vote of 423–0.

The same day, Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) were appointed managers to conduct the trial in the Senate. In addition, Schiff and Goodlatte were designated as the lead managers. The articles of impeachment were sent to the Senate, where the proceedings were started on March 17. On that same day, Senators passed two resolutions: one provided for a summons for Porteous to answer the articles against him, and the other provided for a committee to analyze the evidence against him and report their findings to the full Senate. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) were designated as Chair and Vice Chair of the committee, respectively. The committee met on April 16. The trial was due to begin in early August, with a vote before the Senate happening in late September, but due to delays, it did not begin until mid-September, with a vote scheduled for December 8, 2010.

===Trial===
On December 7, 2010, the full Senate began hearing the impeachment trial. Senate President pro tempore Daniel Inouye presided over the trial. Jonathan Turley, acting in Judge Porteous&#x27;s defense, announced that Judge Porteous had decided to leave the federal bench in 2011 were he not removed from office.

The following day, the Senate voted unanimously to convict Porteous on the first of four impeachment charges, removing him from the bench, before subsequently convicting him on the remaining three articles. In a separate vote, per a motion by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Senate disqualified Porteous from ever holding &quot;any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States&quot; again. He is one of only three former federal officers to be permanently banned from holding federal office after being impeached and removed, the others being West Hughes Humphreys and Robert W. Archbald.

:Article I – engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge – Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 96–0.
:Article II – engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court Judge – Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 69–27.
:Article III – knowingly and intentionally making false statements, under penalty of perjury, related to his personal bankruptcy filing and violating a bankruptcy court order – Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 88–8.
:Article IV – knowingly made material false statements about his past to both the United States Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to obtain the office of United States District Court Judge – Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 90–6.
:Disqualification – Forever disqualified to hold any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States – Disqualified by the Senate by a vote of 94–2. 

On January 15, 2011, Porteous gave up his law license in lieu of facing discipline, and agreed to never practice law in Louisiana again. According to the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board, Porteous&#x27;s conviction by the Senate effectively ended his legal career.

<doc id="434005" wikidata="Q3300483" url="?curid=434005" title="Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition">
<text>The Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition was an exposition held in Nashville from May 1 – October 31, 1897 in what is now Centennial Park. A year late, it celebrated the 100th anniversary of Tennessee&#x27;s entry into the union in 1796. President William McKinley officially opened the event from the White House, where he pressed a button that started the machinery building at the fair; he would visit in person a month later.

==Description==
The Exposition grounds covered about 200 acres and was located on the western fringe of the city, with access to the streetcar line. The landscape plan featured the notable blue grass of the region planted in lawn areas. The more than 100 buildings included those devoted to agriculture, commerce, education, fine arts, history, machinery, minerals and forestry, and transportation. Others had special exhibits related to children, women and the United States Government. Many cities and organizations built buildings and exhibit halls on the Exposition grounds. Foreign nations also were represented here. 

The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad played a central role in the promotion and success of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, and carried tourists to the event. John W. Thomas, who was president of the Railroad at the time, served as president of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Major Eugene Castner Lewis, who was the chief civil engineer for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad, served as the director general of the Exposition. Lewis had suggested that a reproduction of the Parthenon be built in Nashville as the centerpiece of Tennessee’s Centennial Celebration to highlight the city as the &quot;Athens of the South&quot;. 
The City of Memphis featured a large pyramid in its exhibit, in honor of its Egyptian name. The Parthenon and the Pyramid were located next to each other on the shore of Lake Wautaga. Both the exhibits were lit at night. The separate Egyptian Pavilion featured popular belly dancers. During the exposition, Italian-style gondolas plied the lake, carrying tourists by water between exhibits. 

Also located along Lake Watauga, the Negro Building was designed in a Spanish Renaissance style. Exhibits came from numerous cities, and Fisk University and Tuskegee Institute had their own exhibits. Booker T. Washington, president of the latter, was a featured speaker on Emancipation Day.

The total attendance was 1,786,714, of which the total paid attendance was 1,166,692. The total receipts were $1,101,285 (equivalent to $ in ), and the disbursements $1,101,246 (equivalent to $ in ).

The Parthenon was so popular that it was kept after most buildings and exhibits were dismantled. The original exposition grounds were adapted as Centennial Park for the city. Lake Watauga was also retained in the city park. The Centennial Exposition was a great success and is still considered one of the most notable events ever to be held in the state. Unlike most World&#x27;s Fairs, it did not lose money, but the final accounting showed a direct profit of less than $50.

==Later developments==
The fair remains a great source of civic pride for Nashvillians. Today the fairgrounds survive as Centennial Park, the flagship park managed by the Metropolitan Nashville Parks and Recreation Department. 

The Parthenon replica built for the exhibition was made of temporary materials. Because of its popularity, it was reconstructed using permanent materials in a project lasting from 1920 to 1931. Today it is used as an art museum. Among its exhibits is Alan LeQuire&#x27;s 1990 re-creation of the &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; statue. 

Nearly a century later, the United States held the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee.

<doc id="434018" wikidata="Q2548119" url="?curid=434018" title="Uninvited (song)">
<text>&quot;Uninvited&quot; is a song by Canadian recording artist and songwriter Alanis Morissette, released as a single from the soundtrack of &quot;City of Angels&quot; in February 1998, becoming Morissette&#x27;s first new recording since her international debut album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995). Morissette wrote the song and co-produced it with Rob Cavallo. &quot;Uninvited&quot; is driven by four piano notes and builds to an instrumental climax, and haunting atmosphere accompanied by cryptic lyrics.

Because the song was not released as a physical single in the United States, it was not allowed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to rules in place at the time. It instead appeared on the Hot 100 Airplay chart, peaking at number four in June 1998. In Canada, &quot;Uninvited&quot; reached number seven on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart. Elsewhere, the single peaked at number one in El Salvador and number six in Iceland. In 1999, the song won two Grammy Awards: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song.

==Background and release==
After the massive success of her breakthrough album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995) (which spawned the worldwide hits, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;Head over Feet&quot; and &quot;You Learn&quot;), Morissette was considered one of the biggest music stars in the world, and many fans anxiously awaited a follow-up album. That would be &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;, released in November 1998; however, &quot;Uninvited&quot; was released as the lead single from the &quot;City of Angels&quot; soundtrack prior to that.

&quot;Uninvited&quot; was released to American radio stations in March 1998 and was still receiving substantial radio airplay by the following August. An internet and radio leak of &quot;Uninvited&quot; in early March forced Warner Bros. to release the entire soundtrack to radio before it became available in stores. According to a publicity manager for Warner Music Canada, the measure was &quot;an inconvenience&quot; taken to stop radio stations from playing low-quality versions of the song downloaded from the internet.

Following the song&#x27;s leak, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) took down several websites featuring the song. &quot;Uninvited&quot; was due for release on March 31, but was leaked to radio on March 6. &quot;Newsbytes&quot;, a computer industry news service, reported that fast-working fans in Los Angeles, upon hearing the song on KROQ, taped the track and uploaded it onto their websites. Several sites were involved, according to &quot;Newsbytes&quot;, including ones based in Los Angeles, London and Mexico City. The unauthorized material was removed, and in several cases, the whole site was shut down. The action was part of a campaign by the RIAA to stop unauthorized reproductions of recordings on the internet.

&quot;Uninvited&quot; was not included on &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;, but a demo version was included as a bonus track on the Australian and Japanese releases of the album as well as a B-side in the UK CD single for &quot;Thank U&quot;. The compilation &quot;Alanis Morissette: The Collection&quot; (2005) was Morissette&#x27;s first album to include the song in its original studio format; she had performed an acoustic version of the song during her 1999 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance, which was released as the album &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;. An acoustic version of the song was also included on the video album &quot;Live in the Navajo Nation&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Uninvited&quot; is driven by four piano notes and builds to an instrumental climax. According to one critic, &quot;Uninvited&quot; is a moody song that contains an &quot;indelible melody and haunting atmosphere&quot; accompanied by cryptic lyrics.

==Reception==
&quot;Uninvited&quot; was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television, winning in the Female Rock Vocal and Best Rock Song categories. It also won an ASCAP Award for Most Performed Song from Motion Pictures and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song - Motion Picture. Additionally, the song entered &quot;About.com&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Alanis Morissette Lyrics&quot; list at number 10, with Bill Lamb picking the lyrics, &quot;Like anyone would be, I am flattered by your fascination with me, Like any hot blooded woman, I have simply wanted an object to crave&quot; as the best. Although never officially released as a single to retail outlets (which prevented it from charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), the song became a hit for Morissette. &quot;Uninvited&quot; was Morissette&#x27;s fourth number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart and it reached the top five on the Adult Top 40 and the top 40 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It became a success in El Salvador, peaking at number one, becoming Morissette&#x27;s first chart-topper there. Worldwide, &quot;Uninvited&quot; sold over seven million copies.

==Music video==
No music video accompanied the single&#x27;s release, but three videos of performances of &quot;Uninvited&quot; were released: the first one at the 1999 Grammy Awards, another on the &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot; (2002) release, and another on the extended cut of &quot;VH1 Storytellers: Alanis Morissette&quot;. This performance was not included in the original &quot;Storytellers&quot; broadcast in 1999.

<doc id="434025" wikidata="Q27677" url="?curid=434025" title="Kathleen Sebelius">
<text>Kathleen Sebelius (; née Gilligan, born May 15, 1948) is an American politician who served as the 21st United States Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2009 until 2014. As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sebelius was instrumental in overseeing the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Before becoming secretary, she served as the 44th governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, the second woman to hold that office. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Sebelius was the Democratic respondent to the 2008 State of the Union address and is chair-emerita of the Democratic Governors Association (she was its first female chair). She is CEO of Sebelius Resources LLC. In August 2023, Sebelius was awarded the Kettering Foundation David Mathews Democracy Fellowship Award.

==Early life and education==
Sebelius was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of Mary Kathryn (née Dixon) and John J. Gilligan. Sebelius was the second oldest of four children in her family. Her family ran funeral homes and her father was a city councilor in Cincinnati. Jack Gilligan ran for Congress near the end of Sebelius&#x27;s time in high school and served one term in Congress. Her father was elected governor of Ohio when Sebelius was 21 years old. Sebelius worked in her father&#x27;s campaign traveling around the state. Her family was Catholic and has Irish ancestry.

She attended the Summit Country Day School in Cincinnati and graduated from Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C., with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. She later earned a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of Kansas. She moved to Kansas in 1974.

==Early career==
Sebelius served as executive director and chief lobbyist for the Kansas Trial Lawyers Association from 1977 to 1986.

==Kansas House of Representatives (1987–1995)==
Sebelius was first elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1986. She won re-election in 1988, 1990, and 1992. She represented Topeka, Kansas.

===Tenure===
In the 1988 presidential election, she endorsed Gary Hart.

In 1991, she ran to become House Majority Leader but lost to State Representative Tom Sawyer of Wichita.

She is strongly pro-choice.

===Committee assignments===
*Federal and State Affairs Committee (Chair)

==Kansas Insurance Commissioner (1995–2003)==
In 1994, Sebelius left the state House of Representatives to run for state Insurance Commissioner and stunned political forecasters by winningthe first time a Democrat had won the position in over a century.

She refused to take campaign contributions from the insurance industry and blocked the proposed merger of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, the state&#x27;s largest health insurer, with an Indiana-based company. Sebelius&#x27;s decision marked the first time the corporation had been rebuffed in its acquisition attempts.

When Sebelius became commissioner in 1995, the Insurance Department had an annual budget of $11.7 million. By 2002, the budget had been cut to $10 million. Among the cuts was spending on contracted services after Sebelius fired two contracted lawyers after an audit discovered they had overbilled the state.

In 2001 Sebelius was named as one of &quot;Governing Magazine&quot;″s Public Officials of the Year while she was serving as Kansas Insurance Commissioner.

==Governor of Kansas (2003–2009)==
===2002 election===

In the general election, Sebelius&#x27;s platform included promises to protect school budgets from budget cuts, not to raise taxes, and to completely review and overhaul the state government. Sebelius raised $4 million for the campaign, a Kansas state fundraising record. Sebelius defeated Republican Kansas State Treasurer Tim Shallenburger 53%–45%. Sebelius&#x27;s election made her and her father the first father/daughter governor duo in the United States.

===First term===
Throughout her first term, Sebelius built upon her popularity and in January 2006 was tied for 20th most popular governor in the country.

During the 2004 election, CNN speculated Sebelius could be a potential running mate for John Kerry.

In November 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named Sebelius as one of the five best governors in America, praising her for eliminating a $1.1 billion debt she inherited, ferreting out waste in state government, and strongly supporting public educationall without raising taxes, although she proposed raising sales, property, and income taxes. The article also praised her bipartisan approach to governing, a useful trait in a state where Republicans have usually controlled the Legislature.

In February 2006, the White House Project named Sebelius one of its &quot;8 in &#x27;08&quot;, a group of eight female politicians who could possibly run and be elected president in 2008. She was also cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to be among the women most likely to become the first female President of the United States.

In October 2006, the Cato Institute gave Sebelius the grade of &quot;D&quot; on their biennial fiscal policy report card, which measures the fiscal performance of U.S. governors based on spending and taxes. Her grade was influenced by the combination of proposed tax increases and expanded spending growth beyond population plus inflation.

===2006 re-election===

On May 26, 2006, Sebelius formally announced her candidacy for re-election. Four days later, Mark Parkinson, former chair of the Kansas Republican Party, switched his party affiliation to Democrat; the following day Sebelius announced that Parkinson would be her running mate for lieutenant governor. Parkinson had previously served in the state House during 1991 and 1992 and the Senate from 1993 to 1997. Parkinson was viewed as a pro-business moderate who strongly supported public education. This was somewhat reminiscent of the fact that John Moore had also been a Republican, before switching just days before joining Sebelius as her running mate.

She was challenged by Republican Kansas State Senator Jim Barnett. A September 1 Rasmussen poll showed Sebelius with an 11% lead over Barnett. Other polls gave Sebelius as much as a 20% lead. , 50% of Kansas voters were registered Republicans, compared to 27% as registered Democrats. Sebelius nevertheless won re-election, defeating Barnett 57%–41%. Because of Kansas&#x27;s term limits law, her second term as Governor was her last.

===Second term===

In February 2008, during Sebelius&#x27;s second term in office, there was a report in the &quot;Wichita Eagle&quot; that the State of Kansas was suspending tax refunds and that, because of a lack of tax revenue, might not be able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.

After Barack Obama&#x27;s clinching of the Democratic nomination for President in June 2008, speculation that Sebelius would be a contender for the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket continued. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; listed her as the top prospect for the 2008 nomination. James Carville and Bob Novak also mentioned Sebelius&#x27;s name, and Wesley Clark, also considered a potential running mate, publicly endorsed Sebelius, referring to her as &quot;the next vice-president of the United States&quot;. Speculation that the vice presidential nomination lay in her future was heightened by the fact that she was chosen by the Democratic Party&#x27;s congressional leaders to give their party&#x27;s official response to Republican president George W. Bush&#x27;s 2008 State of the Union Address. The next day, she endorsed Obama&#x27;s campaign, one week before the Kansas caucus on Super Tuesday. Obama won the caucus easily, with 74% support.

Speculation on her vice presidential selection intensified when a report from political ad agency insider, Tribble Ad Agency, reported on its website that the Obama Campaign owned the domain name &quot;ObamaSebelius.com&quot; through the GoDaddy.com registration service. However, just after midnight on August 23, it was reported by the Associated Press that Obama ultimately selected Joe Biden, the senior senator from Delaware, as his running mate.

Sebelius is a former chair of the Democratic Governors Association. She was the first female chair of the association (elected as such in 2006).

==U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (2009–2014)==
===Nomination===
Sebelius was an early supporter of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign, endorsing him in January 2008. After he was elected the President of the United States, Sebelius&#x27; early support for Obama and her ability to govern as a Democrat in a heavily Republican state made Sebelius look like a likely nominee for Obama&#x27;s Cabinet. Sebelius asked to be removed from consideration on December 6, 2008. Following Bill Richardson&#x27;s withdrawal as Obama&#x27;s nomination for Secretary of Commerce, there was media speculation that Sebelius would be chosen as the new nominee. Through a spokesperson, Sebelius reiterated her earlier statement that she would not consider accepting a nomination to the Cabinet position.

On February 28, 2009, it was reported that Sebelius had accepted Obama&#x27;s nomination for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. On March 2, 2009, Obama officially announced Governor Sebelius as his nominee. At Obama&#x27;s announcement, Sebelius was accompanied by two Kansas Republicans, former U.S. Senators Bob Dole and Pat Roberts.

Sebelius was Obama&#x27;s second choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services. Obama&#x27;s first pick, former Senator Tom Daschle, withdrew from consideration on February 3 after it was revealed he had over $140,000 in tax errors. In a March 2009 letter to the Senate Finance Committee, Sebelius admitted to &quot;unintentional errors&quot; in tax returns and paid nearly $8,000 in back taxes to rectify the errors. A letter to Sebelius from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and ranking member Chuck Grassley acknowledged their review of Sebelius found no other items needing to be addressed and Baucus, a Democrat, publicly expressed his continued support for Sebelius&#x27; nomination.

Anti-abortion activists and senators were the primary opponents of Sebelius&#x27;s nomination. In answer to questions from the Senate Finance Committee during her April 2009 confirmation hearing, Sebelius stated she received $12,450 between 1994 and 2001 from physician George Tiller, one of only three late term abortion providers nationwide, who was later assassinated. The Associated Press, however, reported that from 2000 to 2002 Tiller gave at least $23,000 more to a political action committee Sebelius established to raise money for Democrats while she was serving as state insurance commissioner.

The Senate Finance Committee approved Sebelius&#x27; nomination with a vote of 15 to 8. The full United States Senate voted to confirm Sebelius by a vote of 65 to 31. She was sworn in on April 28, 2009, amidst an outbreak of swine flu in the United States. Lieutenant Governor Parkinson was sworn in as Governor of Kansas and served the remainder of Sebelius&#x27;s term. As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sebelius led an agency with 6,500 employees and a $700 billion annual budget.

===Affordable Care Act===
Sebelius is a staunch advocate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. In response to glitches and failures during the launch of the ACA website, HealthCare.gov, she said in October 2013, &quot;You deserve better. I apologize. I&#x27;m accountable to you for fixing these problems and I&#x27;m committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.&quot; Republicans called for her resignation in response to the website problems. Fifty-five members of the House of Representatives called for her resignation, while U.S. Senators Ted Cruz, Lamar Alexander and Pat Roberts all called for her resignation. In response to the calls to resign, Sebelius said: &quot;The majority of people calling for me to resign I would say are people who I don&#x27;t work for, and who do not want this program to work in the first place.&quot;

In 2009, 2010, and 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Sebelius the 57th, 23rd, and 13th most powerful woman in the world, respectively.

===Hatch Act concern===
On September 13, 2012, the Office of Special Counsel charged Sebelius with violating the Hatch Act by making a political remark during an official government event. Sebelius&#x27;s office reclassified the event from official to political and reimbursed the government&#x27;s expenses.

===Resignation===
On April 11, 2014, Sebelius announced her resignation from her position as Secretary of Health and Human Services. That same day, President Obama nominated Sylvia Mathews Burwell as Sebelius&#x27; successor. Burwell was sworn in on June 9, 2014.

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Sebelius is &quot;staunchly pro-choice&quot;. Her office stated that abortions declined 8.5% during her tenure as governor. According to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment statistics, the number of induced abortions in Kansas declined by 1,568, or 12.6%, from 2001 to 2007, the year of the most recently available statistics. Her administration attributes the decline to health care reforms that Sebelius initiated, including &quot;adoption incentives, extended health services for pregnant women..., sex education and ... a variety of support services for families&quot;. Nationally, the number of abortions declined approximately 7.6% from 2000 to 2005, the year of the most recently available and reliable U.S. statistics.

Sebelius has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, which has raised funds on her behalf. In 2003, 2005, 2006, and again in 2008, Sebelius vetoed legislation that would have limited abortions in Kansas.

On April 21, 2008, Sebelius vetoed House Substitute for Senate Bill 389, titled the &quot;Comprehensive Abortion Reform Act&quot; by its sponsors. Proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen late-term abortion laws and prevent so-called &quot;coerced abortions&quot;, particularly with respect to minors. The &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; reported that HS SB 389 would have required the State of Kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for late-term abortions, and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a late-term abortion in violation of Kansas law. Sebelius objected to the constitutionality, efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation. She wrote, &quot;The United States Supreme Court decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman&#x27;s life or health. However, SB 389 allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even where it may be necessary to save her life. I am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse, endangers the lives of women.&quot; In addition, she expressed concern that the bill would &quot;likely encourage extensive litigation&quot; and that it &quot;unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of Kansas women&#x27;s confidential medical records&quot;.

Sebelius is a member of the Catholic Church; however, in early March 2009, then-Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke, prefect for the Apostolic Signatura, the Holy See&#x27;s highest court, declared that Sebelius should not approach the altar for Communion in the United States, saying that, &quot;after pastoral admonition, she obstinately persists in serious sin&quot;. Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Fred Naumann also asked that Sebelius no longer receive Holy Communion because of her position on abortion. Naumann criticized Sebelius for vetoing HS SB 389. The action received mixed reviews in the Catholic press.

Anti-abortion activists criticized Sebelius&#x27;s HHS nomination because she had received donations to her campaign from George Tiller, the medical director of an abortion clinic in Wichita. Not long after Sebelius was sworn in as HHS Secretary, on May 31, 2009, Tiller was assassinated by Scott Roeder.

===Morning-after pill===
Despite her pro-choice view, in December 2011, Sebelius overruled the FDA&#x27;s recommendation on making the &quot;morning-after pill&quot; (Plan B One-Step) available over the counter for females under the age of 17. President Obama said that the decision was Sebelius&#x27;s, not his.

Judge Edward R. Korman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York struck down this restriction, calling it &quot;frivolous&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;, and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by Sebelius to block easier distribution to young girls. The Obama administration, in response, lowered the age limit from 17 to 15 but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions, in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights.

===Capital punishment===
Sebelius is an opponent of capital punishment. During her first term, the Kansas capital punishment laws were declared unconstitutional by the Kansas Supreme Court. However, on appeal by Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the United States Supreme Court.

===Drug importation===
As governor of Kansas, Sebelius adopted a state drug importation program in 2004 to help her constituents afford prescription medication. The program, called I-saveRx, connected individuals with and helped them buy medication from licensed pharmacies in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The program later went on to include Australia and New Zealand. Due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances, the FDA intercepted some prescription orders en route to Americans who participated in I-SaveRx; while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized.

===Education===
Early in the term, Sebelius made education funding her top priority. Education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of 2005 when the Kansas Supreme Court ordered the Legislature to increase K–12 funding. Sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term, which consisted of property, sales, and income tax increases, resulting in 2006 in the largest K–12 education funding increase in the history of the state. The three-year plan aimed to increase education funding by nearly $1 billion over three years, but did not give a funding source for the second and third years.

===Environment===
Sebelius chaired the Governors&#x27; Ethanol Coalition. In 2006, she requested that $200 million be allotted from the U.S. government to support the Department of Energy Biomass and Biorefinery Systems Research and Development Program. She pushed for more widespread recycling efforts across the state. In addition, she vetoed bills authorizing the construction of coal-fired power plants on three separate occasions saying in March 2008, &quot;We know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. As an agricultural state, Kansas is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, reducing pollutants benefits our state not only in the short term — but also for generations of Kansans to come.&quot; On June 2, 2008, Sebelius spoke at the American Wind Energy Association Conference, calling for greater federal support for wind energy and other renewable energy resources.

===Firearms===
Sebelius has said she supports Kansans&#x27; right to own firearms, but does not believe a broad concealed carry law would make them safer: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events, shopping malls, grocery stores, or the workplace would be good public policy. And to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents&#x27; purses, pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable.&quot;

Sebelius vetoed, like her Republican predecessor Bill Graves, a concealed-carry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an FBI background check. The veto left Kansas, at the time, as one of four states without any form of a conceal-carry law.

On March 21, 2006, she vetoed Senate Bill 418, a similar concealed-carry bill. On March 25, her veto was overturned after the Kansas House of Representatives voted 91–33 to override it. This followed the Kansas Senate&#x27;s 30-10 override vote, which occurred the day after her veto.

On April 21, 2008, Sebelius signed Senate Bill 46 into law, which repealed a 1933 state law prohibiting civilian ownership of machine guns and other firearms restricted by the National Firearms Act of 1934, specifically permitting ownership by civilians successfully meeting the requirements of the NFA. The law was passed in part to address legal issues that could have prevented dealers from delivering firearms to law enforcement agencies in Kansas. The law took effect on July 1, 2008.

===LGBT issues===
Sebelius did not support an April 2005 amendment to the Kansas Constitution that made same-sex marriage in the state unconstitutional. Sebelius said she supported the existing state law outlawing same-sex marriage, viewing it as sufficient, and therefore opposed the constitutional amendment. The amendment passed with 70% voter approval.

==Subsequent career==
After leaving the Obama cabinet, Sebelius founded and became CEO of Sebelius Resources LLC, which provides strategic advice to private companies, non-profit organizations, higher education institutions, and financial investors.

Sebelius serves as a member of the boards of directors of companies including Dermira Inc., Grand Rounds, Inc., Exact Sciences, and Humacyte Inc., and of the Estee Lauder Foundation and the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 1978, she was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. She serves on advisory boards for the Dole Institute of Politics and Solera Health. Sebelius is a senior advisor to Out Leadership and the Aspen Institute, where she co-chairs the Aspen Health Strategy Group. Sebelius is a frequent keynote speaker for national and international organizations.

==Personal life==
She married K. Gary Sebelius, the son of former Republican Congressman Keith Sebelius. The wedding was held in the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 1974. They have two sons: Ned (b. 1982) and John (b. 1985). Her husband served as a United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Kansas for 16 years until his retirement in 2019.

Her family has a vacation home built by her grandfather located in Leland, Michigan. An avid fan of jazz music, Sebelius annually attended the Jazz Fest in New Orleans for thirty years. She also runs in her spare time.

<text>Earl of Lincoln is a title that has been created eight times in the Peerage of England, most recently in 1572. The title was borne by the Dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyne from 1768 to 1988, until the dukedom became extinct.

==Earls of Lincoln, first creation (1141)==
*William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Lincoln and 1st Earl of Arundel ( 1109–1176)

The Earldom was created for the first time probably around 1141 as William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel, is mentioned as Earl of Lincoln in 1143 in two charters for the Abbey of Affligem, representing his wife Adeliza of Louvain, former wife of King Henry I.

==Earls of Lincoln, second creation (after 1143)==
*William de Roumare, Earl of Lincoln (1096–1155) (reverted to Crown)

The Earldom was created for the second time by King Stephen sometime after 1143 for William de Roumare. However, in 1149 or 1150, as William had gone over to the side of Empress Matilda, King Stephen took the earldom from him and elevated Gilbert de Gant as Earl of Lincoln.

==Earls of Lincoln, third creation (about 1149)==
*Gilbert de Gant, Earl of Lincoln (1120–1156) (reverted to crown)

The Earldom was created for the third time by King Stephen in 1149 or 1150 for Gilbert de Gant, but on his death in 1156 it reverted to the Crown.

==Earls of Lincoln, fourth creation (1217)==
The Earldom was created for the fourth time in 1217 during the reign of Henry III (1207-1272) for Ranulph de Blondeville. He had no issue. In April 1231, with the consent of the King, before his death, he passed the Earldom to his sister Hawise of Chester, and she was formally invested by King Henry III in October 1232. Royal consent was needed for this because the Earldom would otherwise have reverted to the crown in the absence of a legitimate male heir. She in turn passed the Earldom, again with the consent of the King, jointly to her daughter Margaret de Quincy (d.1266), who thereby became &quot;suo jure&quot; 2nd Countess of Lincoln, and to the latter&#x27;s husband (Hawise&#x27;s son-in-law) John de Lacy (c. 1192-1240) 8th Baron of Halton, 8th Hereditary Constable of Chester and feudal baron of Pontefract. They were formally invested by Henry III in November 1232. There is doubt as to whether their son Edmund de Lacy (1230-1258) became Earl of Lincoln, as he predeceased his mother, but not his father. &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; gives him as the 3rd Earl, but notes that &quot;he does not appear to have been formally invested with the earldom, presumably because his mother outlived him&quot;. Edmund&#x27;s son Henry de Lacy, 4th Earl of Lincoln, married Margaret Longespée. Their daughter Alice de Lacy, 5th Countess inherited the earldom and married Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. She had no children, and thus, on Alice&#x27;s death in 1348 the earldom became extinct.
* 1217–1231 Ranulf de Blondeville, 1st Earl of Lincoln (1172–1232)
* 1231–1232 Hawise of Chester, &quot;suo jure&quot; 1st Countess of Lincoln (1180–c. 1242) (received as &quot;inter vivos&quot; gift April 1231)
* 1232–1266 Margaret de Quincy, &quot;suo jure&quot; 2nd Countess of Lincoln ( 1206–1266) (received 23 Nov 1232 as &quot;inter vivos&quot; gift from her mother Hawise of Chester)
** 1232–1240 John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln (1192–1240) (held jointly with his wife)
*Edmund de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract (1230-1258), son, never &quot;formally invested with the earldom, presumably because his mother outlived him&quot;.
* 1272–1311 Henry de Lacy, 4th Earl of Lincoln (1251–1311), son, during whose wardship the earldom was administered by his mother Alice of Saluzzo from 1266 to 1272.
* 1311–1348 Alice de Lacy, &quot;suo jure&quot; 5th Countess of Lincoln (1281–1348), on whose death without issue the title became extinct.

The above list does not contain the men who became Earl of Lincoln by right of their wives who were Countess of Lincoln &quot;suo jure&quot;, except for John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln. He is included in the above list because he was created Earl of Lincoln by Royal Charter (together with his wife Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln). The other men who became Earl of Lincoln by right of their wives were:
* Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke, married Margaret de Quincy in January 1242, died November 1245
* Thomas of Lancaster, husband of Alice de Lacy, became Earl of Lincoln on the death of his father-in-law in February 1311, died March 1322
* Sir Eubulus le Strange, married Alice de Lacy before November 1324, died September 1335
* Hugh de Freyne, married Alice de Lacy before March 1336, died January 1337

As Earl of Lincoln, these husbands had immense power, with the right to control the estates of their wives.

The above list also does not include Margaret Longespée, who was Countess of Salisbury in her own right, but Countess of Lincoln only by right of her husband Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln.

==Earls of Lincoln, fifth creation (1349)==
* Henry of Grosmont (–1361), Earl of Lincoln (1349–1361)
The Earldom was created for the fifth time in the following year, 1349, when it was revived for Alice&#x27;s nephew-in-law Henry of Grosmont, who was later created Duke of Lancaster. It became extinct on his death in 1361.

==Earls of Lincoln, sixth creation (1467)==
*John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln (1462–1487)

The Earldom was created for the sixth time in 1467 for John de la Pole. He was the eldest son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, and Elizabeth of York. He predeceased his father, and the title became extinct on his death in 1487.

==Earls of Lincoln, seventh creation (1525)==
*Henry Brandon, Earl of Lincoln (1523–1534)

The Earldom was created for the seventh time in 1525 for Henry Brandon. He was the second son of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, by his wife Mary Tudor. He died at the age of eleven in 1534 when the title became extinct.

==Earls of Lincoln, eighth creation (1572)==
This creation of the Earldom was made for the eighth time in 1572 for the naval commander Edward Clinton, 9th Baron Clinton (see Baron Clinton for earlier history of the family). He served as Lord High Admiral under Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Launceston and Lancashire in the House of Commons. His son, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby and Lincolnshire. In 1610, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Clinton.

His great-grandson, the fifth Earl, died without surviving issue in 1692 thus the earldom and barony separated. The barony fell into abeyance between his aunts (see Baron Clinton for further history of this title). He was succeeded in the earldom by his second cousin once removed, the sixth Earl. He was the grandson of Sir Edward Clinton, the second son of the second Earl. His son, the seventh Earl, served as Paymaster of the Forces, as Constable of the Tower and as Cofferer of the Household. Lord Lincoln married Lucy Sydney (died 1736), daughter of Robert Sydney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (see the Earl of Chichester for earlier history of the Pelham family).

His eldest son, the eighth Earl, died as a child and was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. He was Cofferer of the Household and Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and Cambridgeshire. He married his first cousin Catherine Pelham (died 1760), daughter and heiress of Henry Pelham. In 1756, his uncle the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne was created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, with remainder to his nephew Lord Lincoln, and on the Duke&#x27;s death in 1768 Lincoln succeeded as second Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne according to the special remainder. He assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Pelham the same year.

The Duke&#x27;s two elder sons, George Pelham-Clinton, Lord Clinton, and Henry Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, both predeceased him. He was therefore succeeded by his third son, the third Duke, who was a Major-General in the Army. On his early death, the titles passed to his son, the fourth Duke. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire from 1809 to 1839. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Duke, a prominent politician who held office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Secretary of State for War. His eldest son, the sixth Duke, briefly represented Newark in the House of Commons; he married Henrietta Adele, the wealthy heiress and daughter of Henry Thomas Hope.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Duke, who died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother. In 1881, the eighth Duke assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Hope on inheriting the substantial Hope estates through his paternal grandmother. On his death, the titles passed to his only son, the ninth Duke. He had two daughters but no sons, and was succeeded by his third cousin, the tenth Duke. He was the great-grandson of Lord Charles Pelham-Clinton, second son of the fourth Duke. He died unmarried in December 1988, having held the titles for only a month. On his death the dukedom became extinct, while he was succeeded in the earldom by his distant relative, the eighteenth Earl, a descendant in the tenth generation of the Hon. Sir Henry Fynes-Clinton, third son of the second Earl. Lord Lincoln lived all his life in Australia, and reportedly learned of his succession from a British newspaper. He wrote a book: &quot;Memoirs of an Embryo Earl&quot;. the title is held by his grandson, the nineteenth Earl, whose father had died in 1999. He is a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and still lives in Australia.

Several other members of the Clinton family have also gained distinction. Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton, son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for Callington. The Honourable George Clinton, youngest son of the sixth Earl, was a naval Commander, politician and Colonial administrator. His son General Sir Henry Clinton was Commander-in-Chief of the British in North America from 1778 to 1782. His sons General Sir William Henry Clinton and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton were also successful military commanders. Lord Edward Pelham-Clinton GCVO, second son of the fifth Duke, was a soldier and courtier.
The seat of the Dukes of Newcastle was Clumber House near Worksop, Nottinghamshire. However, the house was demolished in 1938. The surrounding estate was sold to the National Trust in 1946 and is now a country park featuring a walled kitchen garden, open to the public.

<doc id="434029" wikidata="Q3403762" url="?curid=434029" title="Dip (Catalan myth)">
<text>In Catalan myth, Dip () is an evil, black hellhound and emissary of the Devil, who sucks people&#x27;s blood. Like other figures associated with demons in Catalan myth, he is lame in one leg. Dip is pictured on the escutcheon of Pratdip.

The legend is very old. Images of these vampire dogs already appear on the altarpiece of Santa Marina de Pratdip, from 1602. They also appear in another altarpiece from 1730, cut out on a gold background. Legend has it that these dogs sucked the blood of cattle, but only went out at night, and among their victims were drunken night owls who went to drink wine in the village taverns.

It was said that evil eyes could be seen in the shadows of the night. It is believed that this legend was intended to frighten the drunkards of the village and thus prevent them from engaging in more drinking.

According to tradition, the name of the village comes from these dogs, which are said to have disappeared in the nineteenth century. At the entrance to Pratdip there is a monument to this mythological being, but as it is depicted it has a very kind image.

Due to his thirst for blood, the dip served to inspire Joan Perucho who, in his novel &quot;The Natural Stories&quot; (1960), tells the story of Onofre de Dip, a vampire with the ability to transform himself into many animals. The central part of the play takes place in Pratdip at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in the middle of the Carlist war, and the dip was actually an ambassador of King James who 700 years earlier had gone to the Carpathians on a diplomatic mission and had been attacked there by a noble vampire.

<doc id="434031" wikidata="Q3143375" url="?curid=434031" title="Huntz Hall">
<text>Henry Richard &quot;Huntz&quot; Hall (August 15, 1920 – January 30, 1999) was an American radio, stage, and movie performer who appeared in the popular &quot;Dead End Kids&quot; movies, including &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), and in the later &quot;Bowery Boys&quot; movies, during the late 1930s to the late 1950s.

==Life and career==
Hall was born in 1920 in New York City to Joseph Patrick Hall, an engineer from Ireland, and his wife, Mary Ellen ( Mullen) Hall. The fourteenth of sixteen children, he was nicknamed &quot;Huntz&quot; because of his nose. He attended Catholic schools and started performing on radio at five years of age.

He appeared on Broadway in the 1935 production of &quot;Dead End&quot;, a play written and directed by Sidney Kingsley. Hall was then cast along with the other Dead End Kids in the 1937 film &quot;Dead End&quot;, directed by William Wyler and starring Humphrey Bogart.

Hall served in the United States Army during World War II. In 1943, he appeared in the USN training film &quot;Don&#x27;t Kill Your Friends&quot; as moronic Ensign Dilbert the Pilot, who carelessly causes the death of a civilian and three servicemen.
In 1948, Hall was arrested for possession of marijuana. His trial, held in 1949, resulted in a hung jury.

Hall later played the increasingly buffoonish Horace DeBussy &quot;Sach&quot; Jones in 48 of &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot; films, gaining top billing when his longtime partner, Leo Gorcey, left the series in 1956. Hall and Gorcey reunited in &quot;Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Phynx&quot; (1969).

He was one of the celebrities featured on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In 1971, he co-starred with Art Metrano and Jamie Farr in the CBS situation comedy &quot;The Chicago Teddy Bears&quot;. His plans to produce a movie series, &quot;The Ghetto Boys&quot; (a take on the &quot;Bowery Boys&quot;), fell through. In 1973, Hall took part in Princess Grace of Monaco&#x27;s Council for Drug Abuse, part of the Catholic Office of Drug Education.

In 1976, he appeared in &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood,&quot; and in 1977 he played Jesse Lasky in Ken Russell&#x27;s film &quot;Valentino.&quot; His later films included &quot;Gas Pump Girls&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Escape Artist&quot; (1982), the latter reuniting him with Gabriel Dell. His final film appearance was in &quot;Auntie Lee&#x27;s Meat Pies&quot; in 1993.
&quot;Behind Sach: The Huntz Hall Story&quot; by Jim Manago, published by BearManor Media in 2015, is the first biography of Hall.

==Death==
Hall died from cardiac disease on January 30, 1999, at the age of 78 in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="434032" wikidata="Q888007" url="?curid=434032" title="Bob Ehrlich">
<text>Robert Leroy Ehrlich Jr. (born November 25, 1957) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 60th governor of Maryland from 2003 to 2007. A Republican, Ehrlich represented Maryland&#x27;s 10th legislative district in the House of Delegates from 1987 to 1995 and Maryland&#x27;s 2nd Congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.

Ehrlich was the first Republican to serve as governor of Maryland since Spiro Agnew left office in 1969. He served one term before being defeated in his 2006 re-election bid by Democrat Martin O&#x27;Malley. In 2010, Ehrlich sought an unsuccessful rematch against O&#x27;Malley. Ehrlich then announced, via his website, that he would &quot;return to private life.&quot; In October 2011, he was named chair of Mitt Romney&#x27;s Maryland campaign for the 2012 Republican nomination for President.

==Early life, career, and family==
Ehrlich was born in the Southwest Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, Maryland, the son of Nancy (Bottorf), a legal secretary, and Robert Leroy Ehrlich, a commission car salesman. After attending Gilman School, he studied at Princeton University, where he attended on a partial scholarship and was captain of the football team and a member of the Cap and Gown Club. Ehrlich graduated from Princeton with an A.B. in politics in 1979 after completing a 140-page long senior thesis titled &quot;Alexander Solzenitsyn: The Man and His Politics.&quot; He continued on to law school, graduating from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1982.

After law school, Ehrlich worked for Ober, Kaler, Grimes &amp; Shriver, a Baltimore law firm, and became active in politics. In November 1986, Ehrlich won a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing parts of Baltimore County from 1987 to 1995.

===Personal===
He married Kendel Sibiski in 1993. They have two sons, Drew Robert Ehrlich and Joshua Taylor Ehrlich.

As of 2013, he was a frequent guest on the &quot;Sports Junkies.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives (1995–2003)==

In 1993, 2nd district Representative Helen Delich Bentley announced she would be vacating her seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ehrlich announced his candidacy for the open seat and won the election in November 1994. During his term, he introduced legislation aimed at helping disabled people maintain employment and supported harsher gun violence penalties.

While in Congress, Ehrlich served on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was also a member of the subcommittees on health, telecommunications and the Internet, and environment and hazardous materials; the Congressional Biotechnology Caucus, where he served as co-chairman; and the Congressional Steel Caucus. In 1999, He voted to remove president Bill Clinton from office during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial.

Ehrlich won all his elections in Congress by margins of at least 25%. He announced he would be forgoing reelection in 2002 to run for governor. He was succeeded by Dutch Ruppersberger.

==2002 Maryland gubernatorial campaign==
In 2002, Democratic Governor Parris Glendening&#x27;s second term was ending. While Glendening had been reelected by a substantial margin in 1998, the final years of his term were plagued by a personal marital crisis, and a large state budget deficit. The rural areas of Marylandlargely Republicanhad long criticized Glendening for what they perceived as zealous environmental regulations; in addition, they believed that he did not give sufficient attention to their needs for infrastructure improvements (bridges, highways, etc.).

On March 15, 2002, Ehrlich announced his candidacy for the governorship. He attacked Glendening&#x27;s record, tying his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, to him. Ehrlich promised, if elected, to increase school funding, balance the budget, and protect the Chesapeake Bay. His running mate was Michael Steele, an African-American and the chair of the Maryland Republican Party.

During the election, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate; she picked retired Admiral Charles R. Larson, a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. The Townsend campaign was also hurt by the unpopularity of Glendening, who had implemented a redistricting proposal that was overturned by Maryland&#x27;s highest court. Townsend&#x27;s popularity continued to fall when it was reported that much of her campaign money was given by out-of-state donors; Ehrlich remained on the attack while the lieutenant governor&#x27;s poll numbers declined.

Though Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican governor in almost 40 years, Ehrlich won the race (52% of the vote to Townsend&#x27;s 48%). He was the sixth Republican governor in state history and the first since Spiro Agnew left office to take the Vice Presidency in 1969.

==Governor of Maryland (2003–2007)==

Ehrlich said &quot;fiscal responsibility, education, health, and the environment, public safety, and commerce&quot; were the &quot;Five Pillars&quot; of his administration. He opposed sales and income tax increases and supported legalization of slot machines to raise revenue.

Under Ehrlich&#x27;s tenure, Maryland stayed 0.5% or more below the national unemployment average. The unemployment rate dropped significantly from 4.5% in 2003 to 3.9% in 2006, with an increase of 98,000 private sector jobs, aided by its proximity to the strong labor market associated with the national capital.

Ehrlich established a Department of Disabilities within his cabinet for people with disabilities – the first such cabinet-level agency in the nation.

In 2004, Ehrlich signed the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act: it funds upgrades of water treatment plants to reduce pollution discharge by a surcharge on business and residential water and septic bills. The resulting reduction in pollution into the bay was expected to meet approximately one-third of Maryland&#x27;s obligations under the 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation described the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act as the most significant piece of legislation for the Bay in a generation.

Ehrlich opposed President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2006 approval for a United Arab Emirates firm to take control of six U.S. port operations, including those at the Port of Baltimore. (See Dubai Ports World controversy).

In 2006, Ehrlich signed a law banning police traffic ticket quotas.

===Veto of the &quot;Wal-Mart&quot; Health Care Bill===
In January 2006, Ehrlich vetoed the &quot;Fair Share Health Care Bill,&quot; also known as the Walmart Bill, which required businesses with more than 10,000 employees in the state (three of the four companies being Walmart, Northrop Grumman, and Giant) to either spend eight percent of payroll on employee health care, or pay that amount to a state health program for the uninsured. The bill was commonly nicknamed after Walmart because it was the only company in Maryland of that size that did not already spend the requisite eight percent. Ehrlich, after consulting with counsel regarding the legal validity of the bill, vetoed the proposed legislation as it would run afoul of federal law. Despite this, and over the pleas of state representatives whose constituents benefited from Walmart&#x27;s employment and feared a diminished presence in the state, the Democratic legislators of the Maryland Legislature passed the bill over Ehrlich&#x27;s veto, in part leading to cancellation of the building of a Walmart distribution center in one of Maryland&#x27;s poorest counties.

Critics of the international discount chain claimed that Wal-Mart&#x27;s low wages force employees and their dependents to rely on state healthcare assistance. (See Wal-Mart Employee and Labor Relations). The bill&#x27;s supporters claimed that the veto showed Ehrlich, whose official biography describes him as &quot;unapologetically pro-business,&quot; had sided with &quot;big corporate interests rather than Maryland&#x27;s working families.&quot; For his part, Ehrlich called the bill the &quot;first step toward government-run health care&quot; by &quot;anti-jobs lawmakers.&quot; He claimed that it would hurt low and middle-income consumers and was unfair to Wal-Mart and other businesses. On July 7, 2006, the Maryland law was overturned in federal court by U.S. District Judge Frederick Motz, who ruled that the law violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, while also noting that it would &quot;hurt Wal-Mart by imposing the administrative burden of tracking benefits in Maryland differently than in other states.&quot;

===2006 gubernatorial election===

Governor Ehrlich opted to seek a second term and did not face opposition in the Republican primary. On November 7, 2006, Ehrlich was defeated for re-election in the 2006 gubernatorial election by Baltimore Mayor Martin O&#x27;Malley, who won 53% to Ehrlich&#x27;s 46%. Ehrlich&#x27;s term as governor expired at noon on January 17, 2007.

===Between elections===
A month after he left public office, Ehrlich and several aides from his administration opened a Baltimore-area office of North Carolina law firm Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice. His wife Kendel took a consulting job as a director of the BankAnnapolis.

In March 2007, Ehrlich endorsed former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the US presidency. He was the Chairman of Giuliani&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Campaign Committee.

Ehrlich and his wife hosted their own radio show on WBAL-AM Radio every Saturday from 2007 to 2010. Governor Ehrlich has guest lectured at Towson University in Professor Richard Vatz&#x27;s political persuasion class twice a year since 1993.

==2010 gubernatorial campaign==

On March 30, Ehrlich announced that he would challenge incumbent Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley.

In June 2010, Ehrlich was endorsed by Terrapin basketball standout and Memphis Grizzlies NBA draft pick Greivis Vásquez. On June 30, 2010, Ehrlich announced that his running mate would be Mary Kane, who had served under Governor Ehrlich as secretary of state, August 2, 2005, to January 17, 2007, and also as deputy secretary of state and chief legal counsel, March 2003 to August 2, 2005. He easily won the Republican primary.

His former lieutenant governor, then Chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele, traveled to Maryland on his &quot;Fire Pelosi&quot; bus tour to endorse Ehrlich. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also appeared at a fundraiser to endorse Ehrlich. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani campaigned in Maryland with Ehrlich, calling him &quot;one of the best governors of all-time.&quot;

In the general election, Ehrlich lost again to O&#x27;Malley 56% to 42%.

In December 2011, Ehrlich&#x27;s 2010 campaign manager, Paul E. Schurick, was convicted of four counts of fraud and conspiracy concerning a scheme to suppress the black vote using 112,000 fraudulent robocalls, which discouraged voters from going to the polls. Political consultant Julius Hensen was also convicted on one count.

==Support for presidential candidates==
In October 2011, Ehrlich was named chairman of Mitt Romney&#x27;s Maryland campaign for election as president in 2012.

After initially supporting John Kasich as a Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential primaries, Ehrlich endorsed nominee Donald Trump in May 2016.

==After politics==

As of December 2020, Ehrlich was working as senior counsel in the Washington office of King &amp; Spalding, a major corporate law firm, on the governmental advocacy and public policy (lobbying) team.

In August 2022, the Maryland Republican Party announced that Ehrlich would lead its &quot;2022 Victory Campaign&quot; to support the party&#x27;s nominees in that year&#x27;s elections, including Dan Cox and Michael Peroutka. He spent most of his tenure fundraising for the Maryland Republican Party as a whole. Cox and Peroutka were defeated in a landslide by Democratic nominees Wes Moore and Anthony Brown in the general election on November 8, 2022.

<doc id="434034" wikidata="Q202649" url="?curid=434034" title="Party of the European Left">
<text>The Party of the European Left (PEL), or European Left (EL), is a European political party that operates as an association of democratic socialist and communist political parties in the European Union and other European countries. It was formed in January 2004 for the purposes of running in the 2004 European Parliament elections. The PEL was founded on 8–9 May 2004 in Rome. The elected MEPs from member parties of the PEL sit in The Left in the European Parliament – GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament, though not all PEL members are also members of GUE/NGL.

Several member and observer parties participate also in the more radical European Anti-Capitalist Left. Before the PEL was founded, most of its members already held annual meetings together, as part of the New European Left Forum (NELF). The current president is the Austrian politician Walter Baier.

== History ==
The Party of European Left (PEL) was formed on 8 and 9 May 2004 in Rome, Italy. The party&#x27;s first congress took place on 8 October 2005 in Athens, and produced the &quot;Athens Declaration of the European Left&quot;. The second congress was held 23–25 November 2007 in Prague. The third congress was held on 2–5 December 2010 in Paris. Its fourth congress was held on 13–15 December 2013 in Madrid. Its fifth congress took place on 16–18 December 2016 in Berlin, and elected German lawyer and politician Gregor Gysi as the new PEL President. Heinz Bierbaum was elected president in 2019. He was succeeded by Walter Baier in December 2022.

It operates a think tank, Transform Europe, and it has women&#x27;s wing named EL-Fem.

In 2024, the Danish member Red-Green Alliance (Enhedlisten) announced the schism of the party and the formation of a socially liberal (green- and pro-Ukraine leaning) European Left Alliance for the People and the Planet, in short ELA. The split follows the split of socially liberal Die Linke and socially conservative BSW in Germany, and the creation of a separate platform for the 2024 European elections, Now the People. 

== Ideology ==
PEL has been described as a left-wing and a far-left political party. Its ideology is based on principles of democratic socialism, socialism, and communism. It is opposed to capitalism and consists of parties with wide range of opinions. PEL is also supportive of progressivism.

It takes a soft Eurosceptic approach towards the European Union, and opposes militarization and foreign interventionism. PEL opposed the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, and criticised the oppression of 2009 Iranian presidential election protests. It is also opposed to NATO and United States military bases. It supports Cuba, and a delegation visited the nation in February 2022.

<text>The National People&#x27;s Army (, ; NVA ) were the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1956 to 1990.

The NVA was organized into four branches: the (Ground Forces), the (Navy), the (Air Force) and the (Border Troops). The NVA belonged to the Ministry of National Defence and commanded by the National Defense Council of East Germany, headquartered in Strausberg east of East Berlin. From 1962, conscription was mandatory for all GDR males aged between 18 and 60 requiring an 18-month service, and it was the only Warsaw Pact military to offer non-combat roles to conscientious objectors, known as &quot;construction soldiers&quot; (). The NVA reached 175,300 personnel at its peak in 1987.

The NVA was formed on 1 March 1956 to succeed the (Barracked People&#x27;s Police) and under the influence of the Soviet Army became one of the Warsaw Pact militaries opposing NATO during the Cold War. The majority of NATO officers rated the NVA the best military in the Warsaw Pact based on discipline, thoroughness of training, and the quality of officer leadership. The NVA did not see significant combat but participated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, deployed military advisors to communist governments in other countries, and manned the Berlin Wall where they were responsible for numerous deaths.

The NVA was dissolved on 2 October 1990 with the GDR before German reunification, and its facilities and equipment were handed over to the (the armed forces of West Germany), which also absorbed most of its personnel below the rank of non-commissioned officer.

== History ==

===Founding===
The German Democratic Republic (GDR) established the National People&#x27;s Army on 1 March 1956 (six months after the formation of the West German ) from the . This formation culminated years of preparation during which former officers and communist veterans of the Spanish Civil War helped organize and train paramilitary units of the People&#x27;s Police. Though the NVA featured a German appearance – including uniforms and ceremonies patterned after older German military traditions – its doctrine and structure showed the strong influence of the Soviet Armed Forces.

===&quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Veterans===
During its first year, about 27 percent of the NVA&#x27;s officer corps had formerly served in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Of the 82 highest command positions, ex- officers held 61; however, very few of them had served in high ranks. The military knowledge and combat experience of these veterans were indispensable in the NVA&#x27;s early years, although by the 1960s most of these World War II veterans had retired. (The West German was even more reliant on veterans, who initially comprised the majority of its commissioned ranks.)

====Notable former officers in the NVA command====
The following list includes the NVA generals who were awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross in the during the Second World War.

* Wilhelm Adam (17 December 1942 as )
* Otto Korfes (22 January 1943 as )
* Vincenz Müller (7 April 1944 as )

The following list includes the NVA generals who were awarded the German Cross in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the Second World War.

* Rudolf Bamler (12 March 1942 as )
* Bernhard Bechler (28 January 1943 as )
* Otto Korfes (11 January 1942 as )
* Arno von Lenski (21 January 1943 as )
* Vincenz Müller (26 January 1942 as i.G.)
* (25 January 1943 as )

===Deployment===
The NVA never took part in full-scale combat, although it participated in a support role in the suppression of the Prague Spring of 1968, provided medical support during the Soviet–Afghan War, and NVA officers often served as combat advisers in Africa. Some of the first NVA advisors went to the Republic of the Congo in 1973. During the 1980s at various times the NVA had advisors in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Libya, Mozambique, South Yemen, and Syria. In 1984, there were 10,000 NVA personnel serving on the African continent, primarily in Angola and Mozambique. However, the NVA general staff limited their role to advisory and technical functions, resisting Soviet pressure to commit regular combat formations to African conflicts.

When the Soviet Union prepared to occupy Czechoslovakia in 1968, the GDR government committed the 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division and the 11th Motorised Infantry Division to support the intervention (assigned to 20th Guards Army and 1st Guards Tank Army respectively), becoming the first deployment of German troops outside Germany for the first time since the Second World War. But the East German participation raised Czech ire, and the two divisions were &quot;kept out of sight in the Bohemian forests&quot; and allowed to travel only at night. In a few days they were withdrawn.

In the early 1970s the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) high command assigned to the NVA the wartime mission of capturing West Berlin. The NVA plan for the operation, designated &quot;Operation Centre&quot;, called for some 32,000 troops in two divisions, accompanied by the GSFG&#x27;s Soviet 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. The plan was regularly updated until 1988, when a less ambitious plan that simply aimed at containing Berlin was substituted.

In the autumn of 1981 the NVA stood ready to intervene in Poland in support of a possible Soviet invasion, but the declaration of martial law in Poland (13 December 1981) averted the crisis.

The NVA went into a state of heightened combat readiness on several occasions, including the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, and, for the last time, in late 1989 as protests swept through the GDR.

During the Peaceful Revolution that led to the downfall of the GDR&#x27;s communist government, some NVA forces were placed on alert but were never deployed against protesters. At the same time, the Soviet government ordered its troops in the GDR to remain in barracks. After the forced retirement of SED and state leader Erich Honecker and other conservatives from the ruling Politburo at the height of the crisis in October 1989, the new SED leadership ruled out using armed force against the protesters.

=== Ideology ===
Like the ruling communist parties of other Soviet satellites, the East German Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) assured control by appointing loyal party members to top positions and by organizing intensive political education for all ranks. The proportion of SED members in the officer corps rose steadily after the early 1960s, eventually reaching almost 95 percent.

The NVA saw itself as the &quot;instrument of power of the working class&quot; (). According to its doctrine, the NVA protected peace and secured the achievements of socialism by maintaining a convincing deterrent to imperialist aggression. The NVA&#x27;s motto, inscribed on its flag, read: &quot;For the Protection of the Workers&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; Power&quot;.

The GDR&#x27;s National Defense Council controlled the armed forces, but the mobile forces came under the Warsaw Pact Unified Command. Political control of the armed forces took place through close integration with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which vetted all officers. Military training (provided by the school system) and the growing militarization of East German society bolstered popular support for the military establishment. From a Leninist perspective, the NVA stood as a symbol of Soviet-East German solidarity and became the model communist institution – ideological, hierarchical, and disciplined. The NVA synthesized communist and Prussian symbolism, naming its officers&#x27; academy, the Friedrich Engels Military Academy, after Karl Marx&#x27;s co-author Friedrich Engels, and its highest medal after Prussian Army General Gerhard von Scharnhorst.

=== Composition ===
In its first six years the NVA operated as an all-volunteer force. (West Germany, in contrast, re-introduced universal military service in 1956.) The GDR introduced conscription in 1962. According to the Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security:

The manpower of the NVA consisted of some 85,000 soldiers in 1962, climbed to 127,000 by 1967, and remained essentially steady through 1970. In 1987, at the peak of its power, the NVA numbered 175,300 troops. Approximately 50% of this number were career soldiers, while the others were short-term conscripts.

According to a 1973 study, NVA leaders from the late 1950s through the 1960s came predominantly from working-class backgrounds, with few from middle-class or professional families and no representatives of the aristocracy present in the upper echelons. Excepting specialized military or political instruction, most NVA leaders reported primary school as their highest level of formal education.

=== Post-unification ===

The NVA disbanded with the dissolution of the East German government in October 1990. Under the process of &quot;Army of Unity&quot; (), NVA facilities and equipment were handed over to the , the federal defense force of the unified Germany. Eastern Command () was set up for the control of units or facilities in the territory of former East Germany, and was led by Lieutenant General Jörg Schönbohm. Most facilities closed, and equipment was either sold or given to other countries. Most of the NVA&#x27;s 36,000 officers and NCOs were let go, including all officers above the rank of . The retained only 3,200 – after a demotion of one rank. In addition, all female soldiers (at this point it was still prohibited for women to become soldiers in the ) and all soldiers over the age of 55 were discharged.

Until 1 March 2005, Germany listed time served in the NVA as time &quot;served in a foreign military&quot;. Service in the NVA did not count for points towards federal pensions in the unified Germany. Retired NVA soldiers and officers received only minimal pensions after unification: a thirty-year veteran would receive a pension smaller than a graduate-student stipend. After the reform of 2005, service in the NVA became known as &quot;served outside of the &quot;.

Many former NVA officers feel bitter about their treatment after unification. While receiving only minimal pensions, few have been able to find jobs except as laborers or security guards. Former NVA officers are not permitted to append their NVA rank to their name as a professional title; no such prohibition applies to rank attained in the or in the during the Nazi era.

One of the few former NVA facilities to remain open was a base in Storkow near Berlin, which housed the NVA&#x27;s camouflage and deception center. This became the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; Unit for Camouflage and Deception.

== Utilization of former NVA material after 1990 ==
The NVA was, in relation to its equipment and training, one of the strongest armies in the Warsaw Pact. It was equipped with a large number of modern weapons systems, most of Soviet origin, from which a small portion were returned to the Soviet Union in 1990.

The remaining equipment and materiel was still substantial, including large quantities of replacement parts, medical supplies, atomic, biological and chemical warfare equipment, training devices and simulators, etc.

One of the first measures taken after the reunification was a survey and securing of weapons and devices by former members of the NVA. The federally operated &quot;Materiel Depot Service Gesellschaft&quot; (MDSG) was charged with taking custody of and warehousing this equipment. The MDSG employed 1,820 people who were primarily taken from the . The MDSG was privatised in 1994. Much of the materiel was given free of charge to beneficiaries in the new federal states or other departments, to museums, or to friendly nations in the context of military support for developing countries. The German Federal Intelligence Service secretly sold NVA equipment to several countries, violating international and German laws as well as international treaties. The rest was destroyed.

* 767 aircraft (helicopters, fixed wing aircraft), 24 of which were MiG-29s
* 208 ships
* 2,761 tanks
* 133,900 wheeled vehicles
* 2,199 artillery pieces
* 1,376,650 firearms
* 303,690 tons of ammunition
* 14,335 tons of fuel and cleaning materials

24 modern MIG-29s became part of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. After 1999, 22 of the 24 aircraft were given to Poland.

== Recruitment and conscientious objection ==

Before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, military service in the GDR was voluntary, though the Free German Youth and public schools mounted intensive recruitment drives, and service in the NVA was often a prerequisite for career advancement. Compulsory military service had been introduced in 1956 in West Germany, one year after the West German military was established, but the GDR held back from this step until 1962. The situation changed when the border was sealed in August 1961, and five months later the government announced a mandatory service term of 18 months for men.

There was, at first, no alternative service for conscientious objectors. This changed in 1964 when, under pressure from the Protestant Church in Germany, the GDR&#x27;s National Defence Council authorised the formation of (construction units) for men of draft age who &quot;refuse military service with weapons on the grounds of religious viewpoints or for similar reasons&quot;.

The construction soldiers wore uniforms and lived in barracks under military discipline, but were not required to bear arms and received no combat training. In theory, they were to be used only for civilian construction projects. The GDR therefore became the only Warsaw Pact country to provide a non-combat alternative for conscientious objectors. However, fearing that other soldiers would be contaminated by pacifist ideas, the government took care to segregate the construction units from regular conscripts. Moreover, conscripts who chose the alternative service option often faced discrimination later in life, including denial of opportunities for higher education.

== Organization ==
The NVA had four main branches:
* The (Ground Forces) with an active strength of 108,000 in the following divisions:

* The (People&#x27;s Navy) with a strength of 18,300
* The (Air Forces/Air Defence) with a strength of 58,000

In wartime, mobilization of the NVA&#x27;s reserves would have nearly doubled its strength. GDR authorities also had at their disposal the internal security troops of the Ministry of the Interior (the ) and the Ministry for State Security (the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment) along with the 210,000 strong party auxiliary &quot;Combat Groups of the Working Class&quot; (), who were available in times of war.

The highest level of leadership for the NVA was the Ministry for National Defense () headquartered in Strausberg near East Berlin. NVA administration was divided into the following commands:
* the based in Geltow near Potsdam
* the based in Strausberg
* the based in Rostock
* the based in Pätz near Berlin

== Military Intelligence ==
The National People&#x27;s Army had a Military Intelligence Agency whose purpose was to “prevent surprise by the enemy.”

=== Directors ===
* 1952–1957 Major General Karl Linke
* 1957–1959 Colonel Willy Sägebrecht
* 1959–1974 Lieutenant General Arthur Franke
* 1974–1982 Lieutenant General 
* 1982–1990 Lieutenant General 
* 1990-&quot;disbanded&quot; Colonel Manfred Zeise

== Appearance ==
=== Uniforms ===
The first military units of the Central Training Administration () were dressed in police blue. With the restructuring of the Barracked Police (CIP) in 1952, khaki uniforms similar in shape and colour to those of the Soviet Army were introduced. The desire for a separate &quot;German&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot; military tradition, and the consequent founding of the NVA in 1956, introduced new uniforms which strongly resembled those of the . They were of a similar cut and made of a brownish-gray, called stone gray, cloth. The dark high-necked collar was later removed, except on the coats from 1974 to 1979.

Even the NVA&#x27;s M-56 &quot;gumdrop&quot; army helmet, in spite of its easily noticeable resemblance to well-known Soviet designs, was actually based on a prototype &quot;B / II&quot; helmet that was initially developed for the by the Institute for Defence Technical Materials Science in Berlin. The helmet had seen trials since 1943, but was not adopted by the .

With the exceptions of the People&#x27;s Navy, whose dark-blue uniforms were consistent with the styles of most navies around the world, and the Combat Groups of the Working Class (), who wore their own olive-green fatigue uniforms, all NVA armed services, the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, and the wore the same basic uniform. Several later modifications were introduced, but the style and cut remain fundamentally the same. There were a variety of uniforms worn according to the setting (work or social) and season (summer or winter). Most uniforms (service, semi-dress, and parade) were stone grey, a brownish-grey colour that was conspicuously different from the grey-green of the People&#x27;s Police. Officers&#x27; uniforms differed from those of enlisted personnel by better quality and texture cloth. The field and service uniforms were normal attire for most day-to-day functions.

=== Uniform categories ===
Several basic categories of uniforms were worn:
==== Parade uniform () ====

The parade uniform for ground forces officers was the semi-dress/walking-out tunic with all authorized orders, awards and decorations attached, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet, white shirt, dark-gray necktie, and a ceremonial dagger worn on the left side and fastened to a silver-gray parade belt. Officers in guards of honor, as well as officers of cadet schools when on parade, carried sabers. In winter, a greatcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn. Naval officers wore dark blue uniforms with a peaked cap while ratings wore sailor caps.

==== Service uniform () ====
The summer service uniform for officers was a bloused jacket, called a Hemdbluse, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap. The winter service uniform featured a tunic with four large buttoned-down patch pockets, a black waist belt, the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, and pants belt; high boots were reserved for officers and NCOs. A long, heavy, belted greatcoat was also part of the winter uniform.

==== Semi-dress/walking-out uniform () ====
With a few details, the semi-dress uniform was the same for all ranks and was worn for walking-out purposes (i.e. off-duty and off-post). It consisted of a single-breasted tunic without belt, a silver-gray shirt with dark-gray tie, the service cap, long trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. Officers also wore the tunic with a white shirt. During periods of warm weather, there was the option of omitting the tunic, and furthermore omitting the tie. A double-breasted jacket was optional for officers and warrant officers.

==== Field service uniform () ====

The summer field uniform for both officers and enlisted consisted of a jacket and trousers originally in and then in , a dark-brown (later a forest green) raindrop camouflage pattern on a stone-gray background; a field cap, service cap, or steel helmet; high black boots; and a gray webbing belt with y-strap suspenders. In winter, a quilted stone gray padded suit without a camouflage pattern was worn over the service uniform. Later winter uniforms were also of the same camouflage pattern as the summer variant. The winter uniform also included a fur pile cap or a steel helmet, boots, knitted gray gloves, belt, and suspenders.

==== Work uniform () ====
Seasonal considerations and weather governed the kind of work uniforms worn. Generally, reconditioned articles of service uniforms (field, semi-dress, and padded winter uniforms) were dyed black and issued for all types of fatigue and maintenance details. Coveralls are also used by the lower ranks, especially armor and air force personnel. Officers in technical branches supervising fatigue details wore a laboratory-style smock.

==== Other uniforms ====

High-ranking officers occasionally wore white uniforms (or white jackets), and staff officers were issued distinctive staff service uniforms.

Women wore uniforms consisting of jackets, skirts or slacks, blouses, caps, boots or pumps, and other appropriate items according to season and occasion.

Personnel, such as paratroopers, motorcyclists, and tank troops, wore additional items with their uniforms identifying them as such.

NVA personnel initially wore the as worn by the , but later reverted to white except for generals who wore red.

The uniforms of the Border Troops were distinguished from that of the NVA ground force and Air Force/Air Defense Force by a green armband with large silver letters identifying the wearer&#x27;s affiliation.

Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment uniforms were nearly identical to those of the NVA and were distinguished primarily by the dark red MfS service color of its insignia and by an honorary cuff-band on the left sleeve bearing the regiment&#x27;s name. Other Stasi officers wore a similar uniform, but without the cuff-band.

=== Rank insignia ===

NVA personnel displayed their rank insignia on shoulder boards or shoulder loops on service, semi-dress, and parade uniforms, and subdued sleeve insignia midway between the shoulder and elbow on the left sleeve of the field uniform, coveralls, or other special uniforms. A general officer rank was denoted by five-pointed silver stars mounted on a gold and silver braided shoulder cord set on a bright red base. All other officers and NCOs wore a four-pointed star. Like many of the armies of the other Warsaw Pact countries, NVA rank insignia followed the Soviet pattern in the arrangement of stars.

The followed similar shoulder insignia for the naval officers (who also used sleeve insignia) and enlisted ratings except that these were blue and white or yellow (in the case of naval ratings).

=== Awards and decorations ===
The GDR had some seventy decorations for persons or groups it wished to recognize, and it bestowed them liberally. Some, such as battle decorations, were specifically set aside for armed forces personnel, many awarded to soldiers and civilians alike, and others, although ordinarily civilian awards, can on occasion be earned by those on military duty. The latter group included decorations for achievement in the arts, literature, production, and work methods. They were awarded to service personnel or specific units that participated in civil production projects or assisted during harvesting.

The Order of Karl Marx, Patriotic Order of Merit, Star of People&#x27;s Friendship, Banner of Labor, Order of Scharnhorst, and the National Prize were among the more important awards. Some, including the Order of Merit and the Star of People&#x27;s Friendship, were awarded in three classes. A few were accompanied by substantial monetary premiums. The NVA did not permit military personnel to wear awards and decorations.

== Periodicals ==
The two main periodicals of the NVA were the weekly newspaper and the monthly soldier&#x27;s magazine .

== Relics ==
The former Nazi holiday complex at Prora, on the island of Rügen, contains a number of museum displays. One of these is devoted to the NVA, which had used part of the complex as a barracks. Many German military museums host former NVA equipment like tanks and aircraft.

<text>Speed Metal Symphony is the first studio album by the American heavy metal band Cacophony, released in 1987 through Shrapnel Records.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review, Frank Trojan of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine found &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; &quot;much harder and faster&quot; than the works of Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore or Yngwie Malmsteen, &quot;which means that some tracks are speed kills with super solos&quot;. He added that, although &quot;the pure instrumentals are, unfortunately, again the usual mixtures of classic elements and endless revival on well-known riffs and standards, Cacophony could appeal to a bigger circle by their rough, and sometimes also partly speedy way of playing, than just pure guitar freaks.&quot; The album was re-released on CD in 1991.

Andy Hinds at AllMusic called &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; &quot;tough to digest&quot;. He noted its technical complexity and lack of production quality, while suggesting that it is &quot;some of the most indulgent music ever recorded.&quot; Praise was nevertheless given to the skill of guitarists Jason Becker and Marty Friedman, though Hinds suggested that both their subsequent solo releases (&quot;Perpetual Burn&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, respectively) were superior. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff defined the album &quot;an expertly played, mostly instrumental affair&quot; and &quot;a slightly less arch and arcane version of Yngwie&#x27;s debut&quot;, criticising Peter Marrino&#x27;s vocals &quot;buried in the mix&quot; and not &quot;up to standards&quot; of the other musicians.

In 2009, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked the album ninth on its list of the all-time top ten shred albums.

<doc id="434048" wikidata="Q96590840" url="?curid=434048" title="Succession of the Roman Empire">
<text>The continuation, succession, and revival of the Roman Empire is a running theme of the history of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. It reflects the lasting memories of power, prestige, and unity associated with the Roman Empire.

Several polities have claimed immediate continuity with the Roman Empire, using its name or a variation thereof as their own exclusive or non-exclusive self-description. As centuries went by and more political ruptures occurred, the idea of institutional continuity became increasingly debatable. The most enduring and significant claimants of continuation of the Roman Empire have been, in the East, the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire, which both claimed succession of the Byzantine Empire after 1453; and in the West, the Carolingian Empire (9th century) and the Holy Roman Empire from 800 to 1806. 

Many of these claims were monarchist in nature, with the ethnic or national identity of the Ancient Romans never actually becoming established among the common people (poor peasants and urban workers) of these empires (except in the Byzantine Empire), the idea of succession being restricted to niche groups of intellectuals and members of the elites. Thus, when these empires were replaced by successor states that are republics (such as the Republic of Turkey, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation) there was an abandonment of these claims.

In relation to ethnic and national identity, the Italians of Rome continue to identify with the demonym &#x27;Roman&#x27; to this day. The vast majority of the Western Romance peoples (Portuguese, Spaniards, French, their colonial descendants, among others) diverged into groups that no longer identify as Romans. The Romansh people of Switzerland however, identify as Romans, and similar subnational &quot;Roman&quot; identity exists in the case of Romagnol. Roman identity is claimed by several Eastern Romance peoples. Prominently, the Romanians call themselves &quot;români&quot; and their nation &quot;România&quot;. And the modern Greek people still sometimes use &quot;Romioi&quot; to refer to themselves, as well as the term &quot;Romaic&quot; (&quot;Roman&quot;) to refer to their Modern Greek language (but the term &quot;Éllines&quot; and &quot;Hellēnikḗis&quot; are much more popular among the Greeks to refer to themselves and their language) 

Separately from claims of continuation, the view that the Empire had ended has led to various attempts to revive it or appropriate its legacy, notably in the case of Orthodox Russia. The vocabulary of a &quot;Third Rome&quot;, the &quot;First Rome&quot; being Rome in Italy and the &quot;Second Rome&quot; being Constantinople in the Byzantine Empire, has been used to convey such assertions of legitimate succession.

==Historiography and nomenclature==
In Western Europe, the view of the deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476 AD as a historic watershed, marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire and thus the beginning of the Middle Ages, was introduced by Leonardo Bruni in the early 15th century, strengthened by Christoph Cellarius in the late 17th century, and cemented by Edward Gibbon in the late 18th century. In practice, it is little more than a historiographic convention, since the Imperial idea long survived the Western Roman Empire in most of Western Europe, and reached territories that had never been under Roman rule during classical antiquity.

The fall of Constantinople in 1453 is historically and broadly accepted as the end of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire and the end of the Middle Ages. Nonetheless, two notable claims to succession of the Eastern Roman Empire arose in the centuries after the fall of Constantinople: the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire; notably, Mehmed II, the Ottoman sultan who captured Constantinople, justified his assumption of the title of Emperor of the Romans (&quot;Kayser-i Rum&quot;) by right of conquest, which was consistent with Byzantine imperial ideology which believed that control of Constantinople constituted the key legitimizing factor for an emperor and also was supported by contemporary historiographer George of Trebizond. Mehmed II&#x27;s claim was also recognized by Gennadius Scholarius after Mehmed II installed him as ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople in 1454, the year after the fall of Constantinople. Mehmed II&#x27;s claims were not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church or the Christian states of Europe at the time, and though Mehmed II intended to follow through on his claims by launching a conquest of Italy, his death in 1481 signaled the last time the Ottoman state attempted to conquer Italy or Rome itself; rather subsequent Ottoman emperors instead fought rival claimants to the Roman title (the Holy Roman Empire and the Russian Empire). As the Ottoman Empire continued its break with Greco-Roman legitimacy in favour of strengthening its Islamic legitimacy, Ottoman claims to the Roman Empire faded; the last official use of the title &quot;Kayser-i Rum&quot; was in the 18th century.

===Names===

The empire that modern historiography calls the &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot; never used that expression, and kept calling itself the &quot;Roman Empire&quot;, &quot;Empire of the Romans&quot;, or &quot;Romania&quot; until the fall of Constantinople. Following the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire in 800, Christian Western Europeans were reluctant to apply the &quot;Roman&quot; epithet to the Eastern Empire and frequently called it &quot;Empire of the Greeks&quot; or &quot;Greek Empire&quot;, even though they also used &quot;Romania&quot; – the latter also for the Latin Empire of the 13th century. By contrast, Muslims in the Levant and farther east typically referred to the people of the Eastern Empire as &quot;Romans&quot; (&quot;Rum&quot;), and to Western Europeans, including those from the Holy Roman Empire, as &quot;Franks&quot; (&quot;Farang&quot;).

The name Byzantium refers to the ancient city on the Bosporus, now called Istanbul, which Constantine renamed Constantinople in 330. It was not used thereafter, except in rare historical or poetic contexts, until it first took its new meaning in 1557 when the German scholar Hieronymus Wolf published his &quot;Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ&quot;, a collection of historical sources about the Eastern Empire. Then from 1648 onwards, Philippe Labbe and fellow French Jesuits published the 24-volume &quot;De Byzantinæ historiæ scriptoribus&quot;, and in 1680 Du Cange produced his own &quot;Historia Byzantina&quot;. These endeavors further entrenched the use of the &quot;Byzantine&quot; label among French authors, including Montesquieu in the 18th century. Outside France in the Western world, it only came into general use around the mid-19th century, after Barthold Georg Niebuhr and his continuators published the 50-volume &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae&quot;.

Similarly, what historians call the &quot;Carolingian Empire&quot; and &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; – in French and Spanish, &quot;Holy Roman Germanic Empire&quot; (, ) was the &quot;Roman Empire&quot;, &quot;Empire of the Romans&quot; or simply &quot;Empire&quot; to their own subjects and rulers, with &quot;Frankish&quot; or &quot;of the Franks&quot; sometimes added depending on context. Only in 1157 did the twists and turns of the Investiture Controversy lead to the practice of calling the Empire, though not the Emperor himself, &quot;holy&quot; (&quot;sacrum&quot;). The reference to Germany (&quot;Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation&quot;, &quot;Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanicæ&quot;), which first appeared in the late 15th century, was never much used in official Imperial documents, and even then was a misnomer since the Empire&#x27;s jurisdiction in Italy had not entirely disappeared. Other colloquial designations in the early Modern era included &quot;German Empire&quot; () or &quot;Roman-German Empire&quot; ().

In 1773, a few decades before the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s demise, Voltaire made the famous quip that it &quot;was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.&quot;

==Roman imperial legitimacy==

In the early decades of the Roman Empire, legitimacy was largely defined by the institutions inherited from the Roman Republic, initially together with a form of hereditary succession within the Julio-Claudian dynasty. As the old Republican institutions gradually lost relevance, many later Emperors derived their legitimacy from acclamation by the army, and during the Nerva–Antonine dynasty, adoption by their predecessor. The Roman Empire itself was long defined by its eponymous capital, but this equation became blurred after the crisis of the Third Century as the administrative center was moved to Mediolanum (Milan), then further fragmented into various locations (e.g. Nicomedia, Sirmium, Augusta Treverorum, Serdica) before being reconsolidated by Constantine the Great in Byzantium, renamed and dedicated as Constantinople in 330 - while Ravenna replaced Milan as Western political capital in 402. Meanwhile, the Empire was Christianized in the course of the 4th century, which partly redefined the authority of the Emperor as he became the protector of the new state religion.

Thus, the Imperial identity, and therefore the question of which polity could rightfully claim to be the Roman Empire, rested not on a single criterion but on a variety of factors: dominant territorial power and the related attributes of peace and order; rule over Rome and/or Constantinople; protection of justice and of the Christian faith (against paganism, heresy, and later Islam); as well as, albeit only intermittently, considerations of dynastic succession or of ethnic nationalism.

===Conflicting claims===
The multidimensionality of the imperial claim, together with the unique prestige of the imperial title, explains the recurrence of often intractable conflicts about which polities and rulers could rightfully assume them. These conflicts lost their potency in the course of the Early modern period, however, as improved communications and literacy increasingly undermined any claim of universal supremacy.

A letter of Carolingian Emperor Louis II to Byzantine Emperor Basil I, probably drafted in Roman circles close to the Papacy in response to a lost original and surviving in 13th-century copy kept at the Vatican Library, articulates how the debate was framed in its time (ca. 871). The following quotes are from a full translation by scholar Charles West.

Territorial rule over Constantinople is not the exclusive criterion for a rightful Imperial claim: 
While the Empire as an idea is unitary, there is no established doctrine that there should be only one Emperor at any time, especially if the two Emperors are on friendly terms. Whether on purpose or not, Louis&#x27;s description of two Emperors of a single Empire matches the doctrine underlying the Tetrarchy or the division between Eastern and Western Empire between 395 and 476: 
Louis&#x27;s claim is ancient enough to be justified by tradition since it has already held for several generations: 


Louis defends the Carolingian principle of dynastic succession as validated by tradition. Furthermore, Louis thinks that there should be no exclusive ethnic criterion for the Imperial dignity. Here Louis apparently refers to a claim by Basil that the Emperor should be a Roman and not from a non-Roman ethnicity (&quot;gens&quot;): 
Using a modern vocabulary, Louis thought that those populations (gens) he cited (e.g. Spaniards, Isaurian etc.) were not Romans and that only the inhabitants of the city of Rome were Romans, not recognizing that those populations would have been seen as Romans, being citizens of the empire. While for Basil, the population (gens) of the Franks would not make good emperors because they were not citizens of the empire.

===Empire and Christianity===

Since the 4th century and particularly since the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, the defense and promotion of Christianity has been a key driver of Imperial identity. After that date, the territorial scope of the Empire or any of its continuating entities has never exactly coincided with that of Christendom, and the discrepancies led to enduring conflicts of legitimacy. The most consequential of these was the East-West Schism, which crystallized in 1054 as a consequence of longstanding fights over governance and jurisdiction (known as ecclesiastical differences) and over doctrine (theological differences), and can be fairly viewed as a delayed effect of the problem of two emperors arising from the creation of the Carolingian Empire in 800.

Earlier examples include the preference of several barbarian kingdoms during the Migration Period for Arianism after the competing Nicene Creed had regained dominance in Constantinople: the Burgundians until 516, Vandals until 534, Ostrogoths until 553, Suebi until the 560s, Visigoths until 587, and Lombards intermittently until 652. The adoption of Arianism protected these kingdoms&#x27; rulers from the religious disputes and policy initiatives of Constantinople, while being more acceptable to their majority-Catholic subjects than paganism.

On two occasions, the Eastern (Byzantine) Emperors reunited their church with its Western (Roman Catholic) counterpart, on political motivations and without durable effect. At the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, Emperor Michael VIII aimed to appease the Papacy to keep his Frankish adversaries in check, particularly Charles I of Anjou&#x27;s plans to re-invade the Empire; the union was never widely accepted in Constantinople, and was reversed at the Council of Blachernae in 1285 after both Michael and Charles had died. At the Council of Ferrara/Florence in 1438–39, Emperor John VIII negotiated under the threat of Ottoman conquest, but the union agreement was again resisted in Constantinople and only proclaimed by Isidore of Kiev in December 1452, four years after John&#x27;s death and too late to prevent the fall of Constantinople a few months later.

Conversely, the Ottoman Sultans&#x27; policies as self-proclaimed Emperors of the Romans (i.e. in the language of the time, of the Eastern Orthodox Christians) supported the independence of the Orthodox Church from Rome and occasionally favored reforms to keep religiously inspired separatism in check, e.g. the revival of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in 1557. The initial instrument of that policy, Gennadius Scholarius, had been a prominent opponent of the union of the Eastern and Western churches in the 1440s and early 1450s.

The link between Empire and Christianity has a durable legacy: to this day, Rome remains the seat of the Catholic Church, and Constantinople (Istanbul) that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate with a widely recognized status of &quot;primus inter pares&quot; within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2018, the negotiations over autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine led to a schism between Moscow and Constantinople as the Russian Orthodox Church unilaterally severed full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. A similar schism had occurred in 1996 over the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, but unlike in 2018 it was resolved after a few months.

The Imperial connection extends, through the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, to Islam as well. Istanbul was also until 1924 the seat of the only widely recognized Caliphate of the last half-millennium, and keeps most of the surviving Relics of Muhammad as the Sacred Trust in Topkapı Palace, close to the location of the former Roman Imperial palace.

==Continuation in the East==

===Roman/Byzantine Empire until 1204===

There is seamless continuity between the Roman and Byzantine Empires, to the extent that the date at which the former ends and the latter begins is essentially a matter of historiographical convention. The Byzantines consistently and near-exclusively called themselves Romans, before and after they adopted Greek as principal state language in the 7th century. Traditional Western European historiography retains 395 as the date of beginning of the Byzantine Empire, when Theodosius I was succeeded by Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West. Alternative conventions date the transition from Rome to Byzantium at the translation of the imperial capital from Rome to Constantinople in 330, or at the reign of Heraclius marking the end of late antiquity.

Even though the Byzantine Empire went through numerous political upheavals, and faced periods of dramatic contraction in the 7th and late 11th centuries, it exhibited unquestionable institutional continuity until 1204, not least because its central and defining seat of power, Constantinople, was never conquered during this period. Conversely, in the Eastern Mediterranean territories that ceased being part of the Empire during that period, there emerged almost no competing claim of Imperial legitimacy. In their different ways, the Avars and Slavs in Southeastern Europe, and the Sasanians and Muslims in the Levant and Northern Africa, had different models of governance and no appetite for posing as Romans. This may also be linked to their inability to conquer the Imperial capital despite numerous attempts, as is suggested by the counter-example of the Ottoman Sultans claiming the Imperial title after 1453.

====Bulgarian Empire====
In the period before 1204, the only significant competing Imperial claim in the East appeared in 913, when Simeon I the Great, ruler of Bulgaria, was crowned &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans&quot; (&quot;Car i samodǎržec na vsički bǎlgari i gǎrci&quot; in the modern vernacular) by the Patriarch of Constantinople and imperial regent Nicholas Mystikos outside of the Byzantine capital. The decade 914–927 was then spent in a destructive Byzantine–Bulgarian war over the Imperial claim and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch was eventually recognized as &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot; (&quot;basileus tōn Boulgarōn&quot;) by the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lakapenos in 924, following the convention also adopted with the Carolingian Empire that &quot;basileus&quot; (a Greek word that can translate as &quot;king&quot; or &quot;emperor&quot; depending on context) was not an equal title to that of the Emperor as long as it did not explicitly confer authority over the &quot;Romans&quot;. Constantinople&#x27;s recognition of the &quot;basileus&quot; dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the Bulgarian patriarch was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian–Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. The Bulgarian title &quot;tsar&quot; (&quot;Caesar&quot;) was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule.

During the Second Bulgarian Empire, 14th-century literary compositions portrayed the then capital of Tarnovo, now Veliko Tarnovo, as successor of both Rome and Constantinople. Bulgarian contemporaries called the city &quot;Tsarevgrad Tarnov&quot;, the &quot;Imperial city of Tarnovo&quot;, echoing the Bulgarian name then used for Constantinople, Tsarigrad.

===Fourth Crusade and its aftermath===


The Fourth Crusade and sack of Constantinople in 1204 marked a major rupture in the history of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire, and opened a period of fragmentation and competing claims of Imperial legitimacy. The crusading (Latin) invaders divided most of the Empire among themselves by a formal treaty of partition, under which the Latin Empire of Constantinople&#x27;s direct rule did not extend greatly further than the city itself. It included the Straits and their immediate hinterland, e.g. Adrianople and Nicomedia, but neither Salonica nor Nicaea. Other territories of the former Empire were not conquered by the Latin crusaders, and remained held by various holdovers of the former (Greek) Empire.

Several of the polities emerging from that fragmentation claimed to be the rightful successor of the prior Empire, on various motives: the Latin Empire held the Imperial capital; the rulers of the Empire of Trebizond stemmed from the formerly Imperial Komnenos family; those of the Despotate of Epirus (briefly the Empire of Thessalonica) were from the Angelos family, even though they renounced the imperial claim by accepting Nicaean overlordship in 1248; the Empire of Nicaea successfully claimed the patriarchate in 1206, and eventually prevailed through skillful management of alliances and its recapture of Constantinople in 1261.

====Latin Empire of Constantinople====

The Latin Empire had its own line of Imperial succession, initially dominated by the House of Flanders then by the French House of Courtenay. It was embattled almost from the start, as the city was never able to recover from the trauma of 1204. Despite its theoretical suzerainty, the Latin Empire was not even politically dominant among the crusader states, which were referred to as Latin or Frankish by Easterners.

After being expelled from Constantinople in 1261, its titular Emperors occasionally held territorial power in parts of modern Greece. Jacques des Baux was Prince of Achaea in 1381–1383, and the last recorded claimant to the Latin Imperial title.

===Late Byzantine era===

The Palaiologos dynasty prolonged the Roman Imperial experience from its recovery of Constantinople in 1261 until the Ottoman conquest in 1453. The Empire shrunk considerably during that period, and at the end it was only the imperial city itself without any hinterland, plus most of the Peloponnese (then referred to as Morea) typically under the direct rule of one of the Emperor&#x27;s sons with the title of Despot. This line of Imperial succession ceased in 1453; even though the Despotate of the Morea lingered on a few more years, until the Ottomans conquered it in 1460, its rulers at the time did not claim Imperial authority.

====Serbian Empire====
In 1345, the Serbian King Stefan Dušan proclaimed himself Emperor (Tsar) and was crowned as such at Skopje on Easter 1346 by the newly created Serbian Patriarch, as well as by the Patriarch of All Bulgaria and the Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by, among others, the Bulgarian Empire, much diminished following the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330, albeit not by the Byzantine Empire. In Serbia, the title of &quot;Emperor of Serbs and Romans&quot; (in its final simplified form; &quot;цар Срба и Римљана&quot; / &quot;car Srba i Rimljana&quot; in modern Serbian) was only employed thereafter by Stefan Dušan&#x27;s son Stefan Uroš V until his death in 1371. A half-brother of Dušan, Simeon Uroš, and then his son Jovan Uroš, used the same title until the latter&#x27;s abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in Thessaly.

====Empire of Trebizond====
The Empire of Trebizond, one of the entities that had emerged from the fragmentation of the early 13th century, survived until Ottoman conquest in 1461. Its Komnenos rulers claimed the Imperial title for themselves in competition to the ones in Constantinople, even though they did not receive any meaningful international recognition.

A separate polity on the Crimean coast of the Black Sea, the Principality of Theodoro, only fell to the Ottomans in 1475. There is no indication that its rulers made any claim of being Roman Emperors.

====Andreas Palaiologos&#x27;s cessions====


Andreas Palaiologos, a nephew of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and the head of what remained of the Palaiologos family, started calling himself Emperor of Constantinople in 1483 and, possibly childless, sold what he viewed as his imperial title to Charles VIII of France in 1494. The following Kings of France kept the claim until Charles IX in 1566, when it went into disuse. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title &quot;is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter.&quot;

In his last will in 1502, Andreas Palaiologos again ceded his self-awarded imperial title, this time to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Other pretenders to the Byzantine throne have appeared following his death that year, with increasingly dubious claims as centuries went by. Charles I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, who also claimed descent from the Palaiologos family, declared in 1612 his intent to reclaim Constantinople but only succeeded in provoking an uprising in the Mani Peninsula, which lasted until 1619.

===Ottoman Empire after 1453===


After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II declared himself Roman Emperor: &quot;Kayser-i Rum&quot;, literally &quot;Caesar of the Romans&quot;, the standard title for earlier Byzantine Emperors in Arab, Persian and Turkish lands. In 1454, he ceremonially established Gennadius Scholarius, a staunch antagonist of Catholicism and of the Sultan&#x27;s European enemies, as Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and ethnarch (&quot;milletbashi&quot;) of the Rum Millet, namely Greek Orthodox Christians within the Empire. In turn, Gennadius endorsed Mehmed&#x27;s claim of Imperial succession.

Mehmed&#x27;s claim rested principally with the idea that Constantinople was the rightful seat of the Roman Empire, as it had been for more than a millennium even if the 1204–1261 period is subtracted. Contemporary scholar George of Trebizond wrote that &quot;the seat of the Roman Empire is Constantinople ... and he who is and remains Emperor of the Romans is also the Emperor of the whole world&quot;. An additional though questionable claim of legitimacy referred to the past alliances between the Ottoman dynasty and Byzantine Imperial families. Byzantine Princess Theodora Kantakouzene had been one of the wives of Orhan I, and an unsupported but widespread story portrayed Mehmed as a descendant of John Tzelepes Komnenos.

George of Trebizond addressed Mehmed in a poem:
Mehmed&#x27;s imperial plans went further and aimed at conquering Rome itself, thus reuniting the Empire in a way it hadn&#x27;t been for nearly eight centuries. His Italian campaign started in 1480 with the invasion of Otranto, but was cut short by Mehmed&#x27;s sudden death on 3 May 1481. None of his successors renewed that endeavor. Instead, they repeatedly (albeit never successfully) attempted to conquer the capital of the rival contenders to the Imperial Roman title, with a first siege of Vienna in 1529 and a second one in 1683.

Being the rightful heir of the Roman/Byzantine Empire became part of the identity of the Sultanate, along with its Turkish and Muslim heritage, even though that dimension was played down by Western observers. According to Turkish scholar F. Asli Ergul: 
Additionally, over the centuries, many Greeks abandoned Orthodoxy and embraced Islam, to the point that today, in part because of the intermingling of ethnic Greeks with Turks in the Ottoman Empire, genetic studies have found that modern Turks are closer, genetically, to Mediterranean and Middle Eastern people than to Central Asians.

In diplomatic exchanges with the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans initially refused to acknowledge the latter&#x27;s Imperial claim, because they saw themselves as the only rightful successors of Rome. In the Treaty of Constantinople (1533), the Austrian negotiators agreed not to make any mention of the Holy Roman Empire, only referring to Ferdinand I as King of Germany and Charles V as King of Spain. The Ottomans abandoned that requirement in the Treaty of Sitvatorok in 1606, and similarly to the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774.

Chinese usage during the Ming dynasty referred to the Ottomans as Lumi (魯迷), derived from Rûmi, literally &quot;Roman&quot;. It is important to emphasize that in China there is the concept of &quot;conquest dynasty&quot;, with the Chinese considering dynasties of non-Han ethnic origin as the Yuan dynasty (Mongolian origin) and Qing dynasty (Manchu origin) as Chinese dynasties, this concept (when used for non-Chinese foreign people) may have influenced the Chinese to see the Ottomans as a Roman dynasty.

==Continuation in the West==

===Political fragmentation and imperial overlordship===

By the start of the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire remained close to its maximum territorial extent, notwithstanding the loss of the &quot;Agri Decumates&quot; during the crisis of the Third Century, but Roman rule had become fragile and many areas were depopulated. In the early years of the century, the Empire withdrew from Great Britain, leaving it open to Anglo-Saxon settlement. Mounting foreign incursions soon resulted in permanent settlement of Germanic and other ethnic groups into territories that became gradually autonomous, were sometimes acknowledged or even encouraged by treaty (&quot;foedus&quot;) by the Western Empire, and often embarked on expansion by further conquest.

The Vandals crossed the Rhine in 406, the Pyrenees in 409, the Strait of Gibraltar in 428, and established the Vandal Kingdom in Northern Africa and the Western Mediterranean islands by the mid-5th century; the Suebi, initially moving alongside the Vandals, established their Western Iberian kingdom in 409; the Visigothic Kingdom was initially established by treaty in 418 in the Garonne Valley, and soon expanded into the Iberian Peninsula; the Alemanni expanded into Alsace and beyond, from their initial base in the &quot;Agri Decumates&quot;; in the 440s, the Kingdom of the Burgundians was established around the Rhone; an autonomous Kingdom of Soissons was carved out from 457 by Roman military commanders between the Seine and Somme rivers; last but not least, the Franks, which had been established north of the Rhine in 358 by treaty with Emperor Julian, expanded into what is now Belgium and Northern France. As a consequence, when the last Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus was deposed by military commander Odoacer in 476, his direct rule did not extend much beyond the current Northern borders of Italy. Another military leader, Julius Nepos, briefly Romulus Augustulus&#x27;s predecessor, held territory in Dalmatia and kept the Imperial title until his assassination in 480.

In a symbolic act that would fascinate later historians, Odoacer sent back the Imperial &quot;regalia&quot; or accessories of Romulus Augustulus to the Eastern Emperor Zeno in Constantinople. Far from signaling the end of imperial rule in Italy, this meant that Odoacer acknowledged Zeno&#x27;s overlordship and did not claim full sovereignty. Like previous &quot;foederati&quot; leaders, he adopted the title of King (&quot;Rex&quot;) and ruled in the name of the remaining Emperors, namely Zeno and also Julius Nepos while the latter was still alive. This arrangement was kept by Theodoric the Great, who vanquished and killed Odoacer in 493 and replaced him as King of Italy.

Political boundaries kept moving in the later 5th and 6th centuries. Clovis I, king of the Franks (d. 511), conquered Alemannia, the Kingdom of Soissons and most of the Visigothic Kingdom north of the Pyrenees, and his sons conquered the Kingdom of the Burgundians in 534, thus creating a vast kingdom of Francia, which was periodically divided between various members of the Merovingian dynasty. Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Justinian I reestablished direct Imperial rule in Southern Spain, North Africa and especially Italy, reconquered during the hard-fought Gothic War (535–554). Later in the 6th century, Emperor Maurice sponsored Gundoald, a member of Clovis&#x27;s Merovingian dynasty, in his claim to the Frankish kingdom, which ended unsuccessfully in 585 at Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges.

Even though it was out of the Empire&#x27;s direct military reach, Francia kept acknowledging the overlordship of Constantinople throughout the 6th century. At a ceremony in early 508 in Tours, Clovis received the &quot;insignia&quot; sent by Emperor Anastasius I which established his service to the Empire as Consul. Similarly, in the early 6th century, King Gundobad of the still-independent Burgundians, despite being an Arian, was &quot;Magister militum&quot; in the name of the Emperor. The &quot;Gesta pontificum Autissiodorensium&quot;, a compendium of information about the Bishops of Auxerre first compiled in the late 9th century, keeps referring to the reigning Roman Emperor up to Desiderius (d. 621), listed as bishop &quot;in the reigns of Phocas and Heraclius&quot; (&quot;imperantibus Foca, atque Heraclio&quot;). No such deference appears to have existed in the Visigothic Kingdom at the same time. Chris Wickham portrays the Visigothic king Euric (466–484) as &quot;the first major ruler of a &#x27;barbarian&#x27; polity in Gaul - the second in the Empire after Geiseric - to have a fully autonomous political practice, uninfluenced by any residual Roman loyalties.&quot; A century and a half later in the 620s, Isidore of Seville articulated for the Visigothic Kingdom, by then a Catholic monarchy following the conversion of Reccared I in 587, a vision of Christian monarchy on an equal status with the Eastern Roman Empire that would have seminal influence on later Western European political thinking.

Imperial rule in the West eroded further from the late 6th century. In Britain, to the extent discernible from scarce documentation, Roman rule was at best a distant memory. In Francia, references to Imperial overlordship disappear at the time of Merovingian renewal in the early 7th century under Chlothar II and Dagobert I. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Visigothic King Suintila expelled the last Imperial forces from Southern Spain in 625. In Italy, the Lombards invaded in 568, and the resulting Kingdom of the Lombards was hostile to the Empire whose territorial footprint shrunk gradually.

====Papal pivot====
The Roman Papacy was to become the instrument of the Imperial idea&#x27;s revival in the West. Rome was increasingly isolated from Constantinople following the devastations of Gothic War (535–554), subsequent imperial choices to favor Ravenna over Rome, and the Lombard invasion of Italy starting in 568, which limited its communications with the main imperial outposts in Ravenna and Sicily. The Column of Phocas on the Roman Forum, dedicated in 608, counts among the last monumental expressions of (eastern) imperial power in Rome. In 649, in breach of tradition, Pope Martin I was elected and consecrated without waiting for imperial confirmation. Constans II was the last (eastern) emperor to visit Rome for centuries, in 663, and plundered several of the remaining monuments to adorn Constantinople. Meanwhile, and for various reasons, Catholicism finally triumphed over Arianism in the Western kingdoms: in the Visigothic Iberian Peninsula with the conversion of Reccared I in 587, and in Lombard-held Italy, after some back-and-forth, following the death of King Rothari in 652. Pope Gregory I (590-604) established the foundations for the papacy&#x27;s incipient role as leader of Christianity in the West, even though at the time there was no conception of an alternative imperial authority to be established there in competition with Constantinople.

The promotion of iconoclasm by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian from 726 led to a deepening rupture between the Eastern Empire and the Papacy. Pope Gregory II saw iconoclasm as the latest in a series of imperial heresies. In 731, his successor Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication. Leo III responded in 732/33 by confiscating all papal patrimonies in south Italy and Sicily, and further removed the bishoprics of Thessalonica, Corinth, Syracuse, Reggio, Nicopolis, Athens, and Patras from papal jurisdiction, instead subjecting them to the Patriarch of Constantinople. This was in effect an act of triage: it strengthened the imperial grip in Southern Italy, but all but guaranteed the eventual destruction of the exarchate of Ravenna, which soon occurred at Lombard hands. In effect, the papacy had been &quot;cast out of the empire&quot;. Pope Zachary, in 741, was the last pope to announce his election to a Byzantine ruler or seek their approval.

The Popes needed to quickly reinvent their relationship to secular authority. Even though the neighboring Lombard kings were no longer heretical, they were often hostile. The more powerful and more distant Franks, which had by and large been allies of the Empire, were an alternative option as potential protectors. In 739, Gregory III sent a first embassy to Charles Martel seeking protection against Liutprand, King of the Lombards, but the Frankish strongman had been Liutbrand&#x27;s ally in the past and had asked him in 737 to ceremonially adopt his son. The Papacy had more luck with the latter, Pepin the Short, who succeeded Charles in October 741 together with his elder brother Carloman (who withdrew from public life and became a monk in 747). Pope Zachary was pressed into action by the final Lombard campaign against the exarchate of Ravenna, whose fall in mid-751 sealed the end of Byzantine rule in Central Italy. He was in contact with the Frankish ruling elites through the venerable Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz, and other clerics such as Burchard of Würzburg and Fulrad. In March 751 he moved to depose Childeric III, the last Merovingian King, following which Pepin was dedicated as King of France in Soissons. In 754, Zachary&#x27;s successor Pope Stephen II undertook the first-ever papal visit north of the Alps, met Pepin in Ponthion and anointed him as king at Saint-Denis on July 28, setting the template for later rites of coronation of French Kings. Stephen further legitimized the Carolingian dynasty by also anointing Pepin&#x27;s sons Charles and Carloman, by prohibiting the election of any non-descendant of Pepin as king, and by proclaiming that &quot;the Frankish nation is above all nations&quot;. This in return prompted the Donation of Pepin in 756, cementing the Popes&#x27; rule over the Papal States over the next eleven centuries. Subsequently, in 773–774, Pepin&#x27;s son and successor Charlemagne conquered the Lombard Kingdom of Italy.

===Holy Roman Empire===


The coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III, in Rome on Christmas Day 800, was explicitly intended as establishing continuity with the Roman Empire that still existed in the East. In Constantinople, Irene of Athens had blinded and deposed her son Emperor Constantine VI a few years earlier. With no precedent of a woman being sole holder of the imperial title, her critics in the West (e.g. Alcuin) viewed the imperial throne as vacant rather than recognizing her as Empress. Thus, as Peter H. Wilson put it, &quot;it is highly likely Charlemagne believed he was being made Roman Emperor&quot; at the time of his coronation; however, Charlemagne&#x27;s imperial title rested on a different base from any of the Roman emperors until him, as it was structurally reliant on the partnership with the Papacy, embodied in the act of his coronation by the Pope.

Meanwhile, the accession to the Byzantine throne of Nikephoros I in 802 confirmed the conflict of legitimacy between the Frankish and Byzantine incarnations of the Roman Empire, known in historiography as the problem of two emperors (in German, &quot;Zweikaiserproblem&quot;). According to Theophanes the Confessor, Charlemagne had attempted to prevent that conflict with a project to marry Irene, but this was not completed. The territorial conflicts were addressed in the following years through a series of negotiations known as the &quot;Pax Nicephori&quot;, but the broader conflict with Constantinople about Imperial legitimacy proved extremely durable.

Political authority fragmented within the Empire following Charlemagne&#x27;s death. The eventual outcome was an association of the Imperial dignity with the easternmost (&quot;German&quot;) lands of the Carolingian geography, but that was not self-evident at the start and took a long time to happen. From 843 to 875, the holders of the Imperial title only ruled over Northern Italy and, at the start, the &quot;middle kingdom&quot; of Lotharingia. On Christmas Day 875, exactly 75 years after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald of West Francia was crowned Emperor in Rome by Pope John VIII, adopting the motto &quot;renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum&quot;, which raised the prospect of an Empire centered on what is today France. Charles died soon afterwards in 877, and his successor Charles the Fat only briefly managed to reunite all the Carolingian domains, and after his death in 888 the Western part of Francia was dominated by the non-Carolingian Robertians, later the Capetian dynasty. For over seven decades, the Emperors&#x27; authority was then mostly confined to Northern Italy, until Otto I revived the Imperial idea and was crowned by Pope John XII in Rome in 962. From then on, all Emperors had dynastic roots in the Germanic-speaking lands (even though Frederick II was born in Italy, Henry VII in Valenciennes, Charles IV in Prague, Charles V in Ghent, Ferdinand I in Spain, Charles VII in Brussels, Francis I in Nancy, and Francis II in Florence).

During the millennium of the Holy Roman Empire, several specific attempts were made to recall the Empire&#x27;s classical heritage. Emperor Otto III reigned from Rome from 998 to his death in 1002, and made a short-lived attempt to revive ancient Roman institutions and traditions in partnership with Pope Sylvester II, who chose his papal name as an echo of the time of Constantine the Great. Frederick II took a keen interest in Roman antiquity, sponsored archaeological excavations, organized a Roman-style triumph in Cremona in 1238 to celebrate his victory at the battle of Cortenuova, and had himself depicted in classical imagery. Similarly, Maximilian I was highly mindful of classical references in his &quot;memorial&quot; projects of the 1510s that included the three monumental woodblock prints of the &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot;, &quot;Triumphal Procession&quot; and &quot;Large Triumphal Carriage&quot;.

====Papacy and the imperial title====

According to his biographer Einhard, Charlemagne was unhappy about his coronation, a fact that later historians have interpreted as displeasure about the Pope&#x27;s assumption of the key role in the legitimation of Imperial rule. Instead of the traditional recognition by popular acclamation, Leo III had crowned Charlemagne at the outset of the ceremony, just before the crowd acclaimed him. In September 813, Charlemagne tried to override that precedent by himself crowning his son Louis the Pious in Aachen, but the principle of Papal coronation survived and was renewed in 962 when Otto I restored the Empire and its rituals after decades of turmoil and received the Imperial Crown from Pope John XII.

The interdependence between Pope and Emperor led to conflict after the Papacy started asserting its position with the Gregorian Reform of the mid-11th century. The Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) included episodes of dramatic confrontation, in which the pope attempted to deprive the emperor of his imperial dignity. The &quot;Dictatus papae&quot;, a papal document issued in 1075 shortly after the election of Gregory VII, states that the pope &quot;alone may use the Imperial Insignia&quot;, that &quot;All princes shall kiss the feet of the Pope alone&quot;, and that &quot;It may be permitted to him to depose emperors&quot;. Following Emperor Henry IV&#x27;s walk to Canossa in January 1077, Gregory VII pronounced his absolution but referred to him as &quot;rex Teutonicorum&quot; (&quot;king of the Germans&quot;), thus omitting the imperial title and the fact that Henry was king (&quot;rex&quot;) of several realms, including Burgundy and Italy. Wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines, the respective partisans of the Pope and the Emperor, lasted until the 15th century. In 1527, the Pope&#x27;s involvement in the Italian Wars led to the traumatic sack of Rome by Charles V&#x27;s imperial troops, after which the Papacy&#x27;s influence in international politics was significantly reduced.

====Kingdoms and the imperial title====

Early in the Empire&#x27;s history, Louis the Pious formally established the supremacy of the Empire over Catholic kingdoms through the document issued in 817 and later known as &quot;Ordinatio Imperii&quot;. The view at the time was that the Empire covered all Western Christendom under one authority. (The British Isles, Brittany, and the Kingdom of Asturias were omitted in this vision.) Under Louis&#x27;s arrangement, only his elder son Lothair would hold the title of Emperor, and Lothair&#x27;s younger brothers Pepin and Louis should obey him even though they were kings, respectively, of Aquitaine and Bavaria. That document was controversial from the start, not least as it did not conform to Frankish succession law and practices. Following Louis the Pious&#x27;s death in June 840, the Battle of Fontenoy (841), Oaths of Strasbourg (842) and Treaty of Verdun (843) established a different reality, in which the Imperial title remained undivided but its holder competed with kings for territory, even though at the time all were still bound by the family links of the Carolingian dynasty and the bounds of Catholic Christianity.

Following the gradual demise of the Carolingian dynasty in the late 9th and 10th centuries, the rivalry between the Empire and individual kingdoms developed on these early precedents. The Kingdom of France, developing from Charles the Bald&#x27;s West Francia, was continually reluctant to acknowledge the Emperor&#x27;s senior status among European monarchs. As Latin Christendom expanded in the High Middle Ages, new kingdoms appeared outside of the Empire and would similarly bid for territory and supremacy. France itself was instrumental in the developments that led to the Empire&#x27;s political decline from the 16th to the early 19th centuries.

==Modern-era nationalist revivals==

A number of political regimes have claimed various forms of successorship of the Roman Empire, even though they acknowledged a significant time lag between what they viewed as the Empire&#x27;s extinction and their own efforts to revive it. These attempts have increasingly been framed in nationalist terms, in line with the times.

===Imperial Russia===


Ivan III of Russia in 1472 married Sophia (Zoé) Palaiologina, a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI, and styled himself Tsar (&quot;Царь&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot;) or &quot;imperator&quot;. In 1547, Ivan IV cemented the title as &quot;Tsar of All Rus&quot; (&quot;Царь Всея Руси&quot;). In 1589, the Metropolitanate of Moscow was granted autocephaly by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and thus became the Patriarchate of Moscow, thanks to the efforts of Boris Godunov. This sequence of events supported the narrative, encouraged by successive rulers, that Muscovy was the rightful successor of Byzantium as the &quot;Third Rome&quot;, based on a mix of religious (Orthodox), ethno-linguistic (East Slavic) and political ideas (the autocracy of the Tsar). Supporters of that view also asserted that the topography of the seven hills of Moscow offered parallels to the seven hills of Rome and the seven hills of Constantinople.

In 1492, Zosimus, Metropolitan of Moscow, in a foreword to his &quot;Presentation of the Paschalion&quot;, referred to Ivan III as &quot;the new Tsar Constantine of the new city of Constantine — Moscow.&quot; In a panegyric letter to Grand Duke Vasili III composed in 1510, Russian monk Philotheus (Filofey) of Pskov proclaimed, &quot;Two Romes have fallen. The third stands. And there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom!&quot;

=== Imperial Spain ===
The Hispano-Gothic Monarchy, recognized himself politically and legally as the heir and successor of Roman Empire in Hispania, using the Roman symbols of monarchy. Additionally, two Roman usurpers of the Visigothic Kingdom attempted to claim imperial authority: Burdunellus (496) and Petrus (506).

During the Middle Ages in Spain, some iberian monarchs, mostly from Kings of Castile and Kings of Leon, used the title of Imperator totius Hispaniae, in which there were claims, not only of the suzerainty over the other kings of the peninsula (both Christian and Muslim), but also the king&#x27;s equality with the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and Holy Roman Empire.

The last titular holder heir to the rank of Eastern Roman emperor, Andreas Palaiologos, sold his imperial title, along with his domains in Morea, to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile) in his will, written on 7 April 1502, designating them, and their successors (the future Spanish monarchs) as his universal heirs. Andreas argued that the Spanish kings held, through the Aragonese line, the ownership of the duchy of Athens and Neopatria, also because in Spanish noble circles there was a belief that the Álvarez de Toledo family (cousins of Ferdinand of Aragon) descended from the ancient Byzantine imperial lineage of the Komnenos. He was hoping that the Spanish Army would launch a crusade (during Ottoman–Venetian wars) from their south-Italians domains in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily to conquer the Peloponnese, before moving on to Thrace, Macedonia, and Constantinople; however, no Spanish monarch is known to have used the Byzantine imperial titles. In 1510, Pope Julius II revoked Alexander VI&#x27;s granting of the title of King of Jerusalem to Louis XII of France, and transferred it to Ferdinand the Catholic (which was included in his title of King of Naples after Treaty of Blois). This gave a step to make the confrontation with the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean in the Spanish-Ottoman wars, against Turkish claims of being Rome Successor.

During this times of the Catholic Monarchy, Antonio de Nebrija conceived Spain, after the end of the Reconquista and its political unification of Castille and Aragon, as the heir of the Roman empire, because there was a direct lineage from the Roman emperors and the Visigothic kings (considered their legal successors of Hispania), also appealed to a literary legitimisation in which Castilian replaced Latin as the language of the Empire.

With the succession of Charles I of Spain to the throne of Castile and Aragon, the peninsular territories were included in a greater inheritance that included the Burgundians (the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Burgundy, Franche-Comté) and the Austrians (Tyrol, Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola), to which in 1519 was added the title of Holy Roman Emperor. It was the first time, since the coronation of Charlemagne in 800, and after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, in which the Romano-Germanic and Byzantine crowns coincided in the same person. The followers of the Empire of Charles V (and his imperial ideal of being the universal monarch of Christendom, the &quot;Universitas Christiana&quot;) created maps, like the Europa regina, in which Hispania is the head, crowned with the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s &quot;insignia,&quot; its Carolingian crown (inherited of its Roman claims).

During Bourbon Spain, following the Renaissance tradition, the Spanish Bourbons, like Philip V, in their attempts to stablish the Enlightenment programme, conceived the Spanish empire to be the equal of the Roman empire. So, they started to recover the cultural hegemony, lost under the last Austrian rulers, by imitating Rome political power, institutions and symbols.

With all of this history in the Spanish Monarchy, Spanish nationalism claims that there is a legitimate ideological-dynastic (titles of Emperor of Constantinople and King of Jerusalem in the Spanish Crown, also in the past have been Holy Roman Emperor), geostrategic (kingdom of Naples and Sicily together, the conquests of North African plazas in Barbary, like Melilla, Ceuta, Mazalquivir, Oran, Bugia and Peñón of Algiers) and cultural basis (being a Latin country) to claim the inhertiance of the Roman Empire. Also, because many cities and institutions in the Kingdom of Spain still use the Roman double-headed eagle to this day, like the city of Toledo, the province of Toledo and the province of Zamora. and the manual of history of Edebé editorial (conservative nationalist) establishes a continuity between the Iberians, Rome, the Visigoths, and the peninsular Christian kingdoms as direct heirs of this Roman imperial tradition as Hispano-romans. This claim is also reinforced by the history of Spanish colonization of the Americas, which a lot of Hispanists claim is the definitive proof that Spain is the most accurate heir of Rome&#x27;s imperial legacy, as Spain was important for the culture of a continent, America (the New World), like Rome was to Europe (the Old World), some even claim that Spain surpassed Rome, since it also knew how to unify diverse peoples for centuries and maintaining cultural unity despite the imperial collapse. Even today there are opinions in which Philip VI of Spain is considered the nearest heir of Rome.

===Risorgimento and Fascist Italy===

Italy&#x27;s nationalist visionary Giuseppe Mazzini promoted the notion of the &quot;Third Rome&quot; during the Risorgimento (Italian word that means &#x27;Resurgence&#x27;). Addressing Italian unification and the establishment of Rome as the capital, he said: &quot;After the Rome of the emperors, after the Rome of the Popes, there will come the Rome of the people.&quot; After the Italian unification into the Kingdom of Italy, the state was referred to as the Third Rome by some Italian figures. After unification, Rome was chosen as capital despite its relative backwardness as it evoked the prestige of the former Empire. Mazzini spoke of the need of Italy as a Third Rome to have imperial aspirations, to be realized in the Italian Empire. Mazzini said that Italy should &quot;invade and colonize Tunisian lands&quot; as it was the &quot;key to the Central Mediterranean&quot;, and he viewed Italy as having the right to dominate the Mediterranean Sea as ancient Rome had done.

In his speeches, Benito Mussolini echoed the rhetoric of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; and referred to his regime as a &quot;Third Rome&quot; or as a New Roman Empire. &quot;Terza Roma&quot; (Third Rome) was also a name for Mussolini&#x27;s plan to expand Rome towards Ostia and the sea. The EUR neighbourhood was the first step in that direction.

=== Anglo-Western powers ===
Both the United Kingdom and the United States took inspiration from the Roman Empire in constructing their visions for dominating and transforming the world. For example, leading thinkers in British India saw the possibility to reconstruct the colony&#x27;s education system and leave a legacy similar to that produced by the Romans in ancient Britain.

===Non-Roman reinterpretations===

Several political regimes in the 19th and early 20th centuries defined themselves with reference to continuators of the Roman Empire, but not to the (Classical) Roman Empire itself. They all assumed nationalist reinterpretations of those continuators, and underplayed the extent to which the latter had portrayed themselves as Roman.

* The Austrian Empire, and after it the Austrian Republic, borrowed from the imagery and symbolism of the Holy Roman Empire following its demise in 1806. To this day, the Imperial eagle is a symbol of the Austrian government, as is also the case in Germany.
* In Greece, the &quot;Megali Idea&quot; (&quot;Great Idea&quot;) developed shortly after the War of Independence of recreating the Byzantine Empire, understood as an ethnic-Greek polity with capital in Constantinople. The idea first appeared during the debates of Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis with King Otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution. This nationalist aspiration drove Greek foreign relations and, to a significant extent, domestic politics for much of the first century after independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche – the &quot;Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas&quot; (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan seas, respectively). The effort to realize the idea after the World War I defeat of the Ottoman Empire ended in disaster with the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).
* Certain links between the German Empire in 1871 and the legacy of the Holy Roman Empire were shown in propaganda and actions, such as the creative restoration of the Imperial Palace of Goslar in the 1870s. Nazi Germany has been subsequently called the Third Reich (&quot;Drittes Reich&quot;) by certain figures during its regime, succeeding both the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire. The Holy Roman Empire reference was awkward, as it did not fit well with Nazi ideology. In 1939, a circular not intended for publication prohibited further use of the expression &quot;Third Reich&quot;.
* In Bulgaria, the assumption in 1908 of the title &quot;Tsar&quot; by Ferdinand I was primarily a reference to the First and Second Bulgarian Empires; unlike in Russia, it was translated into Western languages as &quot;king&quot; rather than &quot;emperor&quot;.

==Supranationalism and the Roman imperial idea==
In the 20th century, several political thinkers and politicians have associated the multi-level governance and multilingualism of the Roman Empire in its various successive incarnations with the modern legal concepts of federalism and supranationalism.

===League of Nations===
French historian Louis Eisenmann, in a 1926 article titled &quot;The Imperial Idea in the History of Europe&quot;, portrayed the newly created League of Nations as the modern expression of an &quot;imperial idea&quot; that had been degraded by the nationalistic drift of the German Empire, Habsburg monarchy and Russian Empire. He argued that the three empires&#x27; final demise and the League&#x27;s establishment represent a renewal of the Pax Romana imperial idea.

===European Union===

Memories of the Roman Empire have accompanied the European Union since its inception with the 1950 Schuman Plan. The Roman Empire has provided the European Union, like many countries, with Roman legal concepts and their language, Latin. As such Latin has been used in some circumstances as one non-official &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the European Union, for example by EU Institutions using Latin concepts in texts and titles.

The comparison of the European Union with the Holy Roman Empire, in a negative or positive light, is a common trope of political commentary. The European Union has been viewed as a reincarnation of a foreign and overbearing Roman Empire in some European countries, particularly the United Kingdom. The 2020 withdrawal of the UK from the Union, or Brexit, has been variously compared with the Boudica Rebellion or with end of Roman rule in Britain. A different negative view of the European Union as new Roman Empire has been regularly formulated in Christian fundamentalist circles, principally in the United States. According to that view, the EU, like other supranational endeavors such as the United Nations and World Bank, by attempting to revive the Roman Empire, signals the approaching end time, rapture or Second Coming. Occasionally, the European Union is portrayed as a &quot;Fourth Reich&quot;, further emphasizing its demonic nature. This critique is often portrayed as fringe despite its widespread following among American Evangelicals for several decades.

;&quot;Below the Sky: Photographs of the High Plains&quot;
The High Plains—the Dakotas, Montana, southern Saskatchewan—lie under a vast sky. Weather and wind throw cloud shadows across the landscape, a moving panorama of light, color and form. Earth meets sky at an incredibly distant horizon. Transcendent images materialize, drift away, reappear as the light shifts through the heavens. These remarkable photographs, taken over a span of 30 years, capture the magical moods and textures of a sublime, singular landscape—a rare retrospective of images taken by Hanson as he rambled the back roads of the plains below the sky. With an introduction by Minnesota writer Patricia Hampl and a foreword by Hanson.

<doc id="434056" wikidata="Q6741449" url="?curid=434056" title="Keiko O'Brien">
<text>Keiko O&#x27;Brien (born Keiko Ishikawa) is a character in the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, played by actress Rosalind Chao. Introduced in 1991, she is the civilian spouse of Starfleet crew member Miles O&#x27;Brien (played by Colm Meaney) appearing occasionally in later seasons of the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), and more frequently as a supporting character throughout &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999), as well as in related media such as novels. The producers wanted her as a regular character on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, but Chao was only available part-time.

Keiko was introduced as a romantic interest for the recurring &quot;Next Generation&quot; character of Chief O&#x27;Brien, and stories involving her and the couple&#x27;s children allowed &quot;Star Trek&quot; to expand its narrative beyond weekly space missions. She is a professional botanist, and becomes a teacher on Deep Space Nine, where her husband has been stationed. She is of Japanese ancestry, which is reflected in Keiko&#x27;s and Miles&#x27; Japanese-Irish marriage ceremony, and by her observance of other family traditions.

==Casting and appearances==
Keiko is played by Chinese-American actress Rosalind Chao, who had first come to public attention playing Soon-Lee, the Korean wife of Max Klinger, in the final episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and in its spin-off &quot;AfterMASH&quot;. Actress Patti Yasutake – who would later play nurse Alyssa Ogawa on &quot;The Next Generation&quot; – auditioned unsuccessfully for the role.

Chao also auditioned for the role of Tasha Yar, the Enterprise security chief from season 1.

=== &quot;The Next Generation&quot; ===
The character was introduced in the fourth season episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Data&#x27;s Day&quot;, which depicts her imminent wedding to Miles – which she temporarily cancels – as one of several subplots in which the main-cast character Data is involved. The words in their wedding were based on Captain Kirk&#x27;s in the original series 1966 episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, according to writer Ronald D. Moore.

The character appeared prominently the following season in the episode &quot;Disaster&quot;, in which she gives birth to Keiko and Miles&#x27; first child Molly in the crew lounge Ten-Forward during a shipwide crisis. Keiko is a central character in the sixth season episode &quot;Rascals&quot;, in which she is temporarily transformed into a child and played by Caroline Junko King.

=== &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; ===
Chao was offered a full-time role on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, which she turned down because the demands on her would be too strenuous. Keiko instead appears irregularly, with a focus on the impact of Miles’s job on the O&#x27;Briens&#x27; relationship. Finding limited opportunity to use her botanical expertise, and concerned about the educational opportunities on the station for her daughter and others&#x27; children, she starts a school, where Jake Sisko and Nog are also students.

The first season episode &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot; shows Keiko in conflict with religious leader Vedek Winn over her teaching of science and a secular perspective on elements of Winn&#x27;s Bajoran faith. In the fourth season episode &quot;Body Parts&quot;, Keiko and her unborn child are injured, and to save the fetus it is placed into Major Kira&#x27;s uterus to carry to term, as an in-story explanation for actress Nana Visitor&#x27;s pregnancy. The couple and Kira form an awkward ad hoc family for the duration of the pregnancy, until their son Kirayoshi is born, in the fifth season episode &quot;The Begotten&quot;. Meanwhile, Keiko has a central role in the fifth season episode &quot;The Assignment&quot;, when she is possessed by a malevolent entity. During the Dominion War late in the series, Keiko and the children are evacuated from the war zone. After the war, Keiko and her family relocate to Earth, where Miles will be an instructor at Starfleet Academy.

===Novels===
Keiko has appeared in over twenty &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels. Examples include &quot;The Fall: Revelation and Dust,&quot; &quot;Warpath,&quot; &quot;Warped,&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

=== Toys ===
Keiko was also released as a toy figurine, Playmates no. 65121.

==Reception==
Viewers and critics had mixed reactions to the character. Some criticized her as unlikable and &quot;shrewish&quot;, based on her abrupt (and short-lived) cancellation of her wedding to Miles, and her domestic expectations of him in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episodes. Appearing in only 8 episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and 19 episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, she did not get as much character development as the primary characters, with an article on &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; complaining that her traits are largely a series of &quot;cultural stereotypes, likely checked off by a writer’s room of non-Asian writers who really just weren’t sure how to write a fully fleshed-out Asian character.&quot; &quot;IndieWire&quot; ranked Keiko as only the 14th best out of 17 regular and recurring characters on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. A &quot;Screen Rant&quot; article argued, &quot;It&#x27;s a struggle to come up with any compelling reasons why Keiko needed to exist&quot;, and that the character overall &quot;hurt&quot; &quot;The Next Generation.&quot;

However, &quot;To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe&quot; argues that Keiko and Miles have the only successful long-term relationship in the entire Star Trek universe, noting that they are married in the fourth season of &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; have two children, and are still committed to each other at the conclusion of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; after nearly a decade. CBR praised the character and her relationship with Miles as a realistic depiction of the strains that marriage can involve, and ranked Keiko the 7th best recurring character in all of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. SyFy described her as &quot;fascinating&quot;, rating her among the 21 most interesting supporting characters of the franchise.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; suggested that Keiko and Miles would make a good spin-off series.

<text>These are lists of political office-holders in [[East Germany]]. The political leadership of East Germany was distributed between several offices. However, until the Volkskammer removed a section in the GDR&#x27;s constitution guaranteeing their monopoly on political power on 1 December 1989, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) held ultimate power and authority over state and government. Thus, the head of the SED&#x27;s Politburo of the Central Committee was the de facto leader of the country.

== Overview ==

The political leadership of East Germany was distributed between several offices. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and its leader held ultimate power and authority over state and government.
Prior to the proclamation of an East German state, the Soviets established the German Economic Commission (DWK) in 1948 as a de facto government in their occupation zone. Its chairman was Heinrich Rau.

On 7 October 1949 an East German state, called the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was proclaimed and took over governmental functions from the DWK, largely with the same leading figures.
Until 1 December 1989, the most important position in the GDR was that of the Leader of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), first titled chairman from 1946 to 1950, then as the First Secretary between 1950 and 1976 and finally titled General Secretary. The first article of the GDR&#x27;s constitution contained a section granting the SED a monopoly on power, making the SED&#x27;s leader the de facto leader of the country. He and the party Politburo, which he headed, set all policy, with both cabinet, state council and parliament acting as a rubber stamp implementing their decisions.

The formal head of state was originally the President of the German Democratic Republic. After the death of incumbent Wilhelm Pieck in 1960, the office was replaced by a collective body as head of state, the State Council. The position of chairman was the de facto head of state and commonly held by the party leader.

The government was headed by the Council of Ministers and its chairman, sometimes colloquially called Prime Minister. However, all the decisions were made by the party, with the cabinet implementing them. Indeed, the SED Central Committee had committees mirroring the cabinet departments.

Other institutions included the Volkskammer, the legislature whose sessions were chaired by a President, and, since 1960, the National Defense Council, which held supreme command of the GDR&#x27;s armed forces and had unlimited authority over the State in time of war. The Council was composed exclusively of members of the SED&#x27;s Central Committee and Politburo, with the party leader serving as Chairman of the National Defense Council.

The political landscape was completely changed by the Peaceful Revolution in late 1989, which saw the SED having to relinquish its monopoly on political power in favour of the Council of Ministers, the National Defense Council and the State Council being abolished. The remaining institutions were the People&#x27;s Chamber, whose President became head of state by default for the remainder of the GDR&#x27;s existence, and the Council of Ministers, both soon constituted on basis of the country&#x27;s first and only democratic elections in March 1990. The GDR joined the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990

On 1 December 1989, the People&#x27;s Chamber removed the section of the East German Constitution granting the SED a monopoly of power—thus ending Communist rule in East Germany. Before the month was out, the SED transformed from a Leninist cadre party into a democratic socialist party, renaming itself first to Socialist Unity Party — Party of Democratic Socialism and later in the same year, to Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). Hence, the party&#x27;s subsequent leaders were no more leaders of East Germany than the leaders of other parties.

<doc id="434065" wikidata="Q945379" url="?curid=434065" title="Thomas Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick">
<text>Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, KG (16 March 13388 April 1401) was an English medieval nobleman and one of the primary opponents of Richard II.

==Origins==

He was the son of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick by his wife Katherine Mortimer, a daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March (d.1369).

== Career ==

Knighted around 1355, Beauchamp accompanied John of Gaunt in campaigns in France in 1373, and around that time was made a Knight of the Garter. In the parliaments of 1376 and 1377 he was one of those appointed to supervise reform of King Richard II&#x27;s government. When these were not as effective as hoped, Beauchamp was made Governor over the King. In 1377, or 1378, he granted the manors of Croome Adam (now Earls Croome) in Worcestershire and Grafton Flyford in Warwickshire to Henry de Ardern for a red rose. Between 1377 and 1378 he was appointed Admiral of the North. Beauchamp brought a large contingent of soldiers and archers to King Richard&#x27;s Scottish campaign of 1385.

=== Conflict with King Richard II ===
In 1387 he was one of the Lords Appellant, who endeavored to separate Richard II from his favorites. After Richard regained power, Beauchamp retired to his estates, but was invited to London on a ruse in 1397 and charged with high treason, supposedly as a part of the Earl of Arundel&#x27;s alleged conspiracy. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London (in what is now known as the &quot;Beauchamp Tower&quot;), pleaded guilty and threw himself on the mercy of the king. He forfeited his estates and titles, and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the Isle of Man. The next year, however, he was moved back to the Tower, until he was released in August 1399 after Henry Bolingbroke&#x27;s capture of Richard II.

=== Restored by King Henry IV ===
After Bolingbroke deposed Richard and became king as Henry IV, Beauchamp was restored to his titles and estates. He was one of those who urged the new King to murder Richard, and accompanied King Henry against the rebellion of 1400.

==Marriage and children==

He married Margaret Ferrers, daughter of William Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers of Groby by his wife Margaret d&#x27;Ufford, a daughter of Robert d&#x27;Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk. by his wife he had children including:
*Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick (1382–1439), son and heir.
*Agnes de Beauchamp, married Thomas Borges of Wraxall &amp; Braunton (d. 1401).

== Death and succession ==
Beauchamp died in 1401 (sources differ as to whether on 8 April or 8 August). and was succeeded by his son Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. He was buried with his wife Margaret in the south transept of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, but their tomb was destroyed by fire in 1694. Only the monumental brass survived, which is still on display at St Mary&#x27;s.

<text>Margaret Edith Weis (; born March 16, 1948) is an American fantasy and science fiction author of dozens of novels and short stories. At TSR, Inc., she teamed with Tracy Hickman to create the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; role-playing game (RPG) world. She is founding CEO and owner of Sovereign Press, Inc and Margaret Weis Productions, licensing several popular television and movie franchises to make RPG series in addition to their own.

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Weis one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot;, saying she and Hickman are &quot;basically responsible for the entire gaming fiction genre&quot;. In 2002, she was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in part for &quot;Dragonlance&quot;.

==Early life==
Margaret Weis was born on March 16, 1948, in Independence, Missouri, where she was raised. She discovered heroic fantasy fiction while studying at the University of Missouri (MU). She said, &quot;I read Tolkien when it made its first big sweep in the colleges back in 1966. A girlfriend of mine gave me a copy of the books while I was in summer school at MU. I literally couldn&#x27;t put them down! I never found any other fantasy I liked, and just never read any fantasy after Tolkien.&quot; She conscientiously avoided buying unauthorized publications of his work, and she related the wars in his fictional world to those in the real world of the 1960s.

She graduated from the University of Missouri in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in creative writing and literature.

==Career==
Weis recalled, &quot;Of course, my mother knew I was going to starve with such a worthless degree&quot;, so her mother got her a job as a proofreader at a small publishing company in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri. There, she ascended to editor, learned all about the book industry, and found an agentcrediting the job as an unusually good start for an author. She started writing for the low-paying juvenile book market by appealing to librarians with her high-quality, well-researched books. From 1972 to 1983 she worked for Herald Publishing House as advertising director and subsequently as director of Independence Press, Herald Publishing&#x27;s trade division from 1981 to 1983.

Weis&#x27;s first book is a biography of the outlaws Frank and Jesse James, because Frank had been buried in a cemetery near her childhood school in Independence. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she wrote children&#x27;s books about computer graphics, robots, the history of Thanksgiving, and an adventure book at a second-grade reading level for prisoners with low literacy levels.

===TSR and &quot;Dragonlance&quot;===

In 1983, Weis applied for a job as a game editor at TSR, Inc. that she saw advertised in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. TSR turned her down for that position, but hired her as a book editor. She stayed in the book division, leaving the company as an independent author in 1986.

One of her first assignments at TSR was to help coordinate, in a chance meeting with TSR colleague Tracy Hickman, &quot;Project Overlord&quot;, which was to include a novel and three &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; modules. Weis and Hickman plotted the novel and hired an author to flesh out story ideas but who lacked grasp of the characters or plots. Having &quot;lived with those characters for months&quot; and threatened by deadline, the two saved the project. She said, &quot;By that time, [Hickman] and I were so into the project that we felt we had to write it.&quot; &quot;Project Overlord&quot; soon became known as &quot;Dragonlance&quot;. With 4 million sales of the first book in the US and UK, it grew into a trilogy of novels, called the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot;, and 15 linked modules. Jean Black, managing editor of TSR&#x27;s book department, selected Weis and Hickman to write the series. She said, &quot;To my mind, what made the project so successful was that everyone was involved in it, excited about it, and believed in it.&quot;

After two years of development, TSR released the game module &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot; in March 1984 and the novel &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; in November 1984. TSR had doubts about the finished novel&#x27;s sales potential, and attempted to order 30,000 copies before ordering the minimum print run of 50,000. The novel&#x27;s success prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. The novel was written after the completion of the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; game modules. Weis and Hickman found this constraining and made the novel too episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written.

Weis and Hickman also authored the &quot;Dragonlance Legends&quot; trilogy, published in 1986. Their &quot;Dragonlance&quot; products included novels, game supplements, short stories, art books, and calendars.

The two started moonlighting as book authors, for four hours each evening and through every weekend. Several successful books afforded them to quit TSR and begin writing full-time in 1986.

=== Entrepreneur ===

Having left TSR in 1986, Weis and Hickman continued as a writing team. According to the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; profile of major local authors &quot;transformed&quot; by pioneering fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, the duo sought to recapture the reality-grounded and humanized experience of Tolkien literature but without copying or emulating it, so a reader could imagine meeting their original magical characters in a real place like a bus stop and conversing using pronounceable names. She attributed their writing partnership&#x27;s longevity to specialization, where Hickman was the world builder and storyteller who defines &quot;when the moon rises and which way the winds blow&quot;, and she brought characters and substance. He then untangled her unsolvable situations. Weis and Hickman wrote the &quot;Darksword&quot; trilogy (1986–87) and the seven-book &quot;Deathgate Cycle&quot; (1988–94) for Bantam Books.

Weis&#x27;s daily workflow consisted of five hours of writing on the computer, starting at , even on holidays, often rewriting anything that had surpassed five hours the previous day, and then thinking about the book through the afternoon. She wrote plot ideas and dialogue scraps upon napkins and envelopes until she got a portable computer, and got nervous if unable to work. She said, &quot;I&#x27;d love to do mysteries but I don&#x27;t have the head for them&quot;. She mentally, happily, inhabited her own fictional worlds; and upon completion, suffered &quot;a real depression&quot; due to abandoning characters that seemed realer than most people. Her only vacations consisted of hosting fantasy and science fiction conventions worldwide and befriending her fans.

Weis wrote the space opera &quot;Star of the Guardians&quot; novels, which she calls her favorite series that she has written. She published a game based on &quot;Mag Force 7&quot; from 1994 to 1996. In the late 1990s, Larry Elmore brought his fantasy world of Loerem to Weis and Hickman, which they wrote as the &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; novel trilogy, published by Del Rey. From 2003 to 2005, Weis completed the &quot;Dragonvarld&quot; trilogy for Tor.

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Weis one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot; &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming&quot;, and said she and Hickman are &quot;basically responsible for the entire gaming fiction genre&quot;. Weis was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in 2002, recognized in part for &quot;one game line turned literary sensation: &quot;Dragonlance&quot;&quot;.

==== Publishing companies ====
In addition to her writing career, Weis was the owner and chief officer of two publishing companies. She formed the company Sovereign Press, with herself as CEO, to publish the &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; role-playing game written by her husband Don Perrin with Lester Smith. To support the setting, Weis and Perrin wrote the short story &quot;Shadamehr and the Old Wives Tale&quot; that was published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #264 (October 1999). Perrin left Sovereign Press in 2004 and Weis founded Margaret Weis Productions. It published an RPG line based on several licenses, including &quot;Serenity&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and Ed Greenwood&#x27;s new solo venture into roleplaying, &quot;Castlemourn&quot;.

Weis has served on the board of directors of Mag Force 7, Inc., the developer of the &quot;Star of the Guardians&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander Collectible Trading Card Game&quot; (CCGs).

=== Returns to &quot;Dragonlance&quot; ===
Weis and Hickman returned to &quot;Dragonlance&quot; in 1995 with &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot;. Her next project was a solo novel called &quot;The Soulforge&quot;, based on her favorite character from the trilogy, the dark wizard Raistlin. Wizards of the Coast published a new trilogy of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels by Weis and Hickman called &quot;War of Souls&quot;, beginning with &quot;Dragons of a Fallen Sun&quot; (2000).

Wizards of the Coast licensed &quot;Dragonlance&quot; to Sovereign Press in 2002 to produce role-playing game materials for the setting; Weis and Perrin, with Jamie Chambers and Christopher Coyle, wrote &quot;Dragonlance Campaign Setting&quot; (2003) which Wizards of the Coast published. Sovereign Press was then able to supplement that book additional using material produced under the d20 license. The license expired in 2007. Between 2004 and 2008, Weis wrote a solo novel trilogy titled &quot;The Dark Disciple&quot;; the first novel, &quot;Amber and Ashes&quot;, was published in August 2004. During this period, Weis also co-authored with Hickman &quot;The Lost Chronicles&quot; trilogy starting with &quot;Dragons of the Dwarven Depths&quot; in July 2006. There was a fifteen-year hiatus between novels about the Companions before &quot;Dragons of the Dwarven Depths&quot; was released. After the original &quot;Chronicles&quot; novels were completed in 1991, the co-authors had a lot of material about them remaining, but moved on to writing about new characters. In 2004, Weis told Hickman she wanted to return to the main protagonists of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; world. When the pair contacted their editors, they enthusiastically agreed.

In October 2020, Weis and Tracy Hickman filed suit against Wizards of the Coast for breaching a license for a new &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel trilogy. &quot;Boing Boing&quot; reported that &quot;according to the lawsuit, Weis and Hickman agreed with Wizards of the Coast to produce the new novels in 2017, capping off the series and giving fans a final sendoff. But the company pulled the plug in August 2020&quot;. The authors see the new trilogy as &quot;the capstone to their life&#x27;s work&quot;. In December 2020, Weis and Hickman filed to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice their lawsuit, and &quot;the filing noted that Wizards of the Coast had not formally answered their lawsuit, nor had they filed for a summary judgement&quot;. Weis and Hickman&#x27;s publishing agent affirmed a few weeks later that a new trilogy of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels was again in development. The first novel of the new series, &quot;Dragonlance: Dragons of Deceit&quot;, was released on August 2, 2022.

==Personal life==
Weis met her future husband in high school, married after college, and had two children. The mentality of a professional writer strained those relationships. After publication of her first book and ten years of marriage, they divorced due to that stress and to different personalities.

In 1983, she moved to the resort city of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, to work for TSR, living in a house converted from a barn. She said she always avoided reading fantasy books since Tolkien to avoid influencing her work, but favored classics like Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and Sherlock Holmes in any spare time. She often played games at her co-owned store, Game Guild. She cooked for relaxation, and collected cookbooks in her travels, such as recipes of drinks from Dickens books.

In 1993, Weis was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent successful chemotherapy. She stayed busy writing &quot;The Seventh Gate&quot; during treatment.

In 1996, Weis married writer/game designer Don Perrin; the two later divorced.

<text>Hawkshaw is a pair of semi-detached houses on the River Tweed, two miles southwest of Tweedsmuir in the Scottish Borders. Historically part of Peeblesshire, the original village of Hawkshaw was destroyed when the Fruid Reservoir was constructed in 1963, and is remembered as the ancestral family home of the Porteous family, dating from at least 1439.

A fortified tower stood on a hill overlooking the village for hundreds of years, although little remains of it now, its site being marked with a cairn built from stones from the original tower; this was probably one of a series of so-called Peel towers, small fortified keeps built along the Scottish Borders, intended as watch towers where signal fires could be lit to warn of approaching danger. A line of these towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source (a few miles from Hawkshaw) as a response to the dangers of invasion from the English Borders. Hawkshaw was one of over two dozen of these in Peeblesshire alone.

Roman artefacts have also been found in the vicinity, pre-dating the tower and indicating continuity of habitation in the area for some hundreds of years.

The cairn plays host to a gathering of Porteous family members from all over the world every five years. The September 2005 gathering attracted seventy family members from five continents, and a short religious service was followed by the laying of a wreath at the cairn, in memory of all fallen Porteous servicemen and women.

<text>Horst Sindermann (; 5 September 1915 – 20 April 1990) was a Communist German politician and one of the leaders of East Germany. He became Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1973, but in 1976 he became President of the Volkskammer, the only member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to hold the post.

==Early life==

Sindermann was born in a traditional family in Dresden as the son of the Saxon Social Democratic politician Karl Sindermann. His older brother, Kurt Sindermann, also entered politics as a member of the Communist Party and sat on the Saxon state parliament from 1929 to 1933.

Horst Sindermann joined the Communist Youth Federation (KJVD) in 1929 and in 1932 became a local functionary in Dresden. The group was banned by the Nazi regime and in June 1933, Sindermann was arrested and condemned to eight months of imprisonment for illegal political activities. In September 1934, he became political director of the KJVD&#x27;s Dresden branch. In March 1935, he again was arrested for attempted high treason, tortured and put in solitary confinement for six years at Waldheim jail. In 1941, he was transferred to &quot;protective custody&quot; to several concentration camps, first at Sachsenhausen, then at Mauthausen in Upper Austria, and finally at Ebensee, until being freed by the arriving U.S. army in 1945.

==Career in East Germany==

After the war, Sindermann returned to Saxony and joined the KPD. After 1946 he was a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED), created in April 1946 from the forced merger of Communists and Social Democrats in the Soviet Occupation Zone.

Sindermann worked as a newspaper editor of the &quot;Sächsische Volkszeitung&quot; at Dresden and the &quot;Volksstimme&quot; at Chemnitz from 1945 to 1947. He became First party secretary in the &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Chemnitz and Leipzig. He ran afoul of party co-chairman Otto Grotewohl, whom he criticised for being married to a former Nazi functionary, and in June 1949 was censured by the party&#x27;s controlling commission and was demoted to the &quot;Freiheit&quot; paper in Halle, where he then became editor-in-chief from 1950 to 1953.

Sindermann was director of agitation and propaganda in the Central Committee from 1954 to 1963. In 1958, he became a candidate and in 1963 a member of the Central Committee. In the same year, he also was appointed first party secretary in the district of Halle (until 1971) and was first elected into the Volkskammer. In 1967, he was admitted to the Politburo.

==In the East German leadership==

In 1971, he became Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers—i. e., deputy prime minister of East Germany. Two years later, he became its chairman, or prime minister, when the previous occupant, Willi Stoph, succeeded the deceased Walter Ulbricht as Chairman of the State Council.

His rise was cut short in October 1976, as party leader Erich Honecker deemed his economic views too liberal. Stoph returned to the premiership, while Sindermann was demoted to the posts of President of the Volkskammer and deputy chairman of the State Council. He was the only Communist to preside over the Volkskammer; the SED had previously reserved the Volkshammer presidency for a top member of a block party to keep up the political fiction that East Germany was governed by a broad-based coalition. Although he nominally held the third-highest state office in East Germany (behind Prime Minister Stoph and State Council chairman Honecker), he was left with little political influence.

As a representative of the Socialist Unity Party, Horst Sindermann spoke during the commemorations of the liberation of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at the National Memorial of the GDR.

==Resignation and final years==

Sindermann remained in these positions until the peaceful revolution, during which he resigned from all offices in November 1989. In a desperate attempt to change its image, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the renamed SED, expelled him in December.

In January 1990 he was arrested but eventually released on health concerns, without charges being filed. He died in April the same year in East Berlin.

==Family==

His stepson was the actor Peter Sindermann. His grandson is the handball player and fashion designer Eric Sindermann.

<doc id="434080" wikidata="Q2105775" url="?curid=434080" title="Positivist calendar">
<text>The positivist calendar was a calendar reform proposal by Auguste Comte in 1849. Revising the earlier work of Marco Mastrofini, or an even earlier proposal by &quot;Hirossa Ap-Iccim&quot; (Hugh Jones), Comte developed a solar calendar with 13 months of 28 days, and an additional festival day commemorating the dead, totalling 365 days.

This extra day added to the last month was outside the days of the week cycle, and so the first of a month was always a Monday. On leap years, an additional festival day (also outside the week cycle), to celebrate holy women, would join the memorial day of the dead. The scheme followed the Gregorian calendar rules for determining which years are leap years, and started on January 1. Year 1 &quot;of the Great Crisis&quot; (i.e. the French Revolution) was equivalent to 1789 in the standard Gregorian system.

Much like Comte&#x27;s other schemas, the positivist calendar never enjoyed widespread use.

== Months ==

The months were named, in chronological historical order, for great figures in Western European history in the fields of science, religion, philosophy, industry and literature. Each day of the year was named after neither Catholic Saints as in the Georgian calendar nor after Île-de-France agriculture as in the French Republican calendar but after figures in history in various fields. Weeks and days were also dedicated to great figures in history as a secular version of the concept of saint&#x27;s days. In all, the Positivist Calendar &quot;contains the names of 558 great men of all periods, classified according to their field of activity.&quot; Villains of history were also commemorated in order to be held up for &quot;perpetual execration&quot;. Napoleon, according to Comte, was especially deserving of this fate.

Months were named:
#Moses
#Homer
#Aristotle
#Archimedes
#Caesar
#Saint Paul
#Charlemagne
#Dante
#Gutenberg
#Shakespeare
#Descartes
#Frederick
#Bichat

== Criticism ==
In 1849, Comte wrote that he called his calendar a &quot;breach of continuity&quot; with the old way of thinking, and his Humanistic calendar was part of that breach. He called it, &quot;a provisional institution, destined for the present exceptional century to serve as an introduction to the abstract worship of Humanity.&quot;

Aside from the religious references the calendar carried, Duncan Steel, author of &quot;Marking Time,&quot; believes the novelty of the calendar&#x27;s month names alone helped prevent the wide acceptance of this proposal.

Author Tricia Lootens writes that the idea of naming days after literary figures, as if they were Catholic Saint days, didn&#x27;t catch on outside the Positivist movement.
== Advantages ==

The several advantages of the Positivist calendar are mainly related to its organization. The subdivision of the year is very regular and systematic: 
* Every year has exactly 52 weeks divided in 13 months.
* Each month has exactly 28 days divided in 4 weeks.
* Every day of the month falls on the same weekday in each month (i.e. the 17th always falls on a Wednesday).

The calendar is the same every year (perennial), unlike the annual Gregorian calendar, which differs from year to year. Hence, scheduling is easier for institutions and industries with extended production cycles. Movable holidays celebrated on the &quot;n&quot;th certain weekday of a month, such as U.S. Thanksgiving day, would be able to have a fixed date while keeping their traditional weekday.

Statistical comparisons by months are more accurate, since all months contain exactly the same number of business days and weekends, likewise for comparisons by 13-week quarters. Supporters of the Positivist calendar have argued that thirteen equal divisions of the year are superior to twelve unequal divisions in terms of monthly cash flow in the economy.

== Disadvantages ==

While each quarter would be equal in length (13 weeks), thirteen is a prime number, placing all activities currently done on a quarterly basis out of alignment with the months.

Christian, Islamic and Jewish leaders are historically opposed to the calendar, as their tradition of worshiping every seventh day would result in either the day of the week of worship changing from year to year, or eight days passing when &quot;The Festival of All the Dead” or “The Festival of Holy Women&quot; occurs. 

Birthdays, significant anniversaries, and other holidays would need to be recalculated as a result of a calendar reform, and would always be on the same day of the week. This could be problematic for Public holidays that would fall under non-working days under the new system; eg. If a public holiday is celebrated on January 8, under the Positivist calendar that holiday would always fall on a Sunday, Moses 8, which is already a non-working day, and compensatory leave would have to be given each year on Moses 9, thus essentially changing the date of the holiday to Moses 9. A vast amount of administrative data, and the software that manages that, would have to be corrected/adjusted for the new system, potentially having to support both the IFC and the standard local time keeping systems for a period of time.

<doc id="434081" wikidata="Q1506083" url="?curid=434081" title="Pogo stick">
<text>A pogo stick is a vehicle for jumping off the ground in a standing position—through the aid of a spring, or new high performance technologies—often used as a toy, exercise equipment or extreme sports instrument. It led to an extreme sport named extreme pogo or &quot;Xpogo&quot;.

It consists of a pole with a handle at the top and footrests near the bottom, and a spring located somewhere along the pole. The spring joins two sections of the pole, which extends below the footpads.

The jumper places their feet on the footpads while balancing on the pole, then jumps up or down with a bending action of the knees to add or subtract energy in the spring. When the spring is at full compression or extension, the jumper is lifted by the recoil of the spring, being launched several inches or feet into the air. This process is repeated to maintain a periodic bounce.

The pogo stick can be steered by shifting one&#x27;s weight off the centerline of the spring in the desired horizontal direction thus producing horizontal locomotion.

==Inventors==
A spring stilt utilizing compression springs on each foot was patented in 1881 by George H. Herrington of Wichita, Kansas, &quot;for leaping great distances and heights&quot;. This was an antecedent of the pogo stick as well as today&#x27;s spring stilts.

The modern eponymously named pogo stick was invented by Max Pohlig and Ernst Gottschall, from Germany. A German patent was registered in Hanover in March 1920 for a device they called a &quot;spring end hopping stilt&quot;. It is thought that the beginning two letters in these men&#x27;s last names is where the word &quot;pogo&quot; comes from.

The two-handle pogo stick design was patented by George B. Hansburg in 1957. Hansburg described the origins of the Pogo name colloquially in a story of a young Burmese girl with the aforementioned name whose father had created a crude version of the device so that the daughter could travel to the local temple for prayers. An earlier design with a single upright vertical handle patented in 1955 posed something of a risk to the user&#x27;s chin. Later improvements to the pogo stick have been made, including the Vurtego, Flybar, and the BowGo, which allow operators to jump much higher than with a simple coil spring pogo stick. Back flips and other tricks are now possible on some of these newer sticks, which has contributed to the growth of the new sport of Extreme Pogo (&quot;Xpogo&quot;).

Whatever improvements or different types are made, the basic design idea of a person riding on a spring remains the same.

==Popularity and records==
There have been shows performed with pogo sticks, marriages performed on them, jumping contests held, and world records set and reset numerous times. The record for continuous pogoing currently stands at 20 hours and 13 minutes with 206,864 bounces, set by James Roumeliotis.

In 2012, the pogo stick was gaining in popularity through the invention of extreme pogo sticks and the emerging sport of Xpogo.

==Xpogo==

Extreme Pogo, or Xpogo, is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks on extreme pogo sticks, defined as such by their durability and potential for height. Today&#x27;s Xpogo sticks have the potential for over 10 ft (3 m) of height (measured from the ground to the bottom of the tip). Extreme pogo is a relatively new extreme sport and is currently emerging into popular culture as evidenced by the growing number of Xpogo athletes around the globe, growing sales from extreme pogo companies, the popularity of Xpogo athlete exhibition teams, positive feedback and continued interest in Xpogo content on sites such as YouTube, and the expanding scope of the annual World Championships of Xpogo, Pogopalooza.

<doc id="434089" wikidata="Q555687" url="?curid=434089" title="The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance">
<text>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance () is a 1962 American Western film directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and James Stewart. The screenplay by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck was adapted from a 1953 short story written by Dorothy M. Johnson. The supporting cast features Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Woody Strode, Strother Martin, and Lee Van Cleef.

In 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Near the turn of the 20th century, U.S. Senator Ransom &quot;Ranse&quot; Stoddard and his wife Hallie arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed Western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon. When asked by the local newspaper reporter why a senator would attend the funeral of a poor rancher, Stoddard answers with a story that flashes back 25 years.

Entering the then-unincorporated territory as a young lawyer, Ranse is beaten and robbed by infamous outlaw Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon and his handyman, Pompey, find Ranse and take him to Shinbone, where Tom&#x27;s girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance frequently terrorizes Shinbone and the surrounding country since the local marshal, Link Appleyard, is too cowardly to stop him. Tom says Valance only understands force, but Ranse is determined to bring Valance to justice through the law.

While establishing his practice, Ranse buses tables at Peter Ericson&#x27;s steakhouse, where Hallie works, and befriends Dutton Peabody, the editor of the &quot;Shinbone Star&quot; newspaper. After learning Hallie is illiterate, Ranse opens a school for children and adults in the back of the newspaper&#x27;s office. He also begins practicing with Peabody&#x27;s old gun after Valance bullies him in the restaurant. Hallie tells Tom of Ranse&#x27;s gun practice. Tom takes Ranse to his ranch for a shooting lesson, shows off renovations that are intended for his planned marriage to Hallie, and makes those intentions clear to Ranse. During the lesson, he tricks Ranse by shooting a paint can above his head and staining his clothes, telling Ranse he can expect the same kind of trickery from Valance. Ranse angrily punches Tom and leaves.

Shinbone&#x27;s men meet to elect two delegates to the upcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital. Tom refuses Ranse&#x27;s nomination; ultimately, Ranse and Peabody are elected. Valance, hired by the cattle barons who oppose statehood, fails to intimidate the voters into selecting him. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines.

That evening, Valance and his gang vandalize the newspaper office and severely injure Peabody for reporting Valance&#x27;s murder of a local farmer. Ranse arms himself and goes after Valance; even drunk, Valance easily wounds and disarms Ranse, then prepares to kill him. Ranse retrieves his gun and shoots, and Valance falls dead. Ranse returns to Ericson&#x27;s, where Hallie treats his wounded arm; Tom enters and sees Hallie&#x27;s affection for Ranse as she attends his wounds. He gets drunk and forces Appleyard to run Valance&#x27;s men out of town. Tom then sets fire to his house, but Pompey leads him out of it.

At the territorial convention, Ranse is nominated for delegate to Congress, but withdraws after a representative of the cattle barons accuses him of building a career from murdering a man. Tom arrives and explains to Ranse that it was he who killed Valance; knowing that Ranse could not beat Valance, Tom shot him with Pompey&#x27;s rifle at the same time Ranse fired. Tom encourages Ranse to accept the nomination for Hallie&#x27;s sake before quietly walking out of the convention.

In the present, Ranse&#x27;s rising political achievements – state governor, senator, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and likely vice-presidential nominee in the upcoming election – fill the intervening years. The newspaper editor decides publishing the story would ruin Ranse&#x27;s legacy, burns the reporter&#x27;s notes, and leaves Ranse to conduct Tom&#x27;s funeral. When Ranse asks why, the editor says, &quot;when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&quot;

On the return trip to Washington, DC, Ranse contemplates retiring to Shinbone, which pleases Hallie. Hallie admits placing a cactus rose on Tom&#x27;s coffin, a plant Tom knew Hallie liked. As Ranse thanks the train conductor for the railroad&#x27;s courtesies, the conductor answers, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!&quot;

==Production==
In contrast to prior John Ford Westerns, such as &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) and &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949), &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; was shot in black-and-white on Paramount&#x27;s soundstages. Many stories and speculations exist to explain this decision. Ford preferred that medium over color: &quot;In black and white, you&#x27;ve got to be very careful. You&#x27;ve got to know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is,&quot; he said. &quot;You might say I&#x27;m old fashioned, but black and white is real photography.&quot; Ford also reportedly argued that the climactic shoot-out between Valance and Stoddard would not have worked in color.

Others have interpreted the absence of the magnificent outdoor vistas so prevalent in earlier Ford Westerns as &quot;a fundamental reimagining [by Ford] of his mythic West&quot; – a grittier, less romantic, more realistic portrayal of frontier life. Wayne and Stewart, two of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest stars working together for the first time, were considerably older (54 and 53, respectively) than the characters they were playing. Filming in black and white helped ease the suspension of disbelief necessary to accept that disparity. According to cinematographer William H. Clothier, however, &quot;There was one reason and one reason only ... Paramount was cutting costs. Otherwise we would have been in Monument Valley or Brackettville and we would have had color stock. Ford had to accept those terms or not make the film.&quot;

Another condition imposed by the studio, according to Van Cleef, was that Wayne be cast as Doniphon. Ford resented the studio&#x27;s intrusion and retaliated by taunting Wayne relentlessly throughout the filming. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want Duke [Wayne] to think he was doing &quot;him&quot; any favors,&quot; Van Cleef said. Strode recounted that Ford &quot;kept needling Duke about his failure to make it as a football player&quot;, comparing him to Strode (a former NFL running back), whom he pronounced &quot;a real football player&quot;. (Wayne&#x27;s football career at USC had been curtailed by injuries.) He also ridiculed Wayne for failing to enlist during World War II, during which Ford filmed a series of widely praised combat documentaries for the Office of Strategic Services and was wounded at the Battle of Midway, and Stewart served with distinction as a bomber pilot and commanded a bomber group. &quot;How rich did you get while Jimmy was risking his life?&quot; he demanded. Wayne&#x27;s avoidance of wartime service was a major source of guilt for him in his later years.

Stewart related that midway through filming, Wayne asked him why he, Stewart, never seemed to be the target of Ford&#x27;s venomous remarks. Other cast and crew members also noticed Stewart&#x27;s apparent immunity from Ford&#x27;s abuse. Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strode&#x27;s costume for the film&#x27;s beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, &quot;It looks a bit Uncle Remussy to me.&quot; Ford responded, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with Uncle Remus?&quot; He called for the crew&#x27;s attention and announced, &quot;One of our &quot;players&quot; doesn&#x27;t like Woody&#x27;s costume. Now, I don&#x27;t know if Mr. Stewart has a prejudice against Negroes, but I just wanted you all to know about it.&quot; Stewart said he &quot;wanted to crawl into a mouse hole&quot;, but Wayne told him, &quot;Well, welcome to the club. I&#x27;m glad you made it.&quot;

Ford&#x27;s behavior &quot;really pissed Wayne off,&quot; Strode said, &quot;but he would never take it out on Ford,&quot; the man largely responsible for his rise to stardom. &quot;He ended up taking it out on me.&quot; While filming an exterior shot on a horse-drawn cart, Wayne almost lost control of the horses and knocked Strode away when he attempted to help. When the horses did stop, Wayne tried to pick a fight with the younger and fitter Strode. Ford called out, &quot;Don&#x27;t hit him, Woody, we need him.&quot; Wayne later told Strode, &quot;We gotta work together. We both gotta be professionals.&quot; Strode blamed Ford for nearly all the friction on the set. &quot;What a miserable film to make,&quot; he added.

Stewart received top billing over Wayne on promotional posters and in the trailers, but in the film itself, Wayne&#x27;s screen card appears first and slightly higher on a sign post. The studio also specified that Wayne&#x27;s name appear before Stewart&#x27;s on theatre marquees, reportedly at Ford&#x27;s request. &quot;Wayne actually played the lead,&quot; Ford said, to Peter Bogdanovich. &quot;Jimmy Stewart had most of the sides [sequences with dialogue], but Wayne was the central character, the motivation for the whole thing.&quot;

Parts of the film were shot in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s music score was composed by Cyril J. Mockridge, but in scenes involving Hallie&#x27;s relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, Ford reprised Alfred Newman&#x27;s &quot;Ann Rutledge Theme&quot;, from &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot;. He told Bogdanovich that he used the theme in both films to evoke repressed desire and lost love. Film scholar Kathryn Kalinak notes that Ann Rutledge&#x27;s theme &quot;encodes longing&quot; and &quot;fleshes out the failed love affair between Hallie and Tom Doniphon, the growing love between Hallie and Ranse Stoddard, and the traumatic loss experienced by Hallie over her choice of one over the other, none of which is clearly articulated by dialogue.&quot; Portions of the song &quot;There&#x27;ll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&quot; are played in scenes by bar musicians and a marching band.

Mockridge&#x27;s main theme that opens the picture can also be heard, in a somewhat different form, in a trailer for &quot;River of No Return&quot; with Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe released in 1953.

The Burt Bacharach-Hal David song &quot;(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance&quot; became a top-10 hit for Gene Pitney. Though based upon the movie&#x27;s plotline, it was not used in the film. Pitney said in an interview that he was in the studio about to record the song when &quot;... Bacharach informed us that the film just came out.&quot; It seems unlikely that the song would be used for the opening credits, since its lyrics give the film&#x27;s surprise ending away. The picture was released April 18, 1962, and the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 the week ending April 28, 1962, peaking at number four in June. Jimmie Rodgers also recorded the song, in the Gene Pitney style. James Taylor covered it on his 1985 album &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;, as did The Royal Guardsmen on their 1967 album &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;. It was also covered by Australian rock band Regurgitator on its 1998 David/Bacharach tribute album &quot;To Hal and Bacharach&quot;. In 2010, the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the top 100 Western songs of all time.

==Reception==
&quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; was released in April 1962, and achieved both financial and critical success. Produced for $US3.2 million, it grossed $8 million, making it the 15th-highest grossing film of 1962. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;, the film was considered a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1962.

Edith Head&#x27;s costumes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design (black-and-white), one of the few Westerns ever nominated in that category.

Contemporary reviews were generally positive, although a number of critics thought the final act was a letdown. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;entertaining and emotionally involving,&quot; but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, &quot;it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,&quot; instead of concluding with &quot;condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes. What should have been left to enthrall the imagination is spelled out until there is nothing left to savor or discuss.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; agreed, lamenting that the &quot;final anticlimactic 20 minutes ... all but destroy the value of the disarming simplicity and natural warmth which are Ford&#x27;s everlasting stock-in-trade.&quot; Despite this, the review maintained that the film &quot;has more than enough gusto to see it through,&quot; and that Ford had &quot;lost none of his talent for catching the real heart, humor, and violent flavor of the Old West in spite of the notable rustiness of his technique.&quot; A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here,&quot; but opined that the film &quot;bogs down&quot; once Stoddard becomes famous, en route to &quot;an obvious, overlong, and garrulous anticlimax.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a leisurely yarn boasting fine performances,&quot; but was bothered by &quot;the incredulous fact that the lively townsfolk of Shinbone didn&#x27;t polish off Valence [sic] for themselves. On TV, he would have been dispatched by the second commercial, and the villainy would have passed to some shadowy employer, some ruthless rancher who didn&#x27;t want statehood.&quot; John L. Scott of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Director Ford is guilty of a few lengthy, slow periods in his story-telling, but for the most part the old, reliable Ford touches are there.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; gave the film a grade of &quot;Very Good&quot;, but Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative and called it &quot;a parody of Mr. Ford&#x27;s best work.&quot;
More recent assessments have been more uniformly positive. The film is considered one of Ford&#x27;s best, and in one poll, ranked with &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;The Shootist&quot; as one of Wayne&#x27;s best Westerns. Roger Ebert wrote that each of the 10 Ford/Wayne westerns is &quot;... complete and self-contained in a way that approaches perfection&quot;, and singled out &quot;Liberty Valance&quot; as &quot;the most pensive and thoughtful&quot; of the group. Jack Hawkins of &quot;Slash Film&quot; named &quot;Liberty Valance&quot; the best feature of John Wayne&#x27;s career, praising the film&#x27;s meditations on violence, the state and the individual. 

Director Sergio Leone (&quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;) listed Ford as a major influence on his work, and &quot;Liberty Valance&quot; as his favorite Ford film. &quot;It was the only film,&quot; he said, &quot;where [Ford] learned about something called pessimism.&quot; In a retrospective analysis, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Liberty Valance&quot; &quot;...one of the great Western classics,&quot; because &quot;it questions the role of myth in forging the legends of the West, while setting this theme in the elegiac atmosphere of the West itself, set off by the aging Stewart and Wayne.&quot; 

&quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Richard Brody described it as &quot;the greatest American political movie&quot;, because of its depictions of a free press, town meetings, statehood debates, and the &quot;civilizing influence&quot; of education in frontier America. According to scholar Victor Bruno, the film uses the symbolism of the wilderness and the garden to represent the roles of the cowboy Doniphon and the civilized Stoddard. Bruno points out that after allowing Stoddard to receive the credit for Valance&#x27;s death, Doniphon &quot;sets fire to his own house, bringing about a process akin to &quot;ekpyrosis&quot; that razes his existence to the ground. To the day of his death, Doniphon becomes an ossified man — literally a fossil of a being that lived in a previous era.&quot; However, contrary to most opinions about the film, Bruno believes that &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; is Ford&#x27;s indictment of America&#x27;s increasingly &quot;antimythological&quot; character. &quot;It is not a wonder that Ford begins his &#x27;Age of Mortality&#x27; with such a bleak picture. When the mystical storyteller starts to face death, he must highlight the imperfections of his environment, which is truly himself, so he can face death free of sins.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<text>Addis Ababa University (; AAU) is a national university located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is the oldest university in Ethiopia. AAU has thirteen campuses. Twelve of these are situated in Addis Ababa, and one is located in Bishoftu, about away. AAU has several associated research institutions including the Institute of Ethiopian Studies. The Ministry of Education admits qualified students to AAU based on their score on the Ethiopian University Entrance Examination (EUEE).

==History==

The origins of AAU was a two-year college on 20 March 1950 by the Jesuit Lucien Matte, at the appeal of &quot;His Majesty Emperor&quot; Haile Selassie I. It began operations the following year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the University of London, and University of Oxford was developed. Africans from various parts of the continent would receive free scholarships through programs subsidized by the Organisation of African Unity for higher learning. AAU was also known for sending its students abroad for an extended interpersonal educational experience, and having those students return with the exemplary standards of the international community.

The nucleus of AAU was formed with the establishment of the University College of Addis Ababa (UCAA) in 1950. UCAA, which initially consisted of the Faculties of Arts and Science, became a fully fledged college when it was chartered in 1954. In 1955, the Building College was opened. In February 1961, these various colleges and the Theological College were brought together to form the Haile Selassie University. &quot;Emperor&quot; Haile Selassie I gave his Guenete Leul Palace to serve as the administration building and main campus. He had abandoned the palace, where a number of his ministers and favorites were killed in the wake of the abortive Coup d&#x27;état in 1960, in favor of the new Jubilee Palace. Following the 1974 revolution, the university was briefly renamed University of Ethiopia (National University) before it came to assume its present designation, AAU, in 1975. In the wake of the revolution, AAU was closed for two years and students and staff were drafted into what was known as the Development through Cooperation Campaign (&quot;zemecha&quot;), designed to arise the awareness of the rural population in the spirit of the revolution. The university offered its first Master&#x27;s programs in 1979 and its first PhD programs in 1987.

=== Administration ===

Until 1974 the charter provided for a governance structure in the following descending order or authority: Chancellor (the Emperor himself); the Board of Governors, composed of ministers and members of the royal family; and the Faculty Council, made up of the university officers, deans, directors and elected members. The Faculty later became the Senate. In 1977, Duri Mohammed was appointed president of AAU, under his leadership the academy was preserved and even saw its resurgence despite the turbulent times amid the Ethiopian inserruction. The AAU also lost its relative autonomy when it was brought under the Commission for Higher Education, which came to exercise administrative jurisdiction over all institutions of higher learning. In 1993, AAU was placed under the Ministry of Education by a government proclamation. The incoming transitional government appointed Duri Mohammed as president once again, a purging of 42 staff members which included Asrat Woldeyes and former president Alemayehu Teferra ensued.

==Influence==

Over and above their academic pursuits, AAU students have been actively engaged in community service (such as conducting literacy programs) and political struggle, particularly in the years before the 1974 revolution. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students were required to do a year of national service under the Ethiopia University Service program. University teachers and students were instrumental in exposing the hidden 1973 famine and launching the first famine relief program. The Ethiopian Student Movement, of which the university was the birthplace and main venue, played a pivotal role in bringing about the revolution. Almost all leaders of the political organizations that were active in the revolutionary years or are in power now had their political formation inside the university. In 2013/2014, there were 33,940 undergraduate students, 13,000 graduate students, and 1,733 PhD students, making a total student body of 48,673.

<text>The Pudding River is a tributary of the Molalla River in the U.S. state of Oregon. Its drainage basin covers . Among its tributaries are Silver Creek, Butte Creek, Abiqua Creek, and the Little Pudding River.

Historically, the Pudding River flowed directly into the Willamette River, and aerial photos dating back to 1936 provide evidence of the Willamette River&#x27;s confluence with the Pudding River mainstem channel. Currently, it flows directly into the Molalla River near River Mile 1 before joining the Willamette River. Anadromous and resident salmonids use the Lower Pudding River main stem and key tributaries that support the basin&#x27;s ecosystems.

==Geology==
About 24 million years ago at the end of the Oligocene, Oregon had started to look how it is today and the Willamette Bay finally became the Willamette Valley by drying up and being raised above sea level, after assuming a shape much like today&#x27;s Puget Sound.

==Course==
The Pudding River Basin&#x27;s complex of headwater creeks originates from the western edge of the Cascade Mountains along a snowpack-limited ridgeline (i.e. no glaciers are present) that forms a critical linkage from the Mount Hood National Forest and Table Rock Wilderness to Silver Falls State Park and the rolling Waldo Hills east of Salem. Peak ridgeline elevations vary from . After emerging from the Cascade Mountain foothills of the Panther Rock Ridge and its unique forested upper-elevation wetlands and lakes, the key tributaries of the watershed like ecologically-important Butte Creek converge near Woodburn into the meandering Pudding River. Passing through and within the Pudding River Valley, the numerous subwatersheds of the Pudding Basin represent a vital part of fertile agricultural lands of the Lower Willamette Valley sub-basin. Two forks of the Pudding join between the cities of Silverton and Mt. Angel, at , as the river continues its course northward where it receives Abiqua Creek from the right at about northwest of Silverton. North of Mt. Angel, Butte Creek, which comes down from the Cascade Range foothills past Scotts Mills, empties into the Pudding River at . The river continues northward past the town of Aurora. For most of its course, Butte Creek and the Lower Pudding River mainstem defines the boundary between Marion and Clackamas Counties.

The Pudding River flows into the Molalla River, at , just before the Molalla joins the Willamette River in a floodplain that is part of the Molalla River State Park.

==Fishing==
The upper river offers catch-and-release fishing for wild trout, while the lower river has bass and panfish. Although the Pudding River is not stocked with hatchery fish, coastal cutthroat trout and rainbow trout enter the upper main stem from Drift, Butte, Silver, and Abiqua creeks. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures and is not allowed for winter-run steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout) that spawn in the tributaries. The extreme lower reaches of the river are navigable by boat when the stream flow is sufficient, sometimes as late as June.

<doc id="434103" wikidata="Q1350087" url="?curid=434103" title="Experiential knowledge">
<text>Experiential knowledge is knowledge gained through experience, as opposed to a priori (before experience) knowledge: it can also be contrasted both with propositional (textbook) knowledge, and with practical knowledge.

Experiential knowledge is cognate to Michael Polanyi&#x27;s personal knowledge, as well as to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s contrast of Knowledge by Acquaintance and by Description.

==A posteriori ==
In the philosophy of mind, the phrase often refers to knowledge that can &quot;only&quot; be acquired through experience, such as, for example, the knowledge of what it is like to see colours, which could not be explained to someone born blind: the necessity of experiential knowledge becomes clear if one was asked to explain to a blind person a colour like blue.

The question of a posteriori knowledge might be formulated as: can Adam or Eve know what water feels like on their skin prior to touching it for the first time?

==Religion==
Zen emphasises the importance of the experiential element in religious experience, as opposed to what it sees as the trap of conceptualization: as D. T. Suzuki put it, &quot;fire. Mere talking of it will not make the mouth burn&quot;.

Experiential knowledge has also been used in the philosophy of religion as an argument against God&#x27;s omniscience, questioning whether God could genuinely know everything, since he (supposedly) cannot know what it is like to sin. Commenting on the distinction between experiential knowledge and propositional knowledge, analytic philosopher and theologian William Lane Craig has stated in an interview with Robert Lawrence Kuhn for the PBS series &quot;Closer to Truth&quot; that because experiential knowledge is appropriate to the mind which does the knowing, in order for omniscience to be a cognitive perfection God&#x27;s omniscience must entail God know only and all propositional truths and have only appropriate experiential knowledge.

==Ecology==
Writer Barry Lopez writes about experiential knowledge and how it relates back to the environment, arguing that without experiencing nature, one cannot fully &quot;know&quot; and understand the relationships within ecosystems.

==Therapy==
Carl Rogers stressed the importance of experiential knowledge both for the therapist formulating his or her theories, and for the client in therapy – both things with which most counsellors would agree.

As defined by Thomasina Borkman (Emeritus Professor of Sociology, George Mason University) experiential knowledge is the cornerstone of therapy in self-help groups, as opposed to both lay (general) and professional knowledge. Sharing in such groups is the narration of significant life experiences in a process through which the knowledge derived thereof is validated by the group and transformed into a corpus that becomes their fundamental resource and product.

Neville Symington has argued that one of the central features of the narcissist is a shying away from experiential knowledge, in favour of adopting wholesale a ready-made way of living drawn from other people&#x27;s experience.

==Culture==
Helen Vendler has characterised Seamus Heaney&#x27;s art as, in one respect, recording an experiential learning curve: &quot;we are earthworms of the earth, and all that / has gone through us is what will be our trace&quot;.

<text>Montolieu (; ) is a commune in the Aude department of southern France.

==Village of books==
Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Village of Books&quot;, Montolieu contains fifteen bookshops, mostly specializing in secondhand and antique books. Many artists also live and work in Montolieu, with five workshops and galleries of painters and sculptors and three photographers&#x27; studios. The commune also contains a cactus garden, the Cactuseraie d&#x27;Escaïre-Figue. In 1990, Michel Braibant, a bookbinder in Carcassonne, came up with the idea of a Village of Books in Montolieu, inspired by the Welsh Hay-on-Wye. He created the association &quot;Montolieu Village du Livre&quot; and founded the &quot;Musée des Arts &amp; Métiers du Livre&quot; (&quot;museum of book arts &amp; crafts).

<text>Free writing is traditionally regarded as a prewriting technique practiced in academic environments, in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time with limited concern for rhetoric, conventions, and mechanics, sometimes working from a specific prompt provided by a teacher. While free writing often produces raw, or even unusable material, it can help writers overcome writing blocks and build confidence by allowing them to practice text-production phases of the writing process without the fear of censure. Some writers even use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing.

Unlike brainstorming, where ideas are listed or organized, a free-written paragraph is comparatively formless or unstructured.

==History==
Dorothea Brande was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book &quot;Becoming a Writer&quot; (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 15 minutes every morning, as fast as they can. She argues that doing so for just 15 minutes helps writers to avoid having the feeling of commitment. Instead of believing that writing can become dull, writers can compromise for as little as 15 minutes to liberate ideas and put them on paper. She also argued that this practice would help authors to not fear blank pages when they start to write.

Peter Elbow advanced freewriting in his book &quot;Writing Without Teachers&quot; (1973). He pointed out the importance of writing as a liberating activity. Mentioning that when “freewriting” the author can break any restrictions they may have when writing. He pointed out that when writing in regular basics one is extremely focused on the mistakes and avoids certain words or ideas for fear. Instead, freewriting promotes writers to produce ideas more quickly because they forget to edit as they write.

The idea of freewriting has been popularized by Julia Cameron through her book &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Way&quot; (1992). She presents the method of “morning pages” which demands that the author write three pages every morning to get ideas out. She saw this as a helpful technique to combat the blockages that writers may have.

==Technique==
The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often from five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes with no regards to spelling or grammar, and makes no corrections. If the writer reaches a point where they can&#x27;t think of anything to write, it is presumed that they will continue to write about whichever ideas come to their mind. The writer is free to stray off topic and let thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also perform a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.

Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer&#x27;s daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.

The writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Free blogging combines blogging with free writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.

The free writing technique emphasizes spontaneous, continuous expression, aiming to liberate thoughts and overcome writer&#x27;s block, without concern for grammar or structure. This is different from David Bartholomae&#x27;s approach to writing that emphasizes teaching students to engage critically with academic texts and discussions. This structured method focuses on helping students develop their ability to write well-argued and coherent academic papers, encouraging them to connect their work with existing scholarly literature.

== Evolution of free blogging ==
Free writing has evolved as online platforms and mediums have opened up. With sites like Tumblr in 2007 and Twitter in 2006, online traffic increased. While Tumblr usership has decreased, Twitter maintains one of the largest bases of users actively writing.

==Rationale==
Free writing is based on a presumption that, while everyone has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, Peter Elbow, and Natalie Goldberg.

Free writing is about loosening the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer.

==Use in education==
Often free writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching elementary school children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique, often referred as Natalie Goldberg&#x27;s first four rules of writing:
*The writer gives themselves a time limit, writing for one to twenty minutes and then stopping.
*The writer should keep their hands moving until the time is up. They should not pause to stare into space or to read what they have written. They should write quickly but not in a hurry.
*The writer should pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what they have produced here. The correctness and quality of what is written does not matter; the act of writing does.
*If the writer gets off the topic or runs out of ideas, they should keep writing anyway. If necessary, they can write nonsense or whatever comes into their head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving.
*If the writer feels bored or uncomfortable as they are writing, they should ask themselves what is bothering them and write about that.
*When the time is up, the writer should look over what they have written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free writing session.

Goldberg&#x27;s rules appear to be based on those developed by Jack Kerouac, whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 &quot;rules&quot; in his &quot;Belief &amp; Technique for Modern Prose&quot;. While Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot; are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg&#x27;s for those who have practiced prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose, and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative stream of consciousness. Kerouac himself cites the &quot;trance writing&quot; of William Butler Yeats as a precursor of his own practice.

Goldberg&#x27;s rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.

== Integration of problem-solving strategies into free writing ==
The concept of writing as a problem-solving process, as explored by Linda S. Flower and John R. Hayes, provides a framework for understanding free writing beyond its traditional context. This perspective suggests that free writing can serve as a foundational step in a multifaceted cognitive process that includes critical thinking and strategic planning. By incorporating problem-solving heuristics, writers can use free writing not only to generate raw material but also to transition those ideas into organized, coherent thoughts with clear objectives. This approach positions free writing as a dynamic and non-linear activity, offering strategies for writers to refine their content, tackle common writing challenges, and enhance their overall composition skills. Free writing is considered a technique within the iterative development process, valued for its potential to encourage creativity, enable personal expression, and contribute to the development of structured texts. This perspective expands the conventional understanding of free writing in educational and personal settings, suggesting a multifaceted role in writing practices.

Peter Elbow also emphasizes free writing as a crucial tool for facilitating both creative and critical thinking, highlighting its role in the writing process. Elbow&#x27;s distinction between &#x27;first-order&#x27; and &#x27;second-order&#x27; thinking in writing showcases free writing as a tool that initially facilitates raw idea generation (first-order thinking) before refinement and analysis (second-order thinking).

There are several mental processes integral to writing, like goal setting, planning, and problem-solving. Free writing fits into this framework as a problem-solving technique by facilitating these processes in an unrestricted environment. This approach enables writers to explore ideas freely, potentially enhancing their ability to tackle writing challenges by tapping into their cognitive resources without the constraints typically associated with more structured writing tasks.

== Criticism ==
The effectiveness of free writing remains a disputed topic within the field of writing studies. Charles Piltch expressed concerns that the lack of time for preparation before writing may produce work that is not suitable for academic settings. Furthermore, Piltch notes that students who practice free writing are more reluctant to revise or edit their work and often produce insincere writing. Raymond Rodrigues argues that free writing minimizes the role of skilled instruction in writing studies and wrongfully equates fluid writing to good writing. The research presented in George Hillock&#x27;s &quot;Research on Writing Composition&quot; states that although free writing is superior to emphasizing grammar and mechanics, using writing models with qualitative criteria produces the best writing.

David Bartholomae also criticizes free writing for its emphasis on personal voice at the expense of engaging with the broader academic discourse. He argues that this focus can prevent students from adequately preparing for the complexities of academic writing, which demands critical engagement with tradition, power, and authority. Bartholomae suggests that by prioritizing personal expression, free writing might limit students&#x27; ability to participate in academic conversations meaningfully. 

== Personal Free Writes ==
Personal free writing is the practice of writing what one is thinking without considering organization or grammatical errors. In a study done by Fred McKinney, free writing was defined as letting one’s thoughts and words flow onto paper without hesitation. This can be done in the format of letters or even a personal notebook. Previous research suggests that personal free writing about emotional or traumatic events can lead to improvement in physical and emotional health. Studies done by James Pennebaker suggest privately free writing about emotions and past events for a few minutes every day may be beneficial to those that are healing from trauma or emotional disturbances. Past research implies free writing about emotional events may even be an effective form of therapy. Researchers even suggest that personal free writing in students is correlated to improvements in working memory.

Donald M. Murray positions free writing as a critical discovery tool within the writing process. Free writing plays a key role in this exploratory process of using language to uncover and articulate the meaning within one&#x27;s experiences. It facilitates a dynamic interaction between the writer and their language, enabling them to experiment, reflect, and ultimately refine their ideas into coherent messages. Through free writing, writers can navigate the complexities of their thoughts, leading to clearer understanding and effective communication in all aspects of writing.

<doc id="434114" wikidata="Q2306671" url="?curid=434114" title="Orion-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Orion&quot;-class battleships were a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy (RN) in the early 1910s. The first battleships built for the RN, they were much larger than the preceding British dreadnoughts and were sometimes termed &quot;super-dreadnoughts&quot;. The sister ships spent most of their careers assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home and Grand Fleets, sometimes serving as flagships. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, their service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.

The &quot;Orion&quot;s were deemed obsolete by the end of the war in 1918 and were reduced to reserve the following year. and were sold for scrap in 1922 while was hulked for use as a stationary training ship. In late 1923, she was converted into a target ship and was sunk in early 1925. served the longest, acting as a training ship from 1921 until she, too, was sold for scrap in late 1926. While being towed to the scrapyard, the ship ran aground; &quot;Thunderer&quot; was refloated and subsequently broken up.

==Background and design==
The initial 1909–1910 Naval Programme included two dreadnoughts and a battlecruiser, but was later increased to six dreadnoughts and two battlecruisers as a result of public pressure on the government due to the Anglo-German naval arms race. The original pair of battleships became the and were improved versions of the preceding battleship, . A third dreadnought was added to the programme around April 1909 that was to be armed with more powerful weapons than the guns used in the earlier dreadnoughts. Three more ships of this class, as well as another battlecruiser, were part of the contingency programme authorized in August.
Unlike all of the previous dreadnoughts, which had been incremental improvements of the original design of 1906, constrained by cost and size limits, the &quot;Orion&quot; class were almost a &quot;clean-slate&quot; design driven by the need to accommodate the larger guns and additional armour. The guns were positioned all on the centreline of the hull in superfiring gun turrets, an arrangement first used in HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; for the aft main turrets. The idea had been pioneered by the United States Navy in their , but the RN was slow to adopt the concept, concerned about the effects of muzzle blast on the gunlayers in the open sighting hoods in the roofs of the lower turrets.

One of the few things retained from earlier ships was the position of the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: &quot;It is amazing that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)&#x27;s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe&#x27;s obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships.&quot;

==Description==

The &quot;Orion&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , a normal draught of and a deep draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 738 officers and ratings upon completion and 1,107 in 1917.

The ships retained the three engine-room layout of the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class design. They were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines in the outer engine rooms and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines in the centre engine room which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam provided by 18 water-tube boilers. They were rated at and were intended to give the battleships a maximum speed of . During their sea trials, the &quot;Orion&quot;s exceeded their designed speed and horsepower. They carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament===
These ships were the first to carry the new breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch Mark V gun. This gun was developed as the RN believed that the preceding 12-inch Mark XI gun could not be further developed and that a new gun of an increased bore was needed to deal with the longer ranges at which combat was expected to occur and the need for greater penetration and destructive effect. The Mark V gun had a muzzle velocity about lower than the Mark XI gun, which greatly reduced the wear in the barrel. Despite the reduction in velocity, the gun&#x27;s range was about greater because the much heavier 13.5-inch shell retained its velocity longer than the lighter and smaller 12-inch shell.
The &quot;Orion&quot; class was equipped with ten 45-calibre Mark V guns in five hydraulically powered, centreline, twin-gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20° which gave them a range of . Their gunsights, however, were limited to +15° until super-elevating prisms were installed by 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles, some more than those of the 12-inch Mark XI, at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried 80–100 shells per gun.

Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns. Four of these guns were in exposed mounts on the shelter deck and the remaining guns were enclosed in unshielded single mounts in the superstructure. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 20 torpedoes were provided.

===Fire control===

The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting tops at the head of the fore and mainmasts. Data from a Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder, located at each control position, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the transmitting station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, transmitting stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination. As a backup, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.

 was the second British dreadnought to be built with a gunnery director, albeit a prototype. This was mounted on the foremast, underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are uncertain, all four ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.

Additional nine-foot rangefinders, protected by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914. Furthermore, the ships were fitted with Mark II or III Dreyer Fire-control Tables, in early 1914, in each transmission station. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.

===Armour===

The &quot;Orion&quot; class had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was 12 inches thick between the fore and rear barbettes that was reduced to outside the central armoured citadel, but did not reach the bow or stern. The belt covered the side of the hull from the middle deck to below where the waterline and thinned to at its bottom edge. Above this was a strake of 8-inch armour. The forward oblique bulkheads connected the waterline and upper armour belts to the &#x27;A&#x27; barbette. Similarly the aft bulkhead connected the armour belts to &#x27;Y&#x27; barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The exposed faces of the barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck that thinned to below it. The gun turrets had faces and 8-inch sides with 3-inch roofs.

The four armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the roof was 3 inches thick. The spotting tower behind and above the conning tower had 6-inch sides and the torpedo-control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. Like the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships, the &quot;Orion&quot;s eliminated the anti-torpedo bulkheads that protected the engine and boiler rooms, reverting to the scheme in the older dreadnoughts that placed them only outboard of the magazines with thicknesses ranging from . The boiler uptakes were protected by armour plates.

===Modifications===
 received a small rangefinder on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret in 1914; the other ships may also have had one installed. That same year the shelter-deck guns of the sisters were enclosed in casemates. By October 1914, a pair of QF anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed aboard each ship. Additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, three or four 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. By April 1917, the ships had exchanged a 4-inch AA gun for one of the 3-inch guns. One or two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard each ship during 1917–1918; these were mounted on turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. had them on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets, &quot;Conqueror&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot; on &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets and had one on &#x27;B&#x27;. A high-angle rangefinder was fitted in the forward superstructure by 1921. &quot;Thunderer&quot; had her secondary armament reduced to eight guns during her February–May 1921 conversion into a training ship.

==Careers==

Upon commissioning, all four sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet or, as it was redesignated on 1 May 1912, the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS). &quot;Orion&quot; became the flagship of the division&#x27;s second-in-command, retaining that position until March 1919. &quot;Monarch&quot;, &quot;Thunderer&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot; participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres with Vice-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg commanding the &quot;Blue Fleet&quot; aboard &quot;Thunderer&quot;. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincaré, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. During the annual manoeuvres in August, &quot;Thunderer&quot; was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the &quot;Red Fleet&quot;.

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, the &quot;Orion&quot;s took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans&#x27; reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie.

=== Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ===

Room 40, the Signals intelligence organisation at the Admiralty, had decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group (&quot;Konteradmiral&quot; [Rear-Admiral] Franz von Hipper). The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. The British mustered the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd BS (Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender), including &quot;Orion&quot; and her sister ships, &quot;Monarch&quot; and &quot;Conqueror&quot; and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty).

The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn. Incompetent communications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper to avoid an engagement with the battlecruisers. On 27 December, &quot;Conqueror&quot; accidentally rammed &quot;Monarch&quot; as the Grand Fleet was returning to Scapa Flow in heavy weather and poor visibility. The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but &quot;Conqueror&quot; was not ready for service until March 1915.

===Battle of Jutland===
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers which were to act as bait. Room 40 had again intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

Once Jellicoe&#x27;s ships had rendezvoused with the 2nd BS, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May, he organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd BS were on his left (east), the 4th BS was in the centre and the 1st BS on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd BS at the head of the line of battle. In the early stage of the battle, &quot;Conqueror&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot; fired at the crippled light cruiser with unknown results. The two ships also engaged German dreadnoughts, but failed to make any hits. &quot;Monarch&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot;, in contrast, did not fire at &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;, but shot at and hit several German dreadnoughts. Between them, the pair hit the battleships and once each, lightly damaging them, and the battlecruiser five times, significantly damaging her. The sisters were not heavily engaged during the battle, with none of them firing more than 57 rounds from their main guns.

===Subsequent activity===

The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August 1916 to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, they sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught, and no shots were fired. The sisters were present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered there on 21 November.
They remained part of the 2nd BS through February 1919, but had been transferred to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet by May, &quot;Orion&quot; becoming the squadron flagship. By the end of 1919, the 3rd BS had been disbanded and the sisters had been transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, although &quot;Monarch&quot; was transferred to Portsmouth in early 1920. &quot;Monarch&quot; and &quot;Thunderer&quot; were temporarily recommissioned during the summer of 1920 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. &quot;Orion&quot; joined &quot;Monarch&quot; at Portsmouth later in the year and became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. &quot;Conqueror&quot; followed &quot;Orion&quot; to Portsmouth and relieved her as flagship in mid-1921 and the latter ship was again temporarily recommissioned to transport troops. &quot;Thunderer&quot; was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and &quot;Orion&quot; became a gunnery training ship after being relieved. In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Conqueror&quot; were sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year; &quot;Monarch&quot; was initially listed for sale, but was hulked instead. In 1923, she was converted into a target ship and was used to test the effects of bombs and shells, until she was sunk in early 1925. &quot;Thunderer&quot; was the last surviving ship and was sold in late 1926. On her way to the scrapyard, she ran aground at the entrance to the Port of Blyth, Northumberland, but was refloated and scrapped the following year.

<doc id="434123" wikidata="Q738176" url="?curid=434123" title="Earl of Suffolk">
<text>Earl of Suffolk is a title which has been created four times in the Peerage of England. The first creation, in tandem with the creation of the title of Earl of Norfolk, came before 1069 in favour of Ralph the Staller; but the title was forfeited by his heir, Ralph de Guader, in 1074. The second creation came in 1337 in favour of Robert de Ufford; the title became extinct on the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1382. The third creation came in 1385 in favour of Michael de la Pole. (For more information on this creation, see the Duke of Suffolk (1448 creation).) The fourth creation was in 1603 for Lord Thomas Howard, the second son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by his second wife Margaret Audley, the daughter and eventual sole heiress of Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden, of Audley End in the parish of Saffron Walden in Essex. Howard was a prominent naval commander and politician and served as Earl Marshal, as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord High Treasurer. In 1597 he was summoned to Parliament as Baron Howard de Walden, and in 1603 he was further honoured, at the start of the reign of King James I, when he was created Earl of Suffolk. His second son the Hon. Thomas Howard was created Earl of Berkshire in 1626.

Lord Suffolk was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already in 1610 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Howard de Walden. He later served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners and as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Lord Suffolk had no sons and on his death in 1689 the barony of Howard de Walden fell into abeyance between his daughters (see the Baron Howard de Walden for later history of this title). He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was childless and on his death, the title passed to his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He was a politician and served as First Lord of Trade. In 1706, three years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Chesterford, in the County of Essex, and Earl of Bindon, in the County of Dorset. His son, the seventh Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of Essex and is also remembered as the owner of the slave Scipio Africanus. The Earl was childless and on his early death in 1722, the barony of Chesterford and earldom of Bindon became extinct.

He was succeeded in the earldom of Suffolk by his uncle, the eighth Earl. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. His wife Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, was a mistress of King George II. On Lord Suffolk&#x27;s death, the titles passed to his son, the tenth Earl. He represented Bere Alston in the House of Commons. He was childless and on his death, the line of the eldest son of the first Earl failed. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s third cousin, the fourth Earl of Berkshire, who became the 11th Earl of Suffolk as well (see the Earl of Berkshire for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was succeeded by his grandson, the twelfth Earl (the son of William Howard, Viscount Andover). He was a politician and served as Lord Privy Seal and as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. On his death, the titles passed to his posthumous son, the 13th Earl. He died as an infant and was succeeded by his great-uncle, the 14th Earl. He was the third son of the 11th Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Castle Rising, Malmesbury and St Michael&#x27;s. On his death in 1783, the line of the fourth son of the first Earl of Berkshire failed.

The late Earl was succeeded by his third cousin, the 15th Earl. He was the great-grandson of Colonel the Hon. Philip Howard, seventh son of the first Earl of Berkshire. Lord Suffolk and Berkshire was a General in the Army. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the 16th Earl. He represented Arundel in the House of Commons. His son, the 17th Earl, sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Malmesbury. When he died the titles passed to his son, the 18th Earl. He represented Malmesbury in Parliament as a Liberal. He was succeeded by his son, the 19th Earl. He was killed in action in the First World War. His eldest son, the 20th Earl, was a bomb disposal expert. He was killed in 1941 while trying to defuse an unexploded bomb and was posthumously awarded the George Cross. From 1941 to 2022 the titles were held by his eldest son, the 21st Earl, who as a young boy succeeded on his father&#x27;s death.

The 22nd and present Earl of Suffolk, Alexander Charles Michael Winston Robsahm Howard, was born in 1974 and educated at the University of Bristol. In 2011, he married Victoria Hamilton, a daughter of James Hamilton, with whom he has three children. The heir apparent is their only son, Arthur Charles Alexander Howard, Viscount Andover (born 2014). They also have two daughters, but were divorced in 2018.

The family seat is Charlton Park, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire.

<text>The Old Stone House is a house located in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. The Old Stone House is situated within the J. J. Byrne Playground, at Washington Park, on Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Gowanus Creek once ran nearby, but today the southeastern branch of the Gowanus Canal ends west of the house.

The current structure is a 1933 reconstruction, using some original materials, of the Vechte–Cortelyou House, which was destroyed in 1897. The original house was an important part of the 1776 Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War.

At one time, the Old Stone House was the clubhouse of the Brooklyn Superbas, who later became the Brooklyn Dodgers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
==First house==

The current Old Stone House is a replica, using some unearthed original materials, of a Dutch stone farmhouse originally built adjacent to the current site by the Dutch immigrant Claes Arentson Vechte, or his son Hendrick, in 1699. It is also known as the Vechte–Cortelyou House. The Vechte family farmed the lands around the house, harvested oysters in Gowanus Creek and ferried their produce down the creek to Gowanus Bay and then to lower Manhattan. The house was rented in 1766 by Isaac Cortelyou, but later returned to Vechte. It was then inherited in 1779 by Nicholas Cowenhoven, who sold it in 1790 to Jacques Cortelyou. Cortelyou&#x27;s son, Peter, later received it as a wedding gift from his father.

===Battle of Long Island===

On August 27, 1776, the house was an important location in the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War - the first major engagement of the Continental Army after the Declaration of Independence, and the largest battle of the entire war.

On that day at 9:00 am, George Washington arrived from Manhattan. having been informed that the British were close to a breakthrough of American lines. Washington realized that he had been completely fooled by a deceptive feint by the British on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. On the American right, to the west, Colonial General Stirling still held the line against Grant. Stirling held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver to his east, and some of his own troops thought they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. This was intentional by the British. At 11:00 am, however, British General Grant, reinforced by 2,000 Royal marines, hit Stirling&#x27;s center and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back but British troops were, at this point, coming at him in his rear south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer&#x27; Millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, on the other side of which was Brooklyn Heights.

==== Maryland 400====
Stirling ordered all of his troops, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Major Mordecai Gist, to cross the creek. This group of Maryland troops became known to history as the Maryland 400, although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops which surpassed 2,000 troops supported by two cannon. Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British, who were in fixed positions in and in front of the Vechte–Cortelyou House (known today as Old Stone House). After the last assault the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through the British lines to von Heister&#x27;s Hessians and surrendered to them. 256 Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines. Washington, watching from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill, at the intersection of today&#x27;s Court Street and Atlantic Avenue, was reported to have said, &quot;Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose!&quot;.

The 256 dead troops of the Maryland 400 were buried by the British in a mass grave on a hillock on farmer Adrian Van Brunt&#x27;s land on the outskirts of the marsh. It was from this battle that Maryland gained its nickname &quot;The Old Line State&quot;. This mass grave is believed to be around the southwest corner of what is today 3rd Ave. between 7th and 8th Streets. After its capture, the house was used as an artillery position by an estimated 2,000 British and hired Hessian soldiers who fired on the Americans, who had already suffered disastrous losses and were fleeing from the east to the American forts across the Gowanus Creek to the west. Some four hundred soldiers of the Maryland Brigade under Colonel William Smallwood regained the house twice that day, but were finally repulsed by the British, with very heavy casualties.

Nicholas Vechte, grandson of Claes, lived in the Old Stone House during the American Revolutionary War under the British occupation. Upon his death in 1779, the farm he willed to his grandson, Nicholas R. Cowenhoven. In 1797, Cowenhoven sold the house to Jacques Cortelyou, who purchased it for the use of his newly married son, Peter. Peter&#x27;s son Jacques inherited the house in 1815. His family was the last to live in the Old Stone House.

After the death of his wife, Jacques Cortelyou sold the property to Edwin Litchfield, a railroad developer, in 1852. Litchfield lived in Litchfield Villa, now the Brooklyn headquarters of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Litchfield was the major landowner of the farmland in the area at that time and sold much of his land to the city for the creation of Prospect Park.

===Baseball clubhouse===
After the Litchfield purchase The Old Stone House remained standing another forty years and was occupied by a caretaker during that period. It also served as a club house for a winter skating team, and then for the professional baseball team called the Brooklyn Superbas, which would later be known as the Brooklyn Dodgers before their move to Ebbets Field. The Old Stone House sits on the site of the original Washington Park, and across Fourth Avenue from the second Washington Park, two of the oldest professional baseball stadiums in New York. The left-center field wall from the second Washington Park is still visible on Third Avenue between First and Third Streets.

== Current house and museum==
The land that the house was on was purchased by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1923 and the house, which had been razed and burned in 1897, was excavated in 1933. Half of the house was below street level when the level of Fourth Avenue had been graded up at the end of the nineteenth century. The house was reconstructed in 1934 for use as a rest room, using many of the original stones, though it was moved slightly from its original location. It underwent additional restoration in the 1970s and 1990s and was established as a memorial to the Battle of Long Island due to the efforts of members of the First Battle Revival Alliance. To honor the memory of the Maryland Continentals, the flag of Maryland flies from the house.

Today, the Old Stone House Historic Interpretive Center is operated by the Old Stone House of Brooklyn (OSH), a not-for-profit corporation, under license from the Parks Department. In addition to an exhibit on the battle, OSH offers a full program of school visits on subjects related to the history of the house and the battle and an extensive schedules of concerts, readings, lectures and other events. It is also used for a variety of events including a summer camp, Piper Theatre, and one-off events such as a sing-a-long to the musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

<text>Earl of Berkshire is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. It was created for the first time in 1621 for Francis Norris, 1st Earl of Berkshire. For more information on this creation (which became extinct on his death in 1622), see the Earl of Abingdon and also the Earl of Lindsey. The second creation came in 1626 in favour of Thomas Howard, 1st Viscount Andover. He was the second son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, second son of the second marriage of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. His mother was Katherine, daughter of Sir Henry Knyvett of Charlton in Wiltshire. Howard had already been created Baron Howard of Charlton, in the County of Wiltshire, and Viscount Andover, in the County of Southampton, in 1622. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Lord Berkshire succeeded to the Charlton estate through his mother in 1638. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already in 1640 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Howard of Charlton. He had no sons and on his death in 1679 the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Earl. He represented Wallingford in the House of Commons. He also died without male issue and was succeeded by his great-nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the grandson of the Hon. William Howard, fourth son of the first Earl. In 1745 he succeeded his third cousin as eleventh Earl of Suffolk. For further history of the titles, see the Earl of Suffolk.

<doc id="434126" wikidata="Q3687851" url="?curid=434126" title="Earl of Denbigh">
<text>Earl of Denbigh (pronounced &#x27;Denby&#x27;) is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1622 for William Feilding, Viscount Feilding, a courtier, admiral, and brother-in-law of the powerful Duke of Buckingham. The title is named after the town of Denbigh in the county of Denbighshire, Wales. Since the time of the third earl (1675), the Earl of Denbigh has also held the title of [[Earl of Desmond]], in the Peerage of Ireland.

The family seat is Newnham Paddox, in the parish of Monks Kirby, Warwickshire. The eighth earl converted to Roman Catholicism during the 1850s, in which faith the family has remained. The earldom was one of the hereditary peerages whose entitlement to sit in the House of Lords was removed by the House of Lords Act 1999.

==Origins of the Feilding family==
The Feilding family have been Lords of Newnham Paddox in Monks Kirby, Warwickshire, since 1433. They are in part descended from the Newnham family (named from the estate) who held Newnham Paddox in the 1100s and 1200s (see history of Monks Kirby). 

The nineteenth century historian, S.R. Gardiner described the first Earl of Denbigh, William Feilding, as &quot;the plain country gentleman who had the good luck to marry Buckingham&#x27;s sister in the days of her poverty.&quot;

The family of William&#x27;s wife, Susan Villiers, had also been minor midlands gentry until her brother, George Villiers, became the confidant and lover of King James I. Villiers was elevated by King James to the rank of Duke of Buckingham and continued as a royal favourite during the reign of King Charles I. Exceptionally powerful, Villiers showered preferment on his family. In 1622, not only was Feilding made Earl of Denbigh, but his second son, named George after his important uncle, was given the right to the earldom of Desmond at the point that title reverted to the Crown. In 1660, his daughter, Elizabeth, was created Countess of Guildford for life in her own right. 

===Claimed descent from the Habsburgs===

From around 1656, a story began to be promulgated that the Feilding family were descended from the imperial Habsburg dynasty through the Counts of Laufenburg and Rheinfelden. The family incorporated the Habsburg double headed eagle in their coat of arms and took to naming their sons Rudolph. The claimed imperial ancestry was subject to ridicule, but was also widely accepted for centuries by historians including Edward Gibbon, William Dugdale, and Evelyn Shirley. The claim was, however, comprehensively debunked around the turn of the 20th century by J. Horace Round.

==The 1st and 2nd Earl of Denbigh and 1st Earl of Desmond (4th creation)==
===William Feilding, the First Earl of Denbigh===
Sir William Feilding was Master of the Great Wardrobe under King James I and also took part in the Expedition to Cádiz of 1625. Feilding had already been created Baron Feilding, of Newnham Paddox in the County of Warwick, and Viscount Feilding in 1620 before being made Earl of Denbigh in 1622. All three titles are in the Peerage of England. In 1631, Lord Denbigh visited the Safavid court in Persia.

===Basil Feilding, the Second Earl of Denbigh===
Lord Denbigh was succeeded by his eldest son, Basil, the second Earl. Basil served as ambassador to Venice, and in military service to the Holy Roman Empire. He famously fought as a roundhead in the Civil War, unlike the rest of the family. In 1664, he was created Baron St Liz in the Peerage of England, with remainder to the heirs male of his father.

===George Feilding, the First Earl of Desmond (4th Creation)===
William&#x27;s second son was the Hon. George Feilding. In 1622, when George was around 8 years old, James I created him Baron Fielding, of Lecaghe in the County of Tipperary, and Viscount Callan, of Callan in the County of Kilkenny. At the same time, George was given the right to the title Earl of Desmond as and when the previous holder of that title died without an heir. That happened in 1628. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Earl of Desmond is an ancient Irish title, the 1628 award was its 4th, and current creation.

==Earls of Denbigh (1st creation) and Earls of Desmond (4th creation)==
Basil, the second earl of Denbigh, died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, William Feilding, 2nd Earl of Desmond, who now also became the third Earl of Denbigh (he also succeeded in the barony of St Liz by special remainder).

Basil, the fourth Earl of Denbigh, served as both Lord-Lieutenant of Denbighshire and Warwickshire.
Rudolph, the eighth earl, was a notable member of the Oxford Movement and converted to Roman Catholicism. The family have continued in the Catholic faith, becoming one of the most prominent aristocratic Catholic families.
The ninth Earl served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1897 to 1905 in the Conservative administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour.

The eleventh earl, under the name Rollo Feilding (the name &quot;Rollo&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;Rudolph&quot;, is traditional in the family), raced sports cars and was a notable socialite. 

Since the third earl, the titles have descended from father to son, with the exception of the seventh earl and tenth earl who inherited the title from their grandfathers.

The title is currently held by the twelfth earl, who succeeded his father in 1995. , Lord Denbigh is Grand Carver of England.

<doc id="434128" wikidata="Q950081" url="?curid=434128" title="Earl of Westmorland">
<text>Earl of Westmorland is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. The title was first created in 1397 for Ralph Neville. It was forfeited in 1571 by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, for leading the Rising of the North. It was revived in 1624 in favour of Sir Francis Fane, whose mother, Mary Neville, was a descendant of a younger son of the first Earl. The first Earl of the first creation had already become Baron Neville de Raby, and that was a subsidiary title for his successors. The current Earl holds the subsidiary title Baron Burghersh (1624).

==1397 creation==

Ralph Neville, 4th Baron Neville of Raby, and 1st earl of Westmorland (1364–1425), eldest son of John, 3rd Baron Neville, and his wife Maud Percy (see Neville, &quot;Family&quot;), was knighted by Thomas of Woodstock, afterwards duke of Gloucester, during the French expedition of 1380, and succeeded to his father&#x27;s barony in 1388. He had been joint warden of the west march in 1386, and was reappointed for a new term in 1390. In 1391 he was put on the commission which undertook the duties of constable in place of the duke of Gloucester, and he was repeatedly engaged in negotiations with the Scots. His support of the court party against the lords appellant was rewarded in 1397 by the earldom of Westmorland.

Westmorland married as his second wife Joan Beaufort, half-sister of Henry of Lancaster, afterwards Henry IV, whom he joined on his landing in Yorkshire in 1399. He already held the castles of Brancepeth, Raby, Middleham and Sheriff Hutton when he received from Henry IV the honour and lordship of Richmond for life. The only rivals of the Nevilles in the north were the Percies, whose power was broken at Shrewsbury in 1403. Both marches had been in their hands, but the wardenship of the west marches was now assigned to Westmorland, whose influence was also paramount in the east, which was under the nominal wardenship of the young Prince John, afterwards duke of Bedford. Westmorland had prevented Northumberland from marching to reinforce Hotspur in 1403, and before embarking on a new revolt he sought to secure his enemy, surrounding, but too late, one of Sir Ralph Eure&#x27;s castles where the earl had been staying. In May the Percies were in revolt, with the Earl Marshal, Thomas, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York. Westmorland met them on Shipton Moor, near York, on 29 May 1405, and suggested a parley between the leaders. By pretending accord with the archbishop, the earl induced him to allow his followers to disperse. Scrope and Mowbray were then seized and handed over to Henry at Pontefract on 3 January. The improbabilities of this narrative have led some writers to think, in face of contemporary authorities, that Scrope and Mowbray must have surrendered voluntarily. If Westmorland betrayed them he at least had no share in their execution.

Thenceforward Westmorland was busily engaged in negotiating with the Scots and keeping the peace on the borders. He did not play the part assigned to him by Shakespeare in &quot;Henry V&quot;., for during Henry&#x27;s absence he remained in charge of the north, and was a member of Bedford&#x27;s council. He consolidated the strength of his family through marriage alliances. His daughter Catherine married in 1412 John, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, brother and heir of the Earl Marshal, who had been executed after Shipton Moor; Anne married Humphrey, 1st Duke of Buckingham; Eleanor married, after the death of her first husband Richard le Despenser, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland; Cecily married Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and was the mother of Edward IV and Richard III. The sons by his second marriage were Richard, 5th Earl of Salisbury, William, Baron Fauconberg, George, Baron Latimer, Robert, bishop of Salisbury and then of Durham, and Edward, Baron Abergavenny. The earl died on 21 October 1425, and a fine alabaster tomb was erected to his memory in Staindrop church close by Raby Castle.

Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland (&quot;c&quot;. 1404–1484), the son of John, Lord Neville (died 1423), succeeded his grandfather in 1425, and married as his first wife Elizabeth Percy, dowager Baroness Clifford, the daughter of Sir Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, thus forming further bonds with the Percies. The 3rd Earl, Ralph Neville (1456–1499), was his nephew, and the son of John Neville, Lord Neville, who was slain at the Battle of Towton. His grandson Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland (1499–1550), was an energetic border warrior, who remained faithful to the royal cause when the other great northern lords joined the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was succeeded by his son Henry, 5th Earl (c. 1525–1563).

Charles Neville, 6th Earl (1543–1601), eldest son of the 5th earl by his first wife Anne, daughter of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, was brought up a Roman Catholic, and was further attached to the Catholic party by his marriage with Jane, daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He was a member of the council of the north in 1569 when he joined Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, and his uncle Christopher Neville, in the Catholic Rising of the North, which had as its object the liberation of Mary Queen of Scots. On the collapse of the ill-organised insurrection, Westmorland fled with his brother earl over the borders, and eventually to the Spanish Netherlands, where he lived in receipt of a pension from Philip II of Spain, until his death on 16 November 1601. He left no sons, and his honours were forfeited by his formal attainder in 1571. Raby Castle remained in the hands of the crown until 1645.

During the reign of James I, the earldom was claimed by Edward Neville, a descendant of George Neville, 1st Baron Latymer. Though the claimant was recognised as the heir-male of the first Earl of Westmorland, his claim was not admitted due to the attainder.
 He died about 1640. &quot;There was issue male existing long after the 17th century from the 1st Lord Latimer of this creation. That from Thomas Nevill, of Pigotts Ardley, co. Essex (who d. 1550 and who was next yr. br. to William Nevill abovenamed and to John, the 3d Lord Latimer), ancestor of the Nevills, of Halstead, in that county, is said to have existed for eight generations in Drummond&#x27;s &quot;Noble British Families&quot;&quot; See also

==1624 creation==

The title was revived in 1624 in favour of Sir Francis Fane, whose mother, Mary Neville, was a descendant of a younger son of the first Earl of the 1397 creation. He was created Baron Burghersh, in the County of Sussex, and Earl of Westmorland in the Peerage of England 1624, and became Baron le Despencer on his mother&#x27;s death in 1626. His son Mildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, at first sided with the king&#x27;s party in the English Civil War, but was afterwards reconciled with the parliament. John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland, served under the Duke of Marlborough, and was made in 1739 lieutenant-general of the British Armies.

John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, only son of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, entered the army in 1803, and in 1805 took part in the Hanoverian campaign as aide-de-camp to General Sir George Don. He was assistant adjutant-general in Sicily and Egypt (1806–1807), served in the Peninsular War from 1808 to 1813, was British military commissioner to the allied armies under the Prince of Schwarzenberg, and marched with the allies to Paris in 1814. He was subsequently promoted major general (1825), lieutenant-general (1838) and general (1854), although the latter half of his life was given to the diplomatic service. He was a British resident in Florence from 1814 to 1830, and British ambassador at Berlin from 1841 to 1851, when he was transferred to Vienna. In Berlin, he had mediated in the Schleswig-Holstein question, and in Vienna, he was one of the British plenipotentiaries at the congress of 1855. He retired in 1855, and died at Apethorpe Hall, Northamptonshire, on 16 October 1859. Himself a musician of considerable reputation and the composer of several operas, he took a keen interest in the cause of music in England, and in 1822 made proposals which led to the foundation in the next year of the Royal Academy of Music. His wife Priscilla Anne, daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, was a distinguished artist.

His published works include &quot;Memoirs of the Early Campaigns of the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain&quot; (1820), and &quot; Memoir of the Operations of the Allied Armies under Prince Schwarzenberg and Marshal Blucher&quot; (1822).

Francis Fane, 12th Earl of Westmorland, fourth son of the preceding, was also a distinguished soldier. He entered the army in 1843 and served through the Punjab campaign of 1846; was made aide-de-camp to the governor-general in 1848, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849. He went to the Crimean War as aide-de-camp to Lord Raglan, and was promoted lieutenant colonel in 1855. On his return to England, he became aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge, and received the Crimean Medal. The death of his elder brother in 1851 gave him the style of Lord Burghersh, and after his accession to the earldom in 1859, he retired from the service with the rank of colonel. He died in August 1891 and was succeeded by his son, Anthony Fane, 13th Earl of Westmorland.

<doc id="434129" wikidata="Q5326313" url="?curid=434129" title="Earl of Lindsey">
<text>Earl of Lindsey is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1626 for the 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1635 to 1636 and also established his claim in right of his mother to the hereditary office of Lord Great Chamberlain of England. Lord Lindsey fought on the Royalist side in the Civil War and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. He was succeeded by his son, the second earl. He also fought at Edgehill and surrendered to the Parliamentarians in order to attend his mortally wounded father. Lord Lindsey later fought at the First Battle of Newbury, Second Battle of Newbury, and at Naseby. His son from his second marriage, James, was created Earl of Abingdon in 1682. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Martha Cockayne, the third Earl. He represented Boston in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire.

His son, the fourth earl, was summoned to the House of Lords in 1690 through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He later served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire and was one of the Lords Justice before the arrival of King George I. In 1706 he was created Marquess of Lindsey and in 1715 he was further honoured when he was made Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. His son, the second duke, was called to the House of Lords in 1715 through a writ of acceleration as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. He was succeeded by his son, the third duke. He was a general in the Army and served as Master of the Horse from 1766 to 1778. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. His son, the fourth duke, was briefly Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire but died unmarried in 1779 at an early age. On his death the barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between his sisters Lady Priscilla and Georgiana, Marchioness of Cholmondeley, who also jointly inherited the office of Lord Great Chamberlain (the abeyance was terminated in 1780 in favour of Priscilla; see the Baron Willoughby de Eresby for later history of this title).

The late Duke was succeeded in the earldom, marquessate and dukedom by his uncle, the fifth duke. He represented Lincoln in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. He had no sons and on his death in 1809 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Lindsey by his third cousin, the ninth earl. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Charles Bertie, fifth son of the second earl. Lord Lindsey was a general in the Army and also sat as Member of Parliament for Stamford. On the death in 1938 of his grandson, the twelfth earl, the line of the fifth son of the second earl failed. The late earl was succeeded by his distant relative (his fifth cousin thrice removed) the eighth Earl of Abingdon, who became the thirteenth earl. However, it was not until 1951 the Lord Abingdon was recognised in the earldom of Lindsey. the title is held by his first cousin, the fourteenth Earl of Lindsey and ninth Earl of Abingdon.

The family seat is at Gilmilnscroft House, near Mauchline, in East Ayrshire.

<text>Earl of Abingdon is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 30 November 1682 for James Bertie, 5th Baron Norreys of Rycote. He was the eldest son of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey by his second marriage to Bridget, 4th Baroness Norreys de Rycote, and the younger half-brother of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey (see the Earl of Lindsey and the Baron Willoughby de Eresby for earlier history of the Bertie family). His mother&#x27;s family descended from Sir Henry Norris, who represented Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the House of Commons and served as Ambassador to France. In 1572 he was summoned by writ to Parliament as Lord Norreys de Rycote. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron. In 1621, he created Viscount Thame and Earl of Berkshire in the Peerage of England. He had no sons and on his death in 1624 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony by his daughter Elizabeth, the third holder of the title. On her death, the title passed to her daughter, the aforementioned Bridget, the fourth Baroness, and second wife of the second Earl of Lindsey.

Her son, the aforementioned fifth Baron, was summoned to the House of Lords as &quot;Lord Norreys of Rycote&quot; (with the precedence of 1572) on 13 April 1675. He was later Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire and in 1682 he was honoured when he was made Earl of Abingdon. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Berkshire and Oxfordshire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In 1687, Lord Abingdon assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Venables, which was that of his father-in-law. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of the Hon. James Bertie, second son of the first Earl. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. His son, the sixth Earl, represented Oxford and Abingdon in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire. His great-grandson, the eighth Earl (the son of Montagu Charles Francis Towneley-Bertie, Lord Norreys, who had assumed by Royal licence his maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname of Towneley in 1896), succeeded his distant relative (his fifth cousin thrice removed) the twelfth Earl of Lindsey in the earldom of Lindsey in 1938. However, it was not until 1951 that he was recognised as Earl of Lindsey.

Another member of the Bertie family was the Hon. Francis Bertie, the second son of the sixth Earl of Abingdon. He served as British Ambassador to Italy and France and was created Viscount Bertie of Thame in 1918.
