<text>Mogens Lykketoft (; born 9 January 1946) is a Danish politician who served as Leader of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) from 2002 to 2005.

He succeeded Poul Nyrup Rasmussen as party leader. After losing the 2005 parliamentary election, he resigned his office. In the Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I, II, III and IV which governed from 1993 to 2001, he held positions as Finance Minister and Foreign Minister. During the cabinet of Helle Thorning Schmidt from 2011 to 2015 he was Speaker of the Folketing.

In June 2015 he was unanimously elected the President of the United Nations General Assembly presiding over the 70th session of the General Assembly beginning 15 September 2015.

==Early life==
Lykketoft was born out of wedlock and put up for adoption. He was adopted twice, since his first adoptive father died when he was only a few months old. The second time he was adopted by shopkeeper Axel Lykketoft and Martha Lykketoft. He was the only child in the family and had, according to himself, a safe and secure childhood.

Lykketoft matriculated in mathematics from Frederiksberg Gymnasium, an upper secondary school, in 1964 and went on to study at the University of Copenhagen. In 1971 he became Cand.polit. (a Master&#x27;s degree in economics by the University of Copenhagen). At Copenhagen University Lykketoft became a member of Frit Forum, the Social Democratic student organisation. From 1965 to 1970 he was part of its management committee and he was its national chairman for the academic year 1968/69.

From 1975 to 1981 he was department head in &quot;The Economic Council of the Labour Movement&quot;, a Danish think tank made up of trade union leaders and Social Democratic MPs. He had been working at the think tank since 1966.

==Political career==
===Member of the Folketing===
On 20 January 1981 Prime Minister Anker Jørgensen picked him to be Taxation Minister. He was minister for less than 20 months before the Social Democratic government resigned. In the 1981 general election he became MP for the Copenhagen County constituency. He has been member of the Folketing (the Danish parliament) ever since, standing for election eleven times. Since 2007 he has been representing Greater Copenhagen greater constituency.

In 1987 he unsuccessfully tried to be kingmaker at the election of a new leader of the Danish Social Democrats. The attempt put him in opposition to the new leader Svend Auken. Five years later he was more successful when his new candidate, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, challenged and defeated Auken at an extraordinary congress of the Social Democrats.

After the resignation of the Conservative/Liberal government in January 1993 Lykketoft became Finance Minister in the cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (I, II, III, IV). He is the longest serving Finance Minister in modern Danish history. He became Foreign Minister in December 2000 and continued as such until the government lost the general election of 2001.

After Poul Nyrup resigned Lykketoft was elected Leader of the Social Democrats, a position he held until he failed to unseat the Liberal/Conservative government of Anders Fogh Rasmussen at the general election of 2005. From 2005 to 2011 he was the Foreign Policy Spokesman for the Social Democratic parliamentary group.

After the 2019 Danish general election, Lykketoft stepped down from his position as an MP in the Folketing, bringing an end to his nearly 40-year tenure.

===Speaker of Folketing===
In October 2009 he became member of &quot;the Præsidium of the Folketing&quot; (the unified leadership of the Danish parliament). And after the election victory of the Socialist-Social Democrat-Social Liberal coalition in the 2011 general election he became President of the Parliament of Denmark.

As President or Speaker of the Folketing he has been on official visits to Turkey (2014), Iceland (2014), Slovakia (2013), Greece (2013), The Bundestag in Berlin (2013) and The United States Congress in Washington (2012). He has also been on work visits to Mexico (2014), Palestine (2014), Mongolia (2013), Burma, (2013), Albania (2012), Bulgaria (2012), Vietnam (2012) and Indonesia (2012).

===UN General assembly===
In March 2013, Lykketoft was nominated for the position of President of the United Nations General Assembly by the Danish government. He was the sole official candidate from the Western European and Others Group and received their nomination in November 2014. On 15 June 2015, he made history by becoming the first Dane ever to be elected to this prestigious position, and oversaw the Seventieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. 

During his presidency, he would not resign as a Danish MP but rather take a leave of absence returning to the Folketing after his UN appointment has ended. He returned to the Danish parliament at the end of his United Nations presidency in October 2016.

==Israel/Palestine visit==
During his February 2014 visit to Palestine he did not at the same time meet with Israeli officials, this made the speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein express regret of the fact that Lykketoft unlike other world leaders decided not to include Israel in his visit of the region. Edelstein further said: &quot;I do not understand how a visit to Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, goes along with Denmark&#x27;s democratic values.&quot;

Lykketoft said that he was keen to hear both parts in the conflict and he had tried to schedule a meeting with the speaker of the Knesset. But he was told that Edelstein was unable to meet him during his visit. During an interview Lykketoft stated: &quot;There was this Israeli reaction from the spokesman in the foreign ministry that it was kind of diplomatically impolite to go to Palestine without having an arrangement with the Israeli side.&quot;

In December 2014 he was asked his opinion about the Swedish recognition of an independent Palestine state. He answered the interviewer:&quot;I think the movement in European parliaments and from the government of Sweden to recognize the State of Palestine is a reaction to the observation that the present Israeli government has no intention to contribute to formation of a sovereign Palestinian state, while this is expressed by the vast majority of member states in the United Nations through numerous resolutions.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was married for the first time in 1967 to librarian Aase Toft. The family lived in Albertslund and was next-door neighbors to his good friend Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and his family. in January 1979 Aase Lykketoft died from an intracranial hemorrhage. He has two children from his first marriage, Maja, born in 1969, and Kit, born in 1972. He also has five grandsons.

Two years after his first wife died he got married for the second time, this time to Helle Mollerup, the ex-wife of Poul Nyrup. In 1986 he divorced Helle Mollerup and later married MP Jytte Hilden. From 1993 to 1997 they were both ministers in the Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (I, II, III). They divorced in 2004. Since 2005 Lykketoft has been married to author Mette Holm. They have written three books together.

<doc id="442116" wikidata="Q1699181" url="?curid=442116" title="Peter Dawson (bass-baritone)">
<text>Peter Smith Dawson (31 January 188227 September 1961) was an Australian bass-baritone and songwriter in the 1920s and 1930s, when he was possibly the most popular singer of that era. He said that at the time the gramophone was &quot;an instrument of torture&quot;, excruciating for the recording artist, who needed &quot;lungs of leather&quot; to make an impression on the wax cylinders, which captured nothing but the very loudest noises.

However, Dawson made his first recording in 1904, and continued to release songs for EMI and HMV until 1958. In this time he performed classical tunes such as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan Serenade&quot; and popular songs like &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;.

He was the subject of a biography, &quot;Peter Dawson: The World&#x27;s Most Popular Baritone&quot; written by Peter Burgis and Russell Smith. That biography estimates Dawson had in excess of 1500 recordings issued during his career.

In 1984, he was chosen by the &quot;Guinness Book of Recorded Sound&quot; as one of the top ten singers of all time, alongside Elvis Presley and Enrico Caruso.

==Early career==
Peter Dawson was born in 1882 in Adelaide, South Australia, to immigrant Scottish parents, Thomas Dawson, an ironworker, plumber and seaman from Kirkcaldy and Alison, née Miller. The youngest of nine children, he attended East Adelaide Primary School, then Pulteney Street School. At the age of 17, he joined a church choir and received singing lessons from C. J. Stevens. Then, aged 19, he won a prize for the best bass solo in a competition at Ballarat, Victoria, and began taking up concert engagements. He was a featured singer at the 1901 Christmas performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; at the Adelaide Town Hall.

He was sent to London to be taught by Sir Charles Santley, who first sent him to F. L. Bamford of Glasgow for six months&#x27; basic training and coaching in vocal exercises, arias, oratorio pieces and classical songs. He then studied from 1903 to 1907 with Santley, who gave him a thorough training in voice production and a meticulous understanding of the great oratorios, especially Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; and Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot;. In 1904, he joined Santley on an eight-week concert tour of the West of England with the soprano Emma Albani.

He attended a large number of performances at Covent Garden during the first decade of the 20th century and heard many of the leading lower-voiced male singers of the age, including the baritones Titta Ruffo, Pasquale Amato, Mattia Battistini, Mario Sammarco and the basses Marcel Journet, Édouard de Reszke and Pol Plançon. Throughout his life he acknowledged the &quot;bel canto&quot; example of Battistini. In addition to Italian and French opera, he grew to admire the German music dramas of Richard Wagner.

On 20 May 1905, he married Annie Mortimer &quot;Nan&quot; Noble, daughter of the box-office manager of the Alhambra Theatre, who sang professionally in the soprano range under the name Annette George. Around this time, a Russian medical specialist assisted him to extend his upper range, until his compass extended from E-flat in the bass to a high A or A-flat. In 1909, he appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as the Night Watchman in &quot;The Mastersingers of Nuremberg&quot; (opposite tenor Walter Hyde as David), with Hans Richter conducting. During one of these performances, after winning a large amount playing poker in the wings, he hurried on at his call, and accidentally scattered his winnings over the stage. (Dawson, who had a lively sense of humour, was a master at recounting such anecdotes, usually about other performers.) However, he did not find the pressures of the opera stage to be a congenial fit with his easygoing personality, and he elected instead to forge an alternative career as a concert and oratorio singer.

==The concert platform==
Dawson was approached to appear in an important concert in London at the Queen&#x27;s Hall; but first (in 1909–1910) he made a successful six-month tour of Australia with the Amy Castles company of singers. On his return, he began appearing in Promenade Concerts. A second long tour with his own company in Australia and New Zealand ended with the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914. He returned via South Africa to England, where he made concert appearances for wartime charities and the troops, but later decided to go back to Australia to enlist in the Australian Army as a private. However, the Armistice of 1918 intervened before he saw frontline service.

After the war and with another South African tour under his belt, Dawson returned to England. His voice was now entering its peak phase. A British tour ensued with International Celebrity Concerts, involving recitals of operatic numbers. Accompanied on the piano by Gerald Moore, he then gave lieder recitals at the Wigmore Hall in 1924. An extensive Australian tour (his sixth) occurred in 1931, and he paid further visits to his homeland in 1933, 1935, early 1939 and 1948–49. He made an extensive singing tour of India, Burma and the Straits Settlements during the 1930s; he also visited Ireland. His first BBC radio broadcast was made in 1931 and included lieder by Franz Schubert and Johannes Brahms; he subsequently became a prolific broadcaster, and was still active &quot;on air&quot; as late as the 1950s.

He was in Australia at the outbreak of World War II. Too old (at 57) to enlist, he contributed to the war effort as director of the family firm of Thomas Dawson &amp; Sons, which was producing tins for military use, and by broadcasting and recording songs as well as touring army camps with concert parties.

His last public performance was a concert for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in his home town of Adelaide, in January 1961. He died of heart failure in Sydney in September of that year and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.

==Dawson and the gramophone==

The gramophone was a major factor in the promotion and progression of Dawson&#x27;s career. He made his first 78-rpm acoustic recordings in 1904, and continued to release songs for EMI and HMV until 1958, by which time vinyl stereo LPs had been introduced. Estimates of the number of his published recordings range from 1,500 (a recent biography) to as high as 3,500 (quoted in his autobiography). His first efforts were made for Edison-Bell on wax cylinders in 1904. After a few experimental run-throughs, record producer Fred Gaisberg signed Dawson to an exclusive contract to cut discs for the Gramophone Company (the predecessor of HMV/EMI) in 1906; he continued, however, to record on cylinders for Edison until that company closed its London studios not long before World War I erupted. Dawson&#x27;s standard repertoire rapidly became a mainstay of the HMV catalogue. In addition to the HMV titles appearing under his own name, he recorded Scottish songs popularised by Harry Lauder under the pseudonym Hector Grant, for the sister Zonophone record label.

In 1906, Dawson participated in the first series of partially complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera recordings, together with other studio recording artists. Beginning in 1919, he took part in an extensive series of musically complete recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with members of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, under the supervision of Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, and conducted by HMV staff conductor George W. Byng. By 1920 he is said to have achieved total record sales of five million discs. After the First World War, audio technology was improving, and he recut many of his more popular titles during the early 1920s. With the introduction of electrical microphone recording in 1925, the core body of his work was committed once again to disc, including new Gilbert and Sullivan versions under Sir Malcolm Sargent. Dawson&#x27;s electrical recordings from the late 1920s and early 1930s had the longest shelf-life, and most households owned at least one (according to author Brian Rust, writing in 1979). By the Second World War, his record sales had topped the 12 million mark.

In 1955, he visited the recording studios for the last time where, in experimental stereo, he recorded tracks with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Mackerras. These included a moving rendition of Albert Arlen&#x27;s setting of &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; (to the poem of Banjo Paterson). The achievement is all the more remarkable when it is remembered that at this time Dawson was 73 years old and had had a career of some fifty years.

==Repertoire==
Dawson&#x27;s repertoire was essentially adapted to the purposes of the recital platform, growing out of the late 19th-century tradition of the smoking concerts and Chappell Recitals. He was an advocate of singing in English, and ensured that his diction was of the utmost clarity when he sang.

He owed to his vocal mentor Charles Santley a taste and technique perfectly suited to oratorio, of which Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was his favourite work. Handel standards (&quot;O Ruddier than the Cherry&quot;; &quot;Why do the Nations?&quot;; &quot;Honour and Arms&quot;; &quot;Arm, arm ye Brave&quot; and &quot;Droop not Young Lover&quot;) and Mendelssohn (&quot;I am a Roamer&quot; from the Singspiel, &quot;Son and Stranger&quot;, and &quot;It is Enough&quot;, from &quot;Elijah&quot;) remained constantly in his work. He sang Elgar roles in exemplary fashion, too, including &quot;Oh My Warriors&quot; and &quot;The Sword Song&quot; (&quot;Leap, Leap, to the Light&quot;) from &quot;Caractacus&quot;. His concert operatic titles were principally The Prologue (from &quot;Pagliacci&quot;), &quot;Iago&#x27;s Credo&quot; (&quot;Otello&quot;), &quot;Even Bravest Heart&quot; (&quot;Faust&quot;) – written originally by Gounod for Santley – &quot;Largo al Factotum&quot; (&quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;), &quot;Non più andrai&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;), &quot;O Star of Eve&quot; (&quot;Tannhäuser&quot;), the &quot;Toreador Song&quot; (&quot;Carmen&quot;), &quot;Pari siamo&quot; (&quot;Rigoletto&quot;) and &quot;Within This Hallowed Dwelling&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;).

The art of the German Lied attracted him also, notably Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;Who is Sylvia&quot;, &quot;Sei mir gegrüßt&quot;, &quot;Erstarrung&quot;, &quot;Wasserflut&quot;, &quot;Die Krähe&quot; and &quot;Ungeduld&quot;; Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Die Beiden Grenadier&quot;, &quot;Frühlingsnacht&quot;; Carl Loewe&#x27;s &quot;The Clock&quot;, &quot;Edward&quot;; Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Die Mainacht&quot;, &quot;Botschaft&quot;, &quot;Ständchen&quot;, &quot;Der Tod, der ist die kühle Nacht&quot;, &quot;Blinde Kuh&quot;; Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Traum durch die Dämmerung&quot; and Hugo Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Nun wandre Maria&quot;, &quot;Verschwiegene Liebe&quot;. Russian standards also appeared in his recital programs, notably Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;To the Forest&quot;, &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Serenade&quot;, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Christ is Risen&quot; and Malashkin&#x27;s &quot;O Could I But Express in Song&quot;. Most of these songs were sung in English.

However, it was in British song that Dawson was especially famous, and his career helped to preserve the concert recital, and many of the older ballad type of songs, at a time when other forms of popular music were displacing the Victorian standards. He was particularly successful with the heartier, rollicking type of song, such as &quot;Off to Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;The Old Superb&quot; and &quot;Up from Somerset&quot;. He sang a good deal of the output of Stanford and Arthur Somervell, a few Sullivan vocal warhorses, and a select range of items by contemporary composers such as Percy French, Peter Warlock, Liza Lehmann, Granville Bantock, Eric Coates, Roger Quilter, Thomas Dunhill, Edward German, George Butterworth, Gustav Holst, Landon Ronald, Michael Head, Frank Bridge, Arnold Bax.

Many songs became personally identified with him, including &quot;The Floral Dance&quot; (Katie Moss), &quot;The Kerry Dance&quot; (Molloy), &quot;The Bandolero&quot; (Stuart), &quot;The Cobbler&#x27;s Song&quot; (from &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot;), &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; and &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; (Albert Ketèlbey), &quot;The Lute Player&quot; (Allitsen), &quot;The Old Brigade&quot;, and &quot;On the Road to Mandalay&quot; (Speaks and Hedgcock versions). His performance of the &quot;Four Indian Love Lyrics&quot; (Amy Woodforde-Finden) and his &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot; (Haydn Wood) were famous. He composed a number of songs himself, under the name J. P. McCall, most famously his setting of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Boots&quot;, which won the author&#x27;s approval and was one of Dawson&#x27;s greatest successes.

His recitals were also enlivened by the inclusion of many Australian songs, notably &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, &quot;Song of Australia&quot;, &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; and &quot;The Riveter&quot; (Albert Arlen&#x27;s settings), &quot;Six Australian Bush Songs&quot;, and also Alfred Hill&#x27;s version of the New Zealand Māori song &quot;Waiata Poi&quot;.

<doc id="442120" wikidata="Q8194086" url="?curid=442120" title="Dutch Harbor">
<text>Dutch Harbor is a harbor on Amaknak Island in Unalaska, Alaska. It was the location of the Battle of Dutch Harbor in June, 1942 when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked it just seven months after the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. To this day, it remains one of the few sites in the United States to be subjected to an aerial bombardment by a foreign power.

Dutch Harbor is now the home of an important fishing industry.

== History ==
===Russian to American===
Druzhinin, the commander of the Russian ship &quot;Zakharii I Elisaveta&quot;, is credited for discovering the deep-water harbor now known as Dutch Harbor.

Dutch Harbor is located within the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, more precisely on Amaknak Island in the Fox Islands. A mile-long spit extending from the northeast end of Amaknak Island makes Dutch Harbor a natural port, protecting ships from the waves and currents of the Bering Sea, although winds off the Bering Sea have tossed shipments from decks of ships. Dutch Harbor is close to some of the richest fishing in the world, and it is ice-free.

The native people are known as Aleut. When the Russians arrived, they exploited the Aleut by taxing them in fur pelts.

The Russian-American Company operated from 1799 through the mid-1800s. It used Dutch Harbor in the transport of goods, mainly seal and sea otter fur.
In 1867, Russia sold Alaska to the United States.
Fur was the main export in Alaska after the United States took control. Hutchinson, Kohl, &amp; Company of San Francisco took over the assets of the Russian America Company in 1867, but it sold out in 1868, to the Alaska Commercial Company.
A decline in the sea otter population slowed trade in 1895.

The year 1897 brought a crowd of potential prospectors looking to get rich from the Alaska gold rush.

===World War II===
World War II brought the U.S. Army and Navy, and their supplies, to Dutch Harbor at the Dutch Harbor Naval Operating Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army. The first army troops arrived in June 1941 and the navy air base was finished in September 1941. During the war, Dutch Harbor was also used to house refugees evacuated from other Aleutian Islands.

U.S. Army troops and civilian workers alike spent time at &quot;Blackies&quot;, the only bar in the area. This establishment had cheap beer and 50-cent shots of whiskey, but no stools or chairs as they &quot;splintered too easily in the event of a fight&quot;. Other entertainment included a brothel named &quot;Pleasure Island&quot;, but this was closed in 1941 and later replaced by part of the U.S. Navy submarine base. The 500-man mess hall doubled as a theater. The tickets for the military were 15 cents and 35 cents for civilian workers.

In early 1942, intelligence officers of the U.S. Navy predicted that there would be a Japanese attack in the North Pacific area, and naval codebreakers warned Dutch Harbor of the impending attack. On June 3, 1942, at 5:45 a.m., 20 Japanese planes from two aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy bombed Dutch Harbor in the &quot;Battle of Dutch Harbor,&quot; targeting the radio station and the petroleum storage tanks, and continuing the fight a day later.

By mid-1942, a small submarine base was in place, with a squadron of old U.S. Navy S-class submarines; these were withdrawn by late 1943 due to the availability of longer-range submarines (such as the &quot; Gato&quot; class) operating elsewhere.

By May 1943, a peak of 10,151 sailors and 9,976 soldiers were stationed at the base. 

===Post-World War II===
In 1947, the last units of the U.S. Navy left Dutch Harbor, and the base was decommissioned.

In 1952, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stored 232 surplus buildings on 448 acres of land of the Fort Mears Military Reservation.

During the mid-1980s, the U.S. government finally funded the cleanup of the derelict fort, and the area was turned over for commercial use. The U.S. Navy also scrapped its air base on Dutch Harbor.

The ship &quot;Kuroshima&quot; wrecked in 1997 when it broke away from its anchorage in the Dutch Harbor area.

==Current events==
The harbor is prominently featured in the Discovery Channel reality television series &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;, which has originated there since 2005.

==Demographics==

Dutch Harbor first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It returned lastly in 1940 and did not appear again separately afterward. It was later annexed into Unalaska.

==Fishing==
Dutch Harbor is ranked as a top fishing port with more than a billion dollars transferred each year. Huge harvests of pollock and cod in the Bering Sea are part of this total. The Bering Sea has a continental shelf that is one of the world&#x27;s largest, and supports a rich ecosystem.

<text>The Toronto Fringe Festival is an annual theatre festival, featuring un-juried plays by unknown or well-known artists, taking place in the theatres of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Several productions originally mounted at the Fringe have later been remounted for larger audiences, including the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone,&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Kim&#x27;s Convenience.&quot;

== Features ==

The Toronto Fringe Festival started in 1989 and hosts over 150 productions every July.

It is well known for not having a jury to judge which plays will be presented. Instead it uses a lottery system which gives each play an equal chance. It depends mostly on volunteers, donors/sponsors, and government grants. One notable feature is the 24-hour playwriting contest in which contestants write a play in one day based on items selected by the Fringe and the winning play is performed on the last day of the festival.
In 2008 &quot;The Fringe of Toronto&quot; launched a second festival called &quot;The Next Stage Festival&quot; (NSTF) which takes place annually in January. Unlike the summer festival, NSTF is juried and presents both new and remounted projects by &quot;Fringe Artists&quot;. Also, unlike the summer Fringe Festival NSTF only showcases 8 productions.

NSTF was the first major step in the organization branching out to a year-round support organization that brings many opportunities to artists and arts-lovers. Since the launch of NSTF &quot;The Toronto Fringe&quot; has also introduced a number of artists outreach programs including The Fringe Evolution Fund to help independent producers remount their shows outside of the festival, and youth outreach programs including 10x10x10 which distributes 1,000 rush passes to priority youth in and around Toronto.

In 2010 the Toronto Fringe launched a new and expanded Fringe Club featuring free nightly entertainment, an expanded beer tent, a public stage called &quot;Postscript Patio&quot;, art installations called Fringe-Pretty-Things, and food service provided by local restaurants.
2011 saw the grand opening of yet another expansion, this time a year-round fixture called &quot;The Fringe Creation Lab&quot;.The Creation Lab is the new home of the Toronto Fringe and the indie arts community. The Lab consists of two studio spaces and the Toronto Fringe admin office, both housed on the 4th floor of the Centre for Social Innovation in the Annex. (Just steps away from Bathurst Station.) Both studios are available for anyone to rent at any time to do whatever they want. The spaces can be rented at various levels of subsidy, on a first-come, first-served basis. The studios are already a buzzing arts hub, bookable all hours of the day and night, where artists can focus on their craft and connect with their community without breaking the bank

Some notable productions include Trey Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Da Kink in My Hair&quot;, winner of the Cultural Diversity Drama Competition, premiered as a one hour television pilot produced by VisionTV in 2004, and later was adapted into a half-hour weekly TV series in 2007-8 by the Global Television Network; &quot;My Own Private Oshawa&quot;, a one-man show by Jonathan Wilson which was later adapted into a film; and &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;, which went on to Broadway and several world tours. In 2009, &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Lesbian Jewish-Wiccan Wedding&quot; was picked up by Mirvish Productions from the festival and opened only three months later at Toronto&#x27;s Panasonic Theatre. Ins Choi&#x27;s &quot;Kim&#x27;s Convenience&quot;, winner of the 2011 Best New Play award, was remounted in 2012 by Soulpepper Theatre, and went on to become the successful TV series &quot;Kim&#x27;s Convenience&quot;.

<doc id="442131" wikidata="Q336832" url="?curid=442131" title="Jehoahaz of Judah">
<text>Jehoahaz III of Judah (, &quot;Yǝhōʾāḥāz&quot;, &quot;Yahweh has held&quot;; &quot;Iōakhaz&quot;; ), also called Shallum, was the seventeenth king of Judah (3 months in 609 BC) and the fourth son of king Josiah whom he succeeded. His mother was Hamautal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. He was born in 633/632 BC.

==Background==
In the spring or early summer of 609 BC, Pharaoh Necho II began his first campaign against Babylon, in aid of the Assyrians. He moved his forces along the coastal route Via Maris towards Syria, along the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon and prepared to cross the ridge of hills which shuts in the Jezreel Valley on the south. There he found his passage blocked at Megiddo by the Judean army led by Josiah. After a fierce battle Josiah was killed. The Assyrians and their allies the Egyptians fought the Babylonians at Harran. The Babylonian Chronicle dates the battle from Tammuz (July–August) to Elul (August–September) of 609 BC. Josiah was therefore killed in the month of Tammuz, 609 BC, or the month prior, when the Egyptians were on their way to Harran. Chronological considerations related to his successor limit the month in which Josiah was killed and Jehoahaz took the throne to Tammuz.

==Reign==
Although he was two years younger than his brother, Eliakim, he was elected to succeed his father on the throne at the age of twenty-three, This fact attests the popularity of the young man, and probably also his political affiliations or policy, as being in line with those of his father. Jehoahaz reigned for only three months (2 Kings 23:31), before being deposed by the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II and taken into Egyptian captivity (2 Kings 23:31–34).

He disregarded the reforms of his father Josiah. ()

Both William F. Albright and E. R. Thiele dated his reign to 609 BC, making his birth in 633/632 BC.

==Necho II deposes Jehoahaz==
After the failed siege of Harran, Necho left a sizable force behind, but returned himself to Egypt. On his return march, he found that the Judeans had selected Jehoahaz to succeed his father Josiah. Necho brought Jehoahaz to Riblah and imprisoned him there. He then deposed Jehoahaz and replaced him with his older brother Eliakim as king, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoahaz had ruled for three months. Necho brought Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner, where Jehoahaz ended his days. The prophet Jeremiah said of him to &quot;weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again.&quot;()

<text>Krasnolesye (; ; ; ) is a settlement in Nesterovsky District of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, situated on the Krasnaya River (Rominta) close to the border with Poland, in the north of the Romincka Forest. East of Krasnolesye lies Lake Vistytis.

==History==

The village goes back to a hunting lodge which was first mentioned in a document of 1572. The village later became a colony of tar distillers. Until 1657, it was under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Poland. &quot;Rominten&quot; had already been a hunting place for Prince Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1683. The region was elevated to an Imperial Court Hunting District by German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1890. The emperor&#x27;s Rominten Hunting Lodge was built in 1891. After World War I Rominten remained a state hunting district, while the Lodge remained Wilhelm&#x27;s private property.

In September 1933 Wilhelm refused to allow Hermann Göring to stay in the lodge, subsequently Göring built his Reichsjägerhof Rominten. After Wilhelm&#x27;s death Göring forced the heirs to sell the Lodge to himself. Göring used the new structure until the arrival of the Red Army in 1944.

In 1938 &quot;Groß-Rominten&quot; was renamed &quot;Hardteck&quot; to erase traces of non-German origin. When East Prussia was divided between Russia and Poland after World War II, Rominten became part of the Soviet Union. In 1947, it was renamed Krasnolesye (&quot;Red Woods&quot;).

<doc id="442136" wikidata="Q818888" url="?curid=442136" title="Computability">
<text>Computability is the ability to solve a problem in an effective manner. It is a key topic of the field of computability theory within mathematical logic and the theory of computation within computer science. The computability of a problem is closely linked to the existence of an algorithm to solve the problem.

The most widely studied models of computability are the Turing-computable and μ-recursive functions, and the lambda calculus, all of which have computationally equivalent power. Other forms of computability are studied as well: computability notions weaker than Turing machines are studied in automata theory, while computability notions stronger than Turing machines are studied in the field of hypercomputation.

== Problems ==

A central idea in computability is that of a (computational) problem, which is a task whose computability can be explored.

There are two key types of problems:
* A decision problem fixes a set &quot;S&quot;, which may be a set of strings, natural numbers, or other objects taken from some larger set &quot;U&quot;. A particular instance of the problem is to decide, given an element &quot;u&quot; of &quot;U&quot;, whether &quot;u&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;. For example, let &quot;U&quot; be the set of natural numbers and &quot;S&quot; the set of prime numbers. The corresponding decision problem corresponds to primality testing.
* A function problem consists of a function &quot;f&quot; from a set &quot;U&quot; to a set &quot;V&quot;. An instance of the problem is to compute, given an element &quot;u&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, the corresponding element &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) in &quot;V&quot;. For example, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; may be the set of all finite binary strings, and &quot;f&quot; may take a string and return the string obtained by reversing the digits of the input (so f(0101) = 1010).
Other types of problems include search problems and optimization problems.

One goal of computability theory is to determine which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved in each model of computation.

== Formal models of computation ==

A model of computation is a formal description of a particular type of computational process. The description often takes the form of an abstract machine that is meant to perform the task at hand. General models of computation equivalent to a Turing machine (see Church–Turing thesis) include:

;Lambda calculus: A computation consists of an initial lambda expression (or two if you want to separate the function and its input) plus a finite sequence of lambda terms, each deduced from the preceding term by one application of beta reduction.
;Combinatory logic
:A concept which has many similarities to formula_1-calculus, but also important differences exist (e.g. fixed point combinator Y has normal form in combinatory logic but not in formula_1-calculus). Combinatory logic was developed with great ambitions: understanding the nature of paradoxes, making foundations of mathematics more economic (conceptually), eliminating the notion of variables (thus clarifying their role in mathematics).
;μ-recursive functions: A computation consists of a μ-recursive function, i.e. its defining sequence, any input value(s) and a sequence of recursive functions appearing in the defining sequence with inputs and outputs. Thus, if in the defining sequence of a recursive function the functions and appear, then terms of the form or might appear. Each entry in this sequence needs to be an application of a basic function or follow from the entries above by using composition, primitive recursion or μ-recursion. For instance if , then for to appear, terms like and must occur above. The computation terminates only if the final term gives the value of the recursive function applied to the inputs.
;String rewriting systems: Includes Markov algorithms, that use grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols; also Post canonical system.
;Register machine
:A theoretical idealization of a computer. There are several variants. In most of them, each register can hold a natural number (of unlimited size), and the instructions are simple (and few in number), e.g. only decrementation (combined with conditional jump) and incrementation exist (and halting). The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) external store (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriate huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.
;Turing machine: Also similar to the finite state machine, except that the input is provided on an execution &quot;tape&quot;, which the Turing machine can read from, write to, or move back and forth past its read/write &quot;head&quot;. The tape is allowed to grow to arbitrary size. The Turing machine is capable of performing complex calculations which can have arbitrary duration. This model is perhaps the most important model of computation in computer science, as it simulates computation in the absence of predefined resource limits.
;Multitape Turing machine: Here, there may be more than one tape; moreover there may be multiple heads per tape. Surprisingly, any computation that can be performed by this sort of machine can also be performed by an ordinary Turing machine, although the latter may be slower or require a larger total region of its tape.
;P′′
:Like Turing machines, P′′ uses an infinite tape of symbols (without random access), and a rather minimalistic set of instructions. But these instructions are very different, thus, unlike Turing machines, P′′ does not need to maintain a distinct state, because all “memory-like” functionality can be provided only by the tape. Instead of rewriting the current symbol, it can perform a modular arithmetic incrementation on it. P′′ has also a pair of instructions for a cycle, inspecting the blank symbol. Despite its minimalistic nature, it has become the parental formal language of an implemented and (for entertainment) used programming language called Brainfuck.

In addition to the general computational models, some simpler computational models are useful for special, restricted applications. Regular expressions, for example, specify string patterns in many contexts, from office productivity software to programming languages. Another formalism mathematically equivalent to regular expressions, Finite automata are used in circuit design and in some kinds of problem-solving. Context-free grammars specify programming language syntax. Non-deterministic pushdown automata are another formalism equivalent to context-free grammars.

Different models of computation have the ability to do different tasks. One way to measure the power of a computational model is to study the class of formal languages that the model can generate; in such a way the Chomsky hierarchy of languages is obtained.

Other restricted models of computation include:
;Deterministic finite automaton (DFA): Also called a finite-state machine. All real computing devices in existence today can be modeled as a finite-state machine, as all real computers operate on finite resources. Such a machine has a set of states, and a set of state transitions which are affected by the input stream. Certain states are defined to be accepting states. An input stream is fed into the machine one character at a time, and the state transitions for the current state are compared to the input stream, and if there is a matching transition the machine may enter a new state. If at the end of the input stream the machine is in an accepting state, then the whole input stream is accepted.
;Nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA): Another simple model of computation, although its processing sequence is not uniquely determined. It can be interpreted as taking multiple paths of computation simultaneously through a finite number of states. However, it is possible to prove that any NFA is reducible to an equivalent DFA.
;Pushdown automaton: Similar to the finite state machine, except that it has available an execution stack, which is allowed to grow to arbitrary size. The state transitions additionally specify whether to add a symbol to the stack, or to remove a symbol from the stack. It is more powerful than a DFA due to its infinite-memory stack, although only the top element of the stack is accessible at any time.

== Power of automata ==
With these computational models in hand, we can determine what their limits are. That is, what classes of languages can they accept?

=== Power of finite-state machines ===

Computer scientists call any language that can be accepted by a finite-state machine a regular language. Because of the restriction that the number of possible states in a finite state machine is finite, we can see that to find a language that is not regular, we must construct a language that would require an infinite number of states.

An example of such a language is the set of all strings consisting of the letters &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; which contain an equal number of the letter &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27;. To see why this language cannot be correctly recognized by a finite state machine, assume first that such a machine &quot;M&quot; exists. &quot;M&quot; must have some number of states &quot;n&quot;. Now consider the string &quot;x&quot; consisting of formula_3 &#x27;a&#x27;s followed by formula_3 &#x27;b&#x27;s.

As &quot;M&quot; reads in &quot;x&quot;, there must be some state in the machine that is repeated as it reads in the first series of &#x27;a&#x27;s, since there are formula_3 &#x27;a&#x27;s and only &quot;n&quot; states by the pigeonhole principle. Call this state &quot;S&quot;, and further let &quot;d&quot; be the number of &#x27;a&#x27;s that our machine read in order to get from the first occurrence of &quot;S&quot; to some subsequent occurrence during the &#x27;a&#x27; sequence. We know, then, that at that second occurrence of &quot;S&quot;, we can add in an additional &quot;d&quot; (where formula_6) &#x27;a&#x27;s and we will be again at state &quot;S&quot;. This means that we know that a string of formula_7 &#x27;a&#x27;s must end up in the same state as the string of formula_3 &#x27;a&#x27;s. This implies that if our machine accepts &quot;x&quot;, it must also accept the string of formula_7 &#x27;a&#x27;s followed by formula_3 &#x27;b&#x27;s, which is not in the language of strings containing an equal number of &#x27;a&#x27;s and &#x27;b&#x27;s. In other words, &quot;M&quot; cannot correctly distinguish between a string of equal number of &#x27;a&#x27;s and &#x27;b&#x27;s and a string with formula_7 &#x27;a&#x27;s and formula_12 &#x27;b&#x27;s.

We know, therefore, that this language cannot be accepted correctly by any finite-state machine, and is thus not a regular language. A more general form of this result is called the Pumping lemma for regular languages, which can be used to show that broad classes of languages cannot be recognized by a finite state machine.

=== Power of pushdown automata ===
Computer scientists define a language that can be accepted by a pushdown automaton as a Context-free language, which can be specified as a Context-free grammar. The language consisting of strings with equal numbers of &#x27;a&#x27;s and &#x27;b&#x27;s, which we showed was not a regular language, can be decided by a push-down automaton. Also, in general, a push-down automaton can behave just like a finite-state machine, so it can decide any language which is regular. This model of computation is thus strictly more powerful than finite state machines.

However, it turns out there are languages that cannot be decided by push-down automaton either. The result is similar to that for regular expressions, and won&#x27;t be detailed here. There exists a Pumping lemma for context-free languages. An example of such a language is the set of prime numbers.

=== Power of Turing machines ===
Turing machines can decide any context-free language, in addition to languages not decidable by a push-down automaton, such as the language consisting of prime numbers. It is therefore a strictly more powerful model of computation.

Because Turing machines have the ability to &quot;back up&quot; in their input tape, it is possible for a Turing machine to run for a long time in a way that is not possible with the other computation models previously described. It is possible to construct a Turing machine that will never finish running (halt) on some inputs. We say that a Turing machine can decide a language if it eventually will halt on all inputs and give an answer. A language that can be so decided is called a recursive language. We can further describe Turing machines that will eventually halt and give an answer for any input in a language, but which may run forever for input strings which are not in the language. Such Turing machines could tell us that a given string is in the language, but we may never be sure based on its behavior that a given string is not in a language, since it may run forever in such a case. A language which is accepted by such a Turing machine is called a recursively enumerable language.

The Turing machine, it turns out, is an exceedingly powerful model of automata. Attempts to amend the definition of a Turing machine to produce a more powerful machine have surprisingly met with failure. For example, adding an extra tape to the Turing machine, giving it a two-dimensional (or three- or any-dimensional) infinite surface to work with can all be simulated by a Turing machine with the basic one-dimensional tape. These models are thus not more powerful. In fact, a consequence of the Church–Turing thesis is that there is no reasonable model of computation which can decide languages that cannot be decided by a Turing machine.

The question to ask then is: do there exist languages which are recursively enumerable, but not recursive? And, furthermore, are there languages which are not even recursively enumerable?

==== The halting problem ====
The halting problem is one of the most famous problems in computer science, because it has profound implications on the theory of computability and on how we use computers in everyday practice. The problem can be phrased:

: &quot;Given a description of a Turing machine and its initial input, determine whether the program, when executed on this input, ever halts (completes). The alternative is that it runs forever without halting.&quot;

Here we are asking not a simple question about a prime number or a palindrome, but we are instead turning the tables and asking a Turing machine to answer a question about another Turing machine. It can be shown (See main article: Halting problem) that it is not possible to construct a Turing machine that can answer this question in all cases.

That is, the only general way to know for sure if a given program will halt on a particular input in all cases is simply to run it and see if it halts. If it does halt, then you know it halts. If it doesn&#x27;t halt, however, you may never know if it will eventually halt. The language consisting of all Turing machine descriptions paired with all possible input streams on which those Turing machines will eventually halt, is not recursive. The halting problem is therefore called non-computable or undecidable.

An extension of the halting problem is called Rice&#x27;s theorem, which states that it is undecidable (in general) whether a given language possesses any specific nontrivial property.

==== Beyond recursively enumerable languages ====
The halting problem is easy to solve, however, if we allow that the Turing machine that decides it may run forever when given input which is a representation of a Turing machine that does not itself halt. The halting language is therefore recursively enumerable. It is possible to construct languages which are not even recursively enumerable, however.

A simple example of such a language is the complement of the halting language; that is the language consisting of all Turing machines paired with input strings where the Turing machines do &quot;not&quot; halt on their input. To see that this language is not recursively enumerable, imagine that we construct a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which is able to give a definite answer for all such Turing machines, but that it may run forever on any Turing machine that does eventually halt. We can then construct another Turing machine formula_13 that simulates the operation of this machine, along with simulating directly the execution of the machine given in the input as well, by interleaving the execution of the two programs. Since the direct simulation will eventually halt if the program it is simulating halts, and since by assumption the simulation of &quot;M&quot; will eventually halt if the input program would never halt, we know that formula_13 will eventually have one of its parallel versions halt. formula_13 is thus a decider for the halting problem. We have previously shown, however, that the halting problem is undecidable. We have a contradiction, and we have thus shown that our assumption that &quot;M&quot; exists is incorrect. The complement of the halting language is therefore not recursively enumerable.

== Concurrency-based models ==
A number of computational models based on concurrency have been developed, including the parallel random-access machine and the Petri net. These models of concurrent computation still do not implement any mathematical functions that cannot be implemented by Turing machines.

== Stronger models of computation ==
The Church–Turing thesis conjectures that there is no effective model of computing that can compute more mathematical functions than a Turing machine. Computer scientists have imagined many varieties of hypercomputers, models of computation that go beyond Turing computability.

=== Infinite execution ===

Imagine a machine where each step of the computation requires half the time of the previous step (and hopefully half the energy of the previous step...). If we normalize to 1/2 time unit the amount of time required for the first step (and to 1/2 energy unit the amount of energy required for the first step...), the execution would require

:formula_16

time unit (and 1 energy unit...) to run. This infinite series converges to 1, which means that this Zeno machine can execute a countably infinite number of steps in 1 time unit (using 1 energy unit...). This machine is capable of deciding the halting problem by directly simulating the execution of the machine in question. By extension, any convergent infinite [must be provably infinite] series would work. Assuming that the infinite series converges to a value &quot;n&quot;, the Zeno machine would complete a countably infinite execution in &quot;n&quot; time units.

=== Oracle machines ===

So-called Oracle machines have access to various &quot;oracles&quot; which provide the solution to specific undecidable problems. For example, the Turing machine may have a &quot;halting oracle&quot; which answers immediately whether a given Turing machine will ever halt on a given input. These machines are a central topic of study in recursion theory.

=== Limits of hyper-computation ===
Even these machines, which seemingly represent the limit of automata that we could imagine, run into their own limitations. While each of them can solve the halting problem for a Turing machine, they cannot solve their own version of the halting problem. For example, an Oracle machine cannot answer the question of whether a given Oracle machine will ever halt.

<doc id="442137" wikidata="Q1036748" url="?curid=442137" title="Loss function">
<text>In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function) is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some &quot;cost&quot; associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.

In statistics, typically a loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century. In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret. In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.
==Examples==

===Regret===

Leonard J. Savage argued that using non-Bayesian methods such as minimax, the loss function should be based on the idea of &quot;regret&quot;, i.e., the loss associated with a decision should be the difference between the consequences of the best decision that could have been made under circumstances will be known and the decision that was in fact taken before they were known.

===Quadratic loss function===

The use of a quadratic loss function is common, for example when using least squares techniques. It is often more mathematically tractable than other loss functions because of the properties of variances, as well as being symmetric: an error above the target causes the same loss as the same magnitude of error below the target. If the target is &quot;t&quot;, then a quadratic loss function is
:formula_1
for some constant &quot;C&quot;; the value of the constant makes no difference to a decision, and can be ignored by setting it equal to 1. This is also known as the squared error loss (SEL).

Many common statistics, including t-tests, regression models, design of experiments, and much else, use least squares methods applied using linear regression theory, which is based on the quadratic loss function.

The quadratic loss function is also used in linear-quadratic optimal control problems. In these problems, even in the absence of uncertainty, it may not be possible to achieve the desired values of all target variables. Often loss is expressed as a quadratic form in the deviations of the variables of interest from their desired values; this approach is tractable because it results in linear first-order conditions. In the context of stochastic control, the expected value of the quadratic form is used. The quadratic loss assigns more importance to outliers than to the true data due to its square nature, so alternatives like the Huber, Log-Cosh and SMAE losses are used when the data has many large outliers.
===0-1 loss function===

In statistics and decision theory, a frequently used loss function is the &quot;0-1 loss function&quot;

: formula_2

using Iverson bracket notation, i.e. it evaluates to 1 when formula_3, and 0 otherwise.

==Constructing loss and objective functions==

In many applications, objective functions, including loss functions as a particular case, are determined by the problem formulation. In other situations, the decision maker’s preference must be elicited and represented by a scalar-valued function (called also utility function) in a form suitable for optimization — the problem that Ragnar Frisch has highlighted in his Nobel Prize lecture.
The existing methods for constructing objective functions are collected in the proceedings of two dedicated conferences.
In particular, Andranik Tangian showed that the most usable objective functions — quadratic and additive — are determined by a few indifference points. He used this property in the models for constructing these objective functions from either ordinal or cardinal data that were elicited through computer-assisted interviews with decision makers. 
Among other things, he constructed objective functions to optimally distribute budgets for 16 Westfalian universities
and the European subsidies for equalizing unemployment rates among 271 German regions.

==Expected loss==

In some contexts, the value of the loss function itself is a random quantity because it depends on the outcome of a random variable &quot;X&quot;. 

===Statistics===
Both frequentist and Bayesian statistical theory involve making a decision based on the expected value of the loss function; however, this quantity is defined differently under the two paradigms.

====Frequentist expected loss====
We first define the expected loss in the frequentist context. It is obtained by taking the expected value with respect to the probability distribution, &quot;P&quot;&quot;θ&quot;, of the observed data, &quot;X&quot;. This is also referred to as the risk function of the decision rule &quot;δ&quot; and the parameter &quot;θ&quot;. Here the decision rule depends on the outcome of &quot;X&quot;. The risk function is given by:

: formula_4

Here, &quot;θ&quot; is a fixed but possibly unknown state of nature, &quot;X&quot; is a vector of observations stochastically drawn from a population, formula_5 is the expectation over all population values of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;dP&quot;&quot;θ&quot; is a probability measure over the event space of &quot;X&quot; (parametrized by &quot;θ&quot;) and the integral is evaluated over the entire support of &quot;X&quot;.

====Bayes Risk ====
In a Bayesian approach, the expectation is calculated using the prior distribution * of the parameter &quot;θ&quot;:

:formula_6

where m(x) is known as the &quot;predictive likelihood&quot; wherein θ has been &quot;integrated out,&quot; * (θ | x) is the posterior distribution, and the order of integration has been changed. One then should choose the action &quot;a*&quot; which minimises this expected loss, which is referred to as &quot;Bayes Risk&quot;. 
In the latter equation, the integrand inside dx is known as the &quot;Posterior Risk&quot;, and minimising it with respect to decision &quot;a&quot; also minimizes the overall Bayes Risk. This optimal decision, &quot;a*&quot; is known as the &quot;Bayes (decision) Rule&quot; - it minimises the average loss over all possible states of nature θ, over all possible (probability-weighted) data outcomes. One advantage of the Bayesian approach is to that one need only choose the optimal action under the actual observed data to obtain a uniformly optimal one, whereas choosing the actual frequentist optimal decision rule as a function of all possible observations, is a much more difficult problem. Of equal importance though, the Bayes Rule reflects consideration of loss outcomes under different states of nature, θ.

====Examples in statistics====
* For a scalar parameter &quot;θ&quot;, a decision function whose output formula_7 is an estimate of &quot;θ&quot;, and a quadratic loss function (squared error loss) formula_8 the risk function becomes the mean squared error of the estimate, formula_9An Estimator found by minimizing the Mean squared error estimates the Posterior distribution&#x27;s mean.
* In density estimation, the unknown parameter is probability density itself. The loss function is typically chosen to be a norm in an appropriate function space. For example, for &quot;L&quot;2 norm, formula_10 the risk function becomes the mean integrated squared error formula_11

===Economic choice under uncertainty===

In economics, decision-making under uncertainty is often modelled using the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function of the uncertain variable of interest, such as end-of-period wealth. Since the value of this variable is uncertain, so is the value of the utility function; it is the expected value of utility that is maximized.

==Decision rules==
A decision rule makes a choice using an optimality criterion. Some commonly used criteria are:

*Minimax: Choose the decision rule with the lowest worst loss — that is, minimize the worst-case (maximum possible) loss: formula_12
*Invariance: Choose the decision rule which satisfies an invariance requirement.
*Choose the decision rule with the lowest average loss (i.e. minimize the expected value of the loss function): formula_13

==Selecting a loss function==
Sound statistical practice requires selecting an estimator consistent with the actual acceptable variation experienced in the context of a particular applied problem. Thus, in the applied use of loss functions, selecting which statistical method to use to model an applied problem depends on knowing the losses that will be experienced from being wrong under the problem&#x27;s particular circumstances.

A common example involves estimating &quot;location&quot;. Under typical statistical assumptions, the mean or average is the statistic for estimating location that minimizes the expected loss experienced under the squared-error loss function, while the median is the estimator that minimizes expected loss experienced under the absolute-difference loss function. Still different estimators would be optimal under other, less common circumstances.

In economics, when an agent is risk neutral, the objective function is simply expressed as the expected value of a monetary quantity, such as profit, income, or end-of-period wealth. For risk-averse or risk-loving agents, loss is measured as the negative of a utility function, and the objective function to be optimized is the expected value of utility.

Other measures of cost are possible, for example mortality or morbidity in the field of public health or safety engineering.

For most optimization algorithms, it is desirable to have a loss function that is globally continuous and differentiable.

Two very commonly used loss functions are the squared loss, formula_14, and the absolute loss, formula_15. However the absolute loss has the disadvantage that it is not differentiable at formula_16. The squared loss has the disadvantage that it has the tendency to be dominated by outliers—when summing over a set of formula_17&#x27;s (as in formula_18), the final sum tends to be the result of a few particularly large &quot;a&quot;-values, rather than an expression of the average &quot;a&quot;-value.

The choice of a loss function is not arbitrary. It is very restrictive and sometimes the loss function may be characterized by its desirable properties. Among the choice principles are, for example, the requirement of completeness of the class of symmetric statistics in the case of i.i.d. observations, the principle of complete information, and some others.

W. Edwards Deming and Nassim Nicholas Taleb argue that empirical reality, not nice mathematical properties, should be the sole basis for selecting loss functions, and real losses often are not mathematically nice and are not differentiable, continuous, symmetric, etc. For example, a person who arrives before a plane gate closure can still make the plane, but a person who arrives after can not, a discontinuity and asymmetry which makes arriving slightly late much more costly than arriving slightly early. In drug dosing, the cost of too little drug may be lack of efficacy, while the cost of too much may be tolerable toxicity, another example of asymmetry. Traffic, pipes, beams, ecologies, climates, etc. may tolerate increased load or stress with little noticeable change up to a point, then become backed up or break catastrophically. These situations, Deming and Taleb argue, are common in real-life problems, perhaps more common than classical smooth, continuous, symmetric, differentials cases.

<text>Edward William Felten (born March 25, 1963) is an American computer scientist. At Princeton University, he served as the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs, as well as being director of the Center for Information Technology Policy from 2007 to 2015 and from 2017 to 2019. In the Obama administration, he served as chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission from 2011 to 2012 and as deputy chief technology officer of the United States from 2015 to 2017. Felten retired from Princeton University in July 2021.

Felten has done a variety of computer security research, including work on proof-carrying authentication and work on security related to the Java programming language, but he is perhaps best known for his paper on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) challenge.

In 2018, Felten started to serve as board member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a term that ended on January 29, 2025.

==Biography==
Felten attended the California Institute of Technology and graduated with a degree in physics in 1985. He worked as a staff programmer at Caltech from 1986 to 1989 on a parallel supercomputer project at Caltech. He then enrolled as a graduate student in computer science at the University of Washington. He was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1991 and a Ph.D. in 1993. His Ph.D. thesis was on developing an automated protocol for communication between parallel processors.

In 1993, he joined the faculty of Princeton University in the department of computer science as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1999 and to professor in 2003. In 2006, he joined the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, but computer science remains his home department. In 2005, he became the director of the Center for Information and Technology Policy at Princeton. He has served as a consultant to law firms, corporations, private foundations, and government agencies. His research involves computer security, and technology policy.

He lives in Princeton, New Jersey with his family. From 2006 to 2010, he was a member of the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In 2007, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

In November 2010, he was named Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.

In 2013, Felton was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to security of computer systems, and for impact on public policy.

On May 11, 2015, he was named Deputy U.S. Chief Technology Officer for The White House.

==&quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;==
Felten was a witness for the United States government in &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;, where the software company was charged with committing a variety of antitrust crimes. During the trial, Microsoft&#x27;s attorneys denied that it was possible to remove the Internet Explorer web browser from a Windows 98 equipped computer without significantly impairing the operation of Windows.

Citing research he had undertaken with Christian Hicks and Peter Creath, two of his former students, Felten testified that it was possible to remove Internet Explorer functionality from Windows without causing any problems with the operating system. He demonstrated his team&#x27;s tool in court, showing 19 ways in which it is normally possible to access the web browser from the Windows platform that his team&#x27;s tool rendered inaccessible.

Microsoft argued that Felten&#x27;s changes did not truly remove Internet Explorer but only made its functionality inaccessible to the end user by removing icons, shortcuts and the iexplore.exe executable file, and making changes to the system registry. This led to a debate as to what exactly constitutes the &quot;web browser,&quot; since much of the core functionality of Internet Explorer is stored in a shared dynamic-link library, accessible to any program running under Windows.

Microsoft also argued that Felten&#x27;s tool did not even completely remove web-browsing capability from the system since it was still possible to access the web through other Windows executables besides iexplore.exe, such as the Windows help system.

==The SDMI challenge==
As part of a contest in 2000, SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative) invited researchers and others to try to break the digital audio watermark technologies that they had devised. In a series of individual challenges, the participants were given a sample audio piece, with one of the watermarks embedded. If the participants sent back the sample with the watermark removed (and with less than an acceptable amount of signal loss, though this condition was not stated by SDMI), they would win that particular challenge.

Felten was an initial participant of the contest. He chose to opt out of confidentiality agreements that would have made his team eligible for the cash prize. Despite being given very little or no information about the watermarking technologies other than the audio samples and having only three weeks to work with them, Felten and his team managed to modify the files sufficiently that SDMI&#x27;s automated judging system declared the watermark removed.

SDMI did not accept that Felten had successfully broken the watermark according to the rules of the contest, noting that there was a requirement for files to lose no sound quality. SDMI claimed that the automated judging result was inconclusive, as a submission which simply wiped all the sounds off the file would have successfully removed the watermark but would not meet the quality requirement.

===SDMI lawsuits===
Felten&#x27;s team developed a scientific paper explaining the methods used by his team in defeating the SDMI watermarks. Planning to present the paper at the Fourth International Information Hiding Workshop of 2001 in Pittsburgh, Felten was threatened with legal action by SDMI, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and Verance Corporation, under the terms of the DMCA, on the argument that one of the technologies his team had broken was currently in use in the market. Felten withdrew the presentation from the workshop, reading a brief statement about the threats instead. SDMI and other copyright holders denied that they had ever threatened to sue Felten. However, SDMI appears to have threatened legal action when spokesman Matt Oppenheim warned Felten in a letter that &quot;any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public Challenge...could subject you and your research team to actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.&quot;. This has been described as a case of censorship by copyright.

Felten, with help from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sued the groups, requesting a declaratory judgement ruling that their publication of the paper would be legal. The case was dismissed for a lack of standing.

Felten presented his paper at the USENIX security conference in 2001. 
The United States Department of Justice has offered Felten and other researchers assurances that the DMCA does not threaten their work and stated that the legal threats against them were invalid.

==Sony rootkit investigation==

The 2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal started when security researcher Mark Russinovich revealed on October 31, 2005 that Sony&#x27;s Extended Copy Protection (&quot;XCP&quot;) copy protection software on the CD &quot;Get Right with the Man&quot; by Van Zant contained hidden files that could damage the operating system, install spyware and make the user&#x27;s computer vulnerable to attack when the CD was played on a Microsoft Windows-based PC. Sony then released a software patch to remove XCP.

On November 15, 2005, Felten and J. Alex Halderman showed that Sony&#x27;s method for removing XCP copy protection software from the computer makes it more vulnerable to attack, as it essentially installed a rootkit, in the form of an Active X control used by the uninstaller, and left it on the user&#x27;s machine and set so as to allow any web page visited by the user to execute arbitrary code. Felten and Halderman described the problem in a blog post:
The consequences of the flaw are severe, it allows any Web page you visit to download, install, and run any code it likes on your computer. Any Web page can seize control of your computer; then it can do anything it likes. That&#x27;s about as serious as a security flaw can get.

==Diebold voting machine analysis==

On September 13, 2006, Felten and graduate students Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman discovered severe security flaws in a Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions) voting machine. Their findings claimed, &quot;Malicious software running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little if any risk of detection. The malicious software can modify all of the records, audit logs, and counters kept by the voting machine, so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss.&quot;

==Sequoia voting machine analysis==
In early 2008, New Jersey election officials announced that they planned to send one or more Sequoia Advantage voting machines to Ed Felten and Andrew Appel (also of Princeton University) for analysis. In March 2008, Sequoia sent an e-mail to Professor Felten asserting that allowing him to examine Sequoia voting machines would violate the license agreement between Sequoia and the county which bought them, and also that Sequoia would take legal action &quot;to stop [...] any non-compliant analysis, [...] publication of Sequoia software, its behavior, reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property.&quot;

This action sparked outrage among computer technology activists.

After examining Sequoia&#x27;s machines, Felten and Appel indeed discovered grave problems with the accuracy of the machines. They also demonstrated that the machines can be hacked and compromised within minutes.

Shortly after that, Sequoia&#x27;s corporate Web site was hacked. The hack was first discovered by Ed Felten. Sequoia took its Web site down on 20 March and removed the &quot;intrusive content.&quot;

==Cold boot attack==

In February 2008, Felten and his students were part of the team that discovered the cold boot attack, which allows someone with physical access to a computer to bypass operating system protections and extract the contents of its memory.

==Federal Trade Commission==

In November 2010, Felten was named the first Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission, for which he took a one-year leave of absence from Princeton University.

<text>Pigott Street is a road in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, London. The blocks of flats on it form part of the last phase of the building of the Lansbury Estate, and border the southern end of Burdett Road on the west.
The housing was completed in 1982 by the Greater London Council, although earlier phases in the Lansbury Estate were implemented by the London County Council. In 1998, ownership of part of the estate including Pigott Street transferred to a local housing association, Poplar HARCA.

Along with various other nearby streets, it is named after the family of Francis Pigott Stainsby Conant, MP for Reading Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man 1860–1863. This family held of land in Poplar and Limehouse in the 19th century.

<doc id="442145" wikidata="Q3654309" url="?curid=442145" title="Football in Lebanon">
<text>Football is the most popular sport in Lebanon. It was introduced to Lebanon in the late-19th century, becoming particularly popular among teachers and students Christian schools. The Lebanese Football Association (LFA) was formed in 1933 as one of the earliest administrative bodies for association football in the Middle East. The Lebanon national team made its unofficial debut in 1935 against Romanian club CA Timișoara (T.A.C.), while their first official FIFA game was in 1940 against Mandatory Palestine.

Armenian clubs, namely Homenetmen and Homenmen, led the early football scene between the 1940s and the 1960s; the civil war between 1975 and 1990 made it impossible to practice football in Lebanon. Ansar became the dominating force in the country between the 1990s and the early-2000s, winning 11 consecutive league titles. In the 21st century, Ansar, Nejmeh, and Ahed (the latter in particular starting from the 2010s) formed a Lebanese &quot;Big Three&quot;, winning the majority of the titles. Indeed, historically, the country&#x27;s most-supported clubs are Ansar and Nejmeh, with Ahed gaining popularity in recent years.

While the Lebanon national team has never won a major title internationally, Ahed became the first Lebanese club to win the AFC Cup in 2019. The national under-18 team was the first Lebanon men&#x27;s national team to play in a final, finishing as runners-up in the 2021 WAFF U-18 Championship.

==History==

=== Late 1800s–1940 ===

Football in Lebanon was introduced by the educated class in Lebanon. First played by foreign teachers at the American University of Beirut (AUB) in the late-1800s, football quickly grew in popularity with the immigration of Armenians to Lebanon during the French Mandate. Football was seen as an elite activity, and was mainly played in Christian schools.

In 1931 Khalil Hilmi, a member of Riyadi, attempted to form a Federation. However, the proposal failed as Nahda opposed the formation. On 22 March 1933, representatives of thirteen football clubs gathered in the Minet El Hosn district in Beirut to form the Lebanese Football Association (LFA). Hussein Sejaan was the LFA&#x27;s first president. Lebanon was one of the first nations in the Middle East to establish an administrative body for association football. The Lebanese Premier League began in May 1934, with Nahda winning the first title. The LFA joined FIFA in 1936.

The first activity of the Lebanese national team began in 1935. Beirut XI, representing Lebanon, played against CA Timișoara (T.A.C.) of Romania: the game was considered the national team&#x27;s first. The national team&#x27;s first official FIFA game was a 5–1 loss to Mandatory Palestine on 27 April 1940, with Camille Cordahi scoring Lebanon&#x27;s first official international goal.

=== Early history (1940–1975) ===

Most clubs were born on the basis of sectarianism, such as Sagesse being Maronite Christian, Nahda a Greek Orthodox team, and Ansar having a predominantly Sunni Muslim fanbase. A rivalry was established between Ansar and another Beirut club, Nejmeh: dubbed the Beirut derby, the match has been considered the biggest club football match in Lebanon.

Between the 1940s and 1960s, Armenian clubs, most notably Homenetmen and Homenmen, were the most prominent in the early Lebanese footballing scene. The two clubs shared 11 league titles in 16 seasons between 1943 and 1969. In 1964 the LFA joined the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

Between the 1960s and 1975 Lebanese football was at its peak, with Nejmeh even beating USSR champions Ararat Yerevan in 1974. In 1975, one week before the Lebanese Civil War, Brazilian player Pelé played a friendly game for Nejmeh against a team of Lebanese Premier League stars. On the day of the game, 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match. From 1975 to 1990, the civil war made it impossible to practice football.

=== Post-Civil War (1990–present) ===

Following the civil war, players from lower-income families began to join football clubs, specifically from impoverished Sunni and Shia areas. Ansar set a Guinness World Record by winning 11 consecutive national titles between 1988 and 1999.

Lebanon hosted the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, with the national team finishing last in the group with only two points. In 2001, the LFA joined the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF) as one of its founding members. From 2000, Nejmeh were the dominating force in Lebanon, winning five out of nine league titles until 2009. In 2005 they reached the final of the AFC Cup, becoming the first Lebanese side to do so. However they lost to Al-Faisaly 4–2 on aggregate. During the 2010s Ahed, who had only won one league title prior, won six league titles. In the 2010–11 season Ahed won the league, cup, Super Cup and Elite Cup, becoming the first team in Lebanon to accomplish both a treble and a quadruple.

After winning the 2018–19 Lebanese Premier League Ahed became the three-time defending champions, a feat accomplished only one other time, by Ansar in 1992. In 2018 the national team qualified for their first ever major tournament: the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. They won their first game in the tournament on 17 January 2019, against North Korea 4–1 in the group stage; however, they narrowly missed out on the knock-out stage on the fair play rule. On 4 November 2019, Ahed became the first Lebanese side to win the AFC Cup after defeating April 25 in the 2019 final. The 2019–20 season was cancelled due to financial reasons amid the then-impending coronavirus pandemic.

==League system==

==Cup competitions==
* The Lebanese FA Cup (1938–present), Nahda won the first title, is the national domestic cup competition. Teams from the Lebanese Premier League, Lebanese Second Division and Lebanese Third Division are eligible to compete in the competition.
* The Lebanese Federation Cup (1969–present) is the domestic league cup, contested by all Lebanese Premier League teams.
* The Lebanese Super Cup (1996–present) is a single match played between the winners of the Lebanese Premier League and the Lebanese FA Cup.
* The Lebanese Elite Cup (1996–2023) was an annual cup competition contested by the top six teams of the previous Lebanese Premier League season.
* The Lebanese Challenge Cup (1913–2023) was an annual cup competition contested by the teams placed between 7th and 10th in the previous Lebanese Premier League season and the two promoted teams from the Lebanese Second Division.

==National teams==

=== Senior ===
The Lebanon national team played its first (unofficial) international game in 1935, against Romanian side CA Timișoara (TAC). Their first FIFA-ratified game came in 1940, in a 5–1 defeat to Mandatory Palestine.

Lebanon hosted the 2000 AFC Asian Cup and were eliminated from the group stage. They participated in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, their first through regular qualification, winning their first game in the competition against North Korea in the group stage. However, Lebanon narrowly missed out on the knock-out stages by the fair-play rule.

=== Youth ===
At youth level, the U20 team took part in the AFC U-20 Asian Cup twice, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1973 edition. The U18 team made history as the first Lebanon men&#x27;s national team to play in a final, finishing as runners-up in the 2021 WAFF U-18 Championship after losing to hosts Iraq on penalty shoot-outs. A year later, the U16 team reached the final of the 2022 WAFF U-16 Championship, where they lost to hosts Jordan 1–0.

==Women&#x27;s football==
Women&#x27;s football in Lebanon, while initially not very popular due to the social stigma attached to it, has seen a rise in popularity in the late-2010s. It is mainly played in the affluent areas of the country. The Lebanese Women&#x27;s Football League was founded in 2008, with Sadaka winning the first title. Safa became the first Lebanese women&#x27;s team to win an international competition, after winning the 2022 edition of the WAFF Women&#x27;s Clubs Championship.

The women&#x27;s national team came runners-up in the WAFF Women&#x27;s Championship in 2022, and in third place in 2007 and in 2019. In 2015, the women&#x27;s under-17 team became the first Lebanese national football team to win a title, after being crowned 2015 Arab U-17 Women&#x27;s Cup champions. In 2019, Lebanon won both the WAFF U-15 Girls Championship and the WAFF U-18 Girls Championship, while in 2022 they won the WAFF U-18 Girls Championship for the second time.

<doc id="442146" wikidata="Q208615" url="?curid=442146" title="Queen Mary of Denmark">
<text>Mary (born Mary Elizabeth Donaldson; 5 February 1972) is Queen of Denmark as the wife of King Frederik X.

Mary met Frederik (then Crown Prince of Denmark) while attending the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. They married on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral. They have four children: Christian, Isabella, Vincent and Josephine. Since her marriage, she has carried out engagements on behalf of the Danish monarchy, and she serves as patron of over 30 charitable organisations, including the United Nations Population Fund, the European regional office of the World Health Organization, the Danish Refugee Council and Julemærkefonden. She founded her award-winning social organisation, the Mary Foundation, in 2007.

In 2019, Mary was made a &quot;rigsforstander&quot;, which allows her to act as regent when the monarch is abroad. She became the first Australian-born queen consort of any country upon the abdication of her mother-in-law, Queen Margrethe II, on 14 January 2024. She has the additional title of Countess of Monpezat after her husband was given the title in 2008.

==Early life==
Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was born 5 February 1972 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point, a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania. She is youngest of four children to Scottish parents, Henrietta (née Horne), an executive assistant to the vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania, and John Dalgleish Donaldson, an academic, mathematics professor and member of the Clan Donald. Her paternal grandfather was Captain Peter Donaldson (1911–1978). She was named after her grandmothers, Mary Dalgleish and Elizabeth Gibson Melrose, and was born and raised in Hobart. She has two older sisters, Jane Stephens and Patricia Bailey, and an older brother, John Stuart Donaldson. Her mother died from complications following heart surgery on 20 November 1997, when Mary was 25. In 2001, her father married the British author and novelist Susan Moody (née Horwood).

During her childhood, Mary was involved in sports and other extracurricular activities both at school and elsewhere. She studied music, playing piano, flute, and clarinet, and played basketball and hockey.

==Education==
Mary began schooling at Clear Lake City Elementary School in Houston, Texas, when her father, a professor of applied mathematics, worked at the Johnson Space Center. She then moved to Sandy Bay, Tasmania, from 1975 to 1977. Her primary education, from 1978 to 1983, was at Waimea Heights with her secondary schooling (1984–1987) being at Taroona High School, and at Hobart College (1988–1989). She studied at the University of Tasmania from 1990 to 1994, graduating with a combined Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws degree on 27 May 1995. From 1994 to 1996, she attended a graduate program and qualified with certificates in advertising from the Advertising Federation of Australia (AFA) and direct marketing from the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA).

Her native language is English, and she studied French during her secondary education. In 2002, she briefly worked as an English tutor in Paris while dating Crown Prince Frederik. After moving to Denmark and before her marriage, Mary studied Danish as a foreign language at Studieskolen in Copenhagen in 2003.

==Career==
Mary worked for Australian and global advertising agencies after graduating in 1995. Upon graduation she moved to Melbourne to work in advertising. She became a trainee in marketing and communications with the Melbourne office of DDB Needham, taking a position of account executive. In 1996, she was employed by Mojo Partners as an account manager. In 1998, six months after her mother&#x27;s death, she resigned and travelled to America and Europe. In Edinburgh, she worked for three months as an account manager with Rapp Collins Worldwide; then, in early 1999, she was appointed as an account director with the international advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam in Sydney.

In June 2000, Mary moved to a smaller Australian agency, Love Branding, working for a short time as its first account director. In the (Australian) spring of 2000, she became sales director and a member of the management team of Belle Property, a real estate firm. In the first half of 2002, Mary taught English at a business school in Paris, but upon moving to Denmark permanently, she was employed by Microsoft Business Solutions (5 September 2002 – 24 September 2003) near Copenhagen as a project consultant for business development, communications and marketing.

==Personal life==
===Courtship and engagement===
Mary met Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark at the Slip Inn in 2000 during the Summer Olympics in Sydney. Frederik was at the bar with his brother Prince Joachim, his cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, as well as the then Felipe, Prince of Asturias and Princess Märtha Louise of Norway. Felipe knew Mary&#x27;s flatmate. Frederik was not identified by her friends as the Crown Prince of Denmark until after they met. They conducted a long-distance relationship and Frederik made several discreet visits to Australia. On 15 November 2001, the Danish weekly magazine &quot;Billed Bladet&quot; named Mary as Frederik&#x27;s girlfriend. She moved from Australia to Denmark in December 2001, while she was working as an English tutor in Paris.

On 24 September 2003, the Danish court announced that Queen Margrethe II intended to give her consent to the marriage at the State Council meeting scheduled for 8 October 2003. Frederik had presented Mary with an engagement ring featuring an emerald-cut diamond and two emerald-cut ruby baguettes, which are similar to the colour of Denmark&#x27;s flag. The couple became officially engaged on 8 October 2003.

===Marriage and children===

Mary and Frederik married on 14 May 2004 in Copenhagen Cathedral. The couple reportedly spent their honeymoon in Africa.

The couple have four children:
*Crown Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John, born 15 October 2005 at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen 
*Princess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, born 21 April 2007 at Rigshospitalet
*Prince Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander, born 8 January 2011 at Rigshospitalet
*Princess Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda, born 8 January 2011 at Rigshospitalet

The Danish Folketing (parliament) passed a special law (Mary&#x27;s Law) giving Mary Danish citizenship upon her marriage, a standard procedure for new foreign members of the royal family. She was previously a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom. Formerly a Presbyterian, she converted to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark upon marriage.

As a native English speaker, Mary&#x27;s priority from the time of her engagement was to become fluent in Danish, and she acknowledged in several interviews at the time of her engagement and marriage that this was a challenge for her.

Mary and her family reside at Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, one of the four palaces that make up the Amalienborg Palace complex. Since May 2004 they have also resided at the Chancellery House, a building in the park at Fredensborg Palace, during the summer months.

Mary is a keen equestrian and has competed at several dressage events.

Mary is the godmother of, among others, Princess Estelle of Sweden, who was also given the secondary name Mary in her honour, and her nephew, Count Henrik of Monpezat (then Prince Henrik of Denmark).

==Queen consort==
Mary became Queen of Denmark upon the abdication of Queen Margrethe II and the subsequent accession of her husband as King Frederik X on 14 January 2024. After he was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, Mary joined Frederik on the balcony to wave to the crowds. The next day, 15 January, the royal family attended a ceremony at the Folketing to mark the change of monarch, and on 21 January, they attended a service at Aarhus Cathedral.

The King and Queen made their first state visits from 6–7 and 14–15 May 2024 when they visited Sweden and Norway. In June, they toured one of the autonomous territories of the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland. In 2025, they will tour the other territory, the Faroe Islands.

==Public life, charities and patronages==
Following the wedding, the Crown Prince couple embarked upon a summer working-tour of mainland Denmark aboard the royal yacht &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, then travelled to Greenland and the 2004 Athens Olympics. In 2005, during the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen, the royal family was involved in related events throughout the year. Frederik and Mary marked the anniversary in London, New York, and in Australia, where she was made Honorary Hans Christian Andersen Ambassador to Australia in the Utzon Room of the Sydney Opera House.

After becoming Crown Princess, Mary made a number of international visits, and Frederik and Mary participated in the reburial ceremonies for Empress Maria Feodorovna in Denmark and Saint Petersburg in 2005. In November 2009, Mary made a surprise visit to Danish soldiers in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. One of her stops was FOB Armadillo.

During a Council of State on 2 October 2019, the Queen&#x27;s request to appoint Mary a &quot;rigsforstander&quot;, a functioning regent when the monarch or the heir is out of the country, was approved by the government. After having sworn to respect the Danish constitution, she became the first person not born into the royal family to assume the position of rigsforstander since Queen Ingrid in 1972.

Mary was voted Woman of the Year 2008 by the Danish magazine &quot;Alt for damerne&quot;, donating her cash reward to charity. She was interviewed by &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; (US), on television programs of Andrew Denton (Australia), and by &quot;USA Today&quot; (US).

She serves on the board of directors of The Royal Danish Collection.

===Patronages and interests===
Since 2004, Mary has steadily worked to establish her relationships with various organisations, their issues, missions, programmes and staff. Her patronages range across areas of culture, the fashion industry, humanitarian aid, support for research and science, social and health patronages and sport. The organisations of which she is patron have reported positive outcomes through their relationships with her and there are various reports in the Danish media and on some of the organisations&#x27; websites about her being quite involved in her working relationship with them. She is currently involved in supporting anti-obesity programs through the World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe.

In the context of immigrant issues in Denmark, Mary has visited the disadvantaged migrant areas of Vollsmose (2006), Gellerup (2007), and Viborg (2010), and has participated in integration projects including the teaching of the Danish language to refugees. As patron of the Danish Refugee Council, Mary visited Uganda (2008) and East Africa (2011) and supports fundraising for the region.

Mary has played an active role in promoting an anti-bullying program based on an Australian model through the auspices of Denmark&#x27;s Save the Children. She is also involved in a campaign to raise awareness and safe practices among Danes about skin cancer through The Danish Cancer Society.

Mary is also an Honorary Life Governor of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute based at the Garvan Institute/St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, a member of the International Committee of Women Leaders for Mental Health and a member of various sporting clubs (riding, golf and yachting). In June 2010, it was announced that Mary had become Patron of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, &quot;to support the agency&#x27;s work to promote maternal health and safer motherhood in more than 150 developing nations&quot;. Mary lends her support to a number of other &quot;one-off&quot; Danish causes, industry events, and international conferences. In 2011, the Westmead Cancer Centre at Westmead Hospital in Sydney was renamed the Crown Princess Mary Cancer Care Centre Westmead.

Mary is an active patron of Denmark&#x27;s third-highest-earning export industry, the fashion industry, and is Patron of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit.

===The Mary Foundation===
On 11 September 2007, Mary announced the establishment of the at an inaugural meeting at Amalienborg Palace. The foundation&#x27;s aim is to improve lives compromised by environment, heredity, illness, or other circumstances that can isolate or exclude people socially. The initial funds of DKK 1.1 million were collected in Denmark and Greenland and donated to Frederik and Mary as a wedding gift in 2004. Mary is Chairwoman of eight trusts. In 2014, she received a Bambi Award for her work with the foundation.

===LGBT rights===
In 2016, on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, Mary gave a speech on LGBT rights at a forum in Copenhagen hosted by the Danish government. She called for an end to discrimination, oppression, and violence against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In January 2018, Mary delivered her speech on LGBTQ+ equality at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. On 25 April 2018, she was invited to present the honorary award to LGBT Danmark at the Danish Rainbow Awards – AXGIL 2018. She thus became the first ever member of the royal family to attend the Danish Rainbow Awards. She also attended the awards ceremony in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, Mary spoke at Copenhagen Pride&#x27;s virtual pride festival.

In October 2019, it was announced that Mary would serve as patron of WorldPride Copenhagen 2021, making her the first ever royal to serve as patron for a major LGBT event. She carried out numerous engagements in connection with the event and also gave the closing speech of the week-long celebrations on 21 August 2021.

Mary has been named one of the world&#x27;s most fashionable people in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; annual International Best-Dressed List and has posed and given interviews for magazines including &quot;Vogue Australia&quot; (where she used pieces of foreign designers, such as Hugo Boss, Prada, Louis Vuitton or Gaultier, and Danish designers, like Malene Birger and Georg Jensen), &quot;Dansk&quot; (Danish Magazine, dedicated to Danish fashion) and German &quot;Vogue&quot; (where she was photographed between pieces of Danish modern art in Amalienborg Palace). Mary also posed for other magazines during her life as a royal, such as &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (to which she spoke on several occasions about her life as a royal and her family), and &quot;Parade&quot;.

In 2010 her elegance was praised by designer Tommy Hilfiger, who remarked &quot;I&#x27;ve seen pictures of her and she dresses really well. Mary has a very sophisticated, European style that is also worthy of a princess&quot;.

===50th birthday celebrations===
Numerous official events were planned for the week of Mary&#x27;s 50th birthday on 5 February 2022. Several of these, including a gala dinner at Rosenborg Castle, were cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but several hundred Danes showed up at Amalienborg&#x27;s courtyard at noon on Mary&#x27;s birthday. Rather than stepping out onto Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace&#x27;s balcony as is customary for birthday celebrations in the Danish royal family, Mary and her three oldest children came out onto the courtyard to thank the people who had shown up. The day after her birthday, the Crown Prince family attended a televised concert held in her honour named &quot;Mary 50 – we’re celebrating Denmark&#x27;s Crown Princess&quot; hosted by TV2.

For Mary&#x27;s 50th birthday, several places in Denmark were named in her honour: The University of Copenhagen created a knowledge centre named the &quot;Crown Princess Mary Centre&quot; in which Mary will be part of the Advisory Committee; Rigshospitalet, the Copenhagen University Hospital, named their new department for children, teenagers, expecting mothers and their families &quot;Mary Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital&quot; in honour of Mary&#x27;s extensive work with the well-being of children and youths, maternal health and the hospital&#x27;s network for children with cancer; and Copenhagen Zoo named the Australia-themed section of their garden &quot;Mary&#x27;s Australian Garden&quot;.

===Arms===

With the marriage in 2004, Queen Mary was invested with the Order of the Elephant, and her father John Dalgleish Donaldson with the Order of the Dannebrog. In accordance with the statutes of the Danish Royal Orders, both Mary and her father were granted personal coats of arms, displayed on a stall plate in the Chapel of the Royal Orders at Frederiksborg Castle. The main field of Mary&#x27;s coat of arms is Or-coloured and shows a MacDonald Gules eagle and a Sable-coloured boat both symbolising her Scottish ancestry. The Chief is Azure-coloured and shows two gold Commonwealth Stars from the arms of Australia, and a gold rose in between, depicting her personal symbol. The shield is surmounted by the Royal Crown of Denmark, and surrounded by the Collar of the Order of the Elephant.

The coat of arms of her father, Professor John Donaldson, is almost identical to that of the Queen, but a gold infinity symbol symbolises his career as an Australian mathematician, instead of her gold Rose. Above his shield is instead placed a barred helmet topped with a gules rampant lion, which is turned outward. The lion is derived from the arms of Scotland and also from the arms of Tasmania and Hobart. Both armorial bearings were granted in 2006 and installed in the Chapel of the Royal Orders in 2007.

<text>Frank Raymond &quot;F. R.&quot; Leavis ( ; 14 July 1895 – 14 April 1978) was an English literary critic of the early-to-mid-twentieth century. He taught for much of his career at Downing College, Cambridge, and later at the University of York.

Leavis ranked among the most prominent English-language critics in the 1950s and 1960s. J. B. Bamborough wrote of him in 1963: &quot;it would be true to say that in the last thirty or more years hardly anyone seriously concerned with the study of English literature has not been influenced by him in some way.&quot;

According to Clive James, &quot;You became accustomed to seeing him walk briskly along Trinity Street, gown blown out horizontal in his slipstream. He looked as if walking briskly was something he had practised in a wind-tunnel.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Leavis was born in Cambridge in 1895 to Harry Leavis (1862–1921) and Kate Sarah Moore (1874–1929). His father was a cultured man who ran a shop in Cambridge that sold pianos and other musical instruments, and his son was to retain a respect for him throughout his life. Leavis was educated at The Perse School in Cambridge (in English terms a Public School), whose headmaster was Dr W. H. D. Rouse. Rouse was a classicist and known for his &quot;direct method&quot;, a practice which required teachers to carry on classroom conversations with their pupils in Latin and classical Greek. Though he had some fluency in foreign languages, Leavis felt that his native language was the only one on which he was able to speak with authority. His extensive reading in the classical languages is not therefore strongly evident in his work.

Leavis had won a scholarship from the Perse School to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, to study history. Britain declared war on Germany soon after he matriculated, when he was 19. Leavis left Cambridge after his first year as an undergraduate and joined the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit (FAU) at York in 1915. After the introduction of conscription in 1916, when his brother Ralph also joined the FAU, he benefited from the blanket recognition of the members of the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit as conscientious objectors. Leavis is quoted as saying: &quot;But after the Bloody Somme there could be no question for anyone who knew what modern war was like of joining the army.&quot;

He worked in France behind the Western Front, carrying a copy of Milton&#x27;s poems with him. His wartime experiences had a lasting effect on him, making him prone to insomnia. He maintained that exposure to poison gas retained in the clothes of soldiers who had been gassed damaged his physical health, but that his poor digestion was due to &quot;...not gas at Ypres, but the things I didn&#x27;t say&quot;. Leavis was slow to recover from the war, and he was later to refer to it as &quot;the great hiatus&quot;. He said: &quot;The war, to put it egotistically, was bad luck for us.&quot;

On his return from the war in 1919, Leavis resumed his studies at Cambridge and obtained a lower second-class in Part I of the history tripos. He then changed his field of study to English and became a pupil in the newly founded English School. Despite graduating with first-class honours in his final examinations, Leavis was not seen as a strong candidate for a research fellowship and instead embarked on a PhD, then an unusual career move for an aspiring academic. In 1924, Leavis presented a thesis on &quot;The Relationship of Journalism to Literature&quot;, which &quot;studied the rise and earlier development of the press in England&quot;. This work contributed to his lifelong concern with the way in which the ethos of a periodical can both reflect and mould the cultural aspirations of a wider public.

==Career==
In 1927 Leavis was appointed as a probationary lecturer for the university, and, when his first substantial publications began to appear a few years later, their style was much influenced by the demands of teaching. In 1929 Leavis married one of his students, Queenie Roth, and this union resulted in a collaboration that yielded many critical works. 1932 was an &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; for them, when Leavis published &quot;New Bearings in English Poetry&quot;, his wife published &quot;Fiction and the Reading Public&quot;, and the quarterly periodical &quot;Scrutiny&quot; was founded. A small publishing house, The Minority Press, was founded by Gordon Fraser, another of Leavis&#x27;s students, in 1930, and served for several years as an additional outlet for the work of Leavis and some of his students.

In 1931 Leavis was appointed director of studies in English at Downing College, where he taught for the next 30 years. He soon founded &quot;Scrutiny&quot;, the critical quarterly that he edited until 1953, using it as a vehicle for the new Cambridge criticism, upholding rigorous intellectual standards and attacking the dilettante elitism he believed to characterise the Bloomsbury Group. &quot;Scrutiny&quot; provided a forum for (on occasion) identifying important contemporary work and (more commonly) reviewing the traditional canon by serious criteria. This criticism was informed by a teacher&#x27;s concern to present the essential to students, taking into consideration time constraints and a limited range of experience. 

Leavis was a friend of Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whom he met at the house of their mutual friend, the logician W.E. Johnson. He later wrote a piece &quot;Memories of Wittgenstein&quot; recalling their friendship. 

&quot;New Bearings in English Poetry&quot; was the first major volume of criticism Leavis was to publish, and it provides insight into his own critical positions. He has been frequently (but often erroneously) associated with the American school of New Critics, a group which advocated close reading and detailed textual analysis of poetry over, or even instead of, an interest in the mind and personality of the poet, sources, the history of ideas and political and social implications. Although there are undoubtedly similarities between Leavis&#x27;s approach to criticism and that of the New Critics (most particularly in that both take the work of art itself as the primary focus of critical discussion), Leavis is ultimately distinguishable from them, since he never adopted (and was explicitly hostile to) a theory of the poem as a self-contained and self-sufficient aesthetic and formal artefact, isolated from the society, culture and tradition from which it emerged. &quot;New Bearings&quot;, devoted principally to Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound, was an attempt to identify the essential new achievements in modern poetry. It also discussed at length and praised the work of Ronald Bottrall, whose importance was not to be confirmed by readers and critics.

In 1933 Leavis published &quot;For Continuity&quot;, which was a selection of &quot;Scrutiny&quot; essays. This publication, along with &quot;Culture and the Environment&quot; (a joint effort with Denys Thompson), stressed the importance of an informed and discriminating, highly trained intellectual elite whose existence within university English departments would help preserve the cultural continuity of English life and literature. In &quot;Education and the University&quot; (1943), Leavis argued that &quot;there is a prior cultural achievement of language; language is not a detachable instrument of thought and communication. It is the historical embodiment of its community&#x27;s assumptions and aspirations at levels which are so subliminal much of the time that language is their only index&quot;.

Leavis is sometimes seen as having contributed to the mythos of Merrie England with his notion of the &quot;organic community&quot;, by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed to have existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the Industrial Revolution. Historians of the era have suggested that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed. No historians of Early Modern Britain have given credence to the notion of the organic community.

In 1948, Leavis focused his attention on fiction and made his general statement about the English novel in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot;, where he traced this claimed tradition through Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. Contentiously, Leavis, and his followers, excluded major authors such as Charles Dickens, Laurence Sterne and Thomas Hardy from his canon, characterising Dickens as a &quot;mere entertainer&quot;, but eventually, following the revaluation of Dickens by Edmund Wilson and George Orwell, Leavis changed his position, publishing &quot;Dickens the Novelist&quot; in 1970. The Leavisites&#x27; downgrading of Hardy may have damaged Leavis&#x27;s own authority. In 1950, in the introduction to &quot;Mill on Bentham and Coleridge&quot;, a publication he edited, Leavis set out the historical importance of utilitarian thought. Leavis found Bentham to epitomize the scientific drift of culture and social thinking, which was in his view the enemy of the holistic, humane understanding he championed.

&quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;, another collection of his essays from &quot;Scrutiny&quot;, was published in 1952. Outside his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavis&#x27;s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, &quot;Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow&quot; at Downing College. Leavis vigorously attacked Snow&#x27;s suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by C. P. Snow (see &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines should have some significant understanding of each other, and that a lack of knowledge of 20th century physics was comparable to an ignorance of Shakespeare. Leavis&#x27;s &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks on Snow&#x27;s intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as Lord Boothby and Lionel Trilling.

Leavis introduced the idea of the &quot;third realm&quot; as a name for the method of existence of literature; works which are not private like a dream or public in the sense of something that can be tripped over, but exist in human minds as a work of collaborative re-constitution. The notion of the &quot;third realm&quot; has not received much attention subsequently.

==Character and reputation==
As Leavis continued his career he became increasingly dogmatic, belligerent and paranoid, and Martin Seymour-Smith found him (and his disciples) to be &quot;fanatic and rancid in manner&quot;. Leavis&#x27;s conduct led to a breach with T. S. Eliot, who wrote

Leavis&#x27;s uncompromising zeal in promoting his views of literature drew mockery from quarters of the literary world involved in imaginative writing. In a letter that Edith Sitwell wrote to Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1959 she described Leavis as &quot;a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak&quot;. Leavis (as &quot;Simon Lacerous&quot;) and Scrutiny (as &quot;Thumbscrew&quot;) were satirized by Frederick Crews in the chapter &quot;Another Book to Cross off your List&quot; of his lampoon of literary criticism theory &quot;The Pooh Perplex A Student Casebook&quot;. In her novel &quot;Possession&quot;, A. S. Byatt (who was herself taught by Leavis) wrote of one of her characters (Blackadder) &quot;Leavis did to Blackadder what he did to serious students: he showed him the terrible, the magnificent importance and urgency of English literature and simultaneously deprived him of any confidence in his own capacity to contribute to or change it.&quot; Tom Sharpe, in his novel &quot;The Great Pursuit&quot;, depicts a ludicrous series of events ending in the hero teaching Leavisite criticism as a religion in the American Bible Belt. In the mock epic heroic poem by Clive James, &quot;Peregrine Pykke&quot;, the eponymous hero studies literature under the prophet &quot;F R Looseleaf&quot; at Downing College, Cambridge.

In his autobiography &quot;The Fry Chronicles&quot;, Stephen Fry described Leavis as a &quot;sanctimonious prick of only parochial significance&quot; and said that Leavis had an &quot;intense suspicious propensity to explode in wrath and anathematize anyone who dared disagree with him&quot;. Fry notes:

The literary critic John Gross accuses Leavis of &quot;narrowness, spitefulness, dogmatism&quot;, &quot;distortion, omission and strident overstatement&quot; and says that &quot;the overall effect of his teaching has plainly been calculated ... to produce many of the characteristics of a religious or ideological sect.&quot;

In 2006, Brooke Allen wrote
&quot;In the end, Leavis fell short of his own high humanistic ideals, through intellectual exclusivity and sheer bloody-mindedness, and the passionate advocate degenerated into the hectoring bigot.&quot; 

==Criticism==

===Overview===
Leavis&#x27;s proponents said that he introduced a &quot;seriousness&quot; into English studies, and some English and American university departments were shaped by his example and ideas. He appeared to possess a clear idea of literary criticism, and he was well known for his decisive and often provocative, and idiosyncratic, judgements. He insisted that valuation was the principal concern of criticism, that it must ensure that English literature should be a living reality operating as an informing spirit in society, and that criticism should involve the shaping of contemporary sensibility.

Leavis&#x27;s criticism can be grouped into four chronological stages. The first is that of his early publications and essays, including &quot;New Bearings in English Poetry&quot; (1932) and &quot;Revaluation&quot; (1936). Here he was concerned primarily with re-examining poetry from the 17th to 20th centuries, and this was accomplished under the strong influence of T. S. Eliot. Also during this early period Leavis sketched out his views about university education.

He then turned his attention to fiction and the novel, producing &quot;The Great Tradition&quot; (1948) and &quot;D. H. Lawrence, Novelist&quot; (1955). Following this period Leavis pursued an increasingly complex treatment of literary, educational and social issues. Though the hub of his work remained literature, his perspective for commentary was noticeably broadening, and this was most visible in &quot;Nor Shall my Sword&quot; (1972).

Two of his last publications embodied the critical sentiments of his final years; &quot;The Living Principle: &#x27;English&#x27; as a Discipline of Thought&quot; (1975), and &quot;Thought, Words and Creativity: Art and Thought in Lawrence&quot; (1976). Although these later works have been sometimes called &quot;philosophy&quot;, it has been argued that there is no abstract or theoretical context to justify such a description. In discussing the nature of language and value, Leavis implicitly treats the sceptical questioning that philosophical reflection starts from as an irrelevance from his standpoint as a literary critic – a position set out in his early exchange with René Wellek (reprinted in &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;).

===On poetry===
Leavis is often viewed as having been a better critic of poetry than of the novel. In &quot;New Bearings in English Poetry&quot; Leavis attacked the Victorian poetical ideal, suggesting that 19th-century poetry sought the consciously &quot;poetical&quot; and showed a separation of thought and feeling and a divorce from the real world. The influence of T. S. Eliot is easily identifiable in his criticism of Victorian poetry, and Leavis acknowledged this, saying in &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot; that, &quot;It was Mr. Eliot who made us fully conscious of the weakness of that tradition&quot; . In his later publication &quot;Revaluation&quot;, the dependence on Eliot was still very much present, but Leavis demonstrated an individual critical sense operating in such a way as to place him among the distinguished modern critics.

The early reception of T. S. Eliot and the reading of Hopkins were considerably enhanced by Leavis&#x27;s proclamation of their greatness. His criticism of Milton, on the other hand, had no great impact on Milton&#x27;s popular esteem. Many of his finest analyses of poems were reprinted in the late work, &quot;The Living Principle&quot;.

===On the novel===
As a critic of the English novel, Leavis&#x27;s main tenet stated that great novelists show an intense moral interest in life, and that this moral interest determines the nature of their form in fiction. Authors within this &quot;tradition&quot; were all characterised by a serious or responsible attitude to the moral complexity of life and included Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and D. H. Lawrence, but excluded Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens. In &quot;The Great Tradition&quot; Leavis attempted to set out his conception of the proper relation between form/composition and moral interest/art and life. Leavis, along with his wife, Q.D. Leavis, was later to revise his opinion of Dickens in their study, &quot;Dickens the Novelist&quot; (1970). He also praised the moral seriousness of American novelists such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Mark Twain.

===On the BBC===
Leavis was one of the earliest detractors of the BBC. He accused the corporation&#x27;s coverage of English literature of lacking impartiality, and of vulgarising the literary taste of British society. In 1931, Leavis took issue with a BBC series of book discussions presented by Harold Nicolson, claiming that Nicolson&#x27;s programmes lacked the &quot;sensitiveness of intelligence&quot; which Leavis believed good literary criticism required. Throughout his career, Leavis constantly took issue with the BBC&#x27;s motives and actions, even once jokingly referring to his &quot;anti-BBC complex&quot;.

==Later life and death==
In 1964 Leavis resigned his fellowship at Downing and took up visiting professorships at the University of Bristol, the University of Wales and the University of York. His final volumes of criticism were &quot;Nor Shall My Sword&quot; (1972), &quot;The Living Principle&quot; (1975) and &quot;Thought, Words and Creativity&quot; (1976). 

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1978 New Year Honours.

Leavis died in 1978, at the age of 82, His wife, Queenie D. Leavis, died in 1981. He features as a main character, played by Ian Holm, in the 1991 BBC TV feature, &quot;The Last Romantics&quot;. The story focuses on his relationship with his mentor, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, and the students.

<doc id="442148" wikidata="Q319034" url="?curid=442148" title="Jehoiakim">
<text>Jehoiakim, also sometimes spelled Jehoikim was the eighteenth and antepenultimate King of Judah from 609 to 598 BC. He was the second son of King Josiah () and Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. His birth name was Eliakim.

==Background==
After Josiah&#x27;s death, Jehoiakim&#x27;s younger brother Jehoahaz (also known as Shallum) was proclaimed king, but after three months Pharaoh Necho II deposed him, making Eliakim king in his place. When placed on the throne, his name was changed to &quot;Jehoiakim&quot;.

Jehoiakim reigned for eleven years, until 598 BC and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah (also known as Jehoiachin), who reigned for only three months.

==Reign==
Jehoiakim was appointed king by Necho II, king of Egypt, in 609 BC, after Necho&#x27;s return from the battle in Harran, three months after he had killed King Josiah at Megiddo. Necho deposed Jehoiakim&#x27;s younger brother Jehoahaz after a reign of only three months and took him to Egypt, where he died. Jehoiakim ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians, paying a heavy tribute. To raise the money he &quot;taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.&quot;

However, after the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at the battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim changed allegiances to avoid the destruction of Jerusalem. He paid tribute from the treasury in Jerusalem, some temple artifacts, and handed over some of the royal family and nobility as hostages. In the Book of Daniel, Daniel is described as being one of these.

Rabbinical literature describes Jehoiakim as a godless tyrant who committed atrocious sins and crimes. He is portrayed as living in incestuous relations with his mother, daughter-in-law, and stepmother, and was in the habit of murdering men, whose wives he then violated and whose property he seized. He also had tattooed his body.

The prophet Jeremiah criticised the king&#x27;s policies, insisting on repentance and strict adherence to the law. Another prophet, Uriah ben Shemaiah, proclaimed a similar message and Jehoiakim ordered his execution ().

Jehoiakim continued for three years as a vassal to the Babylonians, until the failure of an invasion of Egypt in 601 BC undermined their control of the area. Jehoiakim switched allegiance back to the Egyptians. In late 598 BC, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II invaded Judah and again laid siege to Jerusalem, which lasted three months. Jehoiakim died before the siege ended. The Book of Chronicles records that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ... bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.&quot; Jeremiah prophesied that he died without proper funeral, describing the people of Judah &quot;shall not lament for him, saying, &#x27;Alas, master!&#x27; or &#x27;Alas, his glory!&#x27; He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, dragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem&quot; () &quot;and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night&quot; (Jeremiah 36:30). Josephus writes that Nebuchadnezzar slew Jehoiakim along with high-ranking officers and then commanded Jehoiakim&#x27;s body &quot;to be thrown before the walls, without any burial.&quot;

He was succeeded by his son Jeconiah (also known as Jehoiachin). After three months, Nebuchadnezzar deposed Jeconiah (fearing that he would avenge his father&#x27;s death by revolting, according to Josephus) and installed Zedekiah, Jehoiakim&#x27;s younger brother, as king in his place. Jeconiah, his household, and much of Judah&#x27;s population were exiled to Babylon.

According to the Babylonian Chronicles, Jerusalem fell on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BC. The Chronicles state:

The seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar – 598 BC.) in the month Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon assembled his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti (Turkey/Syria) he laid siege to the city of Judah. On the second day of the month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king (Jeconiah) prisoner. He installed in his place a king (Zedekiah) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he sent (them) forth to Babylon.

==In rabbinic literature==

Although Jehoiakim was Josiah&#x27;s eldest son, he was passed over at the latter&#x27;s death as being unworthy to be his father&#x27;s successor, and his brother Jehoahaz mounted the throne in his place. Jehoahaz was publicly anointed king to offset his brother&#x27;s claims to the throne (Seder &#x27;Olam R. xxiv.; Hor. 11b; Ratner&#x27;s objection ad loc. to Seder &#x27;Olam was anticipated and answered by the Gemara). When, subsequently, Jehoiakim took the government, after Jehoahaz had been led captive to Egypt, he showed how little he resembled his pious father: he was a godless tyrant, committing the most atrocious sins and crimes. He lived in incestuous relations with his mother, daughter-in-law, and stepmother, and was in the habit of murdering men, whose wives he then violated and whose property he seized. His garments were of &quot;sha&#x27;aṭneẓ,&quot; and in order to hide the fact that he was a Jew, he had made himself an epispasm by means of an operation, and had tattooed his body (Lev. R. xix. 6; Tan., Lek Leka, end; Midr. Aggadat Bereshit xlviii.; see also Sanh. 103b). He even boasted of his godlessness, saying, &quot;My predecessors, Manasseh and Amon, did not know how they could make God most angry. But I speak openly; all that God gives us is light, and this we no longer need, since we have a kind of gold that shines just like the light; furthermore, God has given this gold to mankind [Ps. cxv. 16] and is not able to take it back again&quot; (Sanh. l.c.).

When Jehoiakim was informed that Jeremiah was writing his Lamentations, he sent for the roll, and calmly read the first four verses, remarking sarcastically, &quot;I still am king.&quot; When he came to the fifth verse and saw the words, &quot;For the Lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions&quot; (Lam. i. 5), he took the roll, scratched out the names of God occurring therein, and threw it into the fire (M. Ḳ. 26a). No wonder then that God thought of &quot;changing the world again into chaos,&quot; and refrained from doing so only because the Jewish people under this king were pious (Sanh. 103a). Yet punishment was not withheld. Nebuchadnezzar came with his army to Daphne, near Antiochia, and demanded from the Great Sanhedrin, whose members came to pay him their respects, that Jehoiakim be delivered to him, in which case he would not disturb the city and its inhabitants. The Sanhedrin went to Jehoiakim to inform him of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s demand, and when he asked them whether it would be right to sacrifice him for their benefit, they reminded him of what David did in a similar case with the rebel Sheba (Lev. R. xix. 6).

Various opinions have been handed down concerning the circumstances of Jehoiakim&#x27;s death, due to the difficulty of harmonizing the conflicting Biblical statements on this point (II Kings xxiv. 6; Jer. xxii. 18, 19; II Chron. xxxvi. 6). According to some, he died in Jerusalem before the Sanhedrin could comply with the demand made by Nebuchadnezzar, who therefore had to be content with the king&#x27;s body, which was cast to him over the walls. Another version says that he died while being let down over the wall. Others, again, maintain that after leading him through the whole land of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar killed him, and then threw his corpse piecemeal to the dogs, or, as one version has it, put it into the skin of a dead ass (Lev. R. xix. 6; Seder&#x27;Olam R. xxv., agreeing in part with Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; x. 6, § 3; see also Jerome to Jer. xxii. 18, and Nebuchadnezzar in Rabbinical Literature).

Even this shameful death, however, was not to be the end of the dead king, upon whose skull were scratched the words, &quot;This and one more.&quot; After many centuries the Gemara relates: The grandfather of Rabbi Perida, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avuya, found the skull before the gates of Jerusalem; twice he piously buried it, but as often as he tried to cover it the earth refused to hold it. He then concluded that it was the skull of Jehoiakim, for whom Jeremiah had prophesied such an end (Jer. xxii. 18); and as he did not know what to do with it, he wrapped it in silk and hid it in a closet. After a time his wife found it and showed it to a neighbor, who said: &quot;Your husband had another wife before you whom he can not forget, and therefore he keeps her skull.&quot; Thereupon the wife threw it into the fire, and when her husband returned he knew what the enigmatical words &quot;this and one more&quot; meant -Jehoiakim remains were not only cast out of Jerusalem but were denied the grave as they were burned (Sanh. 82a, 104a). In the Aggadah, Jehoiakim is still undergoing punishment for his sins. Although the Babylonian Talmud does not include him among those who have no place in the world to come (cf. Sanh. 103b), the Jerusalem Talmud cites him as an example of one who has forfeited his place in heaven by publicly transgressing the law.The sages also explain proverbs 24:30 as follows: I passed by the field of a lazy man, This is Ahaz. And the vineyard of a senseless man, this is Manashe. And behold, it was all overgrown with thorns, this is Amon. And its surface was covered with Nettle, this is Jehoiakim. And its stone wall was broken down, this is a reference to Zedekiah, in whose days the temple was destroyed.

== In popular culture ==
Jehoiakim is portrayed by Andrea Occhipinti in the film &quot;Jeremiah &quot;(1998).

<text>The USSR State Prize () was the Soviet Union&#x27;s state honor. It was established on 9 September 1966. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the prize was followed up by the State Prize of the Russian Federation.

The State Stalin Prize (Государственная Сталинская премия, &quot;Gosudarstvennaya Stalinskaya premiya&quot;), usually called the Stalin Prize, existed from 1941 to 1956. It essentially played the same role; therefore upon the establishment of the USSR State Prize, the diplomas and badges of the recipients of Stalin Prize were changed to that of USSR State Prize.

In 1944 and 1945, the last two years of the Second World War, the award ceremonies for the Stalin Prize were not held. Instead, in 1946 the ceremony was held twice: in January for the works created in 1943–1944 and in June for the works of 1945.

USSR State Prize of 1st, 2nd and 3rd degrees was awarded annually to individuals in the fields of science, mathematics, literature, arts, and architecture to honor the most prominent achievements which either advanced the Soviet Union or the cause of socialism. Often the prize was awarded to specific works rather than to individuals.

Each constituent Soviet republic (SSR) or (SFSR) and autonomous republic (ASSR) also had a State Prize (or Stalin Prize).

The Stalin Prize was an honor different from the Stalin Peace Prize. The latter was created on 21 December 1949 and was usually awarded to foreign recipients rather than to Soviet citizens.

It should also not be confused with the Lenin Prize.

<doc id="442157" wikidata="Q15059599" url="?curid=442157" title="Limehouse Town Hall">
<text>Limehouse Town Hall is a former town hall building on Commercial Road, in Limehouse, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is a Grade II listed building.

==History==

The building was commissioned by the Limehouse Board of Works as a vestry hall for the benefit of the Parish of St Anne&#x27;s. The site selected by the vestry had previously been occupied by a private residence belonging to a Mr. Walter.

The foundation stone for the building was laid by the churchwarden, James Rollinson, on 21 October 1879. The building was designed Arthur and Christopher Harston in the Palazzo style and built by J. H. Johnson and was opened as the vestry hall of the Limehouse District on 29 March 1881. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Commercial Road; the central section featured a portico flanked by Corinthian order columns and a balcony above; there were round headed windows on the first floor and a carved pediment above. The principal rooms were the council chamber on the ground floor and an assembly room on the first floor.

After the civil parish became a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in 1900, the town hall ceased to be the seat of local government and was used as an events venue and administrative centre.

On 30 July 1909 the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George made a polemical speech in the assembly room, attacking the House of Lords for its opposition to his &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;. This speech was the origin of the phrase &quot;To Limehouse&quot;, or &quot;Limehousing&quot;, which meant an incendiary political speech. The building was badly damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War but was subsequently restored and re-opened by the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, in November 1950.

Responsibility for management of the building was transferred to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965 and it was re-opened as the National Museum of Labour History by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, in May 1975. After the museum got into financial difficulties and then moved to Manchester in the late 1980s (it subsequently became the People&#x27;s History Museum), the building in London served as the Wapping Neighbourhood Offices until 1994, when it became a training centre and winter shelter for homeless people.

The building was placed on English Heritage&#x27;s list of buildings at risk in 2003 but, after the Limehouse Town Hall Consortium Trust was formed and secured a long lease on the building in 2004, the building was restored with support from English Heritage and re-opened as a community centre in April 2012.

==Features and current use==
The building has a number of offices located on the ground floor below the assembly room. It is home to several groups, such as Stitches in Time, FabricWorks, The Boxing Club (a group that arranges occasional events, mostly to raise money for the upkeep of the venue), ArtSpokes, the Space Hijackers, Primal Pictures, Students for a Free Tibet and Equilibrium. The building is not generally open to the public, but participates in Open House London for guided tours of the building.

<doc id="442163" wikidata="Q3246511" url="?curid=442163" title="Jersey Shore">
<text>The Jersey Shore, commonly called the Shore by locals, is the coastal region of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The term encompasses about of oceanfront bordering the Atlantic Ocean, from Perth Amboy in the north to Cape May Point in the south. The region includes Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic, and Cape May counties, which are in the central and southern parts of the state. Located in the center of the Northeast Megalopolis, the northern half of the shore region is part of the New York metro area, while the southern half of the shore region is part of the Philadelphia metro area. The Jersey Shore hosts the highest concentration of oceanside boardwalks in the United States.

Famous for its wide beaches, and many boardwalks featuring arcades, amusement parks, and water parks, the Jersey Shore is a popular vacation spot for residents of North Jersey, New York, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Certain shore communities are also popular with visitors from the Canadian province of Quebec. Due to New Jersey&#x27;s peninsular geography, both sunrise and sunset are visible over water from different points on the Jersey Shore.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated much of the northern part of the Jersey Shore, spawning the demolition and rebuilding of entire neighborhoods, with reinvention on a physically and financially elevated, and economically upscale level; this process of gentrification escalated property values and transformed communities on the Jersey Shore into a second home for the New York financial community, akin to the more established Gold Coast and Hamptons on Long Island.

==Notable shore towns==

The Jersey Shore is lined with over 40 different towns and communities, each with a different character, flavor, and vibe. Many towns cater extensively to summer tourists, while others are increasingly or completely full-year residential communities. The towns listed below are ordered geographically from north to south.

===Middlesex County===
====The Amboys====
Perth Amboy, along with neighboring South Amboy across the Raritan River, make up The Amboys. Perth Amboy was a resort town in the 19th century and early 20th century, located on the northern edge of the Raritan Bayshore. Since the early 1990s Perth Amboy has seen redevelopment. Small businesses have started to open up, helped by the city&#x27;s designation as an urban enterprise zone. The waterfront has also seen a rebirth, with new parks, a new promenade and an expansion of the marina complementing the old Victorian homes along the bay. Local attractions include the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip and Kearny Cottage. The Raritan Yacht Club, it is one of the oldest yacht clubs in the United States. As of 2023, hundreds of millions of dollars were being invested in the redevelopment of Perth Amboy&#x27;s waterfront area, in part related to its strategically-located industrial area. On October 30, 2023, NY Waterway launched a new ferry service in South Amboy, which connects to Lower and Midtown Manhattan. Both towns are served by the North Jersey Coast Line.

====Laurence Harbor (Old Bridge)====
Laurence Harbor is an unincorporated community located in Old Bridge. The waterfront neighborhood looks directly upon many points in New York City, including Staten Island&#x27;s South Shore; the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge; Lower Manhattan (and the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan on a clear night); and Brooklyn. The New Jersey Transit Railroad no longer has a station in Laurence Harbor. It had a Morgan station during most of the 1st half of the 20th century, located right across Cheesequake Creek, sometimes referred to locally as &quot;The Front&quot;, from Laurence Harbor, dividing the community into eastern and western sections. Cliffwood Beach also borders Laurence Harbor when traveling south. Morgan is named after the 1703 family that had 645 acres (2.61 km2) here and were cousins of the infamous pirate captain Henry Morgan. Morgan is located one mile to the northwest, across the Cheesequake Creek and the Morgan Bridge on New Jersey Route 35. The Morgan Draw carries the North Jersey Coast Line.

Laurence Harbor is home to Old Bridge Waterfront Park, which consists of a new boardwalk (the old boardwalk was destroyed in the 1940–1950s) that was completed in 2002. The beachfront was redone through a joint venture by Old Bridge Township, New Jersey, and Middlesex County Parks Department. It extends approximately one mile from the Old Bridge Police substation south, to the Aberdeen Township neighborhood of Cliffwood Beach, running parallel with New Jersey Route 35. This area is very popular for fishing as three jetties extend into Raritan Bay and are in excellent condition, have been consistent well-maintained. The park&#x27;s boardwalk is also popular for jogging and dog walking. At the northern parking lot of the park, there is bay beach swimming access along with a bathroom and showers.

===Monmouth County===

====Union Beach====

Union Beach is a borough situated on the North Shore of Monmouth County, on Raritan Bay. Union Beach is part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the Raritan Bayshore coastline.

====Keansburg====

Keansburg was a popular early 20th century summertime destination for tourists from New York City, who would cross the Raritan Bay on steamboats to escape the city heat. Hurricane Donna wiped out much of the waterfront area in 1960, and a number of fires in the 1980s destroyed many of the town&#x27;s main attractions, including the Dance Hall Auditorium, the Keansburg Bowling Alley, and the Casino Theater.

The Keansburg Amusement Park, founded in 1904, started a massive expansion project in 1995. Upgrades were made to the park and an adjacent water park, Runaway Rapids, was constructed

====Atlantic Highlands====

Atlantic Highlands, which overlooks where the Atlantic Ocean and Raritan Bay meet at Sandy Hook, contains Mount Mitchill, the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine, rising above sea level.

The Manhattan skyline can be seen from the borough&#x27;s ridges and its shoreline. Pleasure, fishing, and commuter boats sail from its harbor, which was built from 1938 through 1940. It is the largest on the East Coast.

=====SeaStreak ferry=====

Atlantic Highlands is home to 715 seacraft including the high-speed SeaStreak ferry service to New York City, which was introduced in 1986. SeaStreak ferry provides high-speed commuter service for residents on the Raritan Bayshore in northern Monmouth County to Manhattan in New York City. The ferry also offers seasonal sightseeing excursions. Many Jersey Shore residents board the ferry to travel to different points across the Tri-State area and New England coastline. Many New York residents board the ferry to travel to Atlantic Highlands and Sandy Hook Beach, along with the rest of the Jersey Shore region at large.

====Sandy Hook (Middletown)====
Sandy Hook is a long, narrow largely undeveloped barrier spit, most of which is owned and managed by the National Park Service as a unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The eastern, ocean-facing shoreline consists of various public and fishing beaches and serves as a Shore gateway and popular destination for recreation in summer when seasonal SeaStreak ferries bring beachgoers. Sandy Hook&#x27;s Gunnison Beach is one of the largest clothing-optional beaches on the East Coast. The northern end of the peninsula is home to the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, the Marine Academy of Science and Technology, and the restored buildings of Fort Hancock, a former United States Army base. Spread across Sandy Hook are former military installations, including four ammunition bunkers, two gun stations, and a Nike Missile Base.

====Red Bank====

Red Bank, overlooking the Navesink River, is a noted social and commercial destination, filled with boutiques, designer clothing stores, parks, and restaurants. The town is also considered a center of artistic activity and is home to the Monmouth County Arts Council, as well as the Count Basie Theatre, Two River Theater, and several art galleries. Various festivals held by the town, including the Red Bank Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, draw tourists throughout the year.

Boating, sculling, sailing, and fishing are popular outdoor activities in Red Bank; in the winter, ice boats sail on the Navesink when it freezes over. The Monmouth Boat Club, Marine Park, and the slips of the Molly Pitcher Inn provide access to the river and, from there, the Atlantic Ocean.

====Oceanport====
Oceanport is an upper-middle-class bedroom community located on the Shrewsbury River, between Red Bank and Long Branch. It is the home of Monmouth Park Racetrack, one of the oldest thoroughbred racing tracks in the country.

The original racing track was opened by the Monmouth Park Association on July 30, 1870, in nearby Eatontown to increase summer tourism for communities along the Shore. Monmouth Park early on earned the nickname as the &quot;Newmarket of America&quot; due to the excellence of its racing. However, after three years of being open financial issues caused the track to close. In 1878, the track was bought by David D. Withers, George L. Lorillard, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and George P. Wetmore. The men spent four years renovating the grounds and grandstand and reopened Monmouth Park in 1882. From 1882 to 1890, the track increased in popularity and as a result, a new racetrack was constructed next to the original. The new racetrack opened in 1890 becoming the second Monmouth Park. However, legislation proposed in 1891 and enacted in 1894 barred parimutuel betting in New Jersey, and the track closed its doors. It was not until 1946 when the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill providing for state regulation of horse racing that the current Monmouth Park opened.

Its location on the shore and as a stop on the North Jersey Coast Line makes it a popular shore destination for residents from New York and North Jersey to see thoroughbred racing. The Haskell Invitational Stakes take place annually in August.

====Long Branch====
Long Branch developed into a resort town in the late 18th century, with oceanside hotels, large estates, and grand theaters. It was visited by seven United States presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson. All seven worshiped at the Church of the Presidents in the city, and beachside Seven Presidents Park is named for their visits. Long Branch&#x27;s popularity waned in the years following World War II, with the opening of the Garden State Parkway in the mid-1950s allowing tourists to access points further south. The defining moment marking the end of this era occurred on June 8, 1987, when a large fire destroyed the town&#x27;s pier and adjoining amusement park.

In 2005, Pier Village, a Victorian-inspired mixed-use community consisting of rental residences atop retail space, opened. A public grassy area called Festival Plaza is the site of regular events, including concerts, arts &amp; crafts fairs, outdoor movies, and holiday events. Long Branch is also home to Max&#x27;s Famous Hotdogs and its rival, the original WindMill Hot Dogs, located in a windmill-shaped building since 1963.

====Allenhurst====
The borough of Allenhurst is best known for its shoreline Residential Historic District, roughly bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Main Street, Cedar Avenue, Hume Street, and Elberon Avenue. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 2010, for its historical architectural significance. It includes 412 contributing buildings.

====Asbury Park====

Asbury Park developed through the 1920s and 1930s as a resort destination for the New York metro area, and it remained that way through World War II. The Paramount Theatre and Asbury Park Convention Hall, both connected to the boardwalk via a grand arcade, drew considerable tourists. The post-war era of the 1950s and 1960s saw the construction of the Garden State Parkway and the Monmouth Mall, taking visitors away from Asbury Park and its shopping areas. At the same time, the city&#x27;s music scene gained prominence with artists like Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes getting their starts at venues like Asbury Lanes and The Stone Pony, the latter one of New Jersey&#x27;s best-known music venues. These acts and others led to the development of a sub-genre of rock and roll known as the Jersey Shore sound.

Race riots on July 4, 1970, resulted in the destruction of various buildings across the city. A popular indoor amusement complex, Palace Amusements, was closed in 1988 and demolished in 2004, despite multiple attempts to save it. A pair of large murals on the building&#x27;s side known collectively as &quot;Tillie&quot; became an icon of the Jersey Shore and was saved.

In the 1990s, Asbury Park emerged as a prime LGBT destination, with multiple gay bars and nightclubs, as well as the Empress Hotel, the state&#x27;s first gay-oriented hotel, opening. Since the early 2000s, a burgeoning crowd of artists along with local political leaders have helped push the town through major redevelopment, which is still ongoing. Asbury Park still retains the lively music scene which made it famous, with newer music venues such as The Saint operating alongside the older stalwarts. Events like the Asbury Music Awards and the Garden State Film Festival continue to draw tourists to the city.

==== Ocean Grove ====
Ocean Grove was originally developed in 1869 as a Methodist summer camp meeting site. Today, it is an unincorporated community located within Neptune Township and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ocean Grove is noted for its abundant examples of Victorian architecture. It is home to The Great Auditorium, a 6,250-seat indoor arena constructed out of wood in 1894 on bridge-like iron trusses laid on stone foundations. The Auditorium contains a pipe organ that is one of the 20 largest in the world. Surrounding the Auditorium are 114  tents, which are occupied from May to September, just as they have been since the town&#x27;s founding. The tents adjoin to rear sheds containing a kitchen and bathroom and are stored in the sheds during the winter. They are in such demand that there is a waiting list of ten years for summer rentals. Ocean Grove was named one of the top 15 best beaches by Fodor&#x27;s in 2014.

====Belmar====

Belmar is a popular vacation destination due to its natural and recreational resources. Its boardwalk and town offer shops, restaurants, an active arts scene, sporting events, festivals, and a variety of family-oriented activities. Belmar is also a popular party town for young adults and college students. Belmar is among the most popular surf spots on the East Coast, frequently hosting surfing events and competitions.

====Spring Lake====
Spring Lake is easily recognized by its tree lined streets, stately mansions, and seasonal cottages (of which few remain). During the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, prominent members of New York City and Philadelphia high society purchased a large tract of farmland with the vision of creating a resort and religious retreat area catering to the wealthy- similar in fashion to the communities of Newport, Rhode Island, and Bar Harbor, Maine. Grand hotels and guest cottages were constructed to accommodate an anticipated influx well-to-do seasonal visitors. Notably, in 1900 many of the largest hotels were destroyed by fire, leaving way for wealthy families to construct houses for year round living. But to this day, few original structures remain; as it is now commonplace to raise lots and demolish structures in order to make way for the largest homes possible. Of those still in existence, the Martin Maloney Cottage and the Audenried Cottage serve as examples of what now remains. 

====Manasquan====

Manasquan has an active downtown area defined by its Main Street, lined with small businesses and original Victorian houses. It is home to a historic 540-seat theatre, named after the Native American tribe that inhabited the land before European settlement. Built in 1938 as a movie house, it converted during May 1994 to a professional theatre. Over the course of the 20th century, much of the traditional neighborhood beach bungalows were demolished and replaced with dwellings to accommodate larger single families, helping turn Manasquan into a predominately year-round residential community, easing the focus on summer tourism.

The Manasquan Inlet is the northern terminus of the inland portion of the Intracoastal Waterway. It provides surfers with waves that are corralled, refracted, and enlarged by the jetty protruding out into the Atlantic Ocean.

===Ocean County===
====Point Pleasant Beach====
Point Pleasant Beach is situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that divides the Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean at the Manasquan Inlet, and the borough derives its name from this location. The town&#x27;s boardwalk is approximately one mile long, and its central third is home to Jenkinsons&#x27; amusement park, aquarium, and arcades, as well as numerous pizza restaurants, ice cream parlors, games-of-chance, and miniature golf courses. Point Pleasant is home to the first Jersey Mike&#x27;s sub shop, founded in the town in 1956.

====Seaside Heights====

Seaside Heights is a resort community, with a beach, an amusement-oriented boardwalk, and numerous clubs and bars making it a popular destination. During the summer, the borough attracts a crowd largely over the age of 21, drawn to a community with boardwalk entertainment and one of the few shore communities with sizable numbers of apartments. In the peak months of July and August, the town&#x27;s population explodes from around 3,000 residents to between 30,000 and 65,000 people on any given day. South of the town sits Island Beach State Park, the largest reserve of an undeveloped barrier island in New Jersey and one of the largest in the United States.

Casino Pier is an amusement park situated on a pier extending over the Atlantic Ocean. The pier offers many family-friendly attractions and roller coasters, as well as an arcade, games-of-chance, and a rooftop miniature golf course. Across the street, a go-kart track, a new miniature golf course, and a waterpark, Breakwater Beach, round out the attraction list. The rest of the 2-mile (3.2 km) long boardwalk offers various arcades, attractions, souvenir shops, restaurants and food stands.

On October 29, 2012, substantial portions of the boardwalk were damaged and much of the borough was flooded as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Both Casino Pier and Funtown Pier suffered major damage, with sections of both piers torn apart by a powerful storm surge that caused many rides to collapse into the ocean. One such ride, Casino Pier&#x27;s Star Jet, became a symbol of the storm&#x27;s destruction as it sat upright in the Atlantic Ocean after the pier washed out below it. A portion of the rebuilt boardwalk and all of Funtown Pier were destroyed in a 2013 fire.

The community is also known as the setting of the hit MTV show &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, as well as various editions of &quot;MTV True Life&quot; and &quot;MTV Summer Beach House&quot;.

====Long Beach Island====
Long Beach Island, colloquially known as LBI, is a barrier island and summer colony approximately in length. The primary industries include tourism, fishing, and real estate. The only access point to the island by car is via the Manahawkin Bay Bridge, locally known as &quot;The Causeway&quot;, which carries Route 72 over Manahawkin Bay. Long Beach Island is home to about 20,000 people on a year-round basis. However, the population swells significantly during the summer months and reaches about 100,000 people, including both part-time residents and tourists, who are often referred to as &quot;shoobies&quot;. The island&#x27;s close-knit communities are largely affluent and contain vacation homes for wealthy individuals who reside elsewhere in New Jersey, as well as New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

The low-density northern end of the Long Beach Island, including the communities of Barnegat Light, Loveladies, Harvey Cedars, and North Beach, are home to an assortment of high-end waterfront vacation homes. The southern end contains significantly more year-round residents and businesses, particularly in the larger boroughs of Beach Haven, Long Beach, and Surf City. Long Beach Island typically attracts a family-oriented crowd during the summertime; the island has not contained a boardwalk since the 1944 hurricane, and nightlife is limited to a few bars. Tourists generally take part in recreational activities like miniature golf, parasailing, jet skiing, and relaxing on the beaches. The island has a reputation as a base for long-range deep-sea fishing and charter boats.

Attractions include the Barnegat Lighthouse, a 165 feet (50 m) tall lighthouse overlooking the Barnegat Inlet, located in a state park at the island&#x27;s northern tip. A small amusement park, Fantasy Island, serves the surrounding communities, and the original Ron Jon Surf Shop location sits at the foot of the Manahawkin Bay Bridge in Ship Bottom.

===Atlantic County===
====Brigantine====
Brigantine is an island community, the northernmost in Atlantic County. The Brigantine Lighthouse, constructed to attract tourists, is a central identifying symbol of the city. Brigantine is home to the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, the state&#x27;s only rescue center for stranded marine mammals and sea turtles. It has rescued more than 3,900 whales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles since it was formed. Part of the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge is located on the northern end of the island. The town is named after the numerous shipwrecks in the area, many of which were likely brigantines.

====Atlantic City====

Atlantic City is a nationally renowned resort city for gambling, shopping and fine dining. In an effort at revitalizing the city, New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum, approving casino gambling for Atlantic City. Today, the city is second to Las Vegas in number of casinos, yearly gaming revenue, and number of casino hotel rooms. Casinos like the Ocean Casino Resort, Borgata, Harrah&#x27;s, Caesars, and Tropicana draw tourists from around the world.

The Atlantic City Boardwalk is the world&#x27;s oldest boardwalk, opening on June 26, 1870. At long, it is also the world&#x27;s longest and busiest boardwalk. The boardwalk starts at Absecon Inlet and runs along the beach for 4 miles (6 km) to the city limit. An additional miles (2 km) of the boardwalk extend into neighboring Ventnor City. Casinos and hotels front the boardwalk, as well as stores, restaurants, games, and other attractions.

Events like Thunder over the Boardwalk, as well as more traditional attractions like the Absecon Lighthouse and Lucy the Elephant, bring in additional visitors. Shopping in the city include Playground Pier, Tanger Outlets The Walk, and The Quarter at Tropicana.

Notable landmarks include Boardwalk Hall, an arena and convention center opened in 1929, and Steel Pier, an amusement park on a 1,000 foot (300 m) long pier over the Atlantic Ocean. Home of the Miss America pageant, Atlantic City has been featured in numerous films and television series, most notably as the setting of the 1980 film &quot;Atlantic City&quot; and the 2011 HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;. The city also served as the inspiration for the board game Monopoly.

===Cape May County===
====Ocean City====

Ocean City is home to a boardwalk fronted by several shops and amusement areas. Known as a family-oriented seaside resort, the city has prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages within its limits since its founding in 1879. Ocean City has miles of guarded beaches, a 2.5-mile boardwalk, and a downtown shopping and dining district. Gillian&#x27;s Wonderland Pier and Playland&#x27;s Castaway Cove are two large amusement parks located along the boardwalk, with both family and thrill rides. A water park, various arcades, miniature golf courses, and a historic entertainment hall, the Ocean City Music Pier, round out the boardwalk attractions. Corson&#x27;s Inlet State Park was established by the New Jersey Legislature in 1969 to protect and preserve one of the last undeveloped tracts of land along the state&#x27;s oceanfront.

====The Wildwoods====


The Wildwoods is used as a collective term for the four communities that have &quot;Wildwood&quot; as part of the municipality name — the Borough of Wildwood Crest, City of Wildwood, Borough of West Wildwood and the City of North Wildwood — together with Diamond Beach, a portion of Lower Township situated on the island. Its most notable features are its beach and boardwalk, home to the Morey&#x27;s Piers amusement complex and Raging Waters and Ocean Oasis Waterparks owned by Morey&#x27;s Piers. The boardwalk features a trolley called the &quot;Tramcar&quot;, which runs from end to end.

The Wildwoods is home to over 200 motels, built during the Doo-Wop era of the 1950s and 1960s, in an area recognized by the state of New Jersey, known as the Wildwoods Shore Resort Historic District&#x27;

The term doo-wop was coined by Cape May&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Center For The Arts in the early 1990s to describe the unique, space-age architectural style, which is also referred to as the Googie or populuxe style. The motels are unique in appearance, with Vegas-like neon signs and fantastic architecture.

====Cape May====

Cape May is at the southern tip of Cape May Peninsula where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean and is one of the country&#x27;s oldest vacation resort destinations. The Cape May – Lewes Ferry connects US 9 from Cape May to Lewes, Delaware.

==Beaches==

The following is a list of all the towns within the state of New Jersey that have a beach either along the Raritan Bay or Atlantic Ocean, listed north to south:
Most ocean beaches in New Jersey charge admission to the beaches through the use of beach tags. Ocean beaches in New Jersey that do not use beach tags include Atlantic City, Strathmere (Upper Township), North Wildwood, Wildwood, and Wildwood Crest.

== Environmental issues ==
=== Climate change ===

The Jersey shore is expected to have increasing problems with the water supply in part due to saltwater intrusion, and also changes in weather patterns. Communities on the eastern shore are also expected to see significant change in the commercial fisheries along the coast, hurting communities dependent on fishing.

==== Sea level rise ====
The Jersey Shore is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise accelerated by climate change, and will be experiencing more sea level rise than the global average. This is in large part because of the slow down of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation which will allow sea level rise 2 feet greater than average. The region already experiences frequent flooding during king tides and storm surge, because most infrastructure was built based on 20th century standards. Several academic studies have explore various responses to the sea level rise including managed retreat, improved coastal management practices to mitigate risk, and hard structures.

=== Hurricane Sandy ===

The entirety of the Jersey Shore region was significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The devastating effect of the storm surge on property adjacent to the beach resulted in substantial cost to the reinsurance industry which has since advocated avoidance of rebuilding closely packed middle-class residences or flimsy commercial structures adjacent to the beach. The hurricane reached up to 74 mph. Hurricane Sandy&#x27;s pure kinetic energy for storm surge and wave destruction potential reached a 5.8 out of 6 on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s scale. Storm surges reached 14 ft above average low tide. The Barrier Islands were especially damaged, leaving dozens of homes completely washed away. Many iconic places from &quot;The Shore&quot; were also damaged due to Hurricane Sandy, including the Belmar boardwalk, Casino Pier, and Funtown Pier.

==Retail businesses==
Unlike areas in the interior of the state, which has many big box stores and malls, small businesses are a significant portion of the economy of barrier island Jersey Shore towns. This is because small businesses can more easily adapt to the seasonal nature of business in shore towns. Stores that are located at the shore are all unique ranging from psychics and accessories at Ocean City to home-made chocolates in Long Beach Island. In addition, many shore towns deliberately stymie the entry of big box stores because they want to reduce traffic. 

== Property ownership ==
Every town along the Jersey Shore has properties owned by people who do not live in New Jersey. State resident ownership has dropped by 30% since 1989. People from out of state own about 37% of the properties in shore towns. In 10 towns, a majority of the property is owned by out of state residents. Summer tourism swells the population of towns along the shore. Some towns have fewer than 5,000 year-round residents, then explode to more than 30,000 residents during the summer. Monmouth County has the highest percentage of New Jersey resident ownership, at 88%, followed by Ocean County at 80%, 57% in Atlantic County, and only 27% in Cape May County. Avalon has the lowest percentage of state resident ownership at 27.5%, while Monmouth Beach has the highest at 92.7%.

<text>Blackwall is an area of Poplar, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, East London. The neighbourhood includes Leamouth and the Coldharbour conservation area.

The area takes its name from a historic stretch of riverside wall built along an outside curve of the Thames, to protect the area from flooding. Along with the rest of Poplar, Blackwall has its origin in the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney. While mostly residential, the Poplar Dock and Blackwall Basin provide moorings for vessels.

==Setting and administration==
The area&#x27;s significance derived from its position on an outside curve of the Thames, where currents slowed down, making it a sheltered spot useful to a range of shipping activities. This sheltered position was enhanced by the presence of the Blackwall Rock reef, though this could also be a danger to shipping. A further advantage of the area was that it lay east of the Isle of Dogs, so loading and unloading here avoided that time and effort of sailing round that peninsula to London, while still being very close to the City of London.

The area developed on the riverside, next to Poplar&#x27;s East Marsh and was known as Blackwall by at least the 14th century; taking its name from the colour of the river wall, built - with its stairs - in the Middle Ages. Having never been an administrative unit, the area lacks formal definition, but can be broadly described as the part of Poplar close to the Thames on the north-east part of the Isle of Dogs peninsula extending eastward to the confluence of the Thames and Lea.

Blackwall gives its name to &quot;Blackwall Reach&quot;, the stretch of the Thames east of the Isle of Dogs. &quot;Blackwall Reach&quot; gives its name to &quot;Blackwall Point&quot;, the northern tip of the Greenwich Peninsula, south of the Thames in Greenwich (and not in Blackwall).

Blackwall was historically part of the &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot;, an autonomous area of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney in Middlesex. The &quot;Hamlet of Poplar&quot; became an independent parish in 1817. The civil parish of Poplar had a vestry committee which organised services such as poor relief and road maintenance. Indeed, the whole Isle of Dogs was until the late 20th century referred to as being in Poplar. In 1965, the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar merged with its neighbours to form the new London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

==History==

Blackwall Yard became a major sea hub, and the district was a significant part of the Port of London, and involved with important voyages for over 400 years. Shipfitting and repair was taking place by 1485 and shipbuilding would take place in the area later too. In 1576, Martin Frobisher left Blackwall and landed at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, claiming it for England (its first overseas possession) in the name of Queen Elizabeth I. Frobisher was funded by the Muscovy Company seeking the North West Passage. In the early years of the 17th century the port was the main departure point of the English colonisation of North America and the West Indies launched by the London Company. On 20 December 1606, three ships, &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;, sailed from Blackwall, landing in Virginia on 26 April 1607 to establish the first permanent English settlement, Jamestown.

The East and West India Docks were constructed at the beginning of the 19th century.
Leamouth Wharf was the site of the Samuda Brothers, Orchard House Yard and Thames Iron Works shipyards which were major centres of employment. In 1895, Arnold Hills the owner of the Thames Iron Works and foreman Dave Taylor set up a works team, Thames Ironworks F.C. The club would later be reformed as West Ham United F.C.

Until 1987, Blackwall was a centre of shipbuilding and repair. This activity principally included Blackwall Yard, the Orchard House Yard and the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company which included land in both Blankwall and Canning Town, which is east of the Lea in the old parish and borough of West Ham. The Blackwall Yard (two of whose former dry docks can still be seen around the present-day Reuters building) built the first Blackwall Frigates.

The London and Blackwall Railway was one of the earliest railway systems in London, operating from 1840. it was also one of the smallest, running from Fenchurch Street Station in the city to Blackwall, a journey of less than twenty minutes, but which was very important to connect to Gravesend passenger boats. Near the Blackwall railway station was built the Brunswick Hotel, located on the Greenwich Meridian line. In its early years, it apparently attracted a fairly elegant crowd, including William IV on an occasion connected with the opening or expansion of the burgeoning docks in the area. Its prime customer base was emigrants (mostly to Australia) who would wait here until they could board small steamers to take them to the large sea-going liners at Gravesend. In the days of sail, these passengers might have to wait for days or weeks until the winds were favourable; but by the end of the century the substitution of steam power and rail links on the south bank of the Thames greatly reduced the viability of the hotel. No evidence remains of either the hotel (demolished in the 1920s) or the railway station (demolished 1946); they stood between Jamestown Way and the Thames.

The Blackwall Tunnel, opened in 1892–1897, carries road traffic under the Thames from Blackwall to the Greenwich Peninsula.

The Brunswick Wharf Power Station was built by Poplar Borough Council for the British Electricity Authority (BEA) in 1952, on the site of the former East India Export Dock. The power station was controversial due to potential air pollution in a densely populated part of London.

==Built environment==
===Coldharbour Conservation Area===
Coldharbour is said to be &quot;the sole remaining fragment of the old hamlet of Blackwall&quot; and &quot;one of the last examples of the narrow streets which once characterised the river&#x27;s perimeter&quot;. It is today largely residential and no longer has any industrial and maritime activities. The Coldharbour Conservation Area, designated in 1975 and then expanded in 2008, has several listed historic buildings as well as engineering structures once part of the former docks.

===Economic activity===
Northumberland Wharf is still retained as a working wharf, this has special status by the Mayor of London and the Port of London Authority (PLA) as a safeguarded wharf. It is run by Cory Riverside Energy who also managed the Reuse and Recycling Centre which is next to the wharf and for the transportation of waste by barge along the River Thames.

===Housing developments===
The 1980s, Blackwall saw the area first redevelopment project, a luxury housing complex called Jamestown Harbour over the Blackwall Basin, designed by WCEC Architects for the Wates Group and was completed by 1985. Jamestown Harbour was one of the first housing developments of the London Docklands. With its brick-built warehouse-style exteriors and distinctive blue and red balconies, it was designed to recreate the appearance of traditional river and dockside warehouses.

In the 2000s, a residential development New Providence Wharf began to be built, which was designed and built by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and Ballymore Group and saw the Ontario Tower and Providence Tower (now the Charrington Tower) completed in 2007 and 2016 respectively.

==Transport==

;Historic
The former London and Blackwall Railway ran from Minories to Blackwall by way of Stepney, a distance of three and half miles. This was authorised in 1836 as &quot;The Commercial Railway&quot;, running close to Commercial Road in the East End of London to the Blackwall railway station.

;Contemporary
The areas major roads; the A1261 (Aspen Way) and the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road bring a significant degree of air pollution and community severance.

London Buses routes D3 on west-east Blackwall Way, and D6, D7 and N550 on north-south Preston Road give local access to neighbouring Poplar, Leamouth, the Isle of Dogs and Canary Wharf.

The Thames Path (north bank) National Trail which opened in 1996 is connected to Blackwall, it enters the district at the South Dock Entrance and goes via Coldharbour and Blackwall Way and rejoins the River Thames at Virginia Wharf till the East India Dock at Blackwall Point.

<doc id="442181" wikidata="Q1572719" url="?curid=442181" title="Hambleton District">
<text>Hambleton was a local government district in North Yorkshire, England. The administrative centre was Northallerton, and the district included the outlying towns and villages of Bedale, Thirsk, Great Ayton, Stokesley, and Easingwold.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, as a merger of Northallerton Urban District, Bedale Rural District, Easingwold Rural District, Northallerton Rural District, and parts of Thirsk Rural District, Stokesley Rural District and Croft Rural District, all in the North Riding of Yorkshire. It was subsumed into the new unitary authority of North Yorkshire Council on 1 April 2023.

==Geography==
Hambleton covered an area of 1,311.17 km² most of which, 1,254.90 km2, was green space. The district was named after the Hambleton Hills, part of the North York Moors National Park, on the eastern edge of the district. This area was the subject of a national habitat protection scheme as articulated in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Biodiversity Action Plan.
About 75% of the district was in the Vales of Mowbray and of York. These two vales consist largely of low lying and intensively worked arable land which is mostly used for farming. 16% of the former district was within the North York Moors National Park and just over 1% was in the York green belt zone.

==Towns==

Towns that were in the district are listed below. Northallerton housed the headquarters of Hambleton District Council. The district was also the location of 17 wards and 177 parishes.

*Bedale
*Easingwold
*Northallerton
*Stokesley
*Thirsk

==District Council==


=== Abolition ===
In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, the non-metropolitan county would be reorganised into a unitary authority. Hambleton District Council was abolished and its functions were transferred to a new single authority for the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.

==Demographics==
In 2007 Hambleton had an estimated population of 86,900 an increase of 3.2% on the population of 84,200 recorded in the 2001 UK census. In the 2001 census 83% of respondents identified their religion as Christians above the national average for England which was 71.74%. No other religion accounted for more than 0.2% of the population; the next two largest groups of respondents were those with no religion, at 10.40%, and those who did not state a religion, at 6.14%.

<doc id="442185" wikidata="Q657890" url="?curid=442185" title="Ryedale">
<text>Ryedale was a non-metropolitan district in North Yorkshire, England. It was in the Vale of Pickering, a low-lying flat area of land drained by the River Derwent. The Vale&#x27;s landscape is rural with scattered villages and towns. It has been inhabited continuously from the Mesolithic period. The economy was largely agricultural with light industry and tourism playing an increasing role.

Towns included Helmsley, Kirkbymoorside, Malton, Norton-on-Derwent, and Pickering. Part of Ryedale lies within the North York Moors National Park. The A64 passed through Ryedale and villages such as Rillington. In the 2011 Census, the population of this primarily rural area of 150,659 hectares, the largest district in North Yorkshire, was 51,700.

==Derivation of name==
The name refers to the River Rye and was previously used for the Ryedale wapentake of Yorkshire, which covered roughly the same area. The non-metropolitan district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of urban district of Norton and Norton Rural District, from the historic East Riding of Yorkshire, along with the urban districts of Malton and Pickering with Flaxton Rural District, Helmsley Rural District, Kirkbymoorside Rural District, Malton Rural District and Pickering Rural District, all from the North Riding of Yorkshire.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, there were markets in several Ryedale towns; Malton, Pickering, Kirkbymoorside, and Helmsley. A monastery was built at Lastingham in 654. Over the centuries, Celts, Romans and Anglo Saxons all inhabited the area around Pickering. The district had many ancient Saxon churches and some can still be visited, including St Peter&#x27;s in Scrayingham, St Martin&#x27;s in Wharram Percy, St Martins in Bulmer, St Helens in Amotherby, All Saints in Appleton-le-Street, St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Pickering, All Saints in Hovingham, Holy Trinity in Stonegrave, St Gregory&#x27;s Minster, Kirkdale built around 1055-1065, All Saints in Sinnington and St Andrews in Ailsby/Middleton. The Kirkdale sundial above St Gregory&#x27;s door dates to the 11th century (c. 1055 to 1065).

Several abbeys and priories were also built in the 12th century, including Kirkham Priory, the very large Byland Abbey, Ampleforth Abbey, now the site of the Catholic Ampleforth College, and the finest ruined abbey in Yorkshire, Rievaulx Abbey near Helmsley; it was seized in 1538 during the dissolution of the monasteries. All can be seen but all except Ampleforth are ruins.

Ryedale has two impressive castles, both now ruins. The traditional style Pickering Castle was a royal hunting lodge with a moat, while Helmsley Castle was a fine medieval structure with double earthworks. The latter was extensively damaged during the Civil War, in 1644.

==Council==

(*2023 composed of 5 &quot;Independent Group&quot;, 2 &quot;Ryedale First Independents&quot;, 3 &quot;Independents for Ryedale&quot; and 2 &quot;Non-Aligned Independents&quot; and 1 &quot;Independent aligned with Liberal Democrats&quot;.)

Since 2015 one Conservative seat was lost to the Liberal Party in a by-election. Seven former Conservative councillors also joined the Independent bloc.

The Conservatives were nonetheless the largest political party bloc on the council. The district was a stronghold for the Liberal Party who were the second largest political party bloc on the council.

The Ryedale First Independent Group was launched in 2019 by six former Conservative district councillors and one Conservative district councillor who failed to gain re-approval to stand for the party.

=== Abolition ===
In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, the non-metropolitan county would be reorganised into a unitary authority. Ryedale District Council was abolished and its functions transferred to a new single authority for the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.

==York Unitary Authority==
The district lost about half its population in 1996, when an expanded City of York became a unitary authority area, specifically the parishes of Clifton Without, Earswick, Haxby, Heworth Without, Holtby, Huntington, Murton, New Earswick, Osbaldwick, Rawcliffe, Skelton, Stockton-on-the-Forest, Strensall, Towthorpe, and Wigginton. According to the 2001 census, those parishes that were moved into York had a combined population of 50,163, compared to the population of those parishes remaining in Ryedale district, which numbered 50,872.

==Economy==

The market towns of Helmsley, Kirkbymoorside, Pickering and Malton were the largest centres of population in the Ryedale District with about half of the population living there. The eastern part of the area is dominated by the influence of Scarborough. 
Each of the market towns within the Ryedale District had areas set aside for industrial use and small firms engaged in light industry and the service industries occupy these. The largest employer in the district was the pork processor Karro Food Group (once known as The Malton Bacon Factory), now employing around 1,100 people in this location.

The village of Sherburn in what was eastern Ryedale is home to factories of both Severfield and the Kingspan Group who purchased the local Ward Brothers steelworks business. The Kingspan factory also hosts a 5 MW solar array, one of the largest commercial rooftop solar projects in the UK.

Between 1981 and 2022, the district had hosted the Ryedale Festival, which features concerts and performances at various venues during the summer months.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by both BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from either the Emley Moor or Oliver&#x27;s Mount TV transmitters and BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees which broadcast from the Bilsdale TV transmitter which is near Helmsley. 

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio York and North Yorkshire, YO1 Radio, This is The Coast, and Coast &amp; County Radio. 

Ryedale is served by the local newspapers: 
* &quot;Malton and Pickering Mercury&quot;
* &quot;Gazette and Herald&quot;
*&quot;The York Press&quot;.
*&quot;The Northern Echo&quot;

==Notable residents==
* One Night Only, Indie-pop band
* Richard Buck, athlete
* Francis Jackson, organist and composer
* James Martin, chef and television personality
* James Norton, actor
* Selina Scott, television presenter
* Ryan Swain, television and radio presenter, skateboarder

==Demographics==
For all districts in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, Ryedale had the lowest rate of teenage pregnancy between 2000 and 2013, and remained below the national average for England.

<doc id="442186" wikidata="Q1277382" url="?curid=442186" title="Earl of Perth">
<text>Earl of Perth is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1605 for James Drummond, 4th Lord Drummond. The Drummond family claim descent from Maurice, son of George, a younger son of King Andrew I of Hungary. Maurice arrived in Scotland on the ship which brought Edgar Ætheling, the Saxon claimant to the crown of England after the Norman Conquest, and his sister Margaret to Scotland in 1068. Maurice was given lands in Lennox (Dunbartonshire), together with the hereditary stewardship of the county. The Hungarian Prince theory has been discounted as no evidence of any relationships exists in written records or DNA. &quot;The Red Book of the Menteiths&quot; clearly discounts the Hungarian Prince as a myth likely formed to give status to the Drummond origins. The Drummonds in the 12th century were allied to the Menteiths – their early fortunes developed through the relationship. Indeed, one &quot;Johannes De Drumon&quot;, said to have died in 1301, was buried in Inchmahome Priory which was founded by the Menteiths. His successor John Drummond, the 7th Steward, was deprived of the lands and retired into Perthshire.

John Drummond, Justiciar of Scotia, was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Drummond of Cargill in 1487–8 by King James III of Scotland. His direct descendant, James, 4th Lord Drummond, Ambassador to Spain, was created Earl of Perth and Lord Drummond of Stobhall in 1605.

James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth was attainted for supporting the Jacobites during the rising of 1715. He had been created &quot;Duke of Perth, Marquess of Drummond, Earl of Stobhall, Viscount Cargill, and Lord Concraig&quot; in 1701 by the exiled Jacobite claimant to the British thrones, recognised by adherents of the Royal Stuarts as King James III and VIII. This creation, in the Jacobite Peerage, was never recognised by the &quot;de facto&quot; British government. He and his successors nonetheless continued to claim the Earldom together with the Dukedom. Upon the death of the sixth Duke in 1760, he was succeeded by a second cousin, descended from the younger brother of the 4th Earl and 1st Jacobite Duke, John Drummond, first Earl and Jacobite Duke of Melfort, by his first wife. He, in turn, was succeeded by his third but only surviving son, as the 8th (Jacobite) Duke and 11th &quot;de jure&quot; Earl, who obtained in 1783 the restoration of the estates, forfeited as a result of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He did not succeed, however, in removing the attainder of 1716, but was created by George III of the Hanoverian dynasty, in 1797, &quot;Lord Perth, Baron Drummond of Stobhall&quot;, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which title became extinct on his death in 1800. He was succeeded, as 9th Jacobite Duke of Perth by his cousin, James Lewis Drummond, fourth Duke of Melfort, another holder of a Jacobite dukedom. The 10th Duke, who also held the Melfort titles, was a prelate of Catholic Church, known as the Abbé de Melfort. Upon his death in 1840, he was succeeded in his peerage titles by his nephew, George Drummond, who had embraced the Protestant faith.

In 1853, the sixth Duke of Melfort, George Drummond, was by Act of Parliament deemed the 5th Earl of Perth, and the previous attainder was reversed. Drummond also dropped the use of the dukedom of Melfort, although he had been recognised in French law courts as the &quot;duc de Melfort&quot;, &quot;comte de Lussan&quot; and &quot;baron de Valrose&quot;. At his death in 1902, several titles held by him, such as the Earldom of Melfort, became dormant because no-one could prove a claim to the title. The Earldom of Perth, however, as well as the titular Jacobite Dukedom, passed to William Huntly Drummond, 11th Viscount Strathallan (his 7th cousin twice removed, a descendant of the 2nd Lord Drummond). Because some writers do not count the &quot;de jure&quot; holders of the Earldom in the numbering, the 14th Earl is sometimes referred to as the 5th Earl, and so on. The present Earl of Perth considers himself the 19th holder of the title.

The subsidiary titles held by the Earl of Perth are: &quot;Viscount Strathallan&quot; (created 1686), &quot;Lord Drummond of Cargill&quot; (1488), &quot;Lord Drummond of Stobhall&quot; (1605), &quot;Lord Maderty&quot; (1609) and &quot;Lord Drummond of Cromlix&quot; (1686). The title &quot;Viscount Strathallan&quot; is the courtesy title of the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir. All titles are in the Peerage of Scotland.

The Earl of Perth is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Drummond.

The family seat is at Stobhall, near Perth, from the early 14th century.

<doc id="442189" wikidata="Q6869220" url="?curid=442189" title="Minories">
<text>Minories ( ) is the name of a small former administrative unit, and also of a street in the Aldgate area of the City of London. Both the street and the former administrative area take their name from the Abbey of the Minoresses of St. Clare without Aldgate.

Both are positioned just to the east of, and outside, the line of London&#x27;s former defensive walls, in London&#x27;s East End. The area of the former administrative unit was outside the City of London (most recently in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets), with the street partially in the City and partly in Tower Hamlets. Boundary changes in 1994 mean the area of both is now wholly within the City of London.

== Toponymy ==
Minories&#x27; name is derived from the former Abbey of the Minoresses of St. Clare without Aldgate, founded in 1294. The &quot;minoresses&quot; were nuns, the name being an anglicisation of the latin &quot;sorores minores&quot; (&quot;little sisters&quot;), a name they took out of humility.

The Abbey was also known as the Abbey of St Clare, and by a variety of other variations. The Abbey was a house of the Order of St Clare of Assisi founded by St Clare, one of the first followers of St Francis of Assisi. The order was and is the female branch of the Order of St Francis or Order of Friars Minor known as Franciscans.
As an expression of humility, the male Franciscans had adopted for themselves the Latin term &quot;fratres minores&quot; (&quot;lesser or little brothers&quot;), rendered in English as &quot;friars minor&quot; or just &quot;minors&quot;. In a similar way, the female Franciscans were known in Latin as &quot;sorores minores&quot; (&quot;lesser or little sisters&quot;), anglicised to &quot;minoresses&quot;.

Members of the order were also known as Poor Clares or Clarisses, and the name St. Clare Street, just off the Minories reflects that. 
The name Minories can be found in other English towns, including Birmingham, Colchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Stratford-upon-Avon.

== Governance and history==

Minories was in the ancient parish of St Botolph without Aldgate until 1557, when it became extra-parochial.

The area was a papal peculiar outside the jurisdiction of the English bishops. The abbey was dissolved in 1539, the property passing to the Crown. The chapel of the former abbey became the Church of Holy Trinity, Minories, and other buildings were used as an armoury and later as a workhouse. In 1686, the area became part of the Liberties of the Tower of London. The Minories area historically hosted a large Jewish community.

Minories Holy Trinity, also known as Minories Holy Trinity, was abolished as a civil parish in 1895 and absorbed into the parish of Whitechapel. The parish took its name from Holy Trinity Minories church, just off St Clare St, which was built 1706 on the site of an earlier church but destroyed during the Blitz in 1940.

== The street ==
The modern street named Minories runs north–south with traffic flowing both-ways from Aldgate to Tower Hill; it is part of the A1211 road between the Barbican and Whitechapel. The border between the City and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets ran haphazardly between Minories and nearby Mansell Street until boundary changes in 1994 relocated the present-day border along Mansell Street, so that Minories is now within the City of London. Aldgate Underground station is at the northern end of Minories, on Aldgate High Street.

=== Roman cemetery ===
In September 2013, a well-preserved Roman statue of an eagle with a snake in its mouth, thought to have been part of a funerary monument, was discovered on a building site on the street, close to its junction with Aldgate High Street. Burials were forbidden within the inhabited area in the Roman period, so the City&#x27;s defensive wall was ringed by many large cemeteries. The statue is considered to be one of the best examples of Romano-British sculpture in existence.

=== Minories railway station ===
The street gave its name to Minories railway station, built in 1840 as a part of the London and Blackwall Railway – a cable railway. The site is now occupied by the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station Tower Gateway, which opened in 1987 as the system&#x27;s western terminus. The DLR was extended westward in 1991 to Bank, leaving Tower Gateway as a secondary alternative terminus.

<text>YVTO is the callsign of the official time signal from the Juan Manuel Cagigal Naval Observatory in Caracas, Venezuela. The content of YVTO&#x27;s signal, which is a continuous 1 kW amplitude modulated carrier wave at 5.000 MHz, is much simpler than that broadcast by some of the other time signal stations around the world, such as WWV.

The methods of time transmission from YVTO are very limited. The broadcast employs no form of digital time code. The time of day is given in Venezuelan Standard Time (VET), and is only sent using Spanish language voice announcements. YVTO also transmits 100 ms-long beeps of 1,000 Hz every second, except for thirty seconds past the minute. The top of the minute is marked by a 0.5 second 800 Hz tone.

The station previously broadcast on 6.100 MHz but appears to have changed to the current frequency by 1990.

<doc id="442198" wikidata="Q1293005" url="?curid=442198" title="Edward Pakenham">
<text>Major-General Sir Edward Michael Pakenham, (19 March 1778 – 8 January 1815), was a British Army officer and politician. He was the son of the Baron Longford and the brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington, with whom he served in the Peninsular War. During the War of 1812, he was the commander of British forces attempting to take the Southern port of New Orleans (1814–15). On 8 January 1815, Pakenham was killed in action while leading his men at the Battle of New Orleans.

==Early life==
Pakenham was born at Pakenham Hall (present-day Tullynally Castle) in County Westmeath, Ireland, to Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford, and his wife Catherine Rowley. He was educated at The Royal School, Armagh. His family purchased his commission as a lieutenant in the 92nd Regiment of Foot when he was only sixteen.

==Political career==
Between 1799 and 1800, Pakenham also represented Longford Borough in the Irish House of Commons.

==Military career==
Pakenham served with the 23rd Light Dragoons against the French in Ireland during the 1798 Rebellion and later in Nova Scotia, Barbados, and Saint Croix. He led his men in an attack on Saint Lucia in 1803, where he was wounded. He also fought in the Danish campaign at the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and in Martinique against the French Empire, where he received another wounding. In 1806, his sister Catherine married Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington.

===Peninsular War===
Pakenham, as adjutant-general, joined his well known in-law, the Duke of Wellington, in the Peninsular War. He commanded a regiment in the Battle of Bussaco in 1810 and in 1811 fought in the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro to defend the besieged fortress of Almeida, helping to secure a British victory. In 1812 he was praised for his performance at Salamanca in which he commanded the Third Division and hammered onto the flank of the extended French line. He also received the Army Gold Cross and clasps for the battles of Martinique, Busaco, Fuentes de Oñoro, Salamanca, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse.

===War of 1812===
====Louisiana campaign====

In September 1814, Pakenham, having been promoted to the rank of major general, accepted an offer to replace General Robert Ross as commander of the British North American army, after Ross was killed during the skirmishing prior to the Battle of North Point near Baltimore.

In August 1814, Vice Admiral Cochrane had finally convinced the Admiralty that a campaign against New Orleans would weaken American resolve against Canada, and hasten a successful end to the war. The Royal Navy had begun the Louisiana Campaign to capture New Orleans.

In the winter of 1814, the British had the objective of gaining control of the entrance of the Mississippi, and to challenge the legality of the Louisiana Purchase. To this end, an expeditionary force of about 8,000 troops under General Edward Pakenham had arrived in the Gulf Coast, to attack New Orleans.

A general ceasefire had already been declared by the Treaty of Ghent, signed on 24 December 1814, but as peace was not yet ratified in Washington as required by the treaty, the two nations were still formally at war. The news of the treaty did not reach the combatants until February, several weeks after the battle.

====British reconnaissance-in-force====
On Christmas Day, Pakenham arrived on the battlefield. He ordered a reconnaissance-in-force on 28 December against the earthworks. The reconnaissance-in-force was designed to test Line Jackson and see how well-defended it was, and if any section of the line was weak the British would take advantage of the situation, break through, and call for thousands of more soldiers to smash through the defences. Pakenham inexplicably decided to withdraw all the soldiers after seeing the left side of his reconnaissance-in-force collapsing and retreating in panic.

After the failure of this operation Pakenham met with General Keane and Admiral Cochrane that evening for an update on the situation. Pakenham wanted to use Chef Menteur Pass as the invasion route, but he was overruled by Admiral Cochrane, who insisted that his boats were providing everything needed. Admiral Cochrane believed that the veteran British soldiers would easily destroy Jackson&#x27;s ramshackle army, and he allegedly said that if the army did not do it, his sailors would, and the meeting settled the method and place of the attack.

====Artillery duel on New Year&#x27;s Day 1815====
The main British army arrived on New Year&#x27;s Day 1815 and began an artillery bombardment of the American earthworks. The Americans recovered quickly and mobilized their own artillery to fire back at the British artillery. This began an exchange of artillery fire that continued for three hours. After yet another failure to breach Line Jackson Pakenham decided to wait for his entire force of 8,000 men to assemble before continuing his attack.

====New Orleans====
Pakenham developed a complex plan, dividing his forces into 4 brigades. 
# Colonel Thornton would land soldiers on the Right Bank of the Mississippi, capture the artillery battery, so the guns could be turned against Jackson&#x27;s lines. 
# The main assault against the left-centre of the American line on the Left Bank would be undertaken by Major General Gibbs.
# Light troops would be deployed to breach the right, followed by a Brigade commanded by General Keane, to either exploit the success, or move against the centre.
# General Lambert and his brigade were in reserve.

In front of the American line on the Left Bank, there were 600 metres of open ground to be traversed by the British.

Thornton failed to disembark and capture the battery at the designated time. Pakenham summoned his Assistant Adjutant General (AAG), Major Harry Smith, and informed him Thornton&#x27;s delayed troops would have no impact upon the main attack on the Left Bank. Smith tried to dissuade him from proceeding, but to no avail. Pakenham decided to continue with the attack, half an hour before daylight, at 6.20am. 
The 44th Foot, commanded by Thomas Mullins, was assigned to lead the assault. They had to pick up the fascines and ladders needed, in order to cross the ditches and scale the earthworks respectively. Mullins was not pleased, viewing the regiment&#x27;s role as that of a forlorn hope. Perhaps due to his bad temper, he failed to personally locate the ladders and fascines on the evening of the 7th, as Pakenham had ordered him to do. The officer he assigned, Lieutenant Colonel Johnston, inquired about their location from Captain Emmett, an engineer officer, and reported they were in the advance redoubt.

During the night, an &quot;advance battery&quot; was set up about forward of the &quot;advance redoubt&quot;. Mullins, thinking this to be the location of the materiel, passed the advance redoubt and halted the regiment at the battery. Upon discovering his mistake, he sent about 300 of his 427 men back to the redoubt at the double-quick to pick up the fascines and ladders, but it was too late. The other regiments were already advancing behind the 44th, the party of 300 lost formation as they struggled to reach the redoubt, and as day dawned, the attack commenced before the supplies could be brought forward.

The British column had already been disordered by the passage of the 300 returning to the redoubt, and they advanced into a storm of American fire. Without the fascines and ladders, they were unable to scale and storm the American position. Mullins had compromised their attack.


As Pakenham rallied his troops near the enemy line, grapeshot from US artillery shattered his left knee and killed his horse. As he was helped to his feet by his senior &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, Major Duncan MacDougall, Pakenham was wounded a second time in his right arm. After he mounted MacDougall&#x27;s horse, more grapeshot ripped through his spine, fatally wounding him, and he was carried off the battlefield on a stretcher. He was 36. His last words were reputed to be telling MacDougall to find General John Lambert to tell him to assume command and send forward the reserves.

The British attacks on the Left Bank failed in bloody confusion, with Pakenham and Gibbs among the casualties.

The battle ended in defeat for the British.

Wellington had held Pakenham in high regard and was deeply saddened by news of his death, commenting: We have but one consolation, that he fell as he lived, in the honourable discharge of his duty and distinguished as a soldier and a man. I cannot but regret that he was ever employed on such a service or with such a colleague. The expedition to New Orleans originated with that colleague... The Americans were prepared with an army in a fortified position which still would have been carried, if the duties of others, that is of the Admiral (Sir Alexander Cochrane), had been as well performed as that of he whom we now lament.

Patterson notes that the plan of attack was not Pakenham&#x27;s own, yet he conceded to follow it, despite his reservations, and his death prevented him from reformulating a subsequent attack, following the initial failure.

==Legacy==

There is a statue in his memory at the south transept of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. His body was returned in a cask of rum and buried in the Pakenham family vault in Killucan in County Westmeath, Ireland.

The village of Pakenham in Ontario, Canada, named in honour of his role in the War of 1812. The village is located on the Canadian Mississippi River which empties into the Ottawa River.

There is also a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, named after him.

In the alternative &quot;British Version&quot; of Johnny Horton&#x27;s novelty hit &quot;The Battle of New Orleans,&quot; Horton refers to the British being led into battle by Pakenham. As with other &#x27;historic&#x27; details of the song, Horton haphazardly styles him as &quot;Colonel Pakeningham&quot; despite his actually being General Pakenham.

Two streets in Chalmette, Louisiana, the site of the Battle of New Orleans, are named for Pakenham, Packenham Avenue and Packenham Drive.

<text>Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Urich () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character usually appears in comic books featuring Daredevil and Spider-Man.

Urich is a chain-smoking, tough-as-nails investigative journalist for the New York newspaper &quot;The Daily Bugle.&quot; Urich deduced the secret identity of Daredevil and has used him as a source of information and vice versa. To a lesser extent, he has a similar relationship with Spider-Man, whose alter ego Peter Parker was a photographer for the &quot;Bugle&quot; who occasionally accompanied Urich on assignments. Urich has used these connections to expose supervillains posing as businessmen including Kingpin and Green Goblin.

He has been portrayed by Joe Pantoliano in the 2003 film &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Ben Urich was also portrayed by Vondie Curtis-Hall in the first season of the Marvel Television streaming television series &quot;Daredevil&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

==Publication history==

Created by Roger McKenzie and Gene Colan, Ben Urich first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #153 (July 1978).

==Fictional character biography==
Urich first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; stories, where he investigated Wilson Fisk, a businessman who was secretly the Kingpin, the head of the New York criminal underworld.

Urich plays a vital behind-the-scenes role in the Punisher limited series &quot;Circle of Blood&quot; (drawn by Mike Zeck). When a younger, less experienced Punisher plays into the Kingpin&#x27;s ruse, he leaves a message for Urich. The resulting story results in the murders of several mafia men and the deaths of many innocent people, teaching the entire community how vital Kingpin unfortunately is.

Ben learns the secret of Daredevil&#x27;s identity but refuses to divulge it. He is drawn into the circle of revenge the Kingpin has planned for Daredevil. Ben tries to overcome the intimidation but the threats come closer to home. His fingers are broken and he hears the death of a witness over the phone. His courage crumbles but he rallies back. His wife is nearly killed. The would-be hit-woman turns state&#x27;s evidence and Ben and several allies go to interview her. One of his self-proclaimed &#x27;entourage&#x27; and a prison guard turn out to be Kingpin assassins. Ben defeats one by a severe pistol whipping. The witness is killed. Kingpin uses a super-powered assassin, Nuke, to try to take out all his enemies, but the attempt fails. Urich uses public support to destroy the Kingpin&#x27;s empire.

Urich later takes on another criminal businessman, Norman Osborn, also known as the villainous Green Goblin. After Osborn&#x27;s presumed death, Urich writes an exposé book on the man&#x27;s many crimes, titled &quot;Legacy of Evil&quot;. During the course of research for the book, Ben helps Spider-Man and the Molten Man save Liz Allan&#x27;s son from kidnappers who resembled the Green Goblin. His research helps the trio go through the Goblin&#x27;s history and eventually discover what had really gone on. When Norman returns from the dead (or rather, Europe), he is able to discredit Urich and the book, going to great effort to clear his name. Urich refuses to retract his exposé on Osborn despite being threatened by him and risking his career, and investigates him further to prove that Osborn is a criminal.

Ben becomes colleagues with his nephew Phil Urich. Though unsure at first, Phil proves to be a skilled investigator. Though his work life is professional, his personal life is in shambles, causing him and Ben to become endangered.

During the period where Daredevil&#x27;s identity was exposed in print, Ben refuses to confirm it to J. Jonah Jameson on the principle of protecting his sources, and his status at work suffered for it. Jameson was able to move beyond that argument when he assigns Ben to the new supplement, &quot;The Pulse&quot;. During this assignment he reveals to Peter Parker that he knows his identity as Spider-Man. It is also around this time that Matt Murdock sets up a meeting with Ben to privately declare he is ending their professional relationship to avoid anyone else discovering this connection and using Ben to get to Murdock.

Ben Urich turns out to be right when he originally exposed the Green Goblin, as &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; research would show, and conclusively when the Green Goblin is publicly unmasked by Luke Cage and Spider-Man and sent to jail. Plans for a re-release of &quot;Legacy of Evil&quot; are discussed at that point.

Ben is approached by the Kingpin to act as journalist covering the Kingpin brokering a deal with the FBI for release and reinstatement of his wealth, in exchange for proof that Daredevil is in fact Matt Murdock. To Ben&#x27;s horror, he is the one who is forced to lead the FBI to Daredevil&#x27;s location. Matt Murdock is recovering at the Night Nurse&#x27;s clinic, of which Ben Urich knows the location (he had written an article on her), and he is forced to give that information to the FBI, due to the manipulation of the Kingpin.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Ben is one of the main characters in &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot;, covering Iron Man&#x27;s side as an embedded journalist on behalf of the &quot;Bugle&quot;. His neutrality is called into question after a confrontation with the Green Goblin, who was supposed to be in prison at the time but had been secretly released as part of one of Iron Man&#x27;s plans. After insisting to J. Jonah Jameson that it was him, Ben is fired.

In &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot; #4, Ben reveals to his friend Sally Floyd that seeing the Silver Surfer during the alien&#x27;s first visit to Earth caused him to realize that mankind is not alone in the universe. This drove him into alcoholism for about a year.

In the end of &quot;Civil War: Front Lines&quot;, Ben leaves the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, with Jameson&#x27;s blessing and understanding, and forms the online newspaper Frontlines.com with Sally Floyd. They later form the print newspaper &quot;Front Line&quot;.

===&quot;World War Hulk&quot;===
During the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; storyline, Ben and Sally, in their capacity as the new editorial staff of &quot;Front Line&quot;, are two of the few reporters who cover the alien invasion in close proximity, at times too close as they end up dodging live fire to get &#x27;soldier on the street&#x27; interviews. During the course of those events, Sally Floyd learns that &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; editor Jonah Jameson was the mysterious financial backer of the publication, a fact which they agreed to hide from Urich, lest it kill his spirit.

Ben Urich tries to uncover the identity of the Red Hulk. He works with She-Hulk and Peter Parker. They investigate a former S.H.I.E.L.D. base and almost perish in a terrorist explosion. Red Hulk appears before Urich and threatens to destroy those he works with if the story ever sees print.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Ben was covering a story in a local hospital, only to be trapped inside during the Skrull attacks. He survives, though a new-found nurse friend and all the others inside are killed by rampaging Skrulls. Ben and many other human refugees make their way to Stark Tower, though few are aware a human-hunting Skrull with a large body count hides within. The Skrull perishes via human trickery. Ben and one of the Stark Tower survivors, a young girl, wander the city. The duo witness the climactic battle against the Skrulls in Central Park.

He finds out after the invasion ends, that his wife has died; the exact manner is left unclear. He hits both an incredible depression and writer&#x27;s block. After taking some time off and seeing the city begin to recover, he starts to recover himself. He then gets word of Norman Osborn&#x27;s rise to power and confronts him at the press conference announcing the control of the Thunderbolts Initiative over S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, only to get brushed off by Osborn, and the crowd around cheers for Osborn. This ultimately breaks Urich&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block, prompting him to write his return article: &quot;Dark Reign: Norman Osborn Takes Control&quot;.

===&quot;Siege&quot;===
Following a superpowered disaster in Chicago, Ben teams up with his old friend Bill Stern, a disgraced former news reporter who rescues him from police custody. By coincidence they find Volstagg of the Warriors Three, who was involved in the disaster. The trio travels to Oklahoma, intent on covering Osborn&#x27;s Siege of Asgard. All three end up separating and encountering each other again and again, due to Osborn&#x27;s attacks on Asgard. Ben is almost eaten by Venom during a press junket near the battle. Volstagg saves Ben and Bill from the explosive effects of the HAMMER helicarrier crashing down. All three work to save and evacuate Asgardians with Ben leading the effort. Ben sees the heroes defeat the menace of the Sentry&#x27;s alter-ego the Void. When Norman Osborn tries to escape, Volstagg captures him with a knock-out blow. Ben and Bill return to New York as colleagues while Volstagg works at Soldier Field to rebuild.

===&quot;Shadowland&quot;===
During the &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, Ben is forced by gang members to write about Bullseye&#x27;s funeral. He manages to leave his notebook in Essex County Morgue. Daredevil finds it and leads a rescue mission. The funeral service is interrupted by Daredevil and the Hand, as a massive brawl breaks out, almost killing Ben. Ben becomes involved with the return of the Punisher, who literally fell into the care of Norah, one of his employees.

===Goblin Nation===
Learning of his nephew&#x27;s identity as the new Hobgoblin, Ben Urich attempts to arrange a meeting to talk Phil down and convince him to accept a cure for the Goblin formula, but when Robbie Robertson is discovered in the area, Phil believes that Ben had been trying to set a trap and delivers a serious injury to Robbie before The Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Peter Parker&#x27;s body) appears. Phil is able to get away when Ben convinces Spider-Man to take Robbie to hospital, but Ben makes it clear that he had no interest in protecting Phil and was simply trying to help Robbie while he could still be saved, accepting that Phil liked what he had become and was uninterested in redemption or help.

With the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; on its deathbed, Ben approaches Jessica Drew and convinces her to assist him with investigating potential stories and cases, both local and nationwide. The two are later joined by Porcupine.

The three later become a close-knit team handling super-villain confrontations, with Porcupine handling the main battling work. Drew becomes sidelined with a mysterious pregnancy.

Ben later becomes involved in the battle to eliminate Baron Mordo, who was magically rampaging through New York City. Ben&#x27;s pure soul allows him to wield a magic suit of armor and destroy many of Mordo&#x27;s monsters.

<text>1 Giant Leap is a British electronic music duo consisting of the two principal artists, Jamie Catto (Faithless founding member) and Duncan Bridgeman.

==Career==
Based in the UK, the two musicians set out to create a multimedia project that would encompass a CD, DVD and cinematic presentation that would offer a complete artistic statement. The project offers music, digital video footage shot over the course of six months by Catto and Bridgeman, images, rhythms and spoken word content.

The band was signed to the Palm record label and its eponymous CD was released on 9 April 2002. It features contributions from Dennis Hopper, Kurt Vonnegut, Michael Stipe, Robbie Williams, Eddi Reader, Tom Robbins, Brian Eno, Baaba Maal, Speech, Asha Bhosle, Neneh Cherry, Anita Roddick, Michael Franti, Zap Mama, and other artists and authors. The band&#x27;s theme for the project is &quot;Unity Through Diversity&quot;. A making-of was also shown on the Discovery Channel, which featured some of the effort involved in finding and working with the musicians and other people involved in the project.

1 Giant Leap&#x27;s &quot;My Culture&quot; video for their first top ten single, featuring Robbie Williams and Maxi Jazz from Faithless, received extensive airplay.

In 2004, they moved on to a deal with Simon Fuller and 19 Entertainment to make a second film and album titled &quot;What About Me?&quot; The concept was the same as their initial CD and DVD—travelling the world interviewing artists and sampling music—though the second time around their journey was longer (four years) and doubling the number of contributing artists from their debut release.

== Reception ==
In a review for NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Charles deLedesma said that the album and DVD had &quot;an uphill marketing struggle ... because it isn&#x27;t easily pigeonholed. But that&#x27;s its real strength, too. This production presents a luscious, cohesive collection of images, ideas and extremely beautiful world music, which flows here with the voices of three continents.&quot;

<text>Steve Rune Lundin (born October 7, 1959), known by his pseudonym Steven Erikson, is a Canadian novelist who was educated and trained as both an archaeologist and anthropologist.

He is best known for his ten-volume spanning epic fantasy series &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot;, which began with the publication of &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; (1999) and was completed with the publication of &quot;The Crippled God&quot; (2011). By 2012 over 1 million copies of the series had been sold worldwide, and over 3 million copies by 2018. &quot;SF Site&quot; has called the series &quot;the most significant work of epic fantasy since Donaldson&#x27;s Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Book Review&quot; described it as &quot;the best fantasy series of recent times.&quot; Fellow author Glen Cook has called the series a masterwork, while Stephen R. Donaldson has praised him for his approach to the fantasy genre.

Set in the Malazan world, Erikson has commenced a prequel trilogy, &quot;The Kharkanas Trilogy&quot;, seven novellas, a short story, and is currently working on a sequel trilogy, the first book of which, titled &quot;The God is Not Willing&quot;, was published in 2021.

His foray into science fiction has produced a comedic trilogy, the &quot;Willful Child Trilogy&quot;, a spoof on &quot;Star Trek&quot; and other tropes common in the genre, and a First Contact novel titled &quot;Rejoice, a Knife To the Heart&quot;, published in 2018.

==Life and career==
Steven Rune Lundin was born in Toronto, Ontario, and grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He subsequently lived in the UK with his wife and son, but has since returned to Canada. He is an anthropologist and archaeologist by training and is a graduate of the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. For his thesis at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, Erikson wrote a &quot;story cycle&quot; of short stories titled &quot;A Ruin of Feathers&quot; about an archaeologist in Central America. Subsequently, he received a grant to finish the work which was published by TSAR, a small Canadian publishing house. For his next work he co-won the Anvil Press International 3-Day Novel Contest for which he signed away the rights, a mistake he attributes to inexperience. Erikson&#x27;s third book was also published by TSAR, and consisted of a novella and short stories titled &quot;Revolvo and other Canadian Tales&quot;. Later, upon moving to England, he sold what he refers to as his &quot;first real novel&quot; to Hodder and Stoughton — &quot;This River Awakens&quot; — written when he still lived in Winnipeg. Before assuming the pseudonym Erikson (as an homage to his mother&#x27;s maiden name), he published his first four books, out of print , under his real name. In addition to writing, he paints using oil paints.

==Themes==
Erikson has stated that apart from examining the &quot;human condition&quot;, all his literary work share &quot;compassion&quot; as a theme, or main driving force.
Furthermore, when envisioning the Malazan world, both he and his collaborator Ian Cameron Esslemont agreed to create societies and cultures that never knew sexism and gender based hierarchies of power.

Other themes include social inequality, egalitarianism, death, life, history, and historical accuracy.

==Style==
Erikson has stated explicitly that he enjoys playing with and overturning the conventions of fantasy, presenting characters that violate the stereotypes associated with their roles. They embody the multidimensional characteristics found in human beings, making them more realistic and giving the story more depth, which is why his books are anything but predictable. He deliberately began &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; mid-plot rather than beginning with a more conventional narrative. The writer&#x27;s style of writing includes complex plots with masses of characters. In addition, he has been praised for his willingness to kill central characters when it enhances the plot.

==Reception==
The first novel of the &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot; series, &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; (1999), was well received. It was short-listed for a World Fantasy Award. It has also earned Erikson the reputation as one of the best authors in the fantasy genre, and was described as &quot;An astounding début&quot;. The novel was acclaimed for its &quot;combination of originality and intelligent, strong and exciting storytelling&quot;. The second book in the series, &quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot; (2000), was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by &quot;SF Site&quot;.

Fellow author Glen Cook has called the series a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high water mark of the epic fantasy genre. In his treatise written for &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;, fellow author Stephen R. Donaldson has also praised Erikson for his approach to the fantasy genre, the subversion of classical tropes, the complex characterizations, the social commentary — pointing explicitly to parallels between the fictional Letheras Economy and the US Economy — and has referred to him as &quot;an extraordinary writer&quot;, comparing him to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

==Influences==
Erikson attributes pen and paper Role-Playing games, specifically AD&amp;D and GURPS, as being the biggest influence in his writing career, and even calls it the fundament of the Malazan Empire, from his &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot; series, is based on. Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and Glen Cook&#x27;s The Black Company, both ushering post-Tolkien style of writing, are some of the works that have influenced his storytelling. He also credits the works of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Homer, Arthur C. Clarke, Roger Zelazny, John Gardner, Gustav Hasford, Mark Helprin and Robin Hobb as influences on the Malazan works.

<text>The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA), officially the Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is a bi-state agency instrumentality created by a congressionally approved interstate compact between the state governments of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The authority is principally charged to maintain and develop transportation links between the two states with four bridges and a mass transit rail line across the Delaware River. Though the DRPA has &quot;port&quot; in its name, it does not own or operate any ports.

== History ==

In 1919, the Pennsylvania and New Jersey legislatures approved the creation of the Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission. The first meeting was held on December 12, 1919, with Pennsylvania and New Jersey commissioners. On July 1, 1926, the first bridge opened before a crowd of over 25,000 people. It was named the &quot;Delaware River Bridge&quot;, and following the ceremony, over 100,000 people participated in the inaugural walk. United States President Calvin Coolidge came to dedicate the bridge the next day. At this time, political support existed for a regional governing body for a port authority and the construction of another bridge and a high-speed rail line. On July 17, 1951, United States President Harry S. Truman signed a bill that created the Delaware River Port Authority. In 1953, construction started on a new bridge to connect South Philadelphia and Gloucester City. In 1955, the existing bridge was renamed Benjamin Franklin Bridge, while the name Walt Whitman Bridge was approved for the new bridge that would open in 1957. By 1966, two more bridges were approved: the Commodore Barry Bridge (opened February 1, 1974) and the Betsy Ross Bridge (opened April 30, 1976). In 1974 and 1990, the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Walt Whitman Bridge carried their one-billionth vehicle.

In 2011, DRPA ceased operating the Philadelphia Cruise Terminal. In 2015, DRPA sold the RiverLink Ferry to the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation and the Cooper&#x27;s Ferry Partnership.

In 2022, the DRPA installed more than 20 MW of solar panels at its facilities built by TotalEnergies. The Lindenwold, Ashland, Woodcrest, and Ferry Avenue PATCO stations, as well as the Betsy Ross Bridge, Commodore Barry Bridge, and DRPA&#x27;s headquarters in Camden, have large solar canopies covering their parking lots. These will provide more than half of the DRPA&#x27;s electricity usage and save it $12 million over a 20-year PPA contract.

== Board of Commissioners ==
Sixteen commissioners govern the Delaware River Port Authority, eight representing New Jersey and Pennsylvania. All eight New Jersey commissioners are appointed by the governor of New Jersey, and six Pennsylvania commissioners are appointed by the governor of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania treasurer and the Pennsylvania auditor general serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; commissioners. These two officers are elected officials.

The 16 commissioners also serve as the board of directors for the Port Authority Transit Corporation or PATCO, a DRPA subsidiary.

== Facilities ==
=== Bridges ===

The DRPA operates and maintains four bridges that cross the Delaware River between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. All four bridges charge a $6 westbound toll. From southwest to northeast, they are:
* Commodore Barry Bridge – Completed in 1974, the longest of the four bridges. It connects Chester, Pennsylvania with Bridgeport, New Jersey. It carries U.S. Route 322 and New Jersey County Route 536. It is the last crossing of the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania; the next crossing, to the south, is the Delaware Memorial Bridge between New Jersey and Delaware.
* Walt Whitman Bridge – The most heavily traveled of the four bridges, the Walt Whitman Bridge connects South Philadelphia to Gloucester City, New Jersey. It carries Interstate 76, also known as the Schuylkill Expressway. For passengers going to Pennsylvania from New Jersey, it sees its heaviest volume traffic during sports contests, as the South Philadelphia Sports Complex is at the foot of the bridge. For passengers going into New Jersey from Pennsylvania, it sees its heaviest volume of traffic from Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day, as the Walt Whitman provides access via I-76 and New Jersey Route 42 to the Atlantic City Expressway, and thus to shore points in South Jersey, where many Philadelphia-area residents have shore houses or go for a day trip.
* Benjamin Franklin Bridge – The first completed bridge out of the four (opened in 1926) carries U.S. Route 30 and Interstate 676, as well as the PATCO Speedline. The bridge connects Camden, New Jersey with Center City, Philadelphia. It held the position of the World&#x27;s longest suspension bridge from 1926 to 1929 until being surpassed by the Ambassador Bridge.
* Betsy Ross Bridge – The youngest of the four bridges (opened 1976), it connects the Bridesburg section of Philadelphia to Pennsauken. It carries New Jersey Route 90. Arriving in Pennsylvania, it directly intersects with I-95.

=== Public transportation ===

* PATCO Speedline (rapid transit line)

=== Real estate ===
* One Port Center, Camden, New Jersey

=== Former ===
* AmeriPort Intermodal (Closed rail yard)
* RiverLink Ferry (now operated by Delaware River Waterfront Corporation)
* Skylink (aerial tramway, partially built and then abandoned)

== Police Department ==

The DRPA Police Department provides police services on all DRPA properties, including all Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) locations and trains.

<text>Vale Royal was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district with borough status in Cheshire, England. It contained the towns of Northwich, Winsford and Frodsham.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the area of three former districts and part of a fourth, which were abolished at the same time:
*Northwich Rural District
*Northwich Urban District
*Runcorn Rural District (part)
*Winsford Urban District

The district took its name from Vale Royal Abbey, formerly one of the largest in England, which was situated near the village of Whitegate near the centre of the district. The name was suggested in 1972 by a joint committee of the previous district councils, on the basis of the historic use of the name for the general area of the new district. The district was granted borough status on 5 May 1988, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge Vale Royal with the districts of Chester and Ellesmere Port and Neston to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

Vale Royal was abolished on 31 March 2009, with the area becoming part of the new unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester from 1 April 2009.

==Civil parishes==
The district comprised the following civil parishes:
*Acton Bridge
*Allostock
*Alvanley
*Anderton with Marbury
*Antrobus
*Aston
*Barnton
*Bostock
*Byley
*Comberbach
*Crowton

==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council from 1988 were:

===Composition===
The political composition of the council at its abolition in 2009 was:
==Premises==

Until 1990 the council operated from the various offices it had inherited from its predecessors, being Whitehall in Hartford (from Northwich Rural District Council), the Council House in Northwich (from Northwich Urban District Council), Castle Park House in Frodsham (from Runcorn Rural District Council), and Over Hall in Winsford (from Winsford Urban District Council). In 1990 the council consolidated its offices into a new purpose-built headquarters called Wyvern House on The Drumber in Winsford. Wyvern House was formally opened by Princess Margaret on 19 July 1991. Since the council&#x27;s abolition in 2009, Wyvern House has been used as one of the offices of its successor, Cheshire West and Chester Council.

<doc id="442223" wikidata="Q1193565" url="?curid=442223" title="Satellaview">
<text>The is a satellite modem peripheral produced by Nintendo for the Super Famicom in 1995. Containing 1 megabyte of ROM space and an additional 512 kB of RAM, Satellaview allowed players to download games, magazines, and other media through satellite broadcasts provided by Japanese company St.GIGA. Its heavy third-party support included Squaresoft, Taito, Konami, Capcom, and Seta. To use Satellaview, players purchased a special broadcast satellite (BS) tuner directly from St.GIGA or rented one for a six-month fee. It attaches to the expansion port on the bottom of the Super Famicom.

Satellaview is the result of a collaboration between Nintendo and St.GIGA, the latter known in Japan for its &quot;Tide of Sound&quot; nature sound music. By 1994, St.GIGA was struggling financially due to the Japanese Recession affecting the demand for its music; Nintendo initiated a &quot;rescue&quot; plan by purchasing a stake in the company. Satellaview was produced by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2, the same team that designed the Super Famicom, and was made for a more adult-oriented market. By 1998, Nintendo&#x27;s relationship with St.GIGA was beginning to collapse due to St.GIGA&#x27;s refusal of a debt-management plan and failure to secure a government broadcasting license. Nintendo withdrew support for Satellaview in March 1999, with St.GIGA continuing to supply content until June 30, 2000, when it was fully discontinued.

Consumer adoption of Satellaview was complicated by the rise of technologically superior fifth-generation consoles such as the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64, and by Satellaview&#x27;s high cost, especially due to its exclusive availability via mail order and specific electronic store chains. However, St.GIGA reported more than 100,000 subscribers by March 1997. Retrospectively, Satellaview has been praised by critics for its technological accomplishments and its overall library quality, particularly of the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series. In recent years, it has gained a strong cult following due to much of its content being deemed lost media, with video game preservation groups recovering and hosting its games and other services online.

==History==
Founded in early 1990, St.GIGA was a satellite radio subsidiary of the Japanese satellite television company WOWOW Inc., based in Akasaka, Tokyo. Credited as the world&#x27;s first digital satellite radio station, it was maintained by Hiroshi Yokoi and best known for its &quot;Tide of Sound&quot; broadcasts, which were high-quality digital recordings of nature sounds accompanied by a spoken word narrator known as the &quot;Voice&quot;. The company was initially a success, and is recognized for its innovative concept and nonstandard methodology. It later began releasing albums featuring its own music as well as foreign music such as Hearts of Space and various compositions by Deep Forest, and various pieces of merchandise such as program guides and &quot;sound calendars&quot;. By 1994, St.GIGA struggled financially due to the Japanese Recession reducing consumer spending on ambient music and satellite systems. Nintendo purchased a 19.5% stake in St.GIGA in May, as a way to &quot;rescue&quot; the company and help to successfully restructure it.

Satellaview development began shortly after the acquisition, reportedly in production alongside the Virtual Boy and Nintendo 64. While Nintendo was producing the peripheral, St.GIGA revamped its broadcasting schedule to include a new programming block, the &quot;Super Famicom Hour&quot; providing gameplay tips and news for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming Super Famicom games. St.GIGA would provide the necessary satellite and broadcasting services, and host many of its older music and &quot;Tide of Sound&quot; broadcasts, and Nintendo and other third-party developers would create games and other content for the service. Nintendo stressed to video game publications that much of Satellaview&#x27;s content, specifically St.GIGA broadcasts, were primarily for adults, with video games constituting only a small portion of airtime.
Nintendo officially announced Satellaview on December 21, 1994, at a retail price of , or . Several third-party developers, such as Capcom, Taito, Konami, Seta, and Squaresoft, then announced plans to produce Satellaview games. The peripheral was designed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2, the same team that had designed the Super Famicom. Though Nintendo was in a slump due to falling Super Famicom game sales and the Virtual Boy&#x27;s failure, its management remained confident in Satellaview&#x27;s success and would help calm any consumer concerns; company president Hiroshi Yamauchi expected to sell roughly 2 million Satellaview units each year. Pre-orders were available beginning February 25, 1995. Broadcasting services for Satellaview launched on April 1, and the peripheral was released on April 23. It was only sold via mail order, instead of being released into stores. 

Satellaview was never released outside Japan, which some publications cited as being due to expensive costs of digital satellite broadcasting, and due to a supposed lack of appeal to American consumers. When the service first launched, St.GIGA had a number of issues regarding broadcasting video games and video game-related services through the Satellaview service, such as legal issues with other companies and technical restraints of the time. In June 1996, Nintendo announced a potential partnership with Microsoft to release a similar service for Windows, which would combine St.GIGA&#x27;s broadcasting services with dial-up Internet; this was never launched. By March 1997, St.GIGA reported that Satellaview had 116,378 active users.

By mid 1998, Nintendo&#x27;s relationship with St.GIGA began to deteriorate. St.GIGA refused a debt-management plan created by Nintendo to reduce the firm&#x27;s capital, though having ¥8.8 billion in debt, and had also failed to apply for a government digital satellite broadcasting license by a deadline. This led to Nintendo halting all production of new games and content for the peripheral beginning March 1999, and to cancel content and services via a new BS-4 satellite. St.GIGA continued to supply content for Satellaview, broadcasting reruns of older content and making the service only for video games. Satellaview was fully discontinued on June 30, 2000, due to a severe lack of outside support and a dwindling player base, dropping by nearly 60% from its peak in 1997 to about 46,000 active subscribers. One year later, St.GIGA declared bankruptcy and merged with Japanese media company WireBee, Inc.

==Technical specifications==

A Satellaview device attaches to the expansion port on bottom of a Super Famicom, similar to the 64DD or the Sega CD. Its power transfer bracket supplies the Super Famicom. The peripheral expands the Super Famicom with 1 MB of ROM space and 512 kB of RAM. A Satellaview device is packaged with a custom four-way AC adapter and AV selector, connecting the console to the required BS tuner. Game and broadcast information is stored on 8 MB memory packs, inserted into the top of a special application cartridge. These memory packs can be rewritten with new content, including by certain Super Famicom games, such as &quot;RPG Maker 2&quot;. A vintage user purchased (or rented for six months at ) a BS tuner from St.GIGA, paid monthly fees to St.GIGA and Nintendo, and bought a satellite dish.

The requisite system cartridge, titled &quot;BS-X: Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari&quot; (commonly translated as &quot;BS-X: The Town Whose Name Was Stolen&quot;), serves as both an interactive menu system and as its own game. The game features an &quot;EarthBound&quot;-like hub world, based on buildings representing each of Satellaview&#x27;s services. Players can create a custom avatar, purchase items found in stores scattered across the map, play minigames, read announcements by St.GIGA and Nintendo, and participate in contests. The cartridge increases the Super Famicom&#x27;s hardware performance with extra RAM.

==Games and services==
A total of 114 games were released for Satellaview; some are remakes or updates of older Family Computer and Super Famicom games, and others were created specifically for the service. Nintendo&#x27;s popular franchises include &quot;Kirby&quot;, &quot;F-Zero&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s original games include &quot;Sutte Hakkun&quot;. &quot;EarthBound&quot; creator Shigesato Itoi designed a fishing game called &quot;Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1&quot;. The previously unreleased &quot;Special Tee Shot&quot;, later reworked into &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;, was released. Third-party games include Squaresoft&#x27;s &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; and &quot;Treasure Conflix&quot;, Pack-In-Video&#x27;s &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, Chunsoft&#x27;s &quot;Shiren the Wanderer&quot;, Jaleco&#x27;s &quot;Super Earth Defense Force&quot;, and ASCII&#x27;s &quot;Derby Stallion &#x27;96&quot;. Soundlink games were broadcast with live voice acting by radio personalities and commentators. Unlike other Satellaview games, SoundLink games could only be played on a live schedule. Nintendo often held tournaments for certain games, such as &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot;, that allowed players to compete for prizes.

Alongside games, Satellaview subscribers could access many other different services. Free magazines included video game publications like &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and general Japanese publications focusing on news, music, or celebrity interviews. Soundlink magazines included commentary, often by popular Japanese personalities, such as Bakushō Mondai and All Night Nippon. St.GIGA broadcasts included &quot;Tide of Sound&quot; nature ambiance and other music. A special newsletter by both St.GIGA and Nintendo included service updates such as contests and upcoming events.

==Reception and legacy==
Though having amassed a larger playerbase, and being widely-successful for St.GIGA, Nintendo viewed Satellaview as a commercial failure. The rise of technologically superior consoles such as Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64, made consumers reluctant to purchase Satellaview, especially due to its exclusive availability via mail order delivery or specific electronic stores.

Retrospective feedback on Satellaview has been positive. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine applauded the peripheral for its technological achievements, providing an early form of online gaming years before the advent of services such as Xbox Live. It commended the overall quality of the game library, citing the definitive &quot;BS Legend of Zelda&quot; series. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; liked its uniqueness which will likely never be replicated on modern video game consoles, and its library of games and services. &quot;Shacknews&quot; listed it among Nintendo&#x27;s most innovative products for its technological accomplishments and pioneering of online gaming. &quot;Kill Screen&quot; labeled Satellaview as &quot;perhaps one of the most crucial early experiments in combining games with storytelling&quot;, specifically the Soundlink games and voice acting. They were disappointed at the loss of the entire Soundlink live content library upon discontinuation. &quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;an impressive and ingenious idea for the time, and an innovation that we see to a lesser degree now in terms of interactive television and episodic game installments from modern studios&quot;.

In 1999, Nintendo released a spiritual successor to Satellaview for Nintendo 64, the 64DD and its Randnet Internet service. Originally announced in 1995, a year prior to console launch, Randnet had many similar features, such as a Nintendo newsletter and online gaming, plus chat and email. Nintendo attempted to have St.GIGA transition from Satellaview to the 64DD, however, when St.GIGA refused, Nintendo instead partnered with Japanese media company Recruit to form Randnet. The 64DD was a commercial failure.

Satellaview has a large cult following since the late 2000s due to most of its content having been lost after the service was closed. Many video game preservationists and Nintendo fans have searched for memory packs to recover game data and preserve it online. Fans have created custom private servers that work with the official BS-X application cartridge, and translated certain games such as those from the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series. In retrospective years, publications have raised concerns about the permanent loss of much Satellaview content, specifically live audio from Soundlink games and digital newsletters.

<text>Wijk aan Zee (; ) is a village on the coast of the North Sea in the municipality of Beverwijk, the province of North Holland of the Netherlands. The prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament (formerly called the Corus chess tournament or the Hoogovens tournament) takes place there every year.

Due to its seaside location, Wijk aan Zee has become a popular destination among tourists. This is reflected in the village economy, which consists of many bars and hotels.

==Cultural Village of Europe 1999==

In 1999, Wijk aan Zee named itself &quot;Cultural Village of Europe&quot;, recognizing the special nature of village life in general. This was three years after the Danish village of Tommerup had claimed such a title, but this time a large project was to ensue.

Wijk aan Zee came together with villages from England, Estonia, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany, Denmark, The Czech Republic and Hungary in an effort to determine the role and future of villages in Europe, but also to help each other find ways to cope with difficulties that come to small communities nowadays. Each year, another one of these villages would bear the title of &quot;Cultural Village of Europe&quot;.

During the last years, the Cultural Village project led to an increasingly refined picture of what villages have to offer and how to offer it. Simultaneously, this brought about a social critique that is relevant to urban areas as well. It has attracted the attention of the Dutch government, who asked one of the initiators of the project to write an essay about how to &#x27;build&#x27; villages.

Recently, a Dutch journalist wrote a book about the project called &#x27;Vital Villages&#x27;, in which the thoughts and deeds of the &#x27;village movement&#x27; are documented.

==Atlantic Wall==

In the dune landscape around Wijk aan Zee some bunkers still remain of the Atlantic Wall, built by the German occupying forces between 1940 and 1944. These coastal defence works (&quot;kustverdedigingswerken&quot; in Dutch) formed part of the so-called “Fortress IJmuiden,” (&quot;Festung IJmuiden&quot; in German.) The purpose of the Fortress IJmuiden was to protect the port of IJmuiden and the nearby steelworks against attacks from the Allies. All of these defences were protected by a combination of mine fields, tank ditches, and dams, some of which ran kilometres deep inland. In November 1942 it was decided there would be a complete evacuation of the inhabitants of Wijk aan Zee to the inland country. Many inhabitants withdrew to Beverwijk and Velsen. On 12 August 1943 the occupants were permitted to return at their own risk, but on 15 October 1943 the village was once again evacuated.

On the dunes behind Hotel de Wijk, a radar bunker was constructed by the Germans. This was aimed at intercepting enemy ships and planes. These radar screens had a height of twenty meters and for this reason had to be deeply set in the concrete of the bunker. These radar installations were called Mammoths‘ Teeth, (&quot;Mammutstanden&quot; in Dutch). In total there were four places in the Netherlands where these &quot;Mammoths’ Teeth&quot; stood: Den Helder, Oostkapelle, The Hague and Wijk aan Zee.

In the summer of 1944, after the landings of the Allies, Velsen and some parts of Beverwijk were also evacuated. The occupants of Wijk aan Zee then had to move still further away from their village, generally to Haarlem or Amsterdam. After the liberation and as of 8 June 1945 the people could return to their mostly empty houses. 
The German troops that remained were kept by Allied soldiers and Dutch citizen soldiers as prisoners of war and were kept temporarily in still empty apartments. Before they would return to Germany, they were forced to clear the dams and mine fields. The manner in which this happened was indeed cruel: the soldiers had to clear an area of mines completely by walking arm in arm in wide rows. Some German soldiers lost their lives in this clearing of mines. Some rural occupants didn&#x27;t like the idea of de-mining being finished so quickly and so it could be that the German soldiers searched at least one area for mines where they knew for certain mines had indeed been laid. However, the citizen population had personally removed the mines earlier in that area to be able to enter for poaching purposes.

When the village had been safely cleared, the German soldiers were sent back to Germany.

<text>Crush is a brand of carbonated soft drinks owned and marketed internationally by Keurig Dr Pepper, originally created as an orange soda, Orange Crush. Crush competes with Coca-Cola&#x27;s Fanta. It was created in 1911 by beverage and extract chemist Neil C. Ward. Most flavors of Crush are caffeine-free.

==History==
In 1911, Clayton J. Howel, president and founder of the Orange Crush Company, partnered with Neil C. Ward and incorporated the company. Ward made the recipe for Orange Crush. Howel was not new to the soft drink business, having earlier introduced Howel&#x27;s Orange Julep. Soft drinks of the time often carried the surname of the inventor along with the product name. Howel sold the rights to use his name in conjunction with his first brand; therefore, Ward was given the honors: Crush was first premiered as Ward&#x27;s Orange Crush. Originally, Orange Crush included orange pulp in the bottles, giving it a &quot;fresh squeezed&quot; illusion, even though the pulp was added rather than remaining from squeezed oranges. Pulp has not been in the bottles for decades.

Crush was purchased by Procter &amp; Gamble in 1980 (with the exception of the Canadian rights, which were purchased in 1984). Procter &amp; Gamble only manufactured &quot;bottler&#x27;s base&quot;, which was a concentrate consisting of flavour and colour. One milliliter of bottler&#x27;s base was combined with syrup and carbonated water to create a 12-ounce bottle of Crush. In 1989, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Crush USA from Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Cadbury Schweppes spun off its United States beverage business as Dr Pepper Snapple Group (predecessor of Keurig Dr Pepper) in 2008.

Bottles were originally ribbed, and were made of brown glass at one point. Initially, Orange Crush came in the ribbed or &quot;Krinkly&quot;, clear glass bottle. The brown (amber) glass bottle was introduced in 1937, and is known as the &quot;Krinkly Brown&quot; bottle. The bottle design changed again in 1955, leaving the amber glass and &quot;krinkles&quot; behind. This bottle was called &quot;the Big New Bottle&quot; and was intended to give the product a larger and more &quot;graceful&quot; look. 

===Today===
The Crush brand and trademark are currently owned by Keurig Dr Pepper of Frisco, Texas. Crush is also popular in Canada, where it is distributed by a subsidiary of Canada Dry Motts. It is distributed by various Pepsi bottlers, the biggest being the Pepsi Bottling Group United States.

Other countries where Crush is sold are Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Syria, Uruguay and at one time Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Bolivia. In Chile, Crush has been distributed by Compañía de Cervecerías Unidas since the 1940s. In contrast, in some countries of Latin America the Crush brand is distributed by The Coca-Cola Company, using the same colours and bottles as Fanta.

Several flavours (Orange, Diet Orange, Grape, Strawberry, Pineapple) are available at most stores throughout North America; others, however, are distributed only within small markets. Pineapple Crush, Birch Beer Crush, and Lime Crush for instance, are found in both cans and single serving bottles in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in Fort McMurray, Alberta. From 2009, changes in bottling rights allowed many of these regional flavours to be distributed by the Pepsi Bottling Group in a majority of their territory in the United States, and for PepsiAmerica to distribute Crush in most of its territory.

<doc id="442252" wikidata="Q2445378" url="?curid=442252" title="Sonic Blast">
<text>Sonic Blast is a 1996 side-scrolling platform video game known for its use of pre-rendered visuals. To stop Doctor Robotnik from using Chaos Emerald shards to fortify his base, the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna through 15 levels. As a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series platformer, the characters run and jump to reach the end of a level while defeating enemy robots and collecting rings. In separate bonus stages, the player must run forward and collect rings to earn one of the Chaos Emerald shards.

The game was developed by Aspect and published by Sega for the Game Gear. It was the final &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game for the system, and has been rereleased on the Master System (1997), through three &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed compilations (2003, 2004, and 2023), and the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console (2012). Despite their similar titles and coinciding releases, &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; and &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; have little in common. Retrospective reviewers generally had little praise for &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; and have deemed it one of the series&#x27; worst games. Although some considered its graphics impressive when considering the technological restrictions of the Game Gear, most found its animations and colors mediocre. The level designs and slow gameplay were also criticized.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Blast&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Its story begins when Doctor Robotnik shatters a Chaos Emerald into five shards with a laser. One of the shards hits Sonic the Hedgehog, who, with the help of Knuckles the Echidna, sets out to prevent Robotnik from collecting the other shards and fortifying his island base. Sonic and Knuckles serve as the player-characters of the single-player game. Sonic, in addition to his spinning attacks from prior &quot;Sonic&quot; games, has a special double-jump that gives him a secondary jump in midair. Knuckles retains his abilities from &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;: like Sonic, he can perform spin attacks, but can also glide through the air and climb up walls when he hits them in midair. The player travels through 15 levels (called &quot;acts&quot;), across five parts called zones. Every third act contains a boss fight against Robotnik and one of his larger robots. Zones range from the traditional Green Hill Zone to underwater ruins, and feature vertical loops, slides, and teleporters.

In the &quot;Sonic&quot; series tradition, Sonic and Knuckles collect rings as a form of health. Rings serve as protection for the animals, defending them from the attacks of robot enemies. When taking damage, ten rings scatter across the stage and can be recollected before they disappear. The player starts the game with several lives, which are lost if the player is crushed, drowns, falls into a bottomless pit, or is hit with no rings in their possession. Losing all lives results in a game over, after which the player is returned to the title screen and must restart the game. Power-ups hidden in television monitors provide Sonic and Knuckles numerous boons, including more rings, a burst of speed, shields, invincibility, extra lives, and the ability to save progress in a level. Some monitors, however, contain Robotnik&#x27;s face and do not grant the player anything. Others contain question marks, which grant any of the power-ups. At the end of an act, the player must hit a signpost to complete the level. The signpost will spin until it lands on an image; the image will grant the player a reward.

Similar in fashion to &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, giant rings leading to special stages are hidden around levels. The special stages follow the same basic format of those in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;: the player-character runs forward and must collect rings to meet a required amount. They must avoid bombs, and sometimes will jump, run on boost panels, or hop on springs to get more rings. Successful completion of special stages will grant the characters extra lives, rings, or one of the Chaos Emerald shards.

==Development and release==

&quot;Sonic Blast&quot; was the sixth and final &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; platformer released for the Game Gear, and was developed alongside &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;. Like the previous Game Gear titles, &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; was developed by Aspect and published by Sega. Key staff from Aspect&#x27;s prior &quot;Sonic&quot; games did not work on &quot;Sonic Blast&quot;. A prominent feature of the game is its pre-rendered visuals, which had been popularized by &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. The graphics were rendered in 3D before being converted into sprites; the final result has been compared to that of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. However, the visuals presented some limitations: Sonic and Knuckles have few animation frames, there is no timer, and the player only loses ten rings when hit. Several gameplay elements were reused from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, such as Sonic&#x27;s double-jump and the playable characters.

&quot;Sonic Blast&quot; was released worldwide in November 1996, and in Japan as part of the Kid&#x27;s Gear brand on December 13, 1996, retitled &quot;G Sonic&quot;. Worldwide, it was the last Sega-published Game Gear game; it was the system&#x27;s final game outright in Japan. Though they have similar titles and were released around the same time, &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; and &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; have little in common. The game is fairly common in North America, but &quot;G Sonic&quot; is extremely rare, costing almost 350. A port of the game was released for the Master System exclusively in Brazil in December 1997, distributed by Tec Toy. The game had to be simplified to run on the Master System because of its lower graphical quality. Like &quot;G Sonic&quot;, the Master System version of &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; is rare.

The game has been rereleased in emulated form several times. &quot;Sonic Blast&quot;, as well as the other 11 Game Gear &quot;Sonic&quot; games, is an unlockable bonus in the 2003 GameCube game &quot;Sonic Adventure DX: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. The game is also available in the compilation &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; received a wide release in 2012 on the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console service. New features in the 3DS rerelease include the ability to save player progress and choose between the 3DS&#x27;s normal screen resolution or the Game Gear&#x27;s original resolution. The release came as part of a campaign by Nintendo to release 8-bit games on the 3DS eShop following a drought of releases on the distribution service. It was released along with the other 11 Game Gear &quot;Sonic&quot; games on Sonic Origins Plus in 2023.

==Reception and legacy==

Retrospective reviewers did not remember &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; fondly. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; (&quot;NWR&quot;) summarized the game as &quot;a step back&quot; from the other Game Gear &quot;Sonic&quot; titles, due to what they called &quot;the attempt at aping &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;″s pre-rendered sprites on a handheld&quot;.

Most critics disliked the graphics, some claiming they ruined the game. &quot;Digitally Downloaded&quot; called the visuals more distracting than impressive—hampering the fluidity of the gameplay and preventing the use of integral series elements—while &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; thought the game aged badly when compared to the other &quot;Sonic&quot; Game Gear games with its &quot;muddy colours and shaky animation&quot;. Some, such as writers from &quot;USgamer&quot; and &quot;NWR&quot;, complained the character graphics were too big for the Game Gear&#x27;s small screen. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; found the character animations poor and said they caused gameplay limitations. Although they were mostly critical of the graphics, reviewers did acknowledge the visuals were impressive when considering the limitations of the Game Gear. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; noted that prior to the game&#x27;s release, &quot;the capabilities of [the Game Gear] had seemingly been fully explored&quot;, writing while they offered some compromises, the visuals made &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; stand out.

The gameplay was also criticized. &quot;NWR&quot; wrote that the characters&#x27; abilities were difficult to use properly since the screen was zoomed so close to them and particularly disliked the water-based levels, calling them nearly unplayable due to sluggish controls. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; held considerable grievances against the inconsistent and random level designs, while &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; lamented the game lacked the speed previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games offered, and said the playable characters&#x27; abilities, as well as losing only ten rings when hit, made an already-easy game easier. They shared &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;&#x27;s concerns about the level designs, and argued the boss fights lacked difficulty. &quot;Digitally Downloaded&quot; said the game lacked polish: &quot;were you to convert &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; into the engine of one of the other Game Gear games, its shortcomings would still be prevalent.&quot; However, &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; praised the game&#x27;s take on the traditional &quot;Sonic&quot; formula, calling it &quot;a strong choice for anyone who&#x27;s enjoyed any other 2D [&quot;Sonic&quot; game]&quot;. &quot;Digitally Downloaded&quot;, although overall critical, praised the game for its elements of exploration.

&quot;Sonic Blast&quot; has been called one of the worst games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. &quot;NWR&quot; exclaimed the game &quot;should be avoided at all costs&quot;, and &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; said its title screen was the only redeeming quality. &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote it was &quot;an unpleasant end to the Game Gear&quot; and attributed its shortcomings to the system&#x27;s discontinuation. &quot;Complex&quot; declared it &quot;the worst handheld &quot;Sonic&quot; game ever&quot; and said &quot;thank God they didn&#x27;t attempt the &#x27;3D&#x27; aspect of its 16-bit older brother&quot;. Some reviewers noted &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; was the first game to give Sonic the standard ability to double-jump, which would be used in later games such as &quot;Sonic Colors&quot; (2010).

<text>The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto was an upper-tier level of municipal government in Ontario, Canada, from 1953 to 1998. It was made up of the old city of Toronto and numerous townships, towns and villages that surrounded Toronto, which were starting to urbanize rapidly after World War II. It was commonly referred to as &quot;Metro Toronto&quot; or &quot;Metro&quot;.

Passage of the 1997 &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot; caused the 1998 amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto and its constituents into the current City of Toronto. The boundaries of present-day Toronto are the same as those of Metropolitan Toronto upon its dissolution: Lake Ontario to the south, Etobicoke Creek and Highway 427 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the north, and the Rouge River to the east.

==History==

===City and suburbs===
Prior to the formation of Metropolitan Toronto, the municipalities surrounding the central city of Toronto were all independent townships, towns and villages within York County. After 1912, the city no longer annexed suburbs from York Township. At times, the suburbs asked to be annexed into Toronto, but the city chose not to do so.

In 1924, Ontario cabinet minister George S. Henry was the first to propose a &#x27;metropolitan district&#x27; with its own council, separate from the city and the county, to administer shared services. He wrote a draft bill, but the government chose not to act on it.

The Great Depression saw almost all of the towns and villages of the county become insolvent. When that happened, they were financially taken over by the province. In 1933, Henry, now the premier, appointed a formal inquiry into forming a metropolitan district. A proposal was made for Toronto to provide several of its services to the suburbs as well. The inquiry died with the defeat of Henry in 1934.

In the 1930s, a Liberal Ontario government named the first minister of municipal affairs, David A. Croll, and introduced a draft bill to amalgamate Toronto and the built-up suburbs. The draft bill faced strong opposition in Toronto and was withdrawn. The government then started its own inquiry into issues of the suburbs surrounding Toronto. Through consensus, it came to the conclusion that a metropolitan municipality was the best solution. The inquiry reported in September 1939, and its conclusions were put aside for the duration of World War II.

Two factors changed in the 1940s. A Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PCO) government was elected in 1943, with a changed policy, intending to promote economic growth through government action. Also in 1943, the first master plan was adopted in Toronto. It recognized that future growth would take place in the vacant land of adjacent suburbs. Planning would have to take into account the whole metropolitan area.

Forest Hill reeve Fred Gardiner, who was politically well-connected to newly elected PC premier George Drew, now promoted the idea of ambitious new programs to lay the capital infrastructure for growth. In 1946, the province passed the &quot;Planning Act&quot;, which required each urban municipality to have its own Planning Board. A Toronto and Suburban Planning Board was founded, under the chairmanship of James P. Maher, and the vice-chairmanship of Fred Gardiner. The Board promoted specific projects, and also promoted a suburban &#x27;green belt&#x27;, a unified system of arterial roads and the creation of a single public transit network.

The Board was ineffective. Projects such as a bridge across the Don River Valley and the Spadina Road Extension (the basis for the later Spadina Expressway) were rejected by the local municipalities. Gardiner, elected as chairman of the board in 1949, wrote to Premier Leslie Frost that only a unified municipality could measure up to the problems. In 1950, the City of Toronto Council voted to adopt an amalgamated city, while nearly all of the suburbs rejected the amalgamation.

From 1950 until 1951, the Ontario Municipal Board held hearings on the proposal, under the chairmanship of Lorne Cumming. The Board worked until 1953, releasing its report on January 20, 1953. Cumming&#x27;s report proposed a compromise solution: a two-tiered government, with the formation of a Metropolitan government, governed by a Metropolitan Council, to provide strategic functions, while existing municipalities would retain all other services. He rejected full amalgamation, citing a need to preserve &#x27;a government which is very close to the local residents.&#x27;

===Formation===
The Frost government moved immediately and on February 25, 1953, introduced the bill (&quot;An Act to provide for the Federation of the Municipalities in the Toronto Metropolitan Area for Certain Financial and Other Purposes&quot;) to create the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. The new municipality would have the power to tax real estate and borrow funds on its own. It would be responsible for arterial roads, major sewage and water facilities, regional planning, public transportation, administration of justice, metropolitan parks and housing issues as needed. The municipalities retained their individual fire and police departments, business licensing, public health and libraries.

The council would have its own chairman, selected by the province initially, then to be elected by the Council itself after 1955. Premier Frost convinced Fred Gardiner, who still preferred amalgamation, over the metro scheme, to take the job. Gardiner was well known to Frost through the Conservative Party, was well-off, was felt to be beyond personal corruption. Gardiner accepted the position partly due to his friendship with Frost, and he demanded that he retain his corporate connections. He also felt that the job would be &quot;bigger than anything he had tried before.&quot; The bill to form Metro was passed on April 2, 1953. The Gardiner appointment was announced on April 7.

In Canada, the creation of municipalities falls under provincial jurisdiction. Thus it was provincial legislation, the &quot;Metropolitan Toronto Act&quot;, that created this level of government in 1953. When it took effect in 1954, the portion of York Township not yet annexed by Toronto, as well as all of Scarborough and Etobicoke Townships were incorporated as part of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, and seceded from York County.

Metropolitan Toronto Council had its inaugural meeting on April 15, 1953, and was made up of the Metro chairman, Frederick Gardiner, who had been appointed by the province; the mayor of Toronto; Toronto&#x27;s two most senior controllers; nine senior aldermen from the City of Toronto; and the twelve suburban mayors and reeves.

Metro Toronto was composed of the City of Toronto, the towns of New Toronto, Mimico, Weston and Leaside; the villages of Long Branch, Swansea and Forest Hill and the townships of Etobicoke, York, North York, East York, and Scarborough.

Metropolitan Toronto had planning authority over the surrounding townships such as Vaughan, Markham, and Pickering, although these areas did not have representation on Metro Council.

===Growth and mergers===
Gardiner was Metro chairman from 1953 until the end of 1961. During his tenure, Metro built numerous infrastructure projects, including the opening of the first subway line, start of construction of the second subway line, water and sewage treatment facilities, rental housing for the aged and the Gardiner Expressway, named after Gardiner. Metro also amalgamated the various police forces into one in 1956. It was a period of rapid development of the suburban municipalities of Metro. The population of Metropolitan Toronto increased from one million to 1.6million by the time he left office.

As a result of continued growth, the province reorganized Metro in 1967. The seven small towns and villages, which were no longer any denser than the surrounding areas, were merged into their surrounding municipalities. This left the City of Toronto and the five townships, which at this time were re-designated as boroughs (all but East York were later incorporated as cities). Long Branch, New Toronto, and Mimico were absorbed back into Etobicoke; Weston was absorbed into York; Leaside into East York; and Swansea and Forest Hill, into Toronto, resulting in an unusual final situation where none of the municipalities outside the city were ever entities founded as distinct historic urban settlements in their own right. The reorganized Metropolitan Toronto adopted a flag and decal using a symbol of six rings representing the six municipalities.

====Development pattern====

Development in Metro Toronto generally unfurled outward smoothly from the City of Toronto into the surrounding municipalities with little leapfrogging, giving it a core-to-suburb continuum that ignored municipal boundaries, resulting in it having the structure of a single city. For example, most of the areas of the small inner boroughs of York and East York, were in effect, extensions of inner city Toronto and gradually transitioned into the more typical suburban areas of the outer municipalities (which also had such inner-city areas where they bordered Toronto). Given that none of the boroughs originated as distinct settlements, they did not have their own downtowns. To give themselves an identity distinct from the City of Toronto (which was deemed particularly important after being reincorporated as cities), North York and Scarborough built planned city centres: North York City Centre and Scarborough City Centre respectively. This pattern was in contrast to other metropolitan areas like Hamilton-Wentworth, where suburbs such as Stoney Creek had historic cores and whose inner areas were well separated from inner-city Hamilton.

As the seats on Metro Council were reapportioned according to population, the council was now dominated by the suburban majority; but it continued to address suburban and inner city issues in equal measure.

===Amalgamation===
In the 1995 provincial election, PCO leader Mike Harris campaigned on reducing the level of government in Ontario as part of his Common Sense Revolution platform, and promised to examine Metropolitan Toronto with an eye to eliminating it. However, in the end the Harris government announced what they saw as a superior cost-saving plan. The six municipalities of Metro Toronto would be amalgamated into a single-tier city of Toronto. This was a major break from the past, which had seen the core simply annex suburbs. Similar amalgamations were planned for other parts of Ontario, such as Ottawa and Hamilton.

The announcement touched off vociferous public objections to what the media termed the &quot;megacity&quot; plan. In March 1997 a referendum in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3:1 against amalgamation. However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments, and referendums have little to no legal effect. The Harris government could thus legally ignore the results of the referendum, and did so in April when it tabled the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;. Both opposition parties held a filibuster in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets. This only delayed the bill&#x27;s inevitable passage, given the PCO&#x27;s majority. The amalgamation would take place effective January 1, 1998, at which time the new City of Toronto (legal successor of Old Toronto) came into existence.

==Political structure==
Originally, members of the Metropolitan Toronto Council also sat on their respective lower-tier councils; they were not directly elected to the upper-tier council, and because Toronto councillors often voted in a bloc, inner-city issues tended to dominate.

From its inception in 1953 until the 1966 municipal election, Metropolitan Toronto Council consisted of the mayor of Toronto, two members of the Toronto Board of Control (the top two finishers of the four in municipal election) and one mayor or reeve from each of the 12 suburbs, and was presided over by the Metro chairman who did not have a seat.

With the 1966 election, as the result of the reorganization of the 13 municipalities into the City of Toronto and five boroughs, representation on Metropolitan Toronto Council also changed and the body was expanded from 22 to 32 seats, with greater representation from the suburbs which now had 20 out of 32 seats on the body – up from 11 out of 22 with seats roughly allocated according to population. The distribution of seats was as follows. Toronto (12), North York (6), Scarborough (5), Etobicoke (4), York (3), East York (2).

The new Metro Council was made up of the mayor of Toronto, two of the four members of the Toronto Board of Control, senior aldermen from the nine wards of the City of Toronto, the mayor of Scarborough and the four members of Scarborough&#x27;s Board of Control, the mayor of Etobicoke and three of the four members of Etobicoke&#x27;s Board of Control (the top three in terms of votes), the mayor of York and its two Controllers, the mayor of East York and one alderman, selected by East York council, the mayor of North York, all four members of North York&#x27;s Board of Control, and one alderman selected by North York&#x27;s council. After the Toronto Board of Control was abolished with the 1969 Toronto municipal election, Toronto&#x27;s contingent on Metro Council was made up of the mayor of Toronto and 11 senior aldermen – with the nine previous city wards being redrawn into 11 wards.

In the City of Toronto the person who achieved the greatest number of votes in a ward was named the senior alderman. The person with the second most votes was the junior alderman. Both aldermen sat on the Toronto City Council, but only the senior alderman sat on Metro Council. With the 1985 Toronto municipal election the Metro Councillor and City Councillor in the City of Toronto were elected separately though from the same ward. The Metro Councillors still sat on both the Toronto and Metro Council, however. The suburbs retained the status quo and still did not have direct elections to Metro.

The Province of Ontario changed this arrangement with the 1988 municipal election, requiring direct elections to Metro Council from all of Metro&#x27;s municipalities and severing the links between the two tiers. The suburban boards of control were abolished and Metro Councillors were elected from new Metro Wards, which were larger than the city and borough wards. Now only the mayors of the six member municipalities sat on both the upper-tier and lower-tier councils.

===Metro chairman===

The first chairman of Metropolitan Toronto, Fred Gardiner, was appointed by the province; subsequent chairmen were elected by Metro Council itself. The Metro chairman was, for many years, an ex-officio member of the council without having to be elected to Metro Council by constituents as either a local mayor, controller, alderman or councillor. Beginning in 1988, the position of chairman was chosen by council members from amongst its own members (excluding mayors who could vote for Metro councillors but could no longer run for the position).

As usual in Ontario municipalities, these councils were non-partisan, although in later years some councillors (and candidates) did identify themselves explicitly as members of particular political parties. Metro councillors were elected by plurality.

====List of Metro chairmen====
From the inception of Metro Toronto until amalgamation, there were six chairmen altogether:

*Fred Gardiner (1953–1962) – former Reeve of Forest Hill
*William R. Allen (1962–1969) – former member of the Board of Control for the City of Toronto.

*Paul Godfrey (1973–1984) – former alderman and Metro Councillor for the Borough of North York

*Alan Tonks (1987–1997) – Metro Councillor from and former mayor of the City of York

==City Hall and Metro Hall==
At its inception in 1953, Metro was headquartered at a six-floor building at 67 Adelaide Street East (now home to Adelaide Resource Centre for Women). When the new Toronto City Hall opened in 1965, one of its twin towers was intended for Metro Toronto offices and the other for the City of Toronto; the two councils shared the central Council Chamber. Eventually this space proved inadequate and committee facilities and councillors&#x27; offices were relocated to an office tower at the southwest corner of Bay and Richmond Street (390 Bay Street), across from City Hall; Metro Council continued to meet in the City Hall council chamber. Finally, in 1992, the Metro government moved out of Toronto City Hall altogether and into a newly constructed Metro Hall at 55 John Street, which was designed by Brisbin Brook Beynon Architects (BBB Architects).

The amalgamated council chose to meet at City Hall, though it temporarily met at Metro Hall while City Hall was retrofitted for the enlarged council. Metro Hall continues to be used as office space by the City of Toronto.

* Social services, hostels, public housing, children&#x27;s services: Metro Toronto Community Services, Metro Toronto Hostel Services Division, and Metro Toronto Housing Authority (now Toronto Community Housing Corporation)

<text>Robert Baumle Meyner ( ; July 3, 1908 – May 27, 1990) was an American Democratic Party politician and attorney who served as the 44th governor of New Jersey from 1954 to 1962. Before being elected governor, Meyner represented Warren County in the New Jersey Senate from 1948 to 1951.

==Early life==
Meyner was born on July 3, 1908, in Easton, Pennsylvania, to Gustave Herman Meyner Sr. (1878–1950) and Maria Sophia Bäumle (1881–1968). His father was a German American silk worker from Manchester, New Hampshire. His mother was German, but born in Birsfelden near Basel, in Switzerland, to Robert Bäumle from Harpolingen, Baden and to Franziska Oliva Thüring from Istein, Baden. Robert had an older brother, Gustave Herman Meyner Jr. (1907–1996). He also had a younger sister, Olive F. Meyner Wagner (1913–1982).

In 1916, the Meyner family moved across the state border to Phillipsburg, New Jersey. They briefly settled in Paterson, New Jersey but had returned to Phillipsburg by 1922. Meyner graduated from Phillipsburg High School
in 1926, and entered Lafayette College, where he majored in government and law. He was a brother of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. In 1928, Meyner formed a club supporting Al Smith as a presidential candidate in the 1928 United States presidential election. Smith was the nominee of the Democratic Party but lost the election to Herbert Hoover of the Republican Party.

In his senior year, Meyner was editor in chief of &quot;The Lafayette&quot;, a student newspaper.
After his graduation, he moved on to Columbia Law School, where he was awarded an LL.B. degree in 1933.

While still in school, Meyner had been employed as an apprentice coremaker by the Warren Foundry and Pipe Corporation and Ingersoll Rand. During his college years, Meyner was employed as a weaver by the Gunning Silk Company. Following his graduation from Columbia, Meyner found employment as a law clerk in Union City. He was employed by J. Emil Walscheid and Milton Rosenkranz from February, 1933 to April, 1936.

==Career==

Meyner returned to Phillipsburg in 1936, where he quickly became a well-known trial lawyer.

During World War II, Meyner served as an officer in the Navy, and he was discharged with the rank of lieutenant commander.

===New Jersey Senate===
Meyner&#x27;s prominent involvement in civic and social affairs, as well as the recognition it generated, helped him in 1941 during his first bid for elected office. He lost a campaign for a seat in the New Jersey Senate by only fifty votes.

After a failed run for federal office, he was elected to the state senate in 1947. Though he was the Senate Minority Leader in 1950, Meyner lost his seat in the election of 1951.

===Governor of New Jersey===

The ailing New Jersey Democratic Party chose Meyner as its gubernatorial candidate in 1953, and he achieved a surprise victory, boosted by a minor scandal surrounding his opponent, Paul L. Troast. Meyner&#x27;s first term was marked by strong support for state education and a general restructuring of the government.

While in his first term as governor, Meyner uncovered Employment Security Division Director (and former governor) Harold G. Hoffman&#x27;s massive corruption scam, and suspended Hoffman on March 18, 1954. Meyner defeated Malcolm Forbes handily in 1957 in his bid for re-election.

Meyner left office in January 1962. At the time, New Jersey&#x27;s constitution prohibited governors from serving more than two consecutive terms, but did not place a limit on the total number of terms. After his Democratic successor, Richard J. Hughes had served two terms and was unable to run for a third, the Democratic Party turned back to Meyner as their gubernatorial candidate in 1969. But after 16 years of Democratic administrations, Republican William T. Cahill won election over Meyner.

===Presidential campaign===
In 1958, &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized Meyner as a potential candidate for the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination and featured him on the cover of their November 24 edition of that year (along with five other noteworthy Democrats, including John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson).

At the 1960 Democratic National Convention Meyner received 43 votes for president, finishing fifth behind John F. Kennedy (806 votes), Lyndon Johnson (409 votes), Stuart Symington (86 votes) and Adlai Stevenson (79.5 votes) and just ahead of Hubert Humphrey who received 41 votes.

===Later career===
In 1962, Meyner and Stephen B. Wiley formed the law firm of Meyner and Wiley in Newark, New Jersey.

==Marriage==
Meyner married Helen Stevenson Meyner on January 19, 1957, in Oberlin, Ohio. Helen Meyner served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 until 1979.

==Death==
Meyner had a stroke in 1986 and died on May 27, 1990, in Captiva, Florida.

<doc id="442272" wikidata="Q3324182" url="?curid=442272" title="Judaism and Mormonism">
<text>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has several unique teachings about Judaism and the House of Israel. The largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, the LDS Church teaches the belief that the Jewish people are God&#x27;s chosen people and it also teaches the belief that its members share a common and literal Israelite ancestry with the Jewish people.

==A comparison of the Latter Day Saint movement and Judaism==
=== The nature of God ===

In Judaism, God is strictly monotheistic, an absolute one, indivisible, incorporeal and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. The Hebrew Bible presents Hashem as the creator of the world and it also presents Him as the only power which is controlling history. The Hebrew Bible commands the Israelites not to worship other gods, they should only worship YHWH, the God who brought them out of Egypt (Ex. 20:1-4; Deut. 5:6-7). The Babylonian Talmud references other, &quot;foreign gods&quot; as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power.

Theology of the largest Latter Day Saint denomination (headquartered in Salt Lake City) maintains that God the Father (Heavenly Father), Jesus Christ (his son), and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings in person and in substance, yet one in purpose and glory. James E. Faust expounded this Church doctrine, when he said,
 Together, the three comprise the Godhead, unified in purpose and heart. God the Father and Jesus Christ have tangible, perfected bodies of flesh and bone. Humans are literal spirit children of a Father in Heaven, and through the atonement of Jesus Christ they can return to him and become gods. In his King Follet discourse, Joseph Smith said:

God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted Man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens. That is the great secret ... It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the character of God and to know ... that he was once a man like us. Here, then, is eternal life—to know that only wise and true God, and you have got to learn how to become Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you. ... God himself, the father of us all dwelt on an earth the same as Jesus Christ.

Furthermore, there are other gods within Mormonism, such as the Heavenly Mother. Latter-Day Saint theology also holds that, through the process of exaltation, humans can ascend to godhood. Within LDS theology, God the Father himself, as well as Jesus Christ, were once mortal men who were exalted. However, how they came to obtain immortality is not well understood and is doctrinally different from the process of theosis that mankind will undergo. In other words, God The Father and Jesus Christ reached Godship much differently than the path through exaltation LDS members believe they will take to reach the same status. This is different from the Reorganized LDS view, which follows more closely mainstream Christianity in that it is trinitarian rather than nontrinitarian. In addition there are other Latter Day Saint Denominations (such as the branches of the Church Of Christ With the Elijah Message) which hold to the Oneness of God while expressing a unique form of Modalism. The Book of Mormon also lends itself to modalistic interpretations of the Godhead.

===Jesus===

Jesus is not mentioned in Jewish records of the time. 
With regard to the divinity of Jesus, a basic tenet of Judaism is that God is one in both substance and hypostasis (unitary in person); therefore both the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the Mormon doctrine of three separate Gods &quot;united in purpose&quot;, are rejected in the Jewish belief system. 
Jews also do not believe that God has any physical manifestation. As a result, God does not have a permanent physical body and therefore, the idea that God might have physical, &quot;begotten&quot; children is not possible and considered heresy.

According to the members of the LDS Church, Jesus Christ was the Only Begotten Son of God the Father in the flesh. Latter-day Saints identify Jesus with the Old Testament Jehovah, not with God the Father, indicating that the Israelites&#x27; covenant with Jehovah was actually with Jesus. Due to Jesus&#x27; suffering, death, and resurrection, all mankind is saved from death and will rise again and receive a perfected physical body. Furthermore, the atonement satisfies the demands of justice; grace, forgiveness, and mercy (i.e. salvation) are extended to all who accept Christ as their personal Savior and become his lifelong disciples. Latter-day Saints also believe that there is only one God to whom prayer is offered, that is God the Father. Latter-day Saints do not pray to Jesus, though historically this was not always the case.

Latter-day Saints believe that, the Atonement of Jesus Christ goes so far as to cover everyone who is doing their best to be good (including non-Christians), eventually, it will even rescue almost all of the spirits of the wicked from the &quot;telestial kingdom&quot;. The type of reward they receive, however, depends on the level of their acceptance and obedience.

===Prophecy===
Judaism teaches the view that prophecy ceased after the death of Malachi, and will be restored with the Messianic Age, whereas the Latter-Day Saints believe that revelation was present during the dispensation of Jesus, and that through Joseph Smith prophecy was restored to the earth from an age of apostasy. Thus they believe that Smith and his successors are prophets.

Latter-Day Saints believe that, in addition to the various prophecies from the New Testament, divine prophecy has been restored beginning with Joseph Smith. Additionally, during the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Jesus, Moses, Elijah, and Elias appeared to Smith and Oliver Cowdery, giving them authority. They committed to Smith and Cowdery the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, the leading of the ten tribal families from the north, the administering of the keys of the Abrahamic dispensation, and the keys of sealing powers (D&amp;C 110:3–4, 7).

===Temples===

Solomon&#x27;s Temple held the Ark of the Covenant in a room of the temple referred to as the Holy of Holies. The presiding high priest would enter into this room, said to contain the Shekhina (the presence of God), once a year on Yom Kippur.

The LDS Church&#x27;s Salt Lake Temple contains a Holy of Holies wherein the church&#x27;s president—acting as the Presiding High Priest—enters to fulfill the relationship between the High Priest of Israel and God, in accordance with the Church theological interpretation of the Book of Exodus (). Hence, this Holy of Holies is considered a modern cognate to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle and Temple in Jerusalem.

Of the 173 temples operated by the LDS Church today, only the Salt Lake Temple has a Holy of Holies; previous to the completion of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, the Manti Temple housed a Holy of Holies for the use by the President of the Church. While the room itself still exists in the Manti Temple, it was used as a sealing room for marriages for time, but since it is such a small room, it is now only open for viewing by temple patrons.

Latter-day Saints believe that the Jews will one day rebuild a temple in Jerusalem, and that the Jews will restore the practice of rituals of the Law of Moses within that temple.

===Priesthood and clergy===

Judaism holds that descendants of Aaron in the male line are &quot;Kohanim&quot;, or priests, and other descendants of Levi in the male line are &quot;Leviim&quot;, members of the Hebrew tribe of Levi. &quot;Kohanim&quot; and &quot;Leviim&quot; have specific religious rights, duties, and (in the case of &quot;Kohanim&quot;) restrictions. The daughter of a &quot;Kohen&quot; (a &quot;bat-Kohen&quot;) also has specific rights and restrictions, but does not pass on the status of &quot;Kohen&quot; to her offspring (unless their father is also a &quot;Kohen&quot;). Judaism recognizes no other forms of priesthood.

Rabbis are not necessarily &quot;Kohanim&quot;; rather they are Jews who are particularly learned in Jewish law and practice. Although not required, it is typical for a congregation to have at least one rabbi. While it is typical for rabbis to act similarly to spiritual leaders in other religions—delivering a weekly sermon, visiting the sick, officiating at weddings and other life events, and so on—a rabbi&#x27;s most important function in his or her congregation is interpreting and teaching Jewish law.

Training to become a rabbi includes extensive education in Jewish law and practice, and may also include education in Jewish history and philosophy. In general, a congregation will hire a rabbi after reviewing applications and interviewing several candidates—there is no central body that assigns a rabbi to a congregation.

Orthodox Judaism accepts only male rabbis. Reform Judaism ordained its first female rabbi in 1972, Reconstructionist Judaism in 1974, and Conservative Judaism in 1985. All three non-Orthodox movements also accept openly gay and lesbian rabbis. Karaite Judaism accepts only male &quot;ḥakhamim&quot;, although they serve a different purpose than rabbis do in Rabbinic Judaism. Conservative Judaism moved to allow individual congregations to choose whether or not to accept both gay and lesbian rabbis and same-sex commitment ceremonies in December 2006. There are no restrictions in any branch of Judaism with regard to race or descent.
The LDS Church allows &quot;literal descendants of Aaron&quot; the legal right to preside as bishop, when so directed by the First Presidency. When no worthy descendants of Aaron are available, Melchizedek priesthood holders preside instead.

The orders of the priesthood are the Aaronic, modeled after the priesthood of Aaron the Levite, the first high priest of the Hebrews, and his descendants (Kohen); and the Melchizedek priesthood, modeled after the authority of the prophet Melchizedek. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not recognize a patriarchal order of priesthood separate from the Melchizedek priesthood, and considers that both the Patriarchal and Aaronic priesthoods are subsets of the Melchizedek.

Members of the Tribe of Levi are said to have held the Levitical priesthood by right of birth before Jesus, whereas after Jesus, holders of the Aaronic priesthood have received it &quot;by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands&quot;. The Doctrine and Covenants, however, contains an indication that the Aaronic priesthood is only available until the Tribe of Levi again &quot;makes an offering unto the Lord in righteousness&quot; (See D&amp;C 13:1). The Aaronic priesthood is now typically given at the age of twelve.

Just as the priest&#x27;s and the high priest&#x27;s lines were subsets of the tribe of Levi, parallels may be drawn between levels of authority within the offices of the Latter-day Saint Aaronic priesthood and offices under the Law: deacons, corresponding to Levites; teachers, corresponding to Kohathites; priests, corresponding to the priestly line; and bishops, corresponding to the Aaronic High Priest&#x27;s descendants (not to be confused with the High Priesthood of Melchizedek).

All worthy males are eligible to receive the Aaronic Priesthood at age twelve. At age eighteen, worthy members of the Aaronic priesthood are eligible to be ordained as elders in the Melchizedek Priesthood. Depending on the needs of a church, an elder may be ordained a high priest, patriarch, seventy, or apostle of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

Black people were prohibited from receiving the priesthood until 1978, at which time the LDS Church announced that its leaders had received a revelation permitting all worthy males to receive the priesthood. Some Mormon fundamentalist sects reject this revelation.

Some break-off groups, including the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), have adopted the use of women in clerical roles, which is not accepted by the LDS Church.

===Dietary laws===
The laws of &quot;kashrut&quot; (&quot;keeping kosher&quot;) are the Jewish dietary laws. Food which is prepared in accordance with &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) is termed kosher, and food which is not prepared in accordance with Jewish law is termed &quot;treifah&quot; or &quot;treif&quot;. Kosher laws address which kinds of animals can be eaten and they also require the separation of milk and meat (disputed), they command that vegetables be thoroughly inspected for insects, they command that animals be ritually slaughtered by certified persons, and they command that many food products be produced under rabbinical supervision. Produce from the Land of Israel is subjected to further restrictions.

Jews are expected or required to drink wine on certain occasions. Wine is typically consumed during the Sabbath evening meal, after the recitation of a special blessing. In addition, the drinking of wine is an important part of the celebration of two major Jewish holidays—Passover and Purim.

Latter-Day Saints believe that the Word of Wisdom is a modern revelation which is similar to the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot;. The revelation, which is found in the D&amp;C 89, contains three parts; a list of substances such as wine, strong drink, and tobacco that should not be used, but with exceptions (), a list of foods that should be used, sometimes with certain limitations (), and a promise to those who follow the guidelines ().

Among the substances which should not be used according to the revelation, the first substance is &quot;wine or strong drink&quot;, which the revelation says should not be drunk except for wine, which may be used as part of sacraments (for example, weddings, and the Latter-Day Saint communion). As a further precaution, the revelation states that if wine is used, it should be pure wine and it should be &quot;of your own make&quot; or it should be made by fellow church members. The LDS Church has done away with wine altogether, with water replacing wine in the sacrament. Another revelation, D&amp;C 27, gives similar instruction: that wine should only be used if it is made by church members. While section 27 does not instruct the use of water (indeed, after receiving this revelation Joseph Smith understood it to mean that he should make his own wine - see History of the Church 1:108), it is used as justification for the change.

The revelation also advises against the use of tobacco and &quot;hot drinks&quot; (which was explained by Joseph Smith and his associates as meaning coffee, tea, hot chocolate, hot soup, and other hot liquids). Tobacco is believed to be &quot;not for the body, neither for the belly, and it is not good for man, but it is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.&quot;

The list of foods and substances that the revelation encourages the consumption of includes wholesome herbs, and fruits; however, meat is to be eaten sparingly and ideally, it should only be eaten in the winter, during famines, or during periods of &quot;excess hunger&quot;. Other references ( and ) expand on meat and flesh. The revelation also encourages the use of grains, particularly wheat. The use of barley is also encouraged, particularly for the making of &quot;mild drinks&quot;.

===Sabbath===

Shabbat, lasting from sunset Friday night to the appearance of three stars on Saturday night, celebrates God&#x27;s creation with a day of rest that commemorates God&#x27;s day of rest upon the completion of creation. It plays an important role in Jewish practice and is the subject of a large body of religious law. The most notable law with regard to observation of Jewish Sabbath is the requirement to abstain from creative work of any kind (the most widely known implication of this being the prohibition against kindling a fire). Observant Jews will prepare food ahead of time to avoid having to cook on Sabbath, and observant Orthodox Jews will avoid turning on electric lights (which &quot;creates&quot; an electric circuit) or driving.

While almost all work is forbidden on Sabbath, acts of leisure and pleasure are appropriate, as long as they do not violate any proscription with regard to doing work. A special meal is eaten (including wine and meat, if possible, even if the household cannot afford these luxuries the rest of the week). Married couples are encouraged to engage in sexual relations.

The Sabbath for Latter-day Saints is whichever day is being kept as a Sabbath by the larger surrounding community. Thus, in most predominately Christian nations the Latter-day Saints keep Sunday as the Sabbath and have adopted Christian ideas about it. This is explained in the Church &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot; as: &quot;After the ascension of Christ, the members of the Church, whether Jews or gentiles, kept holy the first day of the week (the Lord&#x27;s day) as a weekly commemoration of our Lord&#x27;s resurrection (Acts 20: 7; 1 Cor. 16: 2; Rev. 1: 10); and by degrees the observance of the seventh day was discontinued.&quot; However, in Israel and some Arab countries, Latter-day Saints celebrate Sabbath on Saturday or on Friday, according to the local customs.

The focus of Sabbath for Latter-day Saints is as a day of rest from worldly concerns and endeavors and to concentrate on spiritual matters such as attending church meetings, scripture study, visiting the sick and infirm, and family activities. Members are further encouraged not to make any purchases on the Sabbath, unless an emergency demands otherwise. Members are also invited to fast on the first Sabbath of the month and abstain from two meals over a 24-hour period, which often corresponds to not eating breakfast or lunch on that day. This period of fasting is used to pray and reflect on their own relationship with God. The money that would have been spent on the two missed meals is usually donated as a fast offering to the church. These fast offerings are dedicated to feed the poor and the needy.

===Scriptures===
Judaism&#x27;s most holy book is the Torah. Virtually all Jewish congregations own at least one &quot;sefer Torah&quot; (copy of the Torah, hand-calligraphed on parchment) of which a portion is read aloud every week. The Torah, the Nevi&#x27;im (the Prophets) and Ketuvim (the Writings), make up the Tanakh.

The Tanakh is explained and supplemented by the Talmud, which is made up of two parts: the Mishnah (Oral Torah) and the Gemara (rabbinic commentaries and analysis). More recent work explaining Jewish law includes the Shulkhan Arukh, which was written in the 16th century. Traditionally, Jews believe that the Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, to be passed on to the Jewish people. Scrolls of the Torah are copied by hand by specially trained scribes.

Joseph Smith said, &quot;I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.&quot; Thus, the study of The Book of Mormon is emphasized by Church leaders and teachers, but they also encourage the study of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible and believe in literal fulfillment of Biblical prophecies and covenants, including the Abrahamic covenant. The eighth Article of Faith states, &quot;We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.&quot; In addition to these two books, in keeping with the meaning of the ninth Article of Faith, the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price are also considered canonical scripture.

According to Latter-Day Saint doctrine, the Book of Mormon was originally written in reformed Egyptian by a group of the House of Israel who had migrated from the area of Jerusalem. The book was translated by Joseph Smith &quot;by the gift and power of God&quot;. The Book of Mormon is in a style that closely resembles the language used in the King James Version of the Bible.

===Afterlife===

Jewish beliefs with regard to an afterlife are highly variable. Physical resurrection of the dead at the time of the Mashiach is a traditional belief (with some European Jews being buried facing Jerusalem, so they would be ready on that day). Other Jewish sages promoted the idea of a purely spiritual resurrection. Adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism are more likely to believe in a general Messianic Age than in a physical Moshiach, with or without resurrection. There is also the possibility of reincarnation in some cases.

In general, religious Jews believe that the soul undergoes a period of reflection and penance after death, before moving on to whatever comes next. This period does not exceed 12 months, and Jewish mourners will say special prayers for the dead during this time, to ease the departed soul&#x27;s passage. (See &quot;Kaddish&quot;).

Heaven and Hell as they are understood in Christian theology are roughly analogous to the Jewish Olam habah and Gehenna, with certain major differences. Jewish faiths generally agree that reward in the afterlife or world to come, whatever its form, is not exclusive to Jews, and that punishment in the afterlife is not eternal but corrective.

The Latter-Day Saint movement teaches of a physical resurrection for some beginning with the resurrection of Christ. At the time of the second coming of Christ there will be a general resurrection of the dead. It is held by the LDS Church that between the time of an individual&#x27;s death and resurrection, the individual inhabits an intermediary afterlife in the Spirit world. The nature of this afterlife depends on the individual. Deceased persons who lived good lives and repented during their life of any major sins they had committed are said to inhabit Paradise. However, spirits inhabiting spirit paradise may also receive an assignment to do &quot;missionary work&quot; to other souls in paradise or to the souls in spirit prison, the condition in which Latter-Day Saints believe the spirits of the &quot;rebellious and ungodly&quot; reside. The term &quot;spirit prison&quot; is sometimes used to describe the condition of any spirit who is awaiting being taught the gospel or having the opportunity to accept ordinances that allow them to progress in gaining further knowledge during their time in the spirit world. Latter-Day Saints hold that missionary work in the spirit world was started by Christ during the days between his death and resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 138).

As Smith&#x27;s personal writings and Latter-Day Saint scriptures indicate, it is also possible that if one follows the commandments, then one may be worthy of becoming a literal god and assist the Father in &quot;bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&quot; (Moses 1:39). &quot;Gospel Principles&quot;, an official book of the LDS Church, states that God the Father was a mortal on another earth the same as Jesus Christ was, and like Jesus was resurrected. Following that example, Latter-day Saints hope to attain same godhood status, while eternally worshiping the Father and the Son (Gospel Principles, chapter 47). In 1977, church president Spencer W. Kimball said, concerning this doctrine of exaltation: &quot;We remember the numerous scriptures which, concentrated in a single line, were said by a former prophet, Lorenzo Snow: &#x27;As man is, God once was; and as God is, man may become.&#x27; This is a power available to us as we reach perfection and receive the experience and power to create, to organize, to control native elements. How limited we are now! We have no power to force the grass to grow, the plants to emerge, the seeds to develop.

The Latter-Day Saint movement teaches the existence of three &quot;degrees of glory.&quot; As well, for the most evil of people there is outer darkness, a &quot;kingdom of no glory&quot;. Outer darkness is considered to be the second death or spiritual death, for those few souls who know a fullness of truth and openly rebel and fight against God. The other three degrees of glory have been labeled the telestial kingdom, the terrestrial kingdom, and the celestial kingdom, with the celestial kingdom itself consisting of &quot;three heavens or degrees&quot; (see Doctrine and Covenants 131). This afterlife is what Latter-Day Saints believe comes after an individual&#x27;s resurrection and judgment. Some individuals will be resurrected before or at the second coming of Jesus, while others will be resurrected years later.

Members of the LDS Church believe all three kingdoms, celestial, terrestrial and telestial, are kingdoms of glory. They are all places of glory suitable to the individuals that will reside in them, based on the desires of their hearts. The church further teaches that baptism performed by the proper authority is required to enter the celestial kingdom.

===Conversion and proselytization===

As a general rule, Jews refrain from active proselytizing, and some Jewish denominations discourage conversion. In Judaism, conversion is not a requirement nor is it a prerequisite for goodness or salvation, and if persons truly wish to convert to Judaism, they will seek out communities and rabbis which they feel comfortable with and begin the process there. Conversion to Judaism involves extensive instruction in Jewish law, the renunciation of other religious affiliations, immersion in a mikveh, and, for males, circumcision. If the potential male convert is already circumcised, a procedure which is known as &quot;hatafat dam brit&quot; is performed, in which blood is drawn from his penis. Orthodox Judaism also requires acceptance of the entire code of Jewish Law.

The LDS Church operates a widespread proselytizing program, and its missionaries are encouraged to invite others to repent and be baptized. Baptism not only carries membership in the church, it also, according to Latter-Day Saint beliefs, carries the blessings of the covenants which were given to the House of Israel. In order to be baptized, individuals must agree to abide by the Word of Wisdom and the law of chastity, agree to pay tithes, attend church meetings, and declare that they have repented of their sins. Like most Christian churches, the Latter Day Saint movement does not require circumcision because circumcision was done away with when Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law of Moses. By being baptized, members are covenanting with God in order to be &quot;circumcised of heart&quot;, which means that they are covenanting to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit in order to live in accordance with the gospel.

Doctrine and Covenants instructs the elders to teach the gospel to all nations, but it instructs them to go to the Gentiles first, and then, it instructs them to go to the Jews. There has not been much proselytizing among the Jews, partially because of the teachings about the destiny of the Jews. Early LDS prophets, such as Brigham Young and Wildord Woodruff, taught the belief that Jewish people could not be truly converted because of the curse which resulted from Jewish deicide. However, after the establishment of the state of Israel, many LDS members felt that the Jewish people should join the LDS Church. During the 1950s, the LDS Church established several missions which specifically targeted Jewish people in several cities in the United States.

===Water purification===

==== Mikveh ====
To achieve a state of ritual purification, observant Jews immerse in a Mikveh. Certain kinds of utensils and other objects are also immersed (this practice should not be confused with the physical cleaning required for kashrut).

The most common use of the Mikveh is the practice of immersion after menstruation, miscarriage, or childbirth. This immersion marks the end of a period of sexual separation, and the woman&#x27;s rejoining with her husband. It is also required that a woman immerse before her wedding. Some men use the Mikvah regularly, either daily, weekly, or before Yom Kippur. This is especially true in Hasidic circles. It is also required for Conversion into Orthodox Judaism for both sexes.

Jewish laws with regard to Mikveh are extensive. The most notable aspect of these laws is that a Mikveh must be filled with &quot;living water,&quot; namely, water that has come directly from the earth in the form of caught rainwater or spring water (water flowing in a river or stream is also acceptable in some cases). Once water has been carried in a vessel or run through a pipe, it is no longer considered &quot;living.&quot; Additionally, immersion must be complete (including the head and hair), and there can be nothing between the water and the person immersing—not only clothing, but also makeup and jewelry are removed. The common practice is to wash thoroughly before immersion (to remove any dirt or dead skin on the body), and to enter the Mikveh while still wet (to avoid any air bubbles that might be trapped on the skin or in the hair).

Unlike baptism, immersion is a private event—unless a physical handicap makes it impossible, the person undergoing immersion enters the Mikveh alone, and says any appropriate prayers themselves. When performed as part of Conversion to Orthodox Judaism, the act of immersion needs to be witnessed by a Beth-din of three Rabbis; however, the person immerses him/herself.

&quot;Symbolic&quot; immersions, where only drops of water are applied, where &quot;carried&quot; water is used, or where the immerser wears any kind of clothing or underclothing, are not considered valid immersions under Jewish law. Jews do not practice or recognize any kind of &quot;Proxy&quot; immersion, where one person immerses in the place of another person (living or dead).

====Baptism====
Baptism is a water purification ritual where one is immersed in water. The practice of purification via immersion exists in many cultures. The word &quot;baptize&quot; derives from the Greek word βάπτειν (the infinitive; also listed as the 1st person singular present active indicative βαπτίζω, which loosely means &quot;to dip, bathe, or wash&quot;).

The Christian ritual of baptism traces back to the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, who the Bible says baptized Jesus in the Jordan River. Latter-Day Saint belief holds that baptisms were performed in Adam and Eve&#x27;s day.

Baptism is a required ordinance and ritual cleansing process when joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and is considered to be a purification process in one&#x27;s conversion. In the event of one&#x27;s excommunication or adoption of another faith, individuals are required to be rebaptized when returning to the church. Baptism is also seen as symbolic of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ with the water representing the grave. After the one being baptized is determined to be worthy through an interview with their priesthood leader, he is dressed in white clothing, symbolizing the purification of the baptism. The ordinance is performed by a priest of the Aaronic priesthood or any holder of the Melchizedek priesthood. Latter-Day Saint children are not baptized until they turn eight years old, which is considered to be the age of accountability.

In the past, it was common for Latter Day Saints to be re-baptized for health, or as a re-affirmation of belief. This practice slowly diminished and is no longer practiced by any of the mainstream denominations.

====Washing and anointing====
In the Latter-Day Saint movement, washing and anointing is an ordinance that symbolizes ritual cleansing and anointing to be a king or queen in heaven. In the LDS Church, the ritual is performed in temples. The ordinance of washing and anointing symbolizes the ritual cleansing of priests that took place at Israel&#x27;s Tabernacle, the temple of Solomon, and later temples in Jerusalem (see Exod. 28:40–42, 29:4–9, 29:20–21, 29:29–30, 30:18–21).

===Marriage===

==== Polygamy in Judaism ====
The Hebrew Bible recounts several cases of polygamy among the ancient Hebrews. One source of polygamy was the practice of levirate marriage, wherein a man was required to marry and support his brother&#x27;s widow.

Ashkenazi Jewry has not practiced polygamy since Rabbenu Gershom&#x27;s ban in the 11th century. Some Sephardi and Mizrahi groups, in particular those from Yemen and Iran (where polygamy is the cultural norm), only discontinued polygamy much more recently, for non-religious reasons. When these groups immigrated to the State of Israel after its 1948 creation, existing polygamous families were &quot;grandfathered&quot; in. Polygamous marriage is banned in the State of Israel, however, and no new polygamous marriages are permitted among those groups.

==== Polygamy in the Latter-Day Saint movement ====
:&quot;See main articles: Mormonism and polygamy, Origin of Latter Day Saint polygamy, Mormon fundamentalism, Polygamy in Christianity.&quot;

Early in its history, the LDS Church practiced polygamy and referred to it as &quot;plural marriage&quot;. The practice of polygamy was introduced by Joseph Smith and it was canonized in scripture as being from &quot;the Lord thy God ... the Alpha and Omega&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants 132:1, 2, 66). It was publicly acknowledged by the church in 1852. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now known as the Community of Christ, rejected polygamy and in 1860, they established an independent church under the leadership of Joseph Smith III, the eldest son of the founding leader.

The practice of polygamy led to opposition to the LDS Church and it also led to the enactment of anti-polygamy laws in the United States. (The U.S. Congress made the practice illegal in U.S. territories in 1862.) Many members of the church fled to Canada or Mexico in an attempt to set up communities which would be free from prosecution. Although Latter-day Saints believed that plural marriage was protected as a religious practice by the United States Constitution, opponents used it to delay Utah&#x27;s statehood until 1896. Increasingly harsh anti-polygamy legislation stripped church members of their rights as citizens, revoked the right to vote for female members of the church, disincorporated the church, and permitted the seizure of church property until the church formally discontinued the practice with the 1890 Manifesto.

National attention in the United States focused on polygamy in the church in the early-20th century during the House hearings on Representative-elect B. H. Roberts and Senate hearings on Senator-elect Reed Smoot (the Smoot Hearings). This caused church president Joseph F. Smith to issue the &quot;Second Manifesto&quot; against polygamy in 1904. Since that time, it has been church policy to excommunicate any member either practicing or openly advocating the practice of polygamy.

The ban on polygamy resulted in a schism within the LDS Church, with various Mormon fundamentalist groups leaving the church and continuing to practice polygamy. Collectively, such groups now comprise less than three tenths of one percent of the total membership of the Latter-Day Saint Movement. Among these groups, polygamy currently persists in Utah and neighboring states, and it is also practiced by isolated individuals with no organized church affiliation. The largest church which supports polygamy is the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and it is believed to have about 10,000 members. According to one source, there are as many as 37,000 Mormon fundamentalists, and less than half of them live in polygamous households. Most of the polygamy is believed to be restricted to about a dozen extended groups of polygamous Mormon fundamentalists.

===Divisions===
Judaism encompasses a spectrum of observance with several recognized branches: Hasidic Judaism, Haredi Judaism (often referred to as &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;), Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Humanistic Judaism. Further divisions exist within the divisions.

Approximately 98 percent of Latter Day Saint adherents are members of the LDS Church; however, there are several other groups, such as the Community of Christ and numerous smaller churches within Mormon fundamentalism. The second largest group, the Community of Christ, refer to themselves as Latter Day Saints but not as Mormons, though they do continue to use the Book of Mormon as scripture. The doctrine of the Community of Christ doctrine has changed markedly since their reorganization by Joseph Smith III. Two major changes have been the acceptance of the trinitarian concept of God and ordaining women to the priesthood. Fundamentalist Mormons, in contrast, claim adherence to traditional beliefs and practices that have been rejected or changed by the LDS Church.

==Jewish symbolism in the Latter-Day Saint movement==

The LDS Church includes among its traditional symbols the Star of David, which has been the symbol of Judaism since at least the 13th century. For the LDS Church, it represents the divine Israelite covenant, Israelite regathering, and affinity with Judaism; a Star of David is prominently depicted in a stained glass window in the landmark Salt Lake Assembly Hall.

==Jewish presence in Utah==
Not long after LDS Church members reached the Salt Lake Valley, adherents of Judaism also arrived in the area. Alexander Neibaur, a Jewish convert to the LDS Church, arrived in 1848. The first permanent Jewish family in Utah is thought to be Julius Gerson Brooks and his wife, Isabell. The first Jewish cemetery in Salt Lake City, Utah, was on land donated by Brigham Young in 1869, and the first Reform synagogue in Salt Lake was funded by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Inspired by the Jewish back-to-the-land movement, Eastern European Jewish immigrants from Philadelphia and New York established the Clarion colony in Sanpete County in 1910. The colony was organized by the Jewish Agricultural and Colonial Association, and with approximately 200 individuals at its height, was one of the largest Jewish farming colony initiatives of its era.

Simon Bamberger, the fourth Governor of Utah (1917–1921) was Jewish; antisemitic publications targeting Bamberger were denounced by most Utahns. B. H. Roberts, a politician and church leader, supported Bamberger&#x27;s campaign by nominating him for the governor.

==Baptism for the dead==
A longtime practice of the LDS Church has been to vicariously baptize their relatives, stemming from the belief that all individuals must receive all saving ordinances to achieve exaltation. Under church theology, vicarious performance of the ordinance of baptism and other temple ordinances does not automatically make a deceased individual a Latter-day Saint, but rather allows the person (believed by Latter-day Saints to be alive in the afterlife) the option of freely accepting or rejecting the ordinances performed on their behalf. Latter-day Saints do not claim the power to compel acceptance of vicarious ordinances or change a deceased person&#x27;s religious affiliation against his will.

From time to time, and contrary to church policy, Latter-day Saint genealogists have submitted the names of other prominent individuals, including at one-point victims of the Holocaust. Official policy states that church members submit the names of their own relatives for these type of ordinances, and requires that permission of the closest living relative be obtained for any baptism that is to be performed for deceased individuals born within the last 95 years. Regardless, some baptisms were performed on behalf of Holocaust victims. When this information became public, it generated vocal criticism of the Church from Jewish groups, who found this ritual to be insulting and insensitive. In 1995, in part as a result of public pressure, church leaders promised to put new policies into place that would help stop the practice, unless specifically requested or approved by the surviving spouse, children or parents of the victims.

In late 2002, information surfaced that members of the church had not stopped the practice of baptizing Jewish Holocaust victims despite directives from the church leadership. Criticism once again arose from Jewish groups. The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center is on record as opposing the vicarious baptism of Holocaust victims. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the center stated, &quot;If these people did not contact the Latter-Day Saints themselves, the adage should be: Don&#x27;t call me, I&#x27;ll call you. With the greatest of respect to them, we do not think they are the exclusive arbitrators of who is saved.&quot; Recently, church leaders have agreed to meet with leaders of the &quot;World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors&quot;.

In December 2002, independent researcher Helen Radkey published a report showing that the church&#x27;s 1995 promise to remove Jewish Nazi victims from its International Genealogical Index (IGI) was not sufficient; her research of the church&#x27;s database uncovered the names of about 19,000 who had a 40 to 50 percent chance of having &quot;the potential to be Holocaust victims ... in Russia, Poland, France, and Austria.&quot;

Genealogist Bernard Kouchel conducted a search of the IGI and discovered that many well-known Jewish people have been vicariously baptized, including Rashi, Maimonides, Albert Einstein, Menachem Begin, Irving Berlin, Marc Chagall, and Gilda Radner. Some permissions may have been obtained, but there is currently no system in place to verify that these permissions were obtained, which has angered many in various religious and cultural communities.

In 2004, Schelly Talalay Dardashti, Jewish genealogy columnist for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, noted that some Jews, even those with no Latter-Day Saint descendants, are being rebaptized after being removed from the rolls. In an interview, D. Todd Christofferson, a church official, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that it was not feasible for the church to continuously monitor the archives to ensure that no new Jewish names appear.

On April 11, 2005, Jewish and church officials met and created a joint Jewish/Mormon committee with the goal of preventing future issues. The committee met intermittently over the next few years. On September 1, 2010, Jewish and leaders from the LDS Church issued a joint statement &quot;acknowledging that concerns between members of both groups over [the] sensitive doctrinal issue have been eliminated.&quot; However, in February 2012, the issue re-emerged after it was found that the parents of Holocaust survivor and Jewish rights advocate Simon Wiesenthal were added to the FamilyTree genealogical database.

==Latter-Day Saint movement&#x27;s views on Jews==
According to Armand Mauss, most LDS members simultaneously hold beliefs that encourage them to show a feeling of religious affinity for the Jews along with beliefs that encourage them to show a feeling of religious hostility towards Jews, beliefs that are in line with orthodox LDS teachings. Most LDS members believe that Jews are God&#x27;s chosen people and they also believe that LDS Church members and Jews share a common and literal Israelite ancestry, an ancestry which was associated with an affinity for Jews. However, most LDS members also believe that God is perpetually punishing Jews for their part in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and they will not be forgiven until they are converted.

===Claims of House of Israel descent===

Latter-Day Saints consider themselves to be the descendants of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (also known as &quot;Israel&quot;) or they consider themselves to be adoptees into the House of Israel, and contemporary Latter-Day Saints use the terms &quot;House of Israel&quot; and &quot;House of Joseph&quot; when they refer to themselves.

The Book of Mormon states that the family of the Tribe of Manasseh and the family of the Tribe of Ephraim migrated from Jerusalem to an unknown location in the Americas. According to Mormon doctrine, this migration fulfilled the prophecy of Jacob on his son, Joseph: &quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall&quot; (Genesis 49:22). The Book of Mormon also states that members of the Tribe of Judah came to the Americas after they were defeated by Babylon in around 600 BCE.

Additionally, Alma 16:13 of the Book of Mormon specifically contains the Greek word &quot;synagogues&quot;&#x27;:&quot;And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews&quot;

The official position of the LDS Church is that those who have accepted the teachings of the church or those who are members of the Latter Day Saint movement are primarily from the House of Joseph, either by blood lineage or by adoption, when the recipient is not a literal descendant of Jacob, who is also known as Israel. Individual church members are told about their tribal affiliation through a patriarchal blessing. The LDS Church teaches the belief that all of the tribes exist within their numbers, but it does not teach the belief that members of every tribe live in every country. By far, Ephraim and Manasseh are the two largest tribes in the LDS Church.

Tribal affiliation is usually not discussed in everyday church life, and all church members worship together, regardless of tribal affiliation. Usually, the knowledge of one&#x27;s tribal affiliation is only shared with one&#x27;s immediate family.

In modern Jewish culture, by contrast, knowledge of individual tribal affiliation has been lost since antiquity, except in the case of Levites and Cohens, where such knowledge is relevant to religious practice. However, some Jewish families hold family traditions of descent from other tribes. The Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel has recognized the Beta Israel of Ethiopia as the Tribe of Dan, and he has also recognized the Bene Menashe of India as the Tribe of Menasseh. The Bene Israel of India and the Lemba people of Africa claim descent from Kohanim—according to a government report, these claims are supported by DNA analysis.

The position of those who consider themselves Jewish with regard to Latter-Day Saints is similar to their feelings about other Christian groups—while peaceful coexistence is strongly desired, attempts at conversion are considered inappropriate and unwanted.

Some Jewish groups like Jews for Judaism reject wholesale the claims of the LDS Church that the conversion to the church reveals a familial connection between the convert and ethnic Jews. They base their position on Judaism&#x27;s interpretation of Hebrew scriptures and advances in biological science, saying, &quot;No amount of genetic testing or DNA sampling will show the Jewish people and the Latter-day Saints to be of the same ancestry. The Latter-day Saints are simply not of Israelite origins... For all their assertions and genealogical research, the Latter-day Saints are not descendants of Joseph and can never join Judah in fulfillment of a nonexistent prophecy.&quot;

On similar grounds they reject claims from the LDS Church that Native Americans have Hebrew origins. They also critique church scripture for, in their view, an erroneous use of the word &quot;Jew&quot;, saying &quot;If the American Indians are descendants of Manasseh that would make them Israelites but not specifically Jews. The term &#x27;Jews&#x27; is associated with the tribe of Judah and those of Israelite descent who practice Judaism. ... [I]n the Book of Mormon the inhabitants of what are now the Americas are referred to as descendants of Jews although the dominant group supposedly stems from Manasseh. Thus, Nephi is alleged to have written, &#x27;And thus shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews&#x27; (2 Nephi 30:4).&quot;

Despite this objection, the Biblical use of the term &#x27;Jew&#x27; while associated with the tribe of Judah, is not synonymous with the tribe of Judah. Rather, the term &#x27;Jew&#x27; means someone who is from the Southern Kingdom of Judah (as opposed to the Northern Kingdom of Israel). For example, Mordechi and Esther were &#x27;Jews&#x27;, despite being from the tribe of Benjamin. Esther 2:5 reads, &quot;Now in Shushan, the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite:&quot; Lehi and his family were inhabitants of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, and as such were &#x27;Jews&#x27;.

===The LDS Church and the State of Israel===
The LDS Church is officially neutral when it comes to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Latter-Day Saints, as well as many Jews, are also in favor of peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land. The church recognizes Jews and Arabs as children of Abraham.

The LDS Church has at least three congregations in Israel: the Jerusalem Branch in Jerusalem, a branch in Tel Aviv, a branch in Be&#x27;er Sheva, (and formerly: the Galilee Branch in Tiberias). There are also branches in nearby Amman and Beirut. Latter-day Saints in Israel hold their worship services on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.

&quot;Missionaries are allowed to proselytize, although the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints voluntarily refrains from proselytizing under an agreement with the Government.&quot;

Brigham Young University (BYU) has a study center in Jerusalem that is active in research and cultural activities (e.g., classical music concerts). Its creation was initially protested by Haredi Jewish groups which claimed, despite reassurances from the church that it would not be a center of proselytizing activities. BYU was allowed to open the center in Jerusalem only after promising the mayor that no proselytizing would take place and that all students would be foreigners. The courses at the center, attracting students from BYU and other institutions of higher learning in the US who wanted to do credit coursework in Israel, have previously been temporarily suspended due to security concerns.

===Jewish curse and gathering===
The LDS Church believes that the Jewish people were collectively responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus. Based on this accusation, the LDS Church believes that God cursed them and scattered them across the Earth. The LDS Church believes that the Jewish people will continue to be punished for their iniquities until they believe in Jesus, repent, and are gathered to Israel.

The Book of Mormon teaches that Jesus came to the Jews because they were the only nation which was wicked enough to crucify him. The Book of Mormon characterizes the works of the Jews in this manner: &quot;for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations&quot;. It also teaches that the Jewish people were punished with death and destruction &quot;according to their iniquities&quot;. It teaches that God gave the gentiles the power to scatter the Jews and it connects their future gathering to their belief that Jesus is the Christ. According to the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, after Jesus reveals himself to the Jews, they will weep because of their iniquities. It warns that if the Jewish people do not repent, &quot;I [will] come and smite the whole earth with a curse, and all flesh [will] be consumed before me&quot;.

On its title page, the Book of Mormon, part of the scripture of Latter-day Saints, states that its purpose is &quot;the convincing of the Jew and the Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.&quot;

The Doctrine and Covenants, a collection of canonized prophecies of Joseph Smith and other Latter-Day Saint leaders, contains prophecies regarding the return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel:
:&quot;And the children of Judah may begin to return to the lands which thou didst give to Abraham, their father.&quot;

In addition, it states:
:&quot;Let them, therefore, who are among the Gentiles flee unto Zion. And let them who be of Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto the mountains of the Lord’s house.&quot;

Joseph Smith taught that the generation of Jews that crucified Jesus were corrupt like his generation.

Brigham Young, an early LDS prophet, taught the belief that the Jewish people were in a middle-tier of cursed lineages, below Lamanites (Native Americans) but above Cain&#x27;s descendants (Black people), because they had crucified Jesus and the gathering in Jerusalem would be part of their penance for it. As part of the curse, they would not receive the gospel and if anyone converted to the church it would be proof that they were not actually Jewish. As more Jews began to assimilate into Northern America and Western Europe, church leaders began to soften their stance, saying instead that Lord was gradually withdrawing the curse and the Jews were beginning to believe in Christ, but that it wouldn&#x27;t fully happen until Jesus returned. The Holocaust and the threats of Nazism were seen as fulfillment of prophecy that the Jews would be punished. Likewise, the establishment of Israel and the influx of Jewish people were seen as fulfillment of prophecy that they Jewish people would be gathered and the curse lifted.

In 1982, Bruce R. McConkie published a book titled &quot;The Millennial Messiah&quot;, which devotes an entire chapter to &quot;The Jews and the Second Coming&quot;. It states:
:&quot;Let this fact be engraved in the eternal records with a pen of steel: the Jews were cursed, and smitten, and cursed anew, because they rejected the gospel, cast out their Messiah, and crucified their King. ... Let the spiritually illiterate suppose what they may, it was the Jewish denial and rejection of the Holy One of Israel, whom their fathers worshiped in the beauty and holiness, that has made them a hiss and byword in all nations and that has taken millions of their fair sons and daughters to untimely graves. ... What sayeth the holy word? &quot;They shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of Israel, and turn the hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel. And because they turn their hearts aside,…and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and by-word and be hated among all nations.: (1 Ne. 19:13-14; 2 Ne. 6:9-11.) Such is the prophetic word of Nephi.&quot;

After the LDS Church began to give the priesthood to all males regardless of race and it also began to de-emphasize the importance of race, instead, it adopted a more universal emphasis. This has led to a spectrum of views on how LDS members interpret scripture and previous teachings. According to research by Armand Mauss, most LDS members believe that God is perpetually punishing Jews for their part in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and they will not be forgiven until they are converted.

===Treatment of the Jews===
The Book of Mormon contains a specific condemnation of antisemitism:
:&quot;Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor of any remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath sworn.&quot;3 Nephi 29:8

In a May 2, 1976, speech at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, Ezra Taft Benson declared that he cherished his friendship with the Jews of Israel:

:&quot;Among some of my most cherished experiences and recollections are the fond association I have enjoyed in past years with the Jewish people in the United States and the land of Israel. I have visited Israel three times. I have met hundreds of government officials, farmers, business and trade people, and leaders in professions. No visits have been more impressive than the visits with David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, and Moshe Dayan.&quot;

Benson called on Mormons to understand, learn from, and befriend the Jewish people:
:&quot;But our affinity toward modern Judah is not prompted merely out of mutual suffering; it is prompted out of a knowledge of our peculiar relationships together—relationships which claim a common heritage. Jeremiah has prophesied that in the latter times &quot;the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together.&quot; (Jer. 3:18.) My prayer is that because of evenings spent together like this one, this prophecy will come to be fulfilled. We need to know more about the Jews, and the Jews ought to know more about the Mormons. When we understand one another, then perhaps you will understand why Ben-Gurion said, &quot;There are no people in the world who understand the Jews like the Mormons.&quot;

Benson then criticizes the Crusades&#x27; violence: &quot;Some of the most evil of those deeds were perpetrated upon the remaining Jews in Palestine in the name of Christianity during the Crusades. Will Durrant [sic] has correctly written of this sad chapter of human suffering, &#x27;No other people has ever known so long an exile, or so hard a fate.&#x27;&quot;

Benson laments the suffering and &quot;ruins of what was the largest Jewish ghetto in Europe in the Jewish section of Warsaw, Poland&quot;:

:&quot;Here 250,000 descendants of Judah had lived prior to the war. Under the Nazi rule, through forced labor, Jews were required to build a wall around the ghetto. Later some 150,000 Jews from other parts of Europe were brought into that area. The Germans first tried to starve them out, but when that did not work, they transported over 310,000 Jews to the extermination camps. When Himmler found that there were still some 60,000 Jews alive in the ghetto, he ordered their &quot;resettlement.&quot; When they forcibly resisted, the German S. S. General Stroop ordered the tanks, artillery, flamethrowers, and dynamite squads on the ghetto. The extermination which was to have taken three days lasted four weeks. The final report by the general read, &quot;Total number of Jews dealt with: 56,065, including both Jews caught and Jews whose extermination can be proved.&quot; This report left 36,000 Jews unaccounted for which were no doubt claimed by the gas chambers. (William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Greenwich, Conn.: Fawcett Publishers, 1965, p. 1272.)

:&quot;I have visited some of the concentration camps, the mass graves, and the crematoriums where, it is estimated, six million of the sons and daughters of Judah lost their lives, reducing their world population from seventeen to eleven million.

:&quot;I have been impressed to tears as I visited some of these wanderers, those persecuted and driven sons of our Heavenly Father, my brethren of Judah. Yes, the prophecies regarding the dispersion and suffering of Judah have been fulfilled. But the &quot;gathering and reestablishment of the Jews was also clearly predicted&quot;.

<text>Richard Joseph Hughes (August 10, 1909December 7, 1992) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge. A Democrat, he served as the 45th governor of New Jersey from 1962 to 1970, and as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1973 to 1979. Hughes is the only person to have served New Jersey as both governor and chief justice. Hughes was also the first Roman Catholic governor in New Jersey&#x27;s history.

==Early life and education==
Hughes was born into an Irish-American family on August 10, 1909, in Florence Township, New Jersey. He was the son of Richard Paul and Veronica Hughes (née Gallagher). His father was active in Democratic politics, serving as a state civil service commissioner, warden (then known as &quot;principal keeper&quot;) of Trenton State Prison, now called New Jersey State Prison, and chair of the Burlington County Democratic Party. Hughes graduated from Cathedral High School in Trenton, Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in Philadelphia and the New Jersey Law School, now Rutgers Law School.

==Lawyer and state judge==
Hughes was admitted to the bar in 1932 and entered private practice in Trenton. He became active in Mercer County Democratic politics in 1937 and later became a Democratic state committeeman from the county, as well as president of the New Jersey Young Democrats. Hughes sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938 from New Jersey&#x27;s 4th congressional district, running as a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt; he was defeated by Republican D. Lane Powers by a broad margin but established a reputation as a robust campaigner.

In December 1939, Hughes became a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of New Jersey. In that role, he prosecuted federal crimes, including against members of the pro-Nazi German-American Vocational League. Hughes secured numerous convictions, which bolstered his standing. Hughes stepped down as Assistant U.S. Attorney in June 1945, after being elected chairman of the Mercer County Democratic Party, and resumed private practice in partnership with Thorn Lord, who had been U.S. Attorney.

In 1948, Hughes was appointed by acting Governor John M. Summerill, Jr. as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (which, after the state court system was reorganized, became Mercer County Court). After Superior Court judge William J. Brennan, Jr. was appointed as a justice of the state supreme court in February 1952, Governor Alfred E. Driscoll appointed Hughes to fill the vacancy on the Superior Court bench. Hughes was later appointed to be assignment judge for Union County and was thereafter elevated to the Superior Court, Appellate Division. As a Superior Court judge, Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt appointed Hughes as chair of a committee tasked with studying the state&#x27;s handling of juvenile offenders and making recommendations for changes; the state supreme court accepted the committee&#x27;s recommendations, leading to a reform of the New Jersey juvenile and domestic-relations courts.

Hughes was considered by Governor Robert B. Meyner as a possible nominee to the state supreme court bench. Seeking to support his large family, however, Hughes resigned from the bench in November 1957 in resume the practice of law. In his successful practice, Hughes&#x27; clients included the Association of New Jersey Railroads, Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company, and manufacturers of polio vaccines, whom Hughes defended in antitrust matters.

==Governor, 1962–1970==
Hughes was little known at the time he ran for governor of New Jersey in 1961, and was selected as the Democratic nominee only after the first choice of powerful party leaders, Attorney General Grover C. Richman, had a heart attack. Hughes proved to be a strong campaigner, however, and achieved an upset victory over Republican nominee James P. Mitchell, who had been U.S. Secretary of Labor during the Eisenhower administration, by slightly under 35,000 votes.

One of the important issues of Hughes&#x27; term as governor was state taxation; at the time Hughes took office in 1962, &quot;New Jersey was one of only a handful of states that had neither an income tax nor a sales tax.&quot; Hughes suffered a political defeat when a bond question, which would have issued $750 million in bonds for capital construction, was voted down in the November 1962 elections. Hughes announced his support for enactment of a state personal income tax; consideration of the proposal was delayed by leaders in the state legislature. During Hughes&#x27; campaign for re-election, the tax issue was overshadowed by a political controversy arose when Eugene Genovese, an instructor at Rutgers University, publicly stated that he would &quot;welcome a North Vietnamese victory&quot; in Vietnam. Hughes&#x27; Republican challenger, State Senator Wayne Dumont, called for Genovese to be fired; Hughes criticized Genovese&#x27;s views as &quot;outrageously wrong&quot; but robustly supported academic freedom.

With the backing of organized labor, Hughes was re-elected with 1,279,589 votes, with Dumont taking 915,996. In his second term, he pushed for passage of a state income tax. Although both chambers of the legislature has Democratic majorities, the bill failed, having passed the state House but being defeated by a single vote in the state Senate. In a compromise, the Legislature passed, and Hughes signed, the Sales and Use Tax Act, which established a 3% state sales tax effective in July 1966. Hughes said &quot;that to turn down any broad-based tax would relegate the state to second-class status.&quot;

Hughes was a delegate to three Democratic National Conventions representing New Jersey. He attended Harry S. Truman&#x27;s nomination for a full term as president in Philadelphia in 1948 (as an alternate), Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey&#x27;s selection as standard bearer in Chicago in 1968 and Senator George S. McGovern&#x27;s 1972 convention in Miami Beach.

Many credit the fact that then-President Lyndon B. Johnson had a very close friendship with Hughes, as one reason that Atlantic City hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention.

Hughes was one of three final candidates considered by vice president and presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey to be the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1968.

==Chief justice, 1973–1979==
After serving as governor from 1962 to 1970, he served as the chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court from 1973 to 1979, having been nominated for the post by his successor, William T. Cahill. When Hughes was chief justice, the court issued a unanimous ruling in the Karen Ann Quinlan case, allowing an individual the right to refuse medical treatment and the right of a guardian to exercise that right if the patient cannot.

==Later life==
Hughes left the Supreme Court in 1979 after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, and returned to the private practice of law. In retirement, Hughes was of counsel at Hannoch Weisman, a New Jersey law firm, and split his time between Lawrenceville, New Jersey and Boca Raton, Florida. He suffered a stroke in 1991, and died the following year of congestive heart failure in Boca Raton. He was interred at St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Trenton, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
The building in Trenton, New Jersey which bears his name that houses the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety (headed by the Attorney General), the courtroom, chambers and offices of the State Supreme Court, the courtroom and several chambers and offices of the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, and the administrative headquarters of the statewide court system, was dedicated as the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex, in 1982 in his honor.

==Personal life==
Hughes had five sons, two daughters, and three stepsons. He married Miriam McGrory in 1935; they had four children. His first wife died in 1950; in 1955, he married Elizabeth Sullivan Murphy (died 1983), and they had three children. In 1972, Hughes would contact then-senator Joseph Biden, who he had previously never met, to provide support and advise on how to cope with the unexpected and sudden death of his wife Neilia Hunter Biden.

Several of his children have become prominent in New Jersey law and politics. Hughes&#x27; stepson W. Michael Murphy Jr., a former Morris County prosecutor, placed third in the 1997 Democratic primary for governor of New Jersey. Hughes&#x27; son Brian M. Hughes is the former elected county executive of Mercer County.

<doc id="442280" wikidata="Q888937" url="?curid=442280" title="Brendan Byrne">
<text>Brendan Thomas Byrne (April 1, 1924 – January 4, 2018) was an American attorney and Democratic Party politician who served as the 47th Governor of New Jersey from 1974 to 1982.

Byrne began his career as a private attorney in Newark and East Orange. In 1959, Governor Robert B. Meyner appointed Byrne to serve as Essex County Prosecutor; he served in that role until 1968. In the late 1960s, an FBI wiretap recorded local mobsters calling Byrne &quot;the man who couldn&#x27;t be bought&quot; in reference to his high ethical standards. The publication of the comment propelled Byrne to popularity in an era when corruption was a major concern in state and national politics. He left his office as prosecutor to serve as President of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities from 1968 to 1970, then as a Superior Court judge.

In 1973, using &quot;the man who couldn&#x27;t be bought&quot; as a campaign slogan, Byrne ran for governor of New Jersey. He won the Democratic primary with support from the powerful Hudson County political machine and carried the general election. His landslide victory, until then the largest in the state&#x27;s history, was seen as a reaction against a bribery scandal in state government and the Watergate scandal.

During his first term, Byrne signed the state&#x27;s first income tax, which broke a campaign promise and was initially highly unpopular across party lines. In 1977, he faced several prominent challengers for the party nomination but won the Democratic primary with a small plurality of the vote. Despite expectations he would lose the general election to Raymond Bateman, Byrne came from behind to win a second term.

During his time as governor, Byrne oversaw the opening of the first gambling casinos in Atlantic City and established the New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate. He also preserved a large majority of woodlands and wildlife areas in the state by restricting development.

==Early life and education==
Byrne was born and raised in West Orange, New Jersey. He was the fourth child among five of Irish American Catholic parents Francis A. Byrne (1886–1974), a local public safety commissioner, and Genevieve Brennan Byrne (1888–1969).

In 1942, Byrne graduated from West Orange High School in West Orange, New Jersey, where he as president of the debate club and senior class president. He briefly enrolled at Seton Hall University, but left the university in March of the following year to join the U.S. Army. During World War II, Byrne served in the U.S. Army Air Forces as a navigator on a B-17, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and four Air Medals. By the time of his discharge from active service in 1945, he had achieved the rank of lieutenant.

After the end of World War II, Byrne attended Princeton University for two years, where he studied at the university&#x27;s School of Public and International Affairs. Due to World War II, he spent only two years on campus, finishing his undergraduate thesis while enrolled at Harvard Law School. He graduated from Princeton University&#x27;s School of Public and International Affairs in 1949 after completing a 95-page long senior thesis titled, &quot;Proportional Representation in Municipal Government&quot;. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he graduated with his LL.B. in 1951.

==Career==
===Private attorney===
Byrne then worked as a private attorney, first for the Newark-based law firm of John W. McGeehan, Jr., and later for the East Orange firm of Teltser and Greenberg.

===New Jersey state government===
In October 1955, Byrne was appointed an assistant counsel to Governor Robert B. Meyner. The following year, he became the governor&#x27;s acting executive secretary. In 1958, Byrne was appointed the deputy attorney general responsible for the Essex County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. The following year, Governor Meyner appointed him as the Essex County prosecutor. Governor Hughes reappointed Byrne to this same office in 1964 following the end of his first five-year term. From 1968 to 1970, Byrne served as the president of the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners.

===New Jersey Superior Court===
In 1970, Byrne was appointed by Governor William T. Cahill to the Superior Court. He served as the assignment judge for Morris, Sussex, and Warren Counties starting in 1972.

===Governor of New Jersey (1974–1982)===
====1973 election====

In April 1973, Byrne resigned from the Superior court to run for governor.

Byrne defeated Ann Klein and Ralph DeRose in the 1973 Democratic primary to win the party&#x27;s nomination for governor. In the November general election, Byrne won by beating the Republican nominee Congressman Charles Sandman in a landslide. Sandman had defeated the incumbent Governor Cahill in the primary. Byrne&#x27;s landslide margin of victory was so vast that it allowed Democrats to capture control both chambers of the state legislature with supermajorities.

====First term====
On January 15, 1974, Byrne was sworn in as the 47th governor of New Jersey.

Some of the policies enacted by the first Byrne administration include: the implementation of New Jersey&#x27;s first state income tax, the establishment of spending limits on local governments, county governments, school districts, and the state, the establishment of both the Department of the Public Advocate and the Department of Energy, and the implementation of public financing for future gubernatorial general elections. Although Byrne claimed during the 1973 campaign that a personal income tax would not be necessary for &quot;the foreseeable future&quot;, he eventually &quot;muscled through&quot; the unpopular income tax, New Jersey&#x27;s first, in 1976; it earned him the nickname &quot;One-Term Byrne&quot;.

====1977 election====

Byrne faced ten opponents in the 1977 Democratic primary, including future governor James Florio. However, Byrne obtained the party&#x27;s nomination, and went on to defeat his Republican opponent, State Senator Raymond Bateman, in the general election on November 8, 1977. This despite the fact that in early 1977, three-quarters of voters disapproved of his job performance and in polls taken in the summer, he trailed Bateman by 17 points.

Byrne and Bateman debated nine times and Byrne used the governorship to his advantage, signing bills and appearing with cabinet members all over the state, benefiting from a visit by President Carter and turning what was his biggest weakness, the income tax, into a strength. Shortly before the 1977 gubernatorial election, New Jersey homeowners began receiving rebate checks (funded by state income tax revenues) to offset their property taxes, while Bateman&#x27;s plan—replacing the state income tax with an increased sales tax—was widely criticized.

Until 2021, Byrne was the last Democrat to win re-election as Governor in New Jersey.

====Second term====
During his second term, Byrne focused on policies such as: the passage of the Pinelands Protection Act, expansion of major highways, including the Atlantic City Expressway and Interstate 287, upgrades to sewage systems, further development of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and casino-hotel development in Atlantic City. He is one of only two Democrats, also including incumbent Phil Murphy, to be elected governor twice in the past fifty years. The other Governors elected to two terms (Thomas Kean, Christie Whitman, and Chris Christie) have all been Republicans.

===Cabinet and administration===
==Law practice and columnist==

After leaving office in 1982, Governor Byrne became a senior partner at Carella, Byrne, Bain, Gilfillan, Cecchi, Stewart &amp; Olstein in Roseland, New Jersey (now Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Brody and Agnello, P.C.). Additionally, Byrne and his successor as governor, Thomas Kean, co-wrote a weekly column in &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, containing their &quot;dialogue&quot; on state and national public affairs and politics. He has also taught courses at Princeton University and Rutgers University.

Despite not supporting all of his policies, Byrne said that Governor Chris Christie should run for president in 2016, calling Christie &quot;the best candidate that the Republicans have&quot; and complimented his &quot;charm&quot;.

==Personal life==
On June 27, 1953, he married Jean Featherly, with whom he had seven children. Byrne&#x27;s son, Tom Byrne, was the New Jersey Democratic State Committee chair in the 1990s and was a prospective candidate for the U.S. Senate race in 2000, before withdrawing in favor of eventual winner Jon Corzine, who later became governor. Brendan&#x27;s oldest granddaughter, Meaghan, who also saved Brendan&#x27;s life with the Heimlich at Nero&#x27;s Grille in April 2016, worked as a legislative staffer in the U.S. House of Representatives before moving into NGO foreign policy work.

Jean and Brendan Byrne divorced in 1993 after 40 years of marriage. She died in 2015 of babesiosis, aged 88.

Byrne married Ruth Zinn, who was also divorced, in 1994.

===2010 assault===
On February 16, 2010, while vacationing in London with his wife, Byrne was punched in the face by a mentally ill man near Waterloo tube station. The attacker was subsequently restrained by a London Underground station supervisor who came to Byrne&#x27;s aid until the police arrived. Byrne, who had taken part in a staged charity boxing match with Muhammad Ali in 1979, joked, &quot;At least I didn&#x27;t fall down at Waterloo, as when I fought Ali.&quot;

==Death==

Byrne died on January 4, 2018, in Livingston, New Jersey, of a lung infection at the age of 93.

His funeral was held on January 8 at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey. Archbishop Joseph W. Tobin, then-Governor Chris Christie and Governor-elect Phil Murphy, former Governors Thomas Kean, Donald DiFrancesco, Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Jon Corzine and U. S. Representative Bill Pascrell were in attendance. Byrne&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes were interred in Princeton Cemetery.

==Legacy==

From 1981 to 1996, the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford was named Brendan Byrne Arena. It hosted the New Jersey Devils, New Jersey Nets, and Seton Hall Pirates men&#x27;s basketball. The arena was then renamed Continental Airlines Arena, followed by IZOD Center.

The Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, formerly Lebanon State Forest, in New Lisbon is named for him.

In 2006, Rutgers University&#x27;s Center on the American Governor of the Eagleton Institute of Politics established the Brendan T. Byrne Archive, an online database containing various resources from the Byrne administration, including original documents and video interviews with Brendan Byrne and members of his administration.

In 2011, Byrne was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame along with Queen Latifah, John Travolta, and ten others.

In 2014, Byrne&#x27;s former chief counsel Donald Linky published a biography of Byrne, &quot;New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne: The Man Who Couldn&#x27;t Be Bought.&quot;

<text>Thomas Howard Kean ( ; born April 21, 1935) is an American politician, statesman, and academic administrator from the state of New Jersey. A Republican, Kean served two terms as the 48th governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990.

Kean is a member of the Kean political family. His father, Robert Kean, was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and his grandfather, Hamilton Fish Kean, was a U.S. senator. After graduating from Princeton University, Kean worked as a history teacher and obtained a master&#x27;s degree from Teachers College at Columbia University. He served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1968 to 1978 and held the role of speaker of the Assembly from 1972 to 1973. In 1981, Kean was elected governor of New Jersey; he was re-elected in 1985. A moderate Republican, Kean is regarded as a popular governor who promoted New Jersey tourism.

Following his two terms as governor, Kean served as president of Drew University from 1990 until 2005. After the September 11 attacks, Kean was appointed by President George W. Bush as chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, widely known as the 9/11 Commission. On July 22, 2004, Kean and the commission released their findings in the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;.

Kean is the father of U.S. Representative Thomas Kean Jr.

==Early life and education==
Kean was born in New York City to a long line of Dutch Americans and New Jersey politicians. His mother was Elizabeth Stuyvesant Howard and his father, Robert Kean, was a U.S. representative from 1939 until 1959. Kean&#x27;s grandfather Hamilton Fish Kean and great-uncle John Kean both served as U.S. senators from New Jersey. His second great-uncle was Hamilton Fish, a U.S. senator, governor of New York, and U.S. secretary of state. Kean is also descended from William Livingston, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, was the first governor of New Jersey, and is considered a founding father of New Jersey.

Kean first attended The Potomac School in McLean, Virginia. When he reached fourth grade, he entered St. Albans School, a college preparatory boarding school in Washington, D.C. In 1946, at the age of eleven, Kean was enrolled at St. Mark&#x27;s School, an Episcopalian private school in Southborough, Massachusetts that was the alma mater of his father and his two older brothers.

After graduating from St. Mark&#x27;s, Kean attended Princeton University. At Princeton, he completed a senior thesis on Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, a key architect of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s constitution, entitled &quot;Niemcewicz (The Biography of a Polish Patriot, 1756-1842, Including His Impressions of America, 1797-1807)&quot;. While at Princeton, Kean participated in the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, a political, literary, and debating society with a lengthy list of distinguished members. He graduated from Princeton with a B.A. in history in 1957. After working on his father&#x27;s unsuccessful U.S. senatorial campaign in 1958 and returning to St. Mark&#x27;s School as a history teacher for three years, Kean attended Teachers College at Columbia University in New York City, where he earned his M.A. in history.

==New Jersey General Assembly==


In 1967, running as a moderate Republican, Kean was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly. He ran with Philip D. Kaltenbacher, a Short Hills Republican who had served as an aide to Assemblyman Irwin I. Kimmelman from 1964 to 1966; Kimmelman later served as Attorney General in Kean&#x27;s administration as New Jersey governor. In the Republican primary, Kean and Kaltenbacher defeated Donald Fitz Maurice, Vivian Tompkins Lange, the sister of former U.S. Attorney William F. Tompkins, and Joseph Shanahan to win seats in the New Jersey Assembly.

At the start of the Assembly session in 1972, the New Jersey Assembly&#x27;s then Democratic leadership sought to name S. Howard Woodson of Trenton as Speaker until Assemblyman David Friedland made a deal as one of four Democrats who voted to give the minority Republicans control of the General Assembly, and Kean was elected as Assembly Speaker. Woodson would have been the Assembly&#x27;s first African American Speaker, and charges of racism were leveled against Friedland by fellow Democrats. In the following Assembly in 1974, Democrats united behind Woodson for Speaker, and Kean became the Assembly&#x27;s minority leader. In 1973, Kean served briefly as acting New Jersey governor. In 1974, Kean ran for Congress in New Jersey&#x27;s 5th congressional district but lost the Republican primary to Millicent Fenwick by 0.32%.

During the 1976 presidential campaign, Kean served as Gerald Ford&#x27;s campaign manager for the state of New Jersey.

==Governor of New Jersey==
===1977 election===

In 1977, Kean ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor of New Jersey. Although he spent most of his career as a political moderate, in this race Kean ran to the right of New Jersey Senate Minority Leader Raymond Bateman. Kean was unable to obtain the endorsement of many county Republican chairmen, or from then U.S. President Ford despite having served as Ford&#x27;s campaign director for the state of New Jersey the previous year. Bateman defeated Kean and won the nomination, though Bateman went on to lose the general election to Brendan Byrne.

After the election, Governor Byrne appointed Kean as a commissioner on the board of the New Jersey Highway Authority. Kean also worked as a political commentator on New Jersey public television.

===1981 election===

Four years later, in 1981, Kean again ran for governor. In his campaign, Kean pledged to foster job creation, clean up toxic waste sites, reduce crime, and preserve home rule. In his 1981 campaign, Kean secured the endorsement of former U.S. President Gerald Ford, who had not endorsed him in his 1977 gubernatorial campaign.

In the 1981 general election, Kean defeated Democratic Representative Jim Florio in the closest election in New Jersey gubernatorial election history, winning by 1,797 votes. The election was controversial due to the involvement of the Republican National Committee, who appointed a Ballot Security Task Force that was alleged to have intimidated voters. One of Kean&#x27;s strategists in his 1981 campaign was Roger Stone, a self-proclaimed &quot;GOP hitman.&quot;

===1985 re-election===

In striking contrast to his slim 1981 victory, Kean won re-election in 1985 with the largest margin of victory ever recorded in New Jersey gubernatorial history, defeating Peter Shapiro, then Essex County Executive, 70%–29%. Kean won every municipality in the state except Audubon Park and Chesilhurst in Camden County and Roosevelt in Monmouth County.

===Tenure (1982-1990)===

As governor, Kean served on the President&#x27;s Education Policy Advisory Committee and chaired the Education Commission of the States and the National Governors Association&#x27;s Task Force on Teaching.

Kean began receiving national recognition following the launch of a multi-million dollar promotional campaign for New Jersey tourism, in television commercials promoting New Jersey as a tourist destination, that aired nationally during throughout his eight years as governor. In the ads, in which Kean was sometimes joined by various celebrities with New Jersey roots, including Brooke Shields and Bill Cosby, he recited the state&#x27;s tourism motto: &quot;New Jersey and You: Perfect Together&quot;. In 1998, the campaign was revived by then New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, capping a long-term, multibillion-dollar effort to promote the state and especially its Jersey Shore beach resorts as attractive vacation destinations.

In 1988, Kean delivered the keynote speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans. Also in 1988, Kean authored a book entitled &quot;The Politics of Inclusion&quot;.

As governor, Kean played a central role in founding and funding the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, one of the nation&#x27;s largest performing arts centers, that received roughly $200 million in state funding. Kean believed that the cultural center had the power to revitalize Newark and strengthen the state as a whole. Kean remained involved in advocacy for the arts years after his time as governor, criticizing arts funding cuts in 2007.

Kean practiced bipartisanship and outreach beyond traditional political constituencies. He worked extensively with traditional Democratic constituencies, especially on urban policies. He also divested New Jersey&#x27;s public retirement funds from South Africa during apartheid, embraced the implementation of the statewide holiday in honor of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and supported legislation establishing New Jersey&#x27;s Educational Opportunity Fund.

In January 1990, Kean was succeeded as governor by James Florio. A governor of New Jersey may not serve more than two consecutive terms.

===Cabinet and administration===
===Gubernatorial legacy===

Kean left office in January 1990 as one of the most popular political figures in New Jersey political history. A number of leading New Jersey figures of the 1990s and 2000s began their political careers in Kean&#x27;s administration, including Douglas Forrester, Bob Franks, and Chris Daggett.

In the aftermath of Kean&#x27;s tenure as a two-term New Jersey governor, the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University–New Brunswick&#x27;s Center on the American Governor in New Brunswick, established the Thomas H. Kean Archive.

==President of Drew University==
In 1990, following the end of his second gubernatorial term, Kean was named President of Drew University, a liberal arts university in Madison, New Jersey. During Kean&#x27;s presidency, applications to Drew increased by more than 40 percent; the endowment nearly tripled; and more than $60 million was committed to construction of new buildings and renovation of older buildings. Kean would frequently eat lunch unannounced with students in the dining hall and was a regular spectator at Drew sporting events. Kean served as Drew&#x27;s president until 2005, and also taught a highly selective political science seminar at the university.

==National policy leadership==
In 1990, Kean for the first time began expressing views on foreign policy and national security matters that generally mirrored those of the Republican Party. In a December 15, 1991, speech to The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., Kean endorsed free trade initiatives then under way by the George H. W. Bush administration. Kean also advocated continued U.S. aid to anti-communist resistance forces in Afghanistan, Angola, and to those engaged in supporting democratic change in the former Soviet Union. &quot;To those supporting the Afghan resistance,&quot; Kean told the Heritage Foundation audience in 1991, &quot;I say, carry on.&quot;

Kean was appointed to the boards of several important foreign policy bodies, including the U.S. government-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED); a Presidential advisory commission on a post-Castro Cuba, which was chaired by former U.S. Presidential Republican candidate Steve Forbes; and President Bill Clinton&#x27;s One America Initiative. He also served as an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America. Kean served as co-chair of the National Security Preparedness Group (NSPG) at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

==Other work==
===Corporate board memberships===

Kean has served as chairman of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation&#x27;s largest health philanthropy; the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy; the Carnegie Corporation of New York; Educate America; the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation; MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership; and the Newark Alliance. He has also served as a board member for several publicly traded companies, including Aramark, UnitedHealth Group, Hess Corporation, The Pepsi Bottling Group, CIT Group, and Franklin Templeton Investments.

In 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the conduct of United Health Group&#x27;s management and directors, and the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light following publication of a series of probing articles in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in May 2006, which reported on the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars&#x27; worth of stock options by UnitedHealth Group&#x27;s management. The backdating allegedly occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, including Kean, who sat on the company&#x27;s compensation committee during three crucial years, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Major shareholders filed lawsuits, accusing Kean and the other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.

===Columnist===
From 1995 until 2018, Kean was a weekly columnist for &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, a Newark-based newspaper and the most widely circulated newspaper in the state. Co-authored with former New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne, Kean&#x27;s immediate predecessor as New Jersey governor, the column, titled &quot;Kean-Byrne Dialogue&quot;, addressed issues of the day and was published weekly by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;.

===Alpha Phi Omega and Quad Partners===
Kean is also an advisor to, and has been inducted into, Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity, and is a partner in Quad Partners, a private equity firm that invests in the education industry.

==Chair of 9/11 Commission==

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda, political pressure grew for an independent commission to independently investigate why the attacks were not prevented by U.S. national security organizations, including the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, National Security Agency, and others, and to provide recommendations for preventing future terrorist attacks. The commission is widely considered the most important independent U.S. government commission since the Warren Commission, which was charged with investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, and perhaps the most important U.S. government commission in American history given its mammoth responsibility for investigating the causes of the first foreign attack on the U.S. mainland since the War of 1812, which represented the largest terrorist attack in world history, and recommending steps to defend the U.S. from future attacks. Kean&#x27;s appointment to head the commission, and later the work and final report of the commission, drew substantial global attention.

===Appointment and criticism===

Bush initially selected Richard Nixon&#x27;s former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to head the 9/11 Commission. But Kissinger faced opposition due to his potential conflicts of interest with his global business consultancy, and withdrew from consideration for the position on December 13, 2002. Noting Kean&#x27;s post-gubernatorial foreign policy involvement and his reputation as a consensus-oriented political leader, Bush nominated Kean as Kissinger&#x27;s replacement in leading the important and politically sensitive commission.

Just as some had criticized Kissinger&#x27;s nomination, Kean&#x27;s leadership of the commission also drew some criticism. Some alleged that Kean did not have the depth of foreign policy and national security expertise needed to manage an investigation so integral to the future of American national security. Supporters of Kean in the Bush administration and elsewhere, however, countered that Kean&#x27;s work since 1990 as a board member of the National Endowment for Democracy, the post-Castro Cuba Commission, and his foreign policy and national security commentary and analysis following his governorship established adequate national security and foreign policy credentials for him to assume such a critically important assignment.

===Chairmanship and final report===

In December 2003, as the 9/11 Commission neared completion of its investigation, Kean said that the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying, &quot;As you read the report, you&#x27;re going to have a pretty clear idea what wasn&#x27;t done and what should have been done. This was not something that had to happen.&quot; On April 4, 2004, in an interview with &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Kean again stated that the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying that the federal government should have acted sooner to dismantle al-Qaeda and responded more quickly to the terrorist threat it represented. &quot;When we actually saw bin Laden on the ground, using the Predator or other means, did we have...actionable intelligence? Should we have sent a cruise missile into a site where he was at that point? I think those early opportunities are clear. We had him. We saw him. I think maybe we could have done something about it.&quot;

On July 22, 2004, the Commission issued its final report, the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, a 585-page report that concluded concluded that the CIA and the FBI ill-served President Bush and the American people in failing to predict or prevent the September 11 attacks, which the report concluded were preventable.

===Later work relating to 9/11 attacks===
On August 15, 2006, Kean and Commission Vice Chair Lee H. Hamilton released a book, &quot;Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission&quot;, published by Alfred A. Knopf. In the book, Kean and Hamilton write that the 9/11 Commission was so frustrated with repeated misstatements by The Pentagon and Federal Aviation Administration that it considered an investigation into possible deception by these government bodies concerning their response to the attacks.

Kean served as a paid consultant and spokesman for the ABC miniseries &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, which aired nationally in primetime in two segments, on September 10 and 11, 2006. The second part of the miniseries also aired without commercial interruption with the exception of a 20-minute break at 9 pm ET, when President Bush addressed the nation on the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. While not technically considered a documentary by ABC, the series drew criticism prior to its airing for misrepresenting facts leading up the September 11 attacks. Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, many former high-ranking Clinton administration officials, and other scholars, publicly questioned the accuracy of the miniseries and asked that it not be aired. Albright called the miniseries&#x27; portrayal of her &quot;false and defamatory.&quot; Former U.S. ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine also strongly criticized her own portrayal, complaining in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about the &quot;mythmakers&quot; who created it and calling the project &quot;false.&quot;

On July 4, 2007, al-Qaeda publicly released a video of Ayman al-Zawahri, its deputy chief, urging all Muslims to unite in a holy war against the United States in Iraq and elsewhere. The 95-minute video also prominently featured video excerpts of Kean citing al-Qaeda as one of the most formidable security threats that the U.S. had ever confronted, presumably cited with the intention of bolstering the morale of al-Qaeda supporters. Comments by Kean cited on the video include a reference to the fact that al-Qaeda remained as strong in 2007 as it was before the September 11, 2001, attacks. The video also appeared to validate that al-Qaeda was closely monitoring U.S. political developments, especially including the work of the commission. It also suggested that al-Qaeda intended to focus not just on engaging the West in Iraq, but also in other countries. &quot;As for the second half of the long-term plan,&quot; al-Zawahri says on the video, &quot;it consists of hurrying to the fields of Jihad like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia for Jihadi preparation and training&quot;.

The commission reassembled in Washington, D.C., on July 22, 2014, for the tenth anniversary of the issuance of its report. It assessed how well the government was performing given in addressing terrorist threats and to meeting the commission&#x27;s recommendations for preventing a future attack.

==Awards and recognition==

Kean holds over 30 honorary degrees and numerous awards from environmental and educational organizations, including:
* The Four Freedoms Award
* NAACP&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot; award

In 2009, New York Waterways named the ferry &quot;Governor Thomas Kean&quot; in Kean&#x27;s honor. On January 15, 2009, the ferry saved two dozen individuals when US Airways Flight 1549 made an emergency landing on the Hudson River.

In 2013, Kean was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Kean met his future wife, Deborah Bye, at a party in Manhattan. They began dating in October 1966. Bye and Kean married at the Old Drawyers Church in Odessa, Delaware on June 3, 1967. The couple had three children: daughter, Alexandra, and twin sons, Tom Jr. and Reed.

Kean moved to Livingston, New Jersey in 1967 during his first campaign for office. As of 2015, Kean lived in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Deborah Kean died on April 24, 2020 at the age of 76. The Keans had been married for 53 years.

<text>James Joseph Florio (August 29, 1937 – September 25, 2022) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 49th governor of New Jersey from 1990 to 1994. He was previously the U.S. representative for New Jersey&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1975 to 1990 and served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1970 to 1975. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life and education==
Florio was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 29, 1937. Florio was one of three children (all sons) born to Lillian Ellen (née Hazell) Florio (June 18, 1917 – May 2, 2000) and Vincenzo [later Vincent Joseph] Florio (May 12, 1914 – April 7, 1994), who wed in 1936. Florio and his brothers were raised in Brooklyn. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Scottish, Irish, and German descent. Florio&#x27;s father was a shipyard painter who also used his poker winnings to help support his family. Florio attended Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush. He dropped out of high school following his junior year, joined the U.S. Navy, became a weatherman, and earned a high school equivalency degree.

Florio received a Bachelor of Arts in social studies from Trenton State College in 1962 and started graduate studies in public law and government at Columbia University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship before earning a Juris Doctor from Rutgers School of Law–Camden in 1967.

==Career==
After graduating from law school, Florio volunteered to work for the Democratic Party and was mentored by past Camden Mayor Angelo Errichetti. Florio was an amateur boxer. He served as an enlisted member of the United States Navy from 1955 to 1958 and continued to serve in the United States Naval Reserve as a commissioned officer until 1975, ultimately achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. After being admitted to the bar, he became the assistant city attorney for the City of Camden, a position he would hold until 1971. He was the borough solicitor for the New Jersey towns of Runnemede, Woodlynne, and Somerdale from 1969 to 1974.

===New Jersey General Assembly===
In both 1969 and 1971, Florio was elected to represent the 3rd Legislative District in the New Jersey General Assembly, covering portions of Camden County, each time with Democratic running mate John J. Horn, whom Florio had served as a legislative aide while he was still in law school. He was elected in 1973, together with Ernest F. Schuck, to represent the 5th Legislative District in the General Assembly, which covered portions of Camden County and Gloucester County. In 1975, Florio resigned after being elected to the U.S House of Representatives.

===U.S. Representative===

In November 1974, Florio was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey&#x27;s 1st congressional district, defeating incumbent John E. Hunt. He served in the House from January 3, 1975, until January 16, 1990, when he resigned to serve as governor of New Jersey.

In Congress, Florio authored the Superfund legislation to clean up the most polluted sites in the country in 1980. He was the author of the Railroad Deregulation Law which saved the nation&#x27;s freight railroads, including Conrail. He was also cosponsor of the Exon-Florio Amendment, which created the Treasury Department&#x27;s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and effectively removed Congress from the approval process on foreign takeovers of U.S. industrial concerns. This legislation was a factor in the Dubai Ports World controversy in 2006.

===Unsuccessful gubernatorial candidacies===

While in Congress, Florio ran for Governor of New Jersey in 1977, 1981, and 1989. Florio was defeated by incumbent Democrat Brendan Byrne in 1977. In 1981, he won the Democratic nomination, but then lost a controversial general election to Thomas Kean. The involvement of the Republican National Committee in the 1981 general election received significant subsequent attention, with the RNC accused of having created a Ballot Security Task Force made up of off-duty police officers to engage in voter suppression. The 1981 gubernatorial general election was the closest in New Jersey history, and the outcome of the election was not decided with certainty until several weeks after Election Day.

===Governorship===

In the 1989 New Jersey gubernatorial election, Florio won both the nomination and the general election. During his campaign, Florio said: &quot;You can write this statement down: &#x27;Florio feels there is no need for new taxes&#x27;&quot;. Florio defeated Republican Jim Courter with 61% of the vote, becoming the first American of Italian descent to become Governor of New Jersey.

Florio took office during the late 1980s recession and thus faced a budget deficit. Also, Florio wished to increase education aid to New Jersey&#x27;s low-wealth school districts. Faced with a projected 1991 deficit of $3 billion, Florio asked for a $2.8 billion tax increase, most in the way of a sales tax increase and an increase in the state excise taxes on various goods. Florio signed the tax package into law in June 1990. It was the largest state tax increase in the history of the United States. The money generated balanced the budget, increased property tax relief programs, and increased education spending in the &quot;Abbott&quot; districts. Florio also eliminated 1,500 government jobs and cut perks for state officials.

Florio redistributed hundreds of millions of dollars of school aid away from suburban districts to urban districts (see the &quot;Abbott&quot; case) and rural districts. Under Florio&#x27;s plan, known as the Quality Education Act, 151 suburban districts would lose almost all of their education funding and have to assume pension costs, Social Security payments, and retiree health costs; another 71 districts would have large reductions in aid and have to assume smaller portions of retiree benefits; and about 350 districts would see increases in aid. The aid cuts fell the most heavily in North Jersey.

A grassroots taxpayer revolt sprouted in 1990, spearheaded by a citizens&#x27; group named &quot;Hands Across New Jersey&quot; founded by John Budzash, a postal worker from Howell Township. Budzash was a frequent guest on radio and television shows throughout New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania speaking out against the new taxes. Florio was a regular topic on active anti-tax broadcasting from talk radio stations New Jersey 101.5 to Curtis Sliwa&#x27;s AM radio talk show and Bob Grant&#x27;s AM radio talk show, both based in New York City. Sliwa, Grant, and John and Ken from New Jersey 101.5, along with Alan Keyes (who in later years was a presidential candidate in the Republican primary), were guest speakers at two rallies held by Hands Across New Jersey protesting both George H. W. Bush and Florio&#x27;s tax increases. Bumper stickers with &quot;Impeach Florio&quot; were seen around the state.

Prior to the 1991 New Jersey elections, Democrats held majorities in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey State Senate. But voter anger was so great that after the 1991 election, Republicans were to win veto-proof majorities in both houses. An example of Republican strength at this time was their promise to roll back the sales tax, which was raised by one percentage point during the first two years of the Florio administration. The rollback was passed in both houses, only to be vetoed by Florio. Republicans then overrode Florio&#x27;s veto and the rollback was passed.

In order to pay for the increased aid in rural and urban districts and maintain suburban school aid, Florio and the legislature passed the &quot;Pension Reevaluation Act&quot;. The Pension Reevaluation Act changed the actuarial calculations used to calculate the State&#x27;s pension contributions; instead of using the book value of pension assets (a conservative approach), the state would use a market-related value. The Act also increased the assumed rate of return for investments from 7 percent to 8.75 percent. The Pension Reevaluation Act reduced New Jersey&#x27;s pension contributions by $1.5 billion in 1992.

Florio also signed a 20% reduction of auto insurance premiums. In May 1990, Florio enacted the stiffest laws in the U.S. on owning or selling semi-automatic firearms; in 1993, he vetoed a repeal bill passed by the Republican-led legislature. The National Rifle Association lobbied hard to override the governor&#x27;s veto, and the Assembly voted to override it. However, the Senate voted unanimously to uphold Florio&#x27;s veto. According to &quot;Time&quot;, New Jerseyans had swamped lawmakers&#x27; offices with calls supporting the ban after Florio stumped the state, appealing to voters to voice their feelings&quot; about semi-automatic firearms.

====1993 election====

In 1991, the Democrats lost their majority in both chambers of the state legislature, for the first time in 20 years (Republicans controlled the state assembly after the 1985 and 1987 elections). The governor&#x27;s approval ratings were as low as 18% but stabilized to roughly 50% by 1993. He made an effort for conservative support by putting in place tighter restrictions on welfare payments to mothers and enjoyed the strong support of President Bill Clinton. Clinton advisers James Carville and Paul Begala worked on his campaign. Due in large part to the tax hikes, Florio lost his bid for re-election to Republican Somerset County freeholder Christine Todd Whitman and became the first Democratic governor since the adoption of the state&#x27;s current constitution in 1947 to lose a re-election vote. (Republican William T. Cahill, elected in 1969, became the first governor to lose reelection when he was defeated in the Republican primary in 1973.) Whitman prevailed by a narrow margin of 26,093 votes out of 2,505,964 votes cast. As of 2022, Florio was the last politician from South Jersey to win statewide office.

=== Cabinet and administration ===
===Post-governorship===

In 2000, Florio ran for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat that was being vacated by Frank Lautenberg. His opponent was businessman Jon Corzine, former chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. In the most expensive Senate primary in history, Corzine won with 246,472 votes, or 58%, while Florio had 179,059 votes, or 42%.

Florio served as the chairman of the New Jersey Pinelands Commission from November 2002 to June 2005. As a congressman in the late 1970s, he was instrumental in shaping the legislation that established the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve. He was a critic of the George W. Bush administration and the Iraq War. In a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he made a connection between the war and Bush&#x27;s energy policy saying, &quot;the nation&#x27;s right to know has never been more important&quot;.
Florio supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries for president.

Florio served on the board of directors of Trump Entertainment Resorts until he and other board members were forced to resign following the company&#x27;s entry into its third bankruptcy. He also served on the board of Plymouth Financial Company, Inc. He was a founding partner and of counsel to the law firm of Florio, Perrucci, Steinhardt, Cappelli, Tipton &amp; Taylor.

Florio taught at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.

==Personal life==
Florio was married twice. His first marriage to Maryanne Spaeth ended in divorce. In 1984, Florio met his second wife, Lucinda Coleman, a school teacher, while both were living in the same apartment complex in Pine Hill, New Jersey. Jim and Lucinda Florio married on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1988, and remained together until his death in September 2022. Jim Florio had three children from his first marriage - Chris, Gregory, and Catherine - while Lucinda Florio also had one son from her first marriage, Mark Rowe.

==Death==
Florio died on September 25, 2022, from heart failure at a hospital in Voorhees, New Jersey, at age 85. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. His wife, former New Jersey First Lady Lucinda Florio, died on November 16, 2022, just 52 days later.

== Honors ==
In 1993, Florio was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, for his support for gun control. In 2014, he was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders named the Governor James J. Florio Center for Public Service, a primary county administrative building, in Florio&#x27;s honor in 2017.

<text>John Charles Harsanyi (; May 29, 1920 – August 9, 2000) was a Hungarian-American economist who spent most of his career at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994.

Harsanyi is best known for his contributions to the study of game theory and its application to economics, specifically for his developing the highly innovative analysis of games of incomplete information, so-called Bayesian games. He also made important contributions to the use of game theory and economic reasoning in political and moral philosophy (specifically utilitarian ethics) as well as contributing to the study of equilibrium selection. For his work, he was a co-recipient along with John Nash and Reinhard Selten of the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. 

He moved to the United States in 1956, and spent most of his life there. According to György Marx, he was one of The Martians.

==Early life==
Harsanyi was born on May 29, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Alice Harsányi (née Gombos) and Károly Harsányi, a pharmacy owner. His parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism a year before he was born. He attended high school at the Lutheran Gymnasium in Budapest. In high school, he became one of the best problem solvers of the KöMaL, the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools. Founded in 1893, this periodical is generally credited with a large share of Hungarian students&#x27; success in mathematics. He also won the first prize in the Eötvös mathematics competition for high school students.

Although he wanted to study mathematics and philosophy, his father sent him to France in 1939 to enroll in chemical engineering at the University of Lyon. However, because of the start of World War II, Harsanyi returned to Hungary to study pharmacology at the University of Budapest (today: Eötvös Loránd University), earning a diploma in 1944. As a pharmacology student, Harsanyi escaped conscription into the Royal Hungarian Army which, as a person of Jewish descent, would have meant forced labor.

However, in 1944 (after the fall of the Horthy regime and the seizure of power by the Arrow Cross Party) his military deferment was cancelled and he was compelled to join a forced labor unit on the Eastern Front. After seven months of forced labor, when the German authorities decided to deport his unit to a concentration camp in Austria, John Harsanyi managed to escape and found sanctuary for the rest of the war in a Jesuit house.

==Postwar==
After the end of the war, Harsanyi returned to the University of Budapest for graduate studies in philosophy and sociology, earning his PhD in both subjects in 1947. Then a devout Catholic, he simultaneously studied theology, also joining lay ranks of the Dominican Order. He later abandoned Catholicism, becoming an atheist for the rest of his life. Harsanyi spent the academic year 1947–1948 on the faculty of the Institute of Sociology of the University of Budapest, where he met Anne Klauber, his future wife. He was forced to resign the faculty because of openly expressing his anti-Marxist opinions, while Anne faced increasing peer pressure to leave him for the same reason.

Harsanyi remained in Hungary for the following two years attempting to sell his family&#x27;s pharmacy without losing it to the authorities. After it became apparent that the communist party would confiscate the pharmacy in 1950, he fled with Anne and her parents by illegally crossing the border into Austria and then going to Australia where Klauber&#x27;s parents had some friends.

==Australia==
The two did not marry until they arrived in Australia because Klauber&#x27;s immigration papers would need to be changed to reflect her married name. The two arrived with her parents on December 30, 1950, and they looked to marry immediately. Harsanyi and Klauber were married on January 2, 1951. Neither spoke much English and understood little of what they were told to say to each other. Harsanyi later explained to his new wife that she had promised to cook better food than she usually did.

Harsanyi&#x27;s Hungarian degrees were not recognized in Australia, but they earned him credit at the University of Sydney for a master&#x27;s degree. Harsanyi worked in a factory during the day and studied economics in the evening at the University of Sydney, finishing with a M.A. in 1953. While studying in Sydney, he started publishing research papers in economic journals, including the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; and the &quot;Review of Economic Studies&quot;. The degree allowed him to take a teaching position in 1954 at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. While in Brisbane, Harsanyi&#x27;s wife became a fashion designer for a small factory.

==Later years==
In 1956, Harsanyi received a Rockefeller scholarship that enabled him and Anne to spend the next two years in the United States, at Stanford University and, for a semester, at the Cowles Foundation. At Stanford Harsanyi wrote a dissertation in game theory under the supervision of Kenneth Arrow, earning a second PhD in economics in 1959, while Anne earned an MA in psychology. Harsanyi&#x27;s student visa expired in 1958 and the two returned to Australia.

After working for a short time as a researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, Harsanyi became frustrated with the lack of interest in game theory in Australia. With the help of Kenneth Arrow and James Tobin, he was able to move to the United States, taking a position as professor of economics at the Wayne State University in Detroit between 1961 and 1963. In 1964, he moved to Berkeley, California; he remained at the University of California, Berkeley, until retiring in 1990. Shortly after arriving in Berkeley, he and Anne had a child, Tom.

While teaching at Berkeley, Harsanyi did extensive research in game theory. Harold Kuhn, who had been John von Neumann&#x27;s student in Princeton and already had games theory publications encouraged him in this. The work for which he won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics was a series of articles published in 1967 and 1968 which established what has become the standard framework for analyzing &quot;games of incomplete information&quot;, situations in which the various strategic decisionmakers have different information about the parameters of the game. He resolved the problem of how players could make decisions while not knowing what each other knows by modelling the situation with initial moves by Nature using known probabilities to choose the parameters, with some players observing Nature&#x27;s move but other players just knowing the probabilities and the fact that some players have observed the actual realized values. This relies on assuming that all players know the structure of the game, which means they all have &quot;common priors&quot;, knowing the probabilities Nature uses in selecting parameters values, an assumption known as the Harsanyi Doctrine.

From 1966 to 1968, Harsanyi was part of a team of game theorists tasked with advising the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in collaboration with Mathematica, a consulting group from Princeton University led by Harold Kuhn and Oskar Morgenstern.

John Harsanyi died on August 9, 2000, from a heart attack in Berkeley, California, after developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Publications==
Harsanyi began researching utilitarian ethics in the mid-fifties at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. This led to two publications explaining why, before understanding moral problems, the difference between people&#x27;s personal and moral preferences must be distinguished. As he says at the beginning of his essay included in the book edited by A. Sen and B. Williams (see below), he tries to reconcile three traditions of Western moral thinking, those of Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and the utilitarians (Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick and Edgeworth). He is considered one of the most important exponents of the &quot;rule utilitarianism&quot;.

After moving to the US on a Rockefeller Fellowship where he was supervised by Kenneth Arrow, Harsanyi was influenced by Nash&#x27;s publications on game theory and became increasingly interested in the topic.

<doc id="442293" wikidata="Q889620" url="?curid=442293" title="Donald DiFrancesco">
<text>Donald Thomas DiFrancesco (born November 20, 1944) is a retired American politician who served as the 51st governor of New Jersey from 2001 to 2002. He succeeded Christine Todd Whitman after her resignation to become Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. A member of the Republican Party, DiFrancesco previously was President of the New Jersey Senate from 1992 to 2002.

==Education and early career==
Born in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, DiFrancesco attended Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, where he was senior class president. He graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree from Penn State University in business, and was awarded a J.D. degree from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1969. He served as Scotch Plains Municipal Attorney.

==New Jersey Legislature==
DiFrancesco was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1975. He won a contested Republican primary, defeating former Assemblyman Arthur Manner by 1,067 votes. He defeated incumbent Democratic Assemblywoman Betty Wilson (New Jersey politician) by 2,387 votes. He was re-elected in 1977 by a margin of 4,709 votes.

DiFrancsco won a 1979 special election for State Senator when the Republican incumbent, Peter J. McDonough resigned. He defeated his running mate, Assemblyman William J. Maguire at the Union County Republican Convention; in general election, he defeated Springfield Mayor Joanne Rajoppi by 6,917 votes. He was re-elected in 1981, 1983, 1987, 1991, 1993 and 1997.

DiFrancesco ran for Senate Minority Leader after the 1981 elections, eschewing the traditional rotation of leadership posts. He defeated James P. Vreeland (R-Towaco), who had served as Assistant Minority Leader during the previous session. DiFrancesco&#x27;s attempt to win GOP control of the upper house in 1983 was unsuccessful. After serving nearly three years as Senate Minority Leader, S. Thomas Gagliano succeeded DiFrancesco as Leader on January 8, 1985. After Republicans won a majority of seats in the 1991 election, DiFrancesco used a similar strategy and beat the sitting Minority Leader, John H. Dorsey, to win the Senate presidency.

==Governor==
DiFrancesco, a state senator representing the Scotch Plains area, became acting governor when fellow Republican Christine Todd Whitman resigned from office to join the administration of newly elected President George W. Bush.

At the time of Whitman&#x27;s resignation, the New Jersey Constitution stipulated that the Senate president retains that position while also serving as acting governor. This made DiFrancesco, in his own words, the most powerful New Jersey governor ever (and perhaps the most powerful governor ever) because he was the leader of both the State Senate and executive branch simultaneously. This distinction was shared by later acting governors Robert E. Littell, John O. Bennett and Richard Codey.

DiFrancesco&#x27;s title was officially Acting Governor until it was changed retroactively by legislation passed on January 10, 2006, which classified anyone who, after January 1, 2001, acted as governor for longer than 180 days as a full governor.

==2001 election==

DiFrancesco initially planned to run for a full term as governor in the 2001 election. Democratic Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey and Republican Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler also sought the governorship. Polls showed DiFrancesco with a commanding lead over the more conservative Schundler in the primary, but trailing McGreevey (although performing better against him than Schundler) with a large number of undecided voters. DiFrancesco abruptly withdrew from the race in April 2001 after a number of unfavorable news stories emerged concerning his past legal and business dealings. A report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the media criticism took a heavy toll on DiFrancesco, who had never before been subjected to the intense scrutiny of a statewide campaign, and his family, ultimately prompting his withdrawal. Under New Jersey law, a candidate can designate a replacement to appear on the ballot in the event of his/her withdrawal. DiFrancesco designated former Representative Bob Franks, who had only narrowly lost to Jon Corzine in a 2000 Senate race despite being massively outspent by Corzine in a year in which Democrats gained four seats in the Senate. However, despite receiving widespread support from the New Jersey Republican establishment, Franks was soundly defeated by Schundler in the Republican primary, who went on to lose to McGreevey in the general election by a wide margin.

===Approval ratings===
An August 7, 2001, Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed Donald DiFrancesco&#x27;s approval ratings at 54%, but what was remarkable about that poll is that it showed he had a 48% approval rating among Democrats. 

==Controversies==
The time DiFrancesco spent before, as acting Governor and since has been plagued with many controversies that were reported in various news publications.
The New York Times reported that he was faulted on ethics in 1998 when he was township attorney for Scotch Plains.

The New York Times also reported that in 1996, a prominent builder in New Jersey aided DiFrancesco by providing him with $225,000, to pay off an outstanding legal judgment.

In 2001, while serving as Acting Governor, DiFrancesco&#x27;s nominee for New Jersey Treasurer withdrew from consideration after reports emerged that she was fired from Citibank after being confronted with evidence that she had used her expense account to pay for thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of personal trips while having an extramarital affair with a co-worker in California.

DiFrancesco was sued for sexual harassment by an employee of his law firm in 2007. The lawsuit was settled in 2008.

In 2011, DiFrancesco settled with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, a fine of $5800 for $4650 after returning the excess amounts of two illegal campaign contributions.

In 2017, DiFrancesco resigned from his position as Chair of University Hospital in Newark after it was revealed that he had hired a friend for an no-show job.

==Current activities==
DiFrancesco presently serves on the Commerce Bancorp board of directors and is a partner in a law firm. He resides with his wife and children in Warren Township, New Jersey.

In August 2011, there was a feud between New Jersey Governor Christie and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg over whether DiFrancesco would be invited to the tenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks ceremony in Lower Manhattan, since DiFrancesco was governor during the attacks.

<text>In American science fiction of the 1950s and &#x27;60s, psionics was a proposed discipline that applied principles of engineering (especially electronics) to the study (and employment) of paranormal or psychic phenomena, such as extrasensory perception, telepathy and psychokinesis. The term is a blend word of &quot;psi&quot; (in the sense of &quot;psychic phenomena&quot;) and the -&quot;&quot; from &quot;electronics&quot;. The word &quot;psionics&quot; began as, and always remained, a term of art within the science fiction community and—despite the promotional efforts of editor John W. Campbell, Jr.—it never achieved general currency, even among academic parapsychologists. In the years after the term was coined in 1951, it became increasingly evident that no scientific evidence supports the existence of &quot;psionic&quot; abilities.

==Etymology==
In 1942, two authors—biologist Bertold Wiesner and psychologist Robert Thouless—had introduced the term &quot;psi&quot; (from ψ &quot;psi,&quot; 23rd letter of the Greek alphabet) to parapsychology in an article published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;. (This Greek character was chosen as apropos since it is the initial letter of the Greek word ψυχή [&quot;psyche&quot;]—meaning &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;.) The intent was that &quot;psi&quot; would represent the &quot;unknown factor&quot; in extrasensory perception and psychokinesis, experiences believed to be unexplained by any known physical or biological mechanisms. In a 1972 book, Thouless insisted that he and Wiesner had coined this usage of the term &quot;psi&quot; prior to its use in science fiction circles, explaining that their intent was to provide a more neutral term than &quot;ESP&quot; that would not suggest a pre-existing theory of mechanism.

The word &quot;psionics&quot; first appeared in print in a novella by science fiction writer Jack Williamson—&quot;The Greatest Invention&quot;—published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine in 1951. Williamson derived it from the &quot;psion&quot;, a fictitious &quot;unit of mental energy&quot; described in the same story. (Only later was the term retroactively described in non-fiction articles in &quot;Astounding&quot; as a portmanteau of &quot;psychic electronics&quot;, by editor John W. Campbell.) The new word was derived by analogy with the earlier term radionics. (“Radionics” combined &quot;radio&quot; with &quot;electronics&quot; and was itself devised in the 1940s to refer to the work of early 20th century physician and pseudoscientist Albert Abrams.) The same analogy was subsequently taken up in a number of science fiction-themed neologisms, notably bionics (&quot;bio-&quot; + &quot;electronics&quot;; coined 1960) and cryonics (&quot;cryo-&quot; + &quot;electronics&quot;; coined 1967).

==History==
===Background===
In the 1930s, three men were crucial to inciting John W. Campbell&#x27;s early enthusiasm for a &quot;new science of the mind&quot; construed as &quot;engineering [principles] applied to the mind&quot;. The first was mathematician and philosopher Norbert Wiener—known as the &quot;father of cybernetics&quot;—who had befriended Campbell when he was an undergraduate (1928–31) at MIT. The second was parapsychologist Joseph Banks Rhine whose parapsychology laboratory at Duke University was already famous for its investigations of &quot;ESP&quot; when Campbell was an undergraduate there (1932–34). The third was a non-academic: Charles Fort, the author and paranormal popularizer whose 1932 book &quot;Wild Talents&quot; strongly encouraged credence in the testimony of people who had experienced telepathy and other &quot;anomalous phenomena&quot;.

The idea that ordinary people only utilize a small fraction of the (potentially enormous) capabilities of the human brain had become a particular &quot;pet idea&quot; for Campbell by the time he first published his own science fiction writings as a college student. In a 1932 short story he asserted that &quot;no man in all history ever used even half of the thinking part of his brain&quot;. He followed up on this notion in a note to another story published five years later:

The total capacity of the mind, even at present, is to all intents and purposes, infinite. Could the full equipment be hooked into a functioning unit, the resulting intelligence should be able to conquer a world without much difficulty.

In 1939, he wrote in an editorial in the magazine &quot;Unknown&quot;, which he edited:

Is it so strange a thing that this unknown mass [the human brain] should have some unguessed power by which to feel and see beyond, directly, meeting mind to mind in telepathy, sensing direct the truth of things by clairvoyance?

Along with Charles Fort, Campbell believed that there were already many individuals with latent &quot;psi powers&quot; among us unwittingly and he took this belief a step further in considering development of such powers to be the &quot;next step&quot; in human evolution. Throughout his career, Campbell had sought grounds for a new &quot;scientific psychology&quot; and he was instrumental in formulating the brainchild of one of his more imaginative science fiction writers—the &quot;Dianetics&quot; of L. Ron Hubbard. Campbell&#x27;s enthusiasm for Dianetics—which later morphed into the Church of Scientology—was red hot in 1949 and 1950, but had considerably cooled by 1951 when he saw Hubbard for the last time.

===The &quot;psi-boom&quot;===
With Campbell&#x27;s encouragement, or at his direction, &quot;psionic&quot; abilities began to appear frequently in magazine science fiction stories in the mid-1950s, providing characters with supernormal or supernatural abilities. The first example was Murray Leinster&#x27;s novella &quot;The Psionic Mousetrap&quot; published in early 1955. Examples of psychic abilities in fiction, whether attributed to supernatural agencies or otherwise, predated the &quot;psionics&quot; vogue. But the editors of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; describe and define a post-war &quot;psi-boom&quot; in genre science fiction—&quot;which he [Campbell] engineered&quot;—dating it from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s. They cite James Blish&#x27;s &quot;Jack of Eagles&quot; (1952), Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;More Than Human&quot; (1953), Wilson Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Wild Talent&quot; (1954) and Frank M. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Power&quot; (1956) as examples. Alfred Bester&#x27;s &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; (1953) is a pioneering example of a work depicting a society in which people with &quot;psi&quot; abilities are fully integrated. Since the &quot;psi-boom&quot; years coincided with the darkest and most paranoid period of the Cold War, it is natural that many examples of the utility of telepathy in espionage (for example those of Randall Garrett) would be produced. In terms of literary continuity, the editors of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; point out that:

All the psi powers, of course, used to be in the repertoire of powerful magicians, and most are featured in occult romances.

In 1956, Campbell began promoting a psionics device known as the Hieronymus machine. It faced skepticism from scientists who viewed it as pseudoscientific and even as an example of quackery.

Some of the wind was taken out of the sails of psionics in 1957 when Martin Gardner, in the updated edition of his book &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;, wrote that the study of psionics is &quot;even funnier than Dianetics or Ray Palmer&#x27;s Shaver stories&quot;, and criticized the beliefs and assertions of Campbell as anti-scientific nonsense.

<doc id="442296" wikidata="Q5326364" url="?curid=442296" title="Earl of Rothes">
<text>Earl of Rothes (pronounced &quot;&quot;Roth&quot;-es&quot;) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1458 for George Leslie, 1st Lord Leslie. He had already been created Lord Leslie in 1445, also in the Peerage of Scotland. His grandson, the third Earl, having only succeeded his elder brother in March 1513, was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September of the same year. His son, the fourth Earl, served as an Extraordinary Lord of Session. Lord Rothes was also tried for the murder of Cardinal Beaton but was acquitted.

His great-great-grandson, the seventh Earl, was a prominent statesman. He was notably Lord High Treasurer of Scotland from 1663 to 1667 and Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1667 to 1681. In 1663 he obtained a new charter conferring the earldom of Rothes and lordship of Leslie (which was regranted as &quot;Lord Leslie and Ballenbreich&quot;), in default of male issue of his own, on his eldest daughter Margaret, wife of Charles Hamilton, 5th Earl of Haddington, and her descendants male and female. It was stipulated in the charter that the earldoms of Rothes and Haddington should never be allowed to merge. In 1680 Lord Rothes was further honoured when he was made Duke of Rothes, Marquess of Bambreich, Earl of Leslie, Viscount of Lugtoun and Lord Auchmotie and Caskieberry, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Scotland.

The Duke had no sons and on his death in 1681 the creations of 1680 became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Rothes and the lordship of Leslie and Ballinbreich according to the charter of 1663 by his daughter Margaret, the eighth holder. Her husband Lord Haddington was succeeded by their second son Thomas (see the Earl of Haddington for more information on this title) while Margaret was succeeded by their eldest son John, the ninth Earl. He assumed the additional surname of Leslie and sat in the British House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer between 1708 and 1710. His son, the tenth Earl, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and notably served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland. From 1723 to 1734 and from 1747 to 1767 he was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords.

His son, the eleventh Earl, died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his eldest sister Jane Elizabeth, the twelfth holder of the titles, despite the rival claim of her uncle Andrew. She was the wife firstly of George Raymond Evelyn, and secondly of Sir Lucas Pepys. Her son by her first husband, the thirteenth Earl, served as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1812 to 1817. Lord Rothes assumed the surname of Leslie in lieu of Evelyn. He was succeeded by his daughter Henrietta Anne, the fourteenth holder. She was the wife of George Gwyther who along with his wife assumed the surname of Leslie. Their grandson, the sixteenth Earl (who succeeded his father) died unmarried at a young age and was succeeded by his sister Henrietta, the seventeenth holder. She was the wife of the Hon. George Waldegrave, younger son of William Waldegrave, 8th Earl Waldegrave.

They had no children and Henrietta was succeeded by her aunt Mary Elizabeth, the eighteenth holder. She was the second daughter of Henrietta Anne, the fourteenth holder, and the wife of Captain Martin Edward Haworth, who in 1886 assumed for himself and his family by Royal licence the additional surname of Leslie. Their grandson, the nineteenth Earl, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1906 and 1923. The wife of the 19th Earl, Lucy Noël Martha Leslie, Countess of Rothes, is best known as a survivor of the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912. His son, the twentieth Earl, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1931 to 1959. the titles are held by his grandson, the twenty-second Earl, who succeeded his father in 2005.

The courtesy title used by an heir apparent to the earldom is &quot;Lord Leslie&quot;.

The Earls of Rothes are the hereditary Clan Chiefs of Clan Leslie.

The family seat is Littlecroft, near West Milton, Dorset.

<text>In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, psionics are a form of supernatural power similar to, but distinct from, arcane and divine magic. Psionics are manifested purely by mental discipline. Psionics were introduced in the original supplement &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot;. Psionics have appeared as part of the core rules beginning with &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition.

==Overview==
In 2nd, 3rd and 3.5 editions, psionics are divided into five or six disciplines, or groupings of powers. In 2nd edition, Psionicists gain access to additional disciplines as they advance in level. In 3.5 edition, several psionic character classes are forced to choose one, thereby losing access to the most potent powers of the others. In 2nd edition, each power is tied to an ability score (generally Constitution, Intelligence or Wisdom). In 3rd edition, each discipline is tied to an ability score; and in 3.5 edition, all powers use the same ability score, either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma depending on the user&#x27;s class.

Earlier editions also included psionic combat. This was eliminated in 3.5 edition. Attack and defense modes were converted into standard psionic powers.

Prior to 3rd edition, magic and psionics are treated as distinct from each other. For example, the Detect Invisibility spell will penetrate both magical and psionic invisibility, as it detects invisibility in general, while the Detect Magic spell will not detect psionic effects, as it is restricted to magical effects and psionic effects are non-magical. In 3rd and 3.5 editions, the standard psionics system incorporates psionics–magic transparency, which treats psionic energy and magic as mutually and equally vulnerable to a &quot;dispel magic&quot; spell or a &quot;dispel psionics&quot; power.

In 4th edition, the psionic power source is one of several supernatural power sources. A character&#x27;s powers generally do not interact with other characters&#x27; powers based on power source. As an example, the 4th edition version of Dispel Magic can dispel any effect with the Conjuration or Zone keyword, regardless of power source.

==The disciplines==
*Clairsentience
*Metacreativity -- The ability to create objects or living beings. 
* Metapsionics -- Powers which augment other psionic powers
*Psychokinesis 
*Psychometabolism -- Powers which change the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition, including &quot;animal affinity&quot; and &quot;psionic revivify&quot;.
*Psychoportation: Psychoportation powers move the user or objects through space and/or time. 
*Telepathy

==History==
===Original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
Psionics were first introduced in the supplement &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot; (1976).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; First Edition===
Optional rules for psionics were included in the original &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which presented them as an optional ability available to many monsters and to players who could qualify with lucky rolls. There was no specific character class that specialized in psionics, although an unofficial one, the Psionicist, was introduced in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; issue #78. Much of the rules mechanics for psionic combat were found separately in the &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot;.

===Second Edition===
Psionics rules first appeared &quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot;. Game designer Rick Swan described the book as &quot;a straightforward presentation of an easily managed and highly playable system that clears up the ambiguities in the 1st Edition game and adds a number of elegant new touches&quot;.

Here, the skills of the psionicist are based on Wisdom and Constitution. Characters of chaotic alignment were not allowed to become psionicists, with the rationale being that volatile chaotics lack the discipline required to focus their mental energies. The book assigned psionic powers to the six disciplines listed above. As a psionicist gains experience and advances in level, they acquire more powers. Each power has a score rated in terms of a particular attribute. When attempting to use a power, the player makes a Power Check using 1d20. A psionicist has a fixed number of Psionic Strength Points, derived from their Wisdom, to expend on psionic powers. Psychic combat has its own chapter. The book includes updates on psionic monsters (including the thought eater and cerebral parasite), a discussion of society&#x27;s reaction to psionicists, and a section describing the role of psionics in Ravenloft and other TSR campaign settings.

&quot;Dragon&quot; Magazine issue #174 included &quot;Are You Having Bad Thoughts?&quot;, an article by Ravenloft designer Bruce Nesmith, detailing how psionics work in that setting. 

The power selection for the psionicist class was later expanded by the card-based &quot;Deck of Psionic Might&quot;. 

The new Dark Sun campaign setting made psionics a core part of its fictional world and rule. Here, every character, including PCs, and most monsters possessed some psionic wild talent. Several &quot;Dark Sun&quot; products introduced new psionic powers.

====Revision====
The psionics system was greatly revised in &quot;Player&#x27;s Option: Skills &amp; Powers&quot; and the revised &quot;Dark Sun Campaign Setting&quot;. The psionic abilities possessed by a character are determined by the Wisdom, Constitution, and Intelligence scores of that character. Any character with high enough scores and successful dice rolling can have a psionic talent called a &quot;wild talent&quot;. Any player character in the Dark Sun world will have psionic talent. Characters with psionic abilities also have Psionic Strength Points (PSPs) and a Mental Armor Class (MAC). Many of the powers were also altered in this revision.

A reviewer for the British magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; felt that this system was &quot;a much more logical set-up than was previously in use. It&#x27;s a matter of taste, though, as to whether you think there&#x27;s any need for spell-like psionic powers when the game already supports such a wide variety of magical styles.&quot;

===3rd and 3.5 editions===
Psionics were overhauled in the release of the &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot; (2001) for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Third Edition. The psionicist was renamed &quot;psion&quot; and more closely resembled the Sorcerer class in terms of combat ability. A new character class, the psychic warrior, was introduced. Psions were given several new abilities and psionic powers that were intended to complement the new and revised abilities of the magic-using character classes, and psionic items were introduced to give psionic characters an alternative to using magical items.

The psionics system was again revised for the 3.5 edition of the game, in the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; (2004). This change streamlined the system and eliminated the psionic combat system that had previously been employed, while adding some new mechanics. Any character with some form of psionic ability could now spend a turn concentrating to gain &quot;psionic focus&quot;, with various abilities either functioning only while focused or fuelled by expending focus. The book also introduced other races, such as the &quot;Elan&quot;, psionic characters who had achieved immortality. The May 2004 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; introduced the &quot;Athasian elan&quot; as a playable character race for the Dark Sun campaign setting.

In the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; (2004), many psionic characters have some connection to the quori - malevolent spirits from the dreamrealm of Dal Quor - with such talents being particularly common on the quori-ruled continent of Sarlona. The book also introduces &quot;Kalashtar&quot; as a playable race, psionically-gifted humans whose ancestors offered sanctuary to rogue quori within their own souls. Psionics- and quori-related mechanics were expanded upon in later Eberron supplements.

The &quot;Complete Psionic&quot; (2006) book introduced three new standard classes as well as several prestige classes for the psionic character. It also includes a variant Psion class called the &quot;Erudite&quot; which does not have to specialize in a specific discipline. It also has the ability to learn an unlimited number of powers but can manifest a limited few each day. &quot;Complete Psionic&quot; also introduced a number of minor rules changes and clarifications.

===4th Edition===
The Player&#x27;s Handbook 3, published March 16, 2010, includes four psionic classes, the ardent, battlemind, monk and psion. Psionic powers are called disciplines. Monks use the same general system of at-will, encounter and daily attack and utility powers, while the other three classes lack encounter attack powers, instead possessing a pool of &quot;power points&quot; which they can use to augment their at-will attack powers.

===5th Edition===
On July 6, 2015, Wizards of the Coast published an &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; article on their website introducing a playtest version of new psionics rules for 5th Edition D&amp;D. The article also describes a new psionic class, the Mystic, which could resemble one of several different psionic classes from past editions, depending on the player&#x27;s choice of Psionic Order. An online survey was conducted to gather feedback from the community, and on September 11, Wizards reported that the core rules were &quot;a good start,&quot; but the Mystic class could use greater flexibility. An &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; article published on April 14, 2020, explained that despite positive response from some fans, the Mystic class was removed in favor of options for existing classes to use psionic powers.

The three psionic subclasses were outlined in the 2019 article in &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; introduced psionic sub-classes for the Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard. Two Third Edition classes, the Psychic Warrior for Fighters, the Soulknife for Rogues were brought back as subclasses, and a new psionic Arcane Tradition was created for Wizards. This playtest also included several new psionic-flavored spells and feats. Designers continued to revise the psionic rules releasing another playtest in an &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; article published in March 2020. The revisions kept the Soulknife as a Rogue subclass, changed the name of the Psychic Warrior to the Psi Knight, and dropped the Psionics Wizard subclass in favor of a new, Sorcerer subclass called the Psychic Soul. It also included new spells, feats, and features for each. A new Psionic Talent Die was included which would gradually grow in size as a player levels up, and offer either increases in damage, or other mechanical augmentations to a psion&#x27;s powers.
 At their online gaming event &quot;D&amp;D Celebration&quot; Wizards&#x27; of the Coast revealed that the upcoming supplement &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot; would include a new take on Psionics.

==Psionic classes==
In 1st edition, there was no specific character class for psionics. In 2nd edition, only one psionic character class was introduced, the Psionicist. In 3rd edition this class was renamed &quot;Psion&quot;, and various new alternate classes were introduced based on psionics usage. &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot; was later updated for version 3.5 with the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;, and new material was added in the &quot;Complete Psionic&quot; book.

In the fourth edition, psionic power is considered to be a power source on a par with martial, divine, arcane, or primal power. The Psion was reintroduced as a psionic controller, along with the Ardent, Battlemind, and Monk.

===Monk===

In 4th edition, the Monk uses the psionic power source.

===Psion/Psionicist===
Psionicists and Psions are dedicated to the usage of psionic power.

The powers of a Psionicist come from the mind, rather than external agencies as with a Wizard, and as Psionicists rise in level they will have access to additional attack and defense strategies as well as more psionic powers.

====2nd edition====
The Psionicist class was introduced in 2nd edition, in which it is the sole official psionic class, in &quot;The Complete Psionics Handbook&quot;. Psionicists use psionics according to 2nd edition&#x27;s standard psionics system, in which they expend Psionic Strength Points to activate and sustain powers, and activating most powers requires a roll based on an ability score.

====3rd and 3.5 editions====
In 3rd and 3.5 editions, Psions are mechanically similar to Sorcerers, but with an arsenal of powers smaller than the Sorcerer&#x27;s number of spells. Like Wizards, Psions can (and must) specialize in one discipline, with some powers within each discipline being available only to specialists. In 3rd edition the various disciplines were each linked to a statistic; for instance, clairsentience is linked to Wisdom, and Psions who specialize in it are known as Seers. This was changed in 3.5 so that all disciplines are linked to the Intelligence statistic. Psion is the favored class of the elan race (found in the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;), as well as the kalashtar (found in the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot;).

In both 3rd and 3.5 editions, Psions expend power points to activate their psionic powers. In 3.5 edition, psionic powers can be augmented by spending additional power points to create a new or enhanced effect. Damage-dealing powers in 3.5 do not scale with the user&#x27;s level as spells do, and must be augmented to the maximum in order to match the power of an equivalent-level spellcaster; however, many powers compensate for this loss of efficiency with added versatility, such as &quot;energy ray&quot; allowing the user to switch between four elements with different effects.

Psions also have access to metapsionic feats, which grant generic augments that can be applied to any power. These augments are cheaper in cost than equivalent metamagic feats, but always require the psion to expend their psionic focus - thus granting psions greater power in short bursts, but making it harder for them to use metapsionic feats repeatedly or apply multiple such feats to a single power.

====4th edition====
In 4th Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Psions are a Psionic Controller class. Unlike most 4th edition classes, Psions do not have any encounter attack powers, instead, they have a pool of power points, which can be used to augment at-will attack powers. Like encounter powers, power points are recharged by a short rest. A preview was presented in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; #375 in May 2009, and the class is among the classes included in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 3&quot;, which was released on March 16, 2010.

====Psionicists and Psions in other media====
Psionicists are among the classes in &quot;Dark Sun: Shattered Lands&quot; and &quot;Dark Sun Online: Crimson Sands&quot; PC games. Psions are among the classes in the 2007 PSP game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics&quot;.
===Psychic Warrior===
Introduced in 3rd edition, psychic warriors are a blend between Fighters and Psions. Like fighters, they gain bonus feats, and like Psions, they wield psionic powers, though at a slower rate than either specialized class. Their attack bonus and hit point growth is similarly in the middle. Psychic warrior is the favored class of half-giants (found in the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;).

In 3rd edition, Psychic Warrior powers are tied to multiple statistics depending on their discipline, as Psions. In 3.5, the Psychic Warrior&#x27;s powers are always tied to the Wisdom statistic.
===Soulknife===
Soulknives are warriors who have learned to channel psionic power into &quot;mind blades&quot;, or swords composed of psionic energy. Their broad training allows them to take many occupations and be a &quot;jack of all trades.&quot; Soulknives are the only psionic characters who cannot manifest powers from their class; the soulknife class grants power points, but not the ability to use them. As a soulknife gains levels, the powers of her mind blade increase, such as the ability to form her mind blade into shapes other than a short sword (a concept further expanded with new feats in &quot;Complete Psionic&quot;). Soulknife is the favored class of the xeph race (found in the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;). Soulknife was a prestige class in the original &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot;, but it was made into a base class when psionics were revised for v3.5.
===Wilder===
Introduced in 3.5 edition, wilders can use &quot;wild surges&quot;, which allow them to augment their psionic powers to a greater extent than normal. Doing so is dangerous: every time a wild surge is used there is a chance that the wilder will suffer from &quot;psychic enervation&quot; causing them to become dazed and lose power points. A wilder&#x27;s powers are tied to the Charisma statistic. They are slightly tougher than Psions, but know fewer powers and do not have a specialized discipline. Wilder is the favored class of the dromite and maenad races (both found in the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;).
===Other psionic classes===
The following classes were introduced in 3.5 editions&#x27; Complete Psionic.
==Psionic items==
In 2nd edition, all psionic items are intelligent items with PSP pools and the ability to use psionic powers.

In 3rd edition, psionic items are much closer to magic items. They are generally not intelligent items, and are divided into nine categories: armor, shields, melee weapons, ranged weapons, psionic tattoos, cognizance crystals, power stones, dorjes and universal items. Armor, shields and weapons have enhancement bonuses and abilities like their magical counterparts, cognizance crystals store power points with no other power, dorjes are the psionic equivalent of wands, power stones are the psionic equivalent of scrolls, psionic tattoos are the psionic counterpart of potions, and universal items are the psionic counterpart of wondrous items.

<text>Hafnarfjörður, officially Hafnarfjarðarkaupstaður, is a port town and municipality in Iceland, located about south of Reykjavík. The municipality consists of two non-contiguous areas in the Capital Region, on the southwest coast of the country. At about 30,000 inhabitants, Hafnarfjörður is the third-most populous city in Iceland after Reykjavík and Kópavogur. It has established local industry and a variety of urban activities, with annual festival events.

==Activities==
The town is the site of an annual Viking festival, where Viking culture enthusiasts from around the world display reconstructions of Viking garb, handicraft, sword-fighting and longbow shooting. It takes place in June.

==Local industry==
Just two kilometres () outside of Hafnarfjörður is an aluminium smelter, run by Alcan. The smelter was originally built in 1969. Local elections were held in April 2007, where the people of the town voted against extension of the smelter.

==History==

Hafnarfjörður takes its name (meaning &quot;harbour fjord&quot;) from the area&#x27;s natural harbour. The town is built on top of Holocene lava fields erupted from the nearby Krýsuvík volcanic system, including the 8000-year-old &quot;Búrfellshraun&quot; and the much younger 2000-year-old &quot;Óbrinnishólabruni&quot;. There have been no new lava flows on the site since before the Settlement of Iceland, but the Krýsuvík system is still an active volcano, last erupting in 2021 at Fagradalsfjall further to the southwest.

Hafnarfjörður is first named in the medieval Landnámabók, and the earliest reports of voyages to Hafnarfjörður date from the end of the 14th century. Englishmen began trading in Hafnarfjörður in the 15th century, but German merchants followed in their wake and eventually drove the English out. In German documents, Hafnarfjörður was mentioned for the first time in 1391, and in another German document dating from 1486 the place was described as a trading place of merchants from Hamburg for the first time.

The town of Hafnarfjörður became an official member of the Hanseatic League. The first Lutheran church in Iceland was raised at Háigrandi , opposite Óseyri , just outside the small boat harbour in 1533. After that, the Hanseatic traders prevailed in town until 1602, based at Hvaleyri . At this point, the Danish monarchy established a Danish trade monopoly in Iceland which lasted until late in the 18th century. During this period, Hafnarfjörður was the nation&#x27;s busiest trade centre.

In 1793, Bjarni Sívertsen settled here and became influential in local business and international trade, setting up a major commercial fishing operation. His enterprise and initiative signalled the start of impressive commerce in the town. Ever since, he has been called &quot;the father of Hafnarfjörður&quot; and nicknamed &quot;Sir Bjarni&quot;. His house in Vesturgata street, built in 1803, was transformed into a museum (&quot;Sívertsenshús&quot;).

Around 1870, dramatic changes took place in Icelandic fishing. Residents followed the growing trend in Iceland of using decked boats rather than row-boats. This led to even more employment and rapid growth, and Hafnarfjörður was the fifth town in Iceland to attain official municipal status in 1908. The first mayor was Páll Einarsson, who later became the mayor of Reykjavík. The first road between Reykjavík and Hafnarfjörður was finished in 1898. The first hydrological power plant in Iceland was built in Hafnarfjörður in 1904.

In 1890 Hafnarfjörður had 616 inhabitants and it was one of the largest towns in Iceland. When Hafnarfjörður attained official municipal status on 1 June 1908 it had 1 400 inhabitants. In 1920 Hafnarfjörður had 2 366 inhabitants, in 1940 3 686, in 1960 7 160 and in 1980 12 312.

The &quot;Coot&quot;, Iceland&#x27;s first trawler, operated from Hafnarfjörður between 1905 and 1908. Its boiler stands by the roundabout on the junction of Reykjavíkurvegur, Strandgata and Vesturgata. A harbour for large commercial ships was raised in 1912, and the first car arrived in 1913.

After World War II, more advanced trawlers and numerous motorised ships were added to the fleet. The town&#x27;s first stern trawler appeared in 1973. Today, Hafnarfjörður is one of the nation&#x27;s largest fishing centres and the site of Iceland&#x27;s first fish wholesalers&#x27; auction market. Through the years, Hafnarfjörður&#x27;s dynamic local economy has been strongly linked to fishing, although freight transport has recently become the major harbour activity. And now, the town is Iceland&#x27;s second-ranked import and export harbour. Hafnarfjörður is the third largest town of Iceland, after Reykjavík and Kópavogur.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The climate in Hafnarfjörður is subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;).
==Local festivals==

===Bright days===
Each year in May, the Bright Days festival is held. The events include short movies, concerts and usually conclude on a day commemorating the sailors of Iceland.

===Viking festival===
Each year on the summer solstice a Viking festival is held in Hafnarfjörður. A local pub and restaurant, Fjörukráin, started the festival and maintains it to this day.

==Sights==

There are various old buildings left in the old town centre, e.g. &quot;Pakkhúsið&quot; , a store house dating from 1865 which houses the Museum of Navigation (&quot;Sjóminjasafn Íslands&quot; ). &quot;Sívertsenshús&quot;, an old dwelling house built in 1803, is the oldest building in Hafnarfjörður. It is known by the name &quot;Hús Bjarna riddara Sívertsen&quot; as well and it was transformed into a museum in 1974. &quot;Hafnarfjarðarkirkja&quot; , the oldest church in town, was consecrated in 1914. Strandgata and Fjarðargata are two old streets in the centre where some historical buildings are preserved. No. 55 of Strandargata is a former wooden store house which was built in 1841 and enlarged in 1880. No. 57 is a wooden residential building dating from 1841.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Church (&quot;Sankti Jósefskirkja&quot; ), one of the few Roman Catholic churches in Iceland whose parish was founded in 1926, can be visited in the South of the town centre. &quot;Karmelklaustur&quot; is the only Catholic monastery in Iceland. &quot;Fríkirkjan í Hafnarfirði&quot; is a Protestant church built in 1913.

&quot;Hafnarborg&quot; is a centre of arts and culture where concerts and exhibitions are organized. Hafnarfjörður boasts its own Municipal Theatre, the Icelandic Museum of Films (&quot;Kvikmyndasafn Íslands&quot; ) and a Museum of Telecommunication (&quot;Póst- og Símaminjasafnið&quot; ).

Many Icelanders believe in elves and trolls. Hellisgerði is a small park with lava rocks in the centre of the town which is visited by many people believing that elves and trolls reside there. The northernmost Bonsai trees of the world grow in Hellisgerði as well. &quot;Víðistaðatún&quot; is a park in the town centre which is famous for its sculptures created by Icelandic and international well-known artists. &quot;Víðistaðakirkja&quot; is a modern church, hemicycle in shape which was inaugurated in the park in 1988. The symbol of Hafnarafjörður is &quot;Viti&quot; , a lighthouse built around 1900 which can be seen in a residential area on private property.

==In popular culture==
In the 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; by Tom Clancy, the Soviet Union gains a dramatic strategic advantage at the beginning of the war by seizing Iceland with a Guards Airborne division transported secretly by converted freighters. When the US Marine Corps retake Iceland, they initially land at Hafnarfjörður before advancing on Keflavik. Additionally, in the novella, &quot;The Odd Saga of the American and a Curious Icelandic Flock&quot;, Snorri calls Alex in the middle of the night to tell him that he is passing through Hafnarfjörður and will be picking him up shortly for a trip to Snæfellsnes.

In 2017 a petition calling upon the Icelandic Prime Minister to erect a statue of Stefán Karl Stefánsson in his hometown of Hafnarfjörður “to forever immortalize and honour his amazing legacy” was created. After his death in 2018, there was a surge of signatures. There are now over 528,000 signatures.

<text>For a Few Dollars More () is a 1965 Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone. It stars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as bounty hunters and Gian Maria Volonté as the primary villain. German actor Klaus Kinski plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was an international co-production between Italy, West Germany, and Spain. The film was released in the United States in 1967, and is the second installment of what is commonly known as the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;.

==Plot==
The man that many call Manco is a bounty hunter, a profession shared by a former army officer, Colonel Douglas Mortimer. They separately learn that a ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber, &quot;El Indio&quot;, has been broken out of prison by his gang, who slaughtered all but one of his jailers. While Indio is murdering the family of the man who had captured him, he is shown to carry a musical pocket watch taken from a woman who had shot herself while he was raping her after he had murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory.

Indio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso, which has a disguised safe containing &quot;almost a million dollars.&quot; Manco arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, who had arrived earlier. He sees Mortimer deliberately insult the hunchback Wild, who is reconnoitering the bank. Manco confronts Mortimer, and after the two have studied each other, each ascertaining that the other will not back down, they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades Manco to join Indio&#x27;s gang and &quot;get him between two fires.&quot; Manco achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio from prison despite Indio&#x27;s suspicions.

Indio sends Manco and three others to rob the bank in nearby Santa Cruz. Manco guns down the three bandits and sends a false telegraphic alarm to rouse the El Paso sheriff and his posse, who ride to Santa Cruz. The gang blasts the wall at the rear of the El Paso bank and steals the safe, but is unable to open it. Groggy is angry when Manco is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but Indio accepts Manco&#x27;s version of events thanks to Mortimer having given Manco a convincing neck wound. The gang ride to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer, who had anticipated their destination, is waiting. Wild recognizes Mortimer, forcing a showdown that results in the hunchback&#x27;s death, whereafter Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe without using explosives. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says the loot will be divided after a month.

Manco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught immediately afterward and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Later that night, Indio instructs his lieutenant, Niño, to use a knife belonging to Cuchillo to kill the man guarding Manco and Mortimer. Once Niño has freed the prisoners, Indio reveals that he knew they were bounty hunters all along, and executes Cuchillo for supposedly betraying the gang. Indio orders the rest of his men to bring back Manco and Mortimer, hoping they will all kill each other and he and Niño can split the money just between themselves. However, Groggy realizes the scheme, and after killing Niño, forces Indio to open the strongbox, which is found to be empty.

Eventually, after he and Manco kill the bandits, Mortimer calls out Indio while revealing his full name. Mortimer shoots Groggy as he runs for cover, but is disarmed by Indio, who plays the pocket watch while challenging the bounty hunter to regain his weapon and kill him when the music ends. As the music ends, the same tune begins from an identical pocket watch that Manco had pilfered from Mortimer. Manco gives his gunbelt and pistol to Mortimer, saying, &quot;Now we start.&quot; When the music ends, Mortimer shoots first, killing Indio.

Mortimer retrieves the watch from Indio&#x27;s hand and Manco remarks on Mortimer&#x27;s resemblance to the woman in the vignette photo inside the watch cover. Mortimer reveals that he is her brother (father in the Spanish dubbing), and with his revenge complete, declines his share of the bounty and leaves. Manco tosses the bodies of Indio and his men into a wagon, finally adding Groggy&#x27;s body after killing him, and rides off to collect the bounties on them all, briefly pausing to recover the stolen money from its hiding place.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===

After the box-office success of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; in Italy, director Sergio Leone and his new producer, Alberto Grimaldi, wanted to begin production of a sequel. Since Clint Eastwood was not ready to commit to a second film before he had seen the first, the filmmakers rushed an Italian-language print of &quot;Per un pugno di dollari&quot; to him - as a version in English did not yet exist. When the star arranged for a debut screening at CBS Production Center, though the audience there may not have understood Italian, they found its style and action convincing. Eastwood, therefore, agreed to the proposal. Charles Bronson was again approached for a starring role but he thought the sequel&#x27;s script was too like the first film. Instead, Lee Van Cleef accepted the role. Eastwood received $50,000 for returning in the sequel, while Van Cleef received $17,000.

Screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni wrote the film in nine days. However, Leone was dissatisfied with some of the script&#x27;s dialogue, and hired Sergio Donati to work as an uncredited script doctor.

===Production===
The film was shot in Tabernas, Almería, Spain, with interiors done at Rome&#x27;s Cinecittà Studios. The production designer Carlo Simi built the town of &quot;El Paso&quot; in the Almería desert; it still exists, as the tourist attraction &quot;Mini Hollywood.&quot; The town of Agua Caliente, where Indio and his gang flee after the bank robbery, was filmed in Los Albaricoques, a small &quot;pueblo blanco&quot; on the Níjar plain.

===Post-production===
As all of the film&#x27;s footage was shot MOS (i.e. without recording sound at the time of shooting), Eastwood and Van Cleef returned to Italy where they dubbed over their dialogue, and sound effects were added. Although it is explicitly stated in the movie that the Colonel Mortimer character is originally from the Carolinas, Van Cleef opted to perform his dialogue using his native New Jersey accent rather than a Southern accent.

===Music===
The musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone, who had previously collaborated with director Leone on &quot;A Fistful of Dollars.&quot; Under Leone&#x27;s explicit direction, Morricone began writing the score before production had started, as Leone often shot to the music on set. The music is notable for its blend of diegetic and non-diegetic moments through a recurring motif that originates from the identical pocket watches belonging to El Indio and Colonel Mortimer. &quot;The music that the watch makes transfers your thought to a different place,&quot; said Morricone. &quot;The character itself comes out through the watch but in a different situation every time it appears.&quot;
A soundtrack album was originally released in Italy by RCA Italiana. In the United States, Hugo Montenegro released a cover version as did Billy Strange and Leroy Holmes who released a cover version of the soundtrack album with the original American poster art. Maurizio Graf sang a vocal &quot;Occhio Per Occhio&quot;/&quot;An Eye For An Eye&quot; to the music of the cue &quot;Sixty Seconds to What?&quot;. Graf’s performance(s) did not appear in the film but were released as tie-in 45 RPM records.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; was released in Italy on 30 December 1965 as &quot;Per Qualche Dollaro in Più&quot;.

The film proved to be even more commercially successful than its predecessor. By 1967, the film became the highest-grossing film in Italy with a gross of 3.1 billion lire () from 14,543,161 admissions.

The film opened in Spain on 17 August 1966 as &quot;La muerte tenía un precio&quot; and became the highest-grossing Spanish film of all-time with a gross of 272 million pesetas, equivalent to in 1966.

It was the seventh most popular film at the French box office in 1966, for a total of grossed in international territories outside North America.

In the United States, the film debuted on 10 May 1967, four months after the release of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, earning in rentals. It grossed a total of in the United States and Canada, adding up to a total of grossed worldwide.

===Critical reception===
The film initially received mediocre reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;The fact that this film is constructed to endorse the exercise of murderers, to emphasize killer bravado and generate glee in frantic manifestations of death is, to my mind, a sharp indictment of it as so-called entertainment in this day.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as &quot;one great old Western cliché after another&quot; and said that it &quot;is composed of situations and not plots&quot;, but nonetheless found it &quot;delicious&quot;. Its platitudinous character immediately laid it open to parody and one followed in the same year as Lando Buzzanca&#x27;s &quot;For a Few Dollars Less&quot; (1966).

The film has since grown in popularity, while also gaining more positive feedback from contemporary critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 38 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;With Clint Eastwood in the lead, Ennio Morricone on the score, and Sergio Leone&#x27;s stylish direction, &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; earns its recognition as a genre classic.&quot;

In a retrospective review of the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, Paul Martinovic of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said, &quot;&quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; is often overlooked in the trilogy, awkwardly sandwiched between both the original film and the best-known, but it&#x27;s a stunning film in its own right.&quot; Paolo Sardinas of MovieWeb said, &quot;Eastwood gives it his all and turns in another iconic performance along with scene stealer Lee Van Cleef, who helps make &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; twice as good as its predecessor.&quot; Film historian Richard Schickel, in his biography of Clint Eastwood, believed that this was the best film in the trilogy, arguing that it was &quot;more elegant and complex than &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and more tense and compressed than &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;&quot;. Director Alex Cox considered the church scene to be one of &quot;the most horrible deaths&quot; of any Western, describing Volonté&#x27;s Indio as the &quot;most diabolical Western villain of all time&quot;.

British journalist Kim Newman said that the film changed the way bounty hunters were viewed by audiences. It moved them away from a &quot;profession to be ashamed of&quot;, one with a &quot;(ranking) lower than a card sharp on the Western scale of worthwhile citizens&quot;, to one of heroic respectability.

<text>Walter Evans Edge (November 20, 1873October 29, 1956) was an American diplomat and Republican politician who served as the 36th governor of New Jersey, from 1917 to 1919 and again from 1944 to 1947, during both World War I and World War II. Edge also served as United States Senator representing New Jersey from 1919 to 1929 and as United States Ambassador to France from 1929 to 1933.

==Early life==
Edge was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 20, 1873. His father, William Edge, worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad. His mother Mary (Evans) Edge, died when he was two years old. At the age of four Edge moved to Pleasantville, New Jersey, where the family of his stepmother, Wilhelmina (Scull) Edge, operated a small hotel. His formal education went only as far as the eighth grade in a two-room public school in Pleasantville.

As a youth, Edge demonstrated a desire to succeed in business and he acquired an interest in politics. At the age of ten, he and another boy started a four-page weekly newspaper devoted to social news, the &quot;Pleasantville Bladder&quot;, which had a circulation of approximately one hundred. Edge also attended Pleasantville Republican party rallies and later recounted that he came away from these events feeling great excitement and a growing determination to someday participate in politics himself.

==Business career==
In 1888, at the age of fourteen, Edge began working for the &quot;Atlantic Review&quot;, then Atlantic City&#x27;s only newspaper, providing it with news and social notes pertaining to Pleasantville and nearby communities. Later in 1888, Edge took another job with the newspaper, serving primarily as a printer&#x27;s devil and performing a wide variety of other jobs as well. Edge&#x27;s position at the &quot;Atlantic Review&quot; introduced him to many of the hotel owners and businessmen in rapidly growing Atlantic City. Edge moved from Pleasantville to Atlantic City the same year.

At the age of sixteen, Edge took a part-time job with John M. Dorland, who operated an Atlantic City advertising business. Dorland solicited advertising from Atlantic City hotels for Philadelphia and New York newspapers. Dorland was in poor health when Edge joined him and within a few months, Edge was running the business. When Dorland died less than one year later, his widow sold the business to Edge, who was then seventeen years old, for $500. Edge financed the purchase with a note that a hotel owner agreed to co-sign for him. Under Edge&#x27;s management, the Dorland Agency grew into multimillion-dollar advertising agency, with offices in numerous cities in the United States and Europe.

In 1893 Edge founded the &quot;Atlantic City Guest&quot;, a summer newspaper devoted to the activities of the resort&#x27;s vacationers. The success of the paper led Edge to start a similar paper in Jacksonville, Florida, during the winter of 1894–1895. On March 4, 1895, Edge established the &quot;Atlantic City Daily Press&quot; (now the &quot;Press of Atlantic City&quot;) as the successor to the &quot;Atlantic City Guest&quot;, which eventually became the Atlantic City area&#x27;s dominant newspaper. Edge&#x27;s income from the &quot;Press&quot; soon exceeded $20,000 annually. In 1905, Edge purchased the competing &quot;Evening Union&quot;, also based in Atlantic City. He sold both newspapers in 1919 to three employees: Albert J. Feyl, Paul J. O&#x27;Neill, and Francis E. Croasdale.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Edge&#x27;s successful advertising and publishing businesses made him very wealthy. From the beginning, his ultimate goal was to use his success in business to build a political career and to devote his primary attention to politics after he had attained financial security.

In 1894, Edge was elected to the executive committee of the Atlantic City Republican Party. From 1897 until 1899 he served as journal clerk of the New Jersey Senate, a position that enabled him to meet state political figures and learn parliamentary procedures. In the 1890s Edge was a sergeant with the Morris Guards, a private military organization based in Atlantic City, and when the Spanish–American War began in 1898, he volunteered the company for service in the United States Army. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army during the war and served for a few months, but did not leave the United States. Between 1901 and 1904, Edge was appointed secretary of the state senate, another position that enabled him to cultivate relationships with state legislators.

Edge was a presidential elector in 1904.

In 1904, Edge ran as a reformer in the Republican primary for the Atlantic County state senate seat occupied by incumbent Edward S. Lee. Edge used his &quot;Atlantic City Daily Press&quot; to promote his candidacy against Lee, who was supported by the established local Republican machine. Edge lost to Lee.

After his defeat, Edge&#x27;s &quot;Daily Press&quot; became a faithful supporter of the local Republican organization, and in 1909 he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly. In 1910, Edge was elected to the New Jersey Senate where he served for two terms, becoming the senate president in 1915.

Although Edge served in the state legislature during the height of the Progressive Era, he tended to take moderate positions and was not considered a reformer. He supported the Republican leadership, although he did cooperate with reformers when their efforts appeared sure of success. Early in his legislative career, Edge worked extensively in developing a workers&#x27; compensation law for New Jersey, even traveling to Europe to study compensation systems there. The workers&#x27; compensation bill that he sponsored was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Woodrow Wilson. He also promoted legislation calling for a ten-hour day for women workers and safety laws protecting factory workers. He gained a reputation for concern with economic matters and the efficiency of state government.

===Governor of New Jersey, 1917–1919===

In early 1916 Edge announced his candidacy for governor. Edge&#x27;s opponent for the Republican nomination was Austen Colgate. Edge&#x27;s campaign manager, Enoch &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson, the boss of the Atlantic County Republican machine, and Frank Hague, boss of the Hudson County Democratic machine, are widely credited with securing Edge&#x27;s election as governor. Johnson reached out to Hague, who feared the Democratic candidate, H. Otto Wittpenn, a reformer whose election would threaten Hague&#x27;s control of Hudson County. It is unclear whether Edge and Hague reached some agreement in exchange for Hague&#x27;s assistance, with one authority concluding there was &quot;[p]robably no outright deal&quot;, another stating Edge provided Hague with &quot;a pledge of cooperation&quot;, and a third stating that Edge &quot;had a working arrangement with Hague; the former to be left alone in South Jersey and Hague to be &#x27;protected&#x27; in Hudson&quot;. In any event, Hague instructed those in his Democratic organization to crossover and vote for Edge in the Republican primary, thereby securing Edge a narrow victory. Thereafter, Hague did not support Wittpenn in the general election, and Edge was elected on a platform of making government more effective and efficient with the slogan &quot;A Business Man with a Business Plan&quot;.

As governor, Edge obtained legislation consolidating state boards, improving the civil service, imposing a franchise tax on public utilities, allowing greater home rule for cities, reforming corporation law, and improving state institutions, especially the prisons. In 1917 the legislature also agreed to Edge&#x27;s proposal to reorganize the state road department, and Edge won approval for legislation authorizing the construction of a bridge between southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and a tunnel between northern New Jersey and New York City. The bridge had been sought for some time by South Jersey legislators, but had failed to gain the support of North Jersey legislators, who opposed spending state funds on a project that they felt would benefit only the southern part of the state. Edge therefore combined the bridge proposal with plans for a tunnel to New York to win statewide support. The bridge, the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which spans the Delaware River between Camden and Philadelphia, opened in 1926, and the tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, which connects Jersey City and lower Manhattan, opened in 1927. It has been contended that the decision to place the terminus of the tunnel in Jersey City was the result of Frank Hague&#x27;s support of Edge in the 1916 gubernatorial election.

A considerable part of Edge&#x27;s efforts as governor involved the mobilization for World War I and postwar planning.

===United States Senator, 1919–1929===

In 1918 Edge was elected to the United States Senate, defeating George L. Record and Edward W. Gray in the Republican primary and Democratic candidate George W. La Monte in the general election. Although the term to which he had been elected began on March 4, 1919, the Senate was in recess at that time. In order to attend to remaining gubernatorial business, Edge did not resign as governor until May 16, 1919, and was sworn in as senator three days later.

The most important and controversial vote held by the Senate during Edge&#x27;s term involved the Treaty of Versailles, the ratification of which would have allowed the United States to join the League of Nations. As a member of the moderate wing of the Republican Party, Edge was a &quot;mild reservationist&quot; on the question. Although he appears to have genuinely wanted the United States to enter the League of Nations, he believed that reservations to the treaty were needed both to protect national sovereignty and to secure the votes needed for ratification by the Senate. In November 1919 and again in March 1920, he voted to ratify the treaty with the Lodge Reservations.

Continuing his efforts to apply business management principles to government, in 1919 Edge introduced a joint resolution that led to the passage of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which established the Bureau of the Budget (now called the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office. Edge also sponsored the Edge Act, a 1919 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which allowed National Banks (any banking institution chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) to engage in international banking through federally chartered subsidiaries.

At the 1920 Republican National Convention that nominated Warren G. Harding for president, there was a movement to nominate Edge as candidate for vice president. Convention rules required the vote of a candidate&#x27;s state delegation as a unit in support of the nomination, which Edge could not secure. In 1917, while governor, Edge had made an enemy of William P. Verdon, Republican leader of Hudson County, when Edge refused to appoint the man Verdon wanted as Hudson County prosecutor, Richard Doherty. (Verdon had expected that Doherty would wage a campaign against election fraud in Hudson County if appointed prosecutor). At the convention, Verdon kept his delegates from voting for Edge, thereby blocking the attempt to nominate him, and Verdon backed the nomination of Calvin Coolidge, the successful candidate.

Edge opposed prohibition and voted against the Volstead Act. In 1924, he ran for reelection advocating the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, which New Jersey had approved in 1922, after the end of his term as governor. He proposed a number of bills that would relax prohibition, including legislation authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of 3%, and another bill to legalize the sale of beer with alcohol content of 2.75%. At some point he supported practically every anti-prohibition movement in the Senate.

Edge was reelected to the Senate in 1924, defeating prohibition advocate Hamilton Fish Kean in the Republican primary and Democratic candidate Frederick W. Donnelly in the general election.

In April 1929, it was reported that President Herbert Hoover would appoint Edge United States Ambassador to France. He did not resign from the Senate and take office as Ambassador, however, until November 21, 1929, a delay attributable to political issues involving the appointment of a Republican successor to fill his Senate seat and the desire to have his expertise in the Senate while tariff legislation was considered. During the course of the tariff debates, Edge proved a protectionist who voted in favor of higher tariffs on imported goods. The resulting tariff law, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, was not enacted until the spring of 1930, several months after Edge left the Senate.
===United States Ambassador to France, 1929–1933===
During his tenure as ambassador, Edge spent considerable time dealing with Franco-American trade issues, which were strained by tariff policies and the contentious post-World War I questions of war debts, reparations and disarmament.

===Governor of New Jersey, 1944–1947===
After his ambassadorship ended in 1933, Edge spent most of the next decade living a life of retirement, traveling, and serving as an elder statesman for the New Jersey Republican party. With the outbreak of World War II, Edge was eager to return to public service. In 1943 he agreed to run for governor provided no one opposed him in the Republican primary and the party maintained strong discipline, and party leaders accepted those conditions. Following his nomination, Edge faced Democratic candidate Vincent J. Murphy, mayor of Newark and state leader of the American Federation of Labor, in the general election. By now, any assistance provided to him by Hudson County Democratic boss Frank Hague in the 1916 election was long forgotten, and Edge hammered on the theme of Hague&#x27;s power, campaigning that a vote for Murphy was a vote for the domination of &quot;labor leaders, communists and Hagueism&quot;. Edge also advocated streamlining state government, early postwar planning and the adoption of a new state constitution, which he considered essential to modernizing state government and which had been actively supported by the incumbent Democratic governor, Charles Edison. In the November 1943 election, Edge defeated Murphy by a comfortable margin.Edge&#x27;s second term as governor was marked by numerous battles with Hague. In 1944, Edge and Hague fought over how certain railroad tax money should be allocated (with Hague&#x27;s position ultimately prevailing), while Edge won the passage of legislation that required the use of voting machines in Hudson County to reduce the chance of electoral fraud. Edge also obtained legislation authorizing the governor to appoint jury commissioners for each county, bypassing county sheriffs, who had previously hand-picked grand jurors who they knew would refuse to indict those engaged in illegal activities protected by political bosses like Hague. The most important battle between Edge and Hague involved constitutional revision. In early 1944, Republican legislators drafted a new proposed constitution that would have, among other things, deprived Hague of a major source of patronage by restructuring the judiciary. Hague strongly opposed the revised constitution, and several weeks prior to the November 1944 election he launched a multi-pronged attack on it, charging that it would restrict the activities of labor unions, inhibit advancement opportunities for returning veterans, and subject all church owned property to taxation. Voters rejected the proposed constitution.

The Edge administration battled Hague on other fronts as well. Walter D. Van Riper, whom Edge had appointed state attorney general, took over the Hudson County prosecutor&#x27;s office and brought in outside investigators. Van Riper aggressively prosecuted unlawful activities protected by the Hague organization. In June 1944, he led raids on Hudson County horse race betting rooms, later obtaining the indictments from newly constituted Hudson grand juries, the first indictments for such activities since Hague had come to power. In the process, gambling on horse racing in Hudson County was virtually eliminated. In early 1945 Hague retaliated by having his hand-picked United States Attorney bring two federal indictments against Van Riper, one charging check kiting and the other related to the alleged sale of gasoline in the black market. Van Riper went to trial on both indictments and was acquitted of all charges. Edge and Van Riper were undeterred and continued to apply pressure on Hague. Major state jobs, which Hague once had controlled, now went to Republicans. The state civil service system was reformed and freed from Hague&#x27;s domination. The actions of the Edge administration took a heavy toll on Hague, who retired from active politics in 1947 during the administration of Edge&#x27;s successor, Republican Alfred E. Driscoll.

Despite the defeat of constitutional revision, Edge was able to accomplish much of his program. A number of state boards and commissions were consolidated, and a Taxation and Finance Department was established to handle all fiscal matters. Legislation providing benefits to returning veterans was enacted, as was legislation intended to improve the living conditions of migrant workers. In 1945, Edge signed a series of laws banning racial or religious discrimination in public accommodations, employment, public school admissions, jury service and hospital care.

Much of Edge&#x27;s last year in office was spent dealing with problems associated with the conversion to a peacetime economy and a wave of strikes.

==Relationship with Atlantic County Republican organization==
Throughout Edge&#x27;s political career, his home county, Atlantic County, was controlled by a Republican political machine that was extensively involved in the protection of Atlantic City&#x27;s vice industry and other corruption. When Edge first ran for public office in 1904, he ran as a reformer against a candidate supported by the party establishment. Edge enlisted the support of many prominent Atlantic City citizens, and used his &quot;Atlantic City Daily Press&quot; to promote his candidacy and expose the activities of the machine. Edge fully expected to win the election and was shocked when he was defeated. He later blamed his defeat on the &quot;Scott machine&quot; (a reference to the organization led by County Clerk Lewis P. Scott) and party boss control of voting places and ballot counting.

After his defeat, Edge&#x27;s &quot;Daily Press&quot; became a faithful supporter of the Republican organization. Edge subsequently ran with the support of the party establishment for state legislature, even campaigning when he ran for state senate in 1910 with Louis Kuehnle, Scott&#x27;s successor as leader of the organization. When he ran for governor in 1916, Edge&#x27;s campaign manager was Enoch &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson, who had replaced Kuehnle as boss of the Atlantic County machine after Kuehnle was convicted of corruption related charges in 1911. Johnson and Hudson County Democratic leader Frank Hague were widely credited with engineering Edge&#x27;s 1916 victory, and Johnson also served as Edge&#x27;s campaign manager during his successful run for the United States Senate in 1918.

In 1924, however, the relationship between Edge and Johnson openly soured. In the Atlantic City Commission election that year, Johnson&#x27;s organization backed a slate of candidates led by incumbent mayor Edward L. Bader. Bader was opposed by a ticket led by former mayor Harry Bacharach. The Bacharach ticket ran on an anti-vice platform and gained the support of Johnson&#x27;s opponents. Bader&#x27;s slate won the bitter election, which was marked by allegations of widespread organization-backed voter fraud. A month after the election, Edge replaced Johnson as the manager of his senate reelection campaign amid rumors that Johnson was unhappy about the &quot;hands off&quot; policy that Edge had taken during the recent election in which Johnson&#x27;s leadership had been threatened. Thereafter, the Atlantic County Republican organization led by Johnson refused to support Edge in his 1924 primary election contest against Hamilton Fish Kean.

Although in 1927 Johnson touted Edge as a potential presidential candidate, in 1928 the two men openly broke. The initial indication of a break was Johnson&#x27;s support of Hamilton Fish Kean for the Republican nomination for United States senator, while Edge was backing Edward C. Stokes. The split noticeably widened after Edge abandoned his policy of non-interference in purely local politics and backed Robert M. Johnston for Atlantic County state senator in the Republican primary. This prompted Johnson to openly back incumbent senator Emerson L. Richards, who was Edge&#x27;s political and personal foe. The ensuing election was described as a &quot;trial of strength in Atlantic County, the outcome of which may spell the doom of the loser&quot;. The election results proved to be a disaster for Edge, whose candidates lost Atlantic County to the Johnson backed candidates by margins exceeding three to one, and with Richards claiming the results marked Edge&#x27;s &quot;political extinction&quot;. In the wake of the election, Edge called for party unity, and Johnson attempted to brush aside any damage to Edge by denying claims that the election results meant the end of his political career or that the election had been against Edge.

Edge, who faced a reelection campaign in 1930, resigned from the United States Senate in 1929 to accept appointment as Ambassador to France.

In his 1948 memoirs, &quot;A Jerseyman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Edge makes no mention of either Kuehnle or Johnson, who was imprisoned in 1941 for income tax evasion. Johnson&#x27;s successor as leader of the Atlantic County Republican organization, Frank S. Farley, is mentioned once, in connection with events that transpired while Edge was out-of-state during his second term as governor, and Farley, as state senate president, was acting governor. Edge&#x27;s memoirs have been criticized for failing to discuss how he rose in politics and in skipping over the skullduggery involved in interesting political situations, and his failure to discuss his relationship and disagreements with the Atlantic County machine provide examples of those omissions.

==Later years and death==
After Edge left office on January 21, 1947, he continued to promote constitutional reform, which was achieved later the same year with the adoption of the Constitution of 1947. Edge spent his final years as the elder statesman of the New Jersey Republican party. In 1951, he was one of the first prominent figures to back General Dwight D. Eisenhower for president. In 1953, he attended the coronation of King Faisal II of Iraq as President Eisenhower&#x27;s representative.

Edge died on October 29, 1956, in New York City. He was buried at the Northwood Cemetery in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.

==Personal life==

Edge married Estella Blanche Ailes of Lancaster, Pennsylvania on January 11, 1893. Apparently this marriage ended in divorce since Edge does not mention it in his memoirs. He married Lady Lee Phillips of Memphis, Tennessee on June 5, 1907. She died July 14, 1915, four days after the birth of their only child. On December 9, 1922, Edge married Camilla Sewall of Bath, Maine, the daughter of Harold M. Sewall, a former diplomat and close friend of President Warren G. Harding.
 Edge was forty-nine years old at the time, and his wife twenty-one. During Edge&#x27;s term as Ambassador to France, his wife was known as &quot;the youngest ambassadress&quot;. Walter and Camilla Edge had three children together.

In the early 1920s Edge lived in a cottage on States Avenue in Atlantic City that was near the Boardwalk. In 1923, he moved to a new beachfront home in Ventnor, New Jersey that was located between Oxford and Somerset Avenues. This was his official residence until the mid-1940s, and thereafter was used by him as a summer home.

In 1944, Edge purchased Morven, the historic Princeton, New Jersey home of Richard Stockton, from the Stockton family. The sale was subject to the condition that Morven would be given to the state of New Jersey within two years of Edge&#x27;s death. Edge transferred possession of Morven to the state in 1954, and he spent the last few years of his life living in a small house in Princeton.

Edge was an avid sportsman who enjoyed fishing and hunting, especially hunting quail. After World War I, Edge purchased land in northern Leon County, Florida with his longtime friend, Walter C. Teagle, chairman of the Board of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. They named the property Norias Plantation. In 1937 Edge sold his interests in Norias to Teagle and purchased the adjacent Sunny Hill Plantation, located in northern Florida near Thomasville, Georgia. Sunny Hill Plantation became Edge&#x27;s winter home where he hunted and fished on the grounds.

Edge also maintained homes in Maine and Washington, D.C.

Edge was a Presbyterian while young, becoming a member of the Pleasantville Presbyterian Church in 1889, but later was an Episcopalian.

Edge was an active supporter of the Boy Scout movement in Atlantic County. He was a founder of the Atlantic City Boy Scout Council, and was its first president, a position that he held for four years. In 1929 he donated money that the Council used to purchase Camp Edge, located in Alloway, New Jersey. Edge was also a member of numerous Atlantic City and Atlantic County civic, fraternal, social and business organizations, including the Atlantic City Hospital Association, the Atlantic City Country Club, the Atlantic City Elks Lodge, Trinity Lodge No. 79 and Masonic Belcher Lodge No. 180 of the Free and Accepted Masons, and the Atlantic County Historical Society.

==Miscellaneous==

In the 2000s, Edge&#x27;s name (as Wally Edge) and likeness had renewed currency as the pseudonym of a prominent anonymous New Jersey political columnist, who, in 2010, was identified as former Livingston Mayor David Wildstein, and who would later become involved in the Fort Lee lane closure scandal known as &quot;Bridgegate.&quot;

Geoff Pierson portrayed him in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.

<doc id="442306" wikidata="Q1678228" url="?curid=442306" title="Jafa">
<text>Jafa is a slang term (sometimes ) for a resident of Auckland, New Zealand. It is an acronym, standing for &quot;Just Another Fucking Aucklander&quot;. This prejudice against Aucklanders started to appear around the 1900s, when Premier Richard John Seddon referred to Aucklanders as &quot;Rangitoto Yanks,&quot; and is considered to be representative of the boorishness of Aucklanders, or the envy of the rest of New Zealand, depending on the perspective. The term is also misspelled as Jaffa, a chocolate confection from Dunedin, and is often used in sentences which render the original term useless in the grammatical sense. The term has wider currency than the earlier derogatory term &quot;Rangitoto Yank&quot;. A variant is Jaffa, &quot;Just Another Fuckwit From Auckland&quot;.

==Origins==

The word Jafa often conveys dislike for Aucklanders. While only a small part of New Zealand geographically, Auckland makes up % of the population of New Zealand, by far the largest city, and has greater economic power (mainly through the centralisation of many companies) than its population share would indicate.

Other factors in the use of the word:

*Auckland is alleged to dominate in national politics and society, a claim possibly somewhat overstated, as much of the political power is concentrated in Wellington, the country&#x27;s capital. In terms of society recognition, Wellingtonians are also more than twice as likely to be selected to receive Commonwealth honours such as those on the New Year&#x27;s Honour List.
*Auckland is alleged to receive more than its fair share of government funds, though often in the past, as in 2005, it &quot;received less than its share in terms of its proportion of total population&quot;, and a report in 1991 showed that out of $150 million in fuel taxes, only $84 million had come back to the Auckland Region in transport investment.
*Auckland is alleged to be a drain on the national economy. In fact, it is the main business centre in the country, but rural New Zealand produces the agricultural majority of the nation&#x27;s exports. Auckland produces around 35 percent of New Zealand&#x27;s GDP, however on a per-capita basis, it is fifth behind Taranaki, Wellington, Southland and Canterbury.
*Auckland is alleged to dominate the National Provincial Championship in rugby union in the 1980s and 90s, when Auckland won the championship in 15 out of 30 years and never lost in a final, holding the prestigious Ranfurly Shield trophy for a record 61 successful defences over 8 years.
*Auckland is alleged to be full of rude, greedy and arrogant people, having a similar reputation as Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Milan and Rome in Italy, Paris in France, London in the United Kingdom, New York City in the United States, Jakarta in Indonesia, or Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia.
*Auckland is alleged to be full of cars and especially SUVs (often referred to by detractors as &#x27;Remuera Tractors&#x27;, with Remuera being the stereotypical &#x27;rich people&#x27;s suburb&#x27;), and its drivers preferring them to other types of transportation, but Aucklanders use them less than the rural population.
*Auckland is alleged to be a culturally alien place due to the much higher proportion of non-Māori and nonwhite populations than the rest of the country. Percentage-wise, Auckland has the seventh largest ethnic Chinese population among all urban areas outside Greater China. In the 2006 census, Asians comprised 18.9% of Auckland&#x27;s population but only 7.9% in Christchurch, and 14.4% of Auckland&#x27;s but merely 2.8% of Christchurch&#x27;s population are Pacific Islanders. Most new immigrants to Auckland are from East Asia and South Asia, while people immigrating to other parts of the country show higher percentage rates of UK and South African origins. Auckland is finding itself increasingly marginalised on sports traditionally identified with New Zealand culture, such as rugby and netball, because of high immigrant numbers from countries with little tradition of such sports.
*Auckland is one of the few areas in New Zealand that has the traffic volumes associated with a major city. Most of New Zealand, including other cities, has a rural traffic pattern. This has given rise to the idea that &#x27;Auckland Drivers&#x27; are overly aggressive.

==Use in Auckland==

*In 1999 the Tourism Auckland organisation launched a &quot;Jafa&quot; advertising campaign.
*Aucklanders initially adopted the word ironically.
*&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, the main Northern North Island (encompassing Northland, Greater Auckland, and Waikato) daily newspaper, now sometimes uses &quot;Jafa&quot; as a nickname for Aucklanders without any hint of irony.
*This use of &quot;Jafa&quot; amongst Aucklanders, as a positive, self-referential term, has led to the reinterpretation of the acronym by some to mean Just Another Fabulous Aucklander.
*In 2004, mayor Dick Hubbard launched a free JafaCab service for the Auckland CBD, by driving a cab down Queen St. The occupants were Nicky Watson and Santa.
* From 2005 onwards, there have been some Aucklanders using this term with civic pride, as part of the general trend of rising self-confidence among the local residents identifying with the city.
*The term Jafa is also used in the name of an independent student-owned film / media group, Jafa TV Productions, run by students of the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology. It describes itself as &quot;an interactive hub where independent filmmakers network with other filmmakers freely and directly&quot;.

*Transit NZ also ran a similar road safety campaign running north from Hastings using the term &quot;JAFA&quot; as &quot;Just Another Fatal Accident&quot;
*In the name of an Auckland taxi company, &quot;Jafacabs&quot;

==Other uses==

It has been claimed in one 2007 tourist article that in the United Kingdom, the term JAFA has also come to stand for &quot;Just Another Fucking Australian&quot;, apparently in reference to the hard drinking and allegedly arrogant behaviour of many travelling Australians.

The acronym is also used, particularly by Australian Antarctic personnel, for &quot;Just Another Fucking Academic&quot;.

<doc id="442308" wikidata="Q206388" url="?curid=442308" title="Once Upon a Time in America">
<text>Once Upon a Time in America () is a 1984 epic crime film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone, and starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. The film is an Italian–American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hoods&quot;, it chronicles the lives of best friends David &quot;Noodles&quot; Aaronson and Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City&#x27;s world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, and broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.

It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third installment of Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time Trilogy&quot;, which includes &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) and &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes), and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone&#x27;s involvement.

The US edit was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes made. The original &quot;European cut&quot; has remained a critical favourite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest films of all time, especially in the gangster genre.

== Plot ==

In the 1930s, three thugs search for a man named &quot;Noodles&quot;. Noodles is drugging himself in an opium den with a newspaper next to him featuring the death of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls the police removing their corpses, one burnt beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city.

In 1918, David &quot;Noodles&quot; Aaronson leads a gang of him and his three friends &quot;Patsy&quot; Goldberg, &quot;Cockeye&quot; Stein and Dominic, performing jobs for local gangster Bugsy. They meet Max as he foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by corrupt police officer Whitey. Max joins their gang and they later blackmail Whitey and get the same police protection as Bugsy.

The gang becomes successful liquor smugglers. They deposit their earnings in a locker, giving the key to a friend of theirs, Moe. Noodles is in love with Moe&#x27;s sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer. Due to his socialization as a gangster, Deborah sees no future for their love. Bugsy, now a rival, ambushes the gang and fatally shoots Dominic. Noodles kills Bugsy and is sentenced to prison.

Upon his release a decade later, Noodles rejoins his gang. During a diamond heist they use jewellery employee Carol as their informant. She goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later becomes Max&#x27;s girlfriend. Noodles realizes that the heist was commissioned by a syndicate figure to eliminate competition. This leads to tensions between Max and Noodles, who seeks independence. The gang provides protection for Teamsters&#x27; union boss O&#x27;Donnell, during the course of which they exchange newborns at a clinic, punishing the head of the police whose wife has just given birth to a boy at that clinic. This results in the police withdrawing their actions against striking workers.

Noodles takes Deborah on a lavish date. When she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood, he snaps and rapes her. As she departs the next day, he attempts to catch a glance of her sitting on the train, but she avoids eye contact.

The repeal of Prohibition forces the gang to look for alternative activities. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem too risky. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max&#x27;s ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out. Upon regaining consciousness, Noodles learns that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police during the heist, as established at the beginning of the film. A guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. During his subsequent escape, he realizes the locker money has disappeared.

In the 1960s, Noodles returns to Manhattan for the first time since the 1930s after receiving a letter indicating that his identity has been uncovered, seeking to find out who is responsible. He learns that the bodies of his three friends have been relocated to Riverdale. He visits their mausoleum in Riverdale and finds a key to a railway locker.

The locker reveals a suitcase full of money, stated to be the advance on his next job. Noodles learns of the corruption scandals around Senator Christopher Bailey and visits Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and that Max opened fire first, wishing to die young. Noodles spots Deborah in a memorial photograph, who has become a major actress, and starts to suspect a connection between Deborah and Bailey. He tracks down Deborah and visits her, telling her about his invitation to a party at Bailey&#x27;s mansion and challenging her to tell him about the mysterious job as well as the identity of Bailey. Deborah admits to being Bailey&#x27;s lover and begs Noodles to leave the city before facing hurtful revelations. Ignoring her advice, Noodles leaves her after seeing Bailey&#x27;s son, who looks like the young Max.

Noodles meets Bailey, who turns out to be Max. Having faked his death, Max stole the gang&#x27;s money and reinvented himself as a self-made business man. He also made Deborah his mistress, thus robbing Noodles of everything he had. Faced with ruin due to the corruption scandal, Max reveals that he is behind the mysterious job, which is for Noodles to kill him. Noodles refuses. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck passes and a man, presumably Max, walks toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck&#x27;s auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.

== Interpretations ==
As the film begins and ends in 1933, with Noodles hiding in an opium den from syndicate hitmen, and the last shot of the film is of Noodles in a smiling, opium-soaked high, the film can be interpreted as having been a drug-induced dream, with Noodles remembering his past and envisioning the future. In an interview by Noël Simsolo published in 1987, Leone lent support to this interpretation, saying that the scenes set in the 1960s could be seen as an opium dream of Noodles&#x27;. In the DVD commentary for the film, film historian and critic Richard Schickel states that opium users often report vivid dreams, and that these visions have a tendency to explore the user&#x27;s past and future.

The ending in which Max appears as Noodles is leaving Bailey&#x27;s mansion and then suddenly disappears behind a truck only for Noodles to see the blades of the truck spinning, was reportedly left ambiguous on purpose. James Woods, who played Max, stated that he does not know if Max jumped in the truck or just disappeared. Critic Carlo Affatigato described this twist as a &quot;paradox&quot;, postulating that the whole film is about how Noodles spends the second half of his life seeking out the truth of what happened, only to discover it, not accept it, and not investigate what happens to Max in the end. Noodles only wants to believe the reality he has created for himself, not an objective one. Affatigato also believes this could point to it all being the imagination of Noodles.

Many people (including Schickel) assume that the 1968 Frisbee scene, which has an immediate cut and gives no further resolution, was part of a longer sequence. Ebert stated that the purpose of the flying disc scene was to establish the 1960s time frame and nothing more.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
During the mid-1960s, Sergio Leone had read the novel &quot;The Hoods&quot; by Harry Grey, a pseudonym for the former gangster-turned-informant whose real name was Harry Goldberg. In 1968, after shooting &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, Leone made many efforts to talk to Grey. Having enjoyed Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, Grey finally responded and agreed to meet with Leone at a Manhattan bar. Following that initial meeting, Leone met with Grey several times throughout the remainder of the 1960s and 1970s, having discussions with him to understand America through Grey&#x27;s point of view.

Intent on making another trilogy about America consisting of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, Leone turned down an offer from Paramount Pictures to direct &quot;The Godfather&quot; in order to pursue his pet project.

At some point Leone considered other colleagues including Miloš Forman and John Milius for the role of director, with him just serving as producer. For some time the project was linked to French producters André Génovès and Gérard Lebovici and later to Gaumont, with Gérard Depardieu and Jean Gabin supposed to be main actors.

Acquiring the rights to the novel proved to be complicated, as they had been bought by Dan Curtis, who intended to shoot the film and refused various offers by Leone and by his backers to sell the rights. Curtis eventually transferred the rights to Alberto Grimaldi, in exchange for Grimaldi&#x27;s production of his $2 million film &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;.

Initially, only a draft for the film&#x27;s opening scene was made, penned by Ernesto Gastaldi and developed by Robert Dillon, which Dillon eventually used in John Frankenheimer&#x27;s film &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead&quot;, much to Leone&#x27;s dismay. 
After Grimaldi bought the rights, he felt that he needed an American scriptwriter to faithfully capture the spirit of the novel; he eventually made a deal with Norman Mailer, whose draft greatly disappointed both Grimaldi and Leone, who later described Mailer&#x27;s draft as &#x27;a Mickey Mouse version [of the novel]&#x27; that lacked in structure and &#x27;made no sense at all&#x27;. A few elements of Norman Mailer&#x27;s first two drafts would eventually appear in the film.

After Mailer&#x27;s fiasco, Leone opted for an all-Italian team of scriptwriters: Leonardo Benvenuti and Piero De Bernardi would focus on the 1920s section, Enrico Medioli on the 1930s section, and Franco &quot;Kim&quot; Arcalli on the time shifts, with Leone supervising and Franco Ferrini polishing the script. As of 1975-6 Leone&#x27;s casting ideas still included Depardieu and Gabin, as well as Richard Dreyfuss as Max, James Cagney, Robert Charlebois, and appearances by Henry Fonda, James Stewart, George Raft and Glenn Ford. In 1976, Ennio Morricone had already composed all the main themes for the film. In the meanwhile relations between Grimaldi and Leone soured, with Grimaldi unconvinced of the film&#x27;s commercial viability and eventually exiting the project, being replaced in 1980 by Arnon Milchan. At this stage, Leone&#x27;s casting ideas included Tom Berenger, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman and Liza Minnelli. A 317 pages shooting script was completed in late 1981. The final script, translated in English by Stuart M. Kaminsky, was approved by Leone in May 1982.

=== Casting ===
In 1981, at Milchan&#x27;s suggestion, Leone met Robert De Niro and eventually offered him a role of his choice between Noodles and Max. De Niro&#x27;s commitment turned out to be crucial for Milchan&#x27;s securing the financial backing for the film.

For the role of Max, eventually played by James Woods, about 200 actors were auditioned. Elizabeth McGovern was chosen for the role of Deborah against De Niro&#x27;s request for having a New York native with a Brooklyn accent, due to Leone&#x27;s appreciation of her performance in &quot;Ragtime&quot;. Joe Pesci was chosen by Arnon Milchan because of his role in &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, and was offered a supporting role of his choice. Tuesday Weld was cast as Carol, a role that Leone had previously envisioned for Claudia Cardinale, at De Niro&#x27;s recommendation.

For the children&#x27;s roles, Leone entrusted the task to Cis Corman and asked him not to have child stars and instead to have actors who had lived in New York&#x27;s Jewish neighborhood and had no previous acting experience; in the end, Corman provided mostly actors without film credits but with experiences on stage and on television.

=== Filming ===
The filming of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; started in June 1982 and eventually ended in April the next year. The locations where the shooting took place were in and around US, Canada, Italy, and France, with a focal point in New York City. Interior scenes were mostly filmed at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome.

The beach scene, where Max unveils his plan to rob the Federal Reserve, was shot at The Don CeSar in St. Pete Beach, Florida. The New York&#x27;s railway &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; scene in the thirties flashbacks was filmed in the Gare du Nord in Paris. The interiors of the lavish restaurant where Noodles takes Deborah on their date were shot in the in Venice, Italy. Shooting in New York proved to be difficult, as the IATSE labor union raised a strong controversy over Leone&#x27;s use of a foreign crew, and launched such a massive public protest campaign that President Ronald Reagan called for a Department of Labour investigation into the matter.

De Niro shot his scenes in chronological continuity. His make-up as an old man required four to six hours of preparation. After a few weeks Nilo Jacoponi, Manlio Rocchetti and Gino Zamprioli replaced Christopher Tucker, whose make-up was considered excessive and unrealistic by Leone.

=== Editing ===
By the end of filming, Leone had ten hours worth of footage. With his editor, Nino Baragli, Leone trimmed this to almost six hours, and he originally wanted to release the film in two parts. The producers refused, partly because of the commercial and critical failure of Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s two-part &quot;1900&quot;, and Leone was forced to further shorten it. The film was originally 269 minutes (4 hours and 29 minutes), but when the film premiered out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Leone had cut it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes) to appease the distributors, which was the version shown in European cinemas.

=== Music ===
The musical score was composed by Leone&#x27;s longtime collaborator Ennio Morricone. &quot;Deborah&#x27;s Theme&quot; was written for a Franco Zeffirelli film but was rejected. The score is also notable for Morricone&#x27;s incorporation of the music of Gheorghe Zamfir, who plays a pan flute. Zamfir&#x27;s flute music was used to similar effect in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975). Morricone also collaborated with vocalist Edda Dell&#x27;Orso on the score.

Besides the original music, the film used source music, including:
* &quot;God Bless America&quot; (written by Irving Berlin, performed by Kate Smith – 1943) – Plays over the opening credits from a radio in Eve&#x27;s bedroom and briefly at the film&#x27;s ending.
* &quot;Yesterday&quot; (written by Lennon–McCartney – 1965) – A Muzak version of this piece plays when Noodles first returns to New York in 1968, examining himself in a train station mirror. An instrumental version of the song also plays briefly during the dialogue scene between Noodles and &quot;Bailey&quot; towards the end of the film.
* &quot;Summertime&quot; (written by George Gershwin – 1935) An instrumental version of the aria from the opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; is playing softly in the background as Noodles, just before leaving, explains to &quot;Secretary Bailey&quot; why he could never kill his friend.
* &quot;Amapola&quot; (written by Joseph Lacalle, American lyrics by Albert Gamse – 1923) – Originally an opera piece, several instrumental versions of this song were played during the film; a jazzy version, which was played on the gramophone danced to by young Deborah in 1918; a similar version played by Fat Moe&#x27;s jazz band in the speakeasy in 1930; and a string version, during Noodles&#x27; date with Deborah. Both versions are available on the soundtrack.
* Part of the third theme from the overture to &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (Gioachino Rossini – 1817) – Used during the baby-switching scene in the hospital.
* &quot;Night and Day&quot; (written and sung by Cole Porter – 1932) – Played by a jazz band during the beach scene before the beachgoers receive word of Prohibition&#x27;s repeal, and during the party at the house of &quot;Secretary Bailey&quot; in 1968.
* &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot; is used during the Prohibition &quot;funeral&quot; at the gang&#x27;s speakeasy.

A soundtrack album was released in 1984 by Mercury Records. This was followed by a special-edition release in 1995, featuring four additional tracks.


== Release ==
&quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 1984. It received a 15-minute standing ovation after the screening. In the United States, a heavily edited version of the film received a wide release in 894 theaters on June 1, 1984, and grossed $2.4 million during its opening weekend. It ended its box office run with a gross of just over $5.3 million on a $30 million budget, and became a box office bomb.

Numerous women at the film&#x27;s premiere reacted furiously, mostly due to the two rape sequences. One among them later confronted Robert De Niro in a press conference and made harsh comments to the film&#x27;s depiction, describing it as &quot;blatant, gratuitous violence&quot;. In general, the rape scenes specifically were controversial. Richard Godden defended Leone&#x27;s representation of rape, saying that it &quot;articulates the dysfunction between bodies in images and bodies themselves&quot;. Of the scene in which De Niro&#x27;s character rapes her character, Elizabeth McGovern said it &quot;didn&#x27;t glamorize violent sex: it is extremely uncomfortable to watch and it is meant to be&quot;. She went on to state:
In his book, Leone scholar Christopher Frayling argues that the movie&#x27;s central gang are all emotionally stunted: &quot;like small boys obsessed with their equipment who have no idea how to relate to flesh-and-blood women&quot;.

=== Versions ===
==== US version ====
The film was shown in limited release and for film critics in North America, where it was slightly trimmed to secure an &quot;R&quot; rating. Cuts were made to two rape scenes and some of the more graphic violence at the beginning. Noodles&#x27; meeting with Bailey in 1968 was also excised. The film gained a mediocre reception at several sneak premieres in North America. Because of this early audience reaction, the fear of its length, its graphic violence, and the inability of theaters to have multiple showings in one day, The Ladd Company cut entire scenes and removed approximately 90 minutes of the film, without the supervision of Sergio Leone.

This American wide release (1984, 139 minutes) was drastically different from the European release, as the non-chronological story was rearranged into chronological order. Other major cuts involved many of the childhood sequences, making the adult 1933 sections more prominent. Noodles&#x27; 1968 meeting with Deborah was excised, and the scene with Bailey ends with him shooting himself (with the sound of a gunshot off screen) rather than the garbage truck conclusion of the 229-minute version. Sergio Leone&#x27;s daughter, Raffaella Leone, said that Leone had dismissed the US version as not his own movie.

==== USSR ====
In the Soviet Union, the film was shown theatrically in the late 1980s, with other Hollywood blockbusters such as the two &quot;King Kong&quot; films. The story was rearranged in chronological order and the film was split in two, with the two parts shown as separate movies, one containing the childhood scenes and the other comprising the adulthood scenes. Despite the rearranging, no major scene deletions were made.

==== Restored original ====

In March 2011, it was announced that Leone&#x27;s original 269-minute version was to be re-created by a film lab in Italy under the supervision of Leone&#x27;s children, who had acquired the Italian distribution rights, and the film&#x27;s original sound editor, Fausto Ancillai, for a premiere in 2012 at either the Cannes Film Festival or Venice Film Festival.

The restored film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, but because of unforeseen rights issues for the deleted scenes, the restoration had a runtime of only 251 minutes. However, Martin Scorsese (whose Film Foundation helped with the restoration) stated that he was helping Leone&#x27;s children gain the rights to the final 24 minutes of deleted scenes to create a complete restoration of Leone&#x27;s envisaged 269-minute version. On August 3, 2012, it was reported that after the premiere at Cannes, the restored film was pulled from circulation, pending further restoration work.

==== Home media ====
In North America, a two-tape VHS was released by Warner Home Video with a runtime of 226 minutes in February 1985 and 1991. The U.S. theatrical cut was also released at the same time in February 1985. A two-disc special edition was released on June 10, 2003, featuring the 229-minute version of the film. This special edition was re-released on January 11, 2011, on both DVD and Blu-ray. On September 30, 2014, Warner Bros. released a two-disc Blu-ray and DVD set of the 251-minute restoration shown at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, dubbed the &quot;Extended Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. This version was previously released in Italy, on September 4, 2012.

== Critical reception ==
The initial critical response to &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; was mixed, because of the different versions released worldwide. While internationally the film was well received in its original form, American critics were much more dissatisfied with the 139-minute version released in North America. This condensed version was a critical and financial disaster, and many American critics who knew of Leone&#x27;s original cut attacked the short version.

Some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas, saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. In his 1984 review, Roger Ebert gave the uncut version four stars out of four and wrote that it was &quot;an epic poem of violence and greed&quot;, but described the American theatrical version as a &quot;travesty&quot;. Furthermore, he gave the American theatrical version one star out of four, calling it &quot;an incomprehensible mess without texture, timing, mood, or sense&quot;. Ebert&#x27;s television film critic partner Gene Siskel considered the uncut version to be the best film of 1984 and the shortened, linear studio version to be the worst film of 1984. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the nonlinear narrative that is structured throughout the film.

It was only after Leone&#x27;s death and the subsequent restoration of the original version that critics began to give it the kind of praise displayed at its original Cannes showing. The uncut original film is considered to be far superior to the edited version released in the U.S. in 1984. Ebert, in his review of Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, called the original uncut version of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; the best film depicting the Prohibition era. James Woods, who considers it to be Leone&#x27;s finest film, mentioned in the DVD documentary that one critic dubbed the film the worst of 1984, only to see the original cut years later and call it the best of the 1980s. Some were critical towards the movie&#x27;s graphic violence and cruelty, with Donald Clarke of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; condemning it as a &quot;fistful of misogyny&quot; and &quot;offensively sexist&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; has an approval rating of 86% based on 56 reviews, with an average score of 8.60/10. The website&#x27;s critic consensus reads: &quot;Sergio Leone&#x27;s epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting, and filled with great performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and James Woods.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film has since been ranked as one of the best films of the gangster genre. In &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, critic Adam Smith compared the film favourably to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, saying: &quot;Leone&#x27;s film is arguably the better of the two – if the less popular – eschewing, as it does, the soapy melodramatics of Coppola&#x27;s family saga in favour of less audience-friendly, but more intriguing, ambiguity and symbolism.&quot;

When &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; asked several UK critics in 2002 what their favorite films of the last 25 years were, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; placed at number 10. In 2015, the film was ranked at number nine on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s list of the 50 best gangster films of all time, while in 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited it as the fourth greatest mobster film ever made. In 2023, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked it seventh in its list of the greatest gangster movies of all time.

=== Accolades ===
Unlike its modern critical success, the initial American release did not fare well with critics and received no Academy Award nominations. The film&#x27;s music was disqualified from Oscar consideration for a technicality, as the studio accidentally omitted the composer&#x27;s name from the opening credits when trimming its running time for the American release.
