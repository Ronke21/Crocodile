<text>Euthyphro (; ; c. 399–395 BC), by Plato, is a Socratic dialogue whose events occur in the weeks before the trial of Socrates (399 BC), between Socrates and Euthyphro. The dialogue covers subjects such as the meaning of piety and justice. As is common with Plato&#x27;s earliest dialogues, it ends in aporia.

In this dialogue, Socrates meets Euthyphro at the porch of the archon basileus (the &#x27;king magistrate&#x27;) at that time. Socrates tells him that he is preparing to go to court against the charges of Meletus on the grounds of impiety. Euthyphro tells Socrates that he is going to court himself to prosecute his father for binding a worker in chains and leaving him to die. This has granted him the ire of his own family who believe his father was in the right. The worker had killed a fellow worker, which they believe exempts his father from liability for leaving him bound in the ditch to starve to death. Since Euthyphro seems assured of himself, Socrates asks him to define piety. His help will clarify Socrates&#x27; case in the courtroom. If Socrates is asked to define piety, he can simply rely on Euthyphro&#x27;s definition. This however leads to the main dilemma of the dialogue when the two cannot come to a satisfactory conclusion. Is something pious because the gods approve of it? Or do the gods approve of it because it is pious? This aporic ending has led to one of the longest theological and meta-ethical debates in history.

==Characters==
*Socrates, the Athenian philosopher. He questions the nature of piety in this dialogue.
*Euthyphro, the Athenian prophet. His father owned land on the island of Naxos. His father&#x27;s harsh treatment of a paid servant (a thetes under the Solonian Constitution) leads to Euthyphro raising charges against him. According to his own statements in this dialogue, his claims to prophecy and divination were considered a joke to other Athenians. He attempts to provide Socrates with a definition of piety but none are sufficient. It is entirely possible as well that Euthyphro was created by Plato as a literary device. His name in ancient Greek is ironically &quot;straight thinker&quot; or &quot;Mr. Right-mind.&quot; A combination of εὐθύς (euthys), which means straight or direct and φρονέω (phroneô) which means to think or to reason. If Euthyphro and his father were historical people then this places the murder charges brought by Euthyphro and the main actions of this dialogue sometime between 405 BC and 399 BC, when the Athenian settlers were expelled from the Island of Naxos after the defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami.

==Background==
The dialogue in &quot;Euthyphro&quot; occurs near the court of the &quot;archon basileus&quot; (king magistrate), where Socrates and Euthyphro encounter each other; each man is present at the court for the preliminary hearings to possible trials (2a).

Euthyphro has come to present charges of murder against his own father who, after arresting one of his workers (Thetes) for killing a slave from the family estate on Naxos Island, tied him and threw him in a ditch where he died of exposure to the elements (3e–4d) while Euthyphro&#x27;s father waited to hear from the exegetes (&quot;cf.&quot; Laws 759d) about how to proceed. Socrates is astonished by Euthyphro&#x27;s confidence in being able to prosecute his own father for the serious charge of manslaughter, despite the fact that Athenian Law allows only relatives of the dead man to file suit for murder (Dem. 43 §57). Euthyphro dismisses the astonishment of Socrates, which confirms his overconfidence in his own critical judgment of religious and ethical matters.

In an example of Socratic irony, Socrates says that Euthyphro obviously has a clear understanding of what is pious or holy (τὸ ὅσιον &quot;to hosion&quot;) and impious or unholy (τὸ ἀνόσιον &quot;to anosion&quot;). Because he is facing a formal charge of impiety, Socrates expresses the hope to learn from Euthyphro, all the better to defend himself in the trial, as he himself is being accused of religious transgressions.

Euthyphro says that what lies behind the charge of impiety presented against Socrates, by Meletus and the others, is Socrates&#x27; claim that he is subjected to a &quot;daimon&quot; (divine sign), which warns him of various courses of action (3b). From the perspective of some Athenians, Socrates expressed skepticism of the accounts about the Greek gods, which he and Euthyphro briefly discuss, before proceeding to the main argument of their dialogue: the definition of &quot;piety&quot;. Moreover, Socrates further expresses critical reservations about such divine accounts that emphasize the cruelty and inconsistent behaviour of the Greek gods, such as the castration of the early sky-god Uranus, by his son Cronus; a story Socrates said is difficult to accept (6a–6c).

After claiming to know and be able to tell more astonishing divine stories, Euthyphro spends little time and effort defending the conventional Greek view of the gods. Instead, he is led to the true task at hand, as Socrates forces him to confront his ignorance by pressing Euthyphro for a definition of &quot;piety&quot;; yet, Socrates finds flaw with each definition of &quot;piety&quot; proposed by Euthyphro (6d ff.).

At the dialogue&#x27;s conclusion, Euthyphro is compelled to admit that each of his definitions of &quot;piety&quot; has failed, but, rather than correct his faulty logic, he says that it is time for him to leave, and excuses himself from their dialogue. To that end, Socrates concludes the dialogue with Socratic irony: Since Euthyphro was unable to define &quot;piety&quot;, Euthyphro has failed to teach Socrates about piety. Therefore, from his dialogue with Euthyphro, Socrates received nothing helpful to his defense against a formal charge of impiety (15c ff.).

It is easier to understand Socrates&#x27; arguments in this dialogue if the reader keeps in mind that Athenian religion revolved around specific rituals and practices with no reference to sacred scripture, at least in the same sense as later Abrahamic religions. Priests might worship only one specific god while not paying respect to the others. Euthyphro uses Zeus as evidence for his notions of piety while disregarding Uranus and Cronus, for example.

==The argument==

Socrates asks Euthyphro to offer him a definition of piety or holiness. The purpose of establishing a clear definition is to provide a basis for Euthyphro to teach Socrates the answer to the question: &quot;What is piety?&quot; Ostensibly, the purpose of the dialogue is to provide Socrates with a definitive meaning of &quot;piety&quot;, with which he can defend against the charge of impiety in the pending trial.

Socrates seeks a definition of &quot;piety&quot; that is a universal (universally true), against which all actions can be measured to determine whether or not the actions are pious. To be universal, the definition of &quot;piety&quot; must express the &#x27;essence&#x27; () of the thing defined (piety), a clear and unambiguous standard to which each particular instance of piety will conform.

==The dialogue==
Ostensibly in order to better defend himself in an upcoming trial for being an impious citizen of Athens, Socrates asks Euthyphro for a clear definition of &quot;piety&quot; (holiness); he offers Socrates four definitions.
===First definition===
Euthyphro&#x27;s first definition of piety is what he is doing now, that is, prosecuting his father for manslaughter (5d). Socrates rejects Euthyphro&#x27;s definition, because it is not a definition of piety, and is only an &quot;example&quot; of piety, and does not provide the essential characteristic that makes pious actions pious.

===Second definition===
Euthyphro&#x27;s second definition: Piety is what is &quot;pleasing&quot; to the gods. (6e–7a) Socrates applauds this definition, because it is expressed in a general form, but criticizes it saying that the gods disagree among themselves as to what is pleasing. This means that a given action, disputed by the gods, would be both pious and impious at the same time – a logical impossibility. Euthyphro argues against Socrates&#x27; criticism, by noting that not even the gods would disagree, among themselves, that someone who kills without justification should be punished. Yet Socrates argues that disputes would still arise – over just how much justification actually existed; hence, the same action could be pious and impious; again, Euthyphro&#x27;s definition cannot be a definition of &quot;piety&quot;.

===Third definition===
To overcome Socrates&#x27; objection to his second definition of piety, Euthyphro amends his definition. (9e)

Euthyphro&#x27;s third definition of piety is: &quot;What &quot;all&quot; the gods love is pious, and what they &quot;all&quot; hate is impious.&quot; In reply, Socrates poses the question that would eventually become known in philosophy as the Euthyphro dilemma: &quot;Is the pious loved by the gods &quot;because&quot; it is pious? Or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?&quot;. Euthyphro seems unsure as to what the question means and so Socrates applies a dialectic technique: an analogy, to clarify his question (10a). He persuades Euthyphro to agree that when we call a thing &quot;carried&quot;, it is simply because it is being carried by someone and not because it possesses an inherent characteristic, which could be called &quot;carried&quot;. That is, &quot;being carried&quot; is not an essential trait of the thing being carried but a condition, a state that the object is currently in. He then moves to what we call &quot;beloved&quot; (φιλούμενόν &quot;filoumenon&quot;). Is something &quot;beloved&quot; in and of itself (like being big or red), or does it become beloved &quot;when&quot; it is loved by someone? Clearly, the answer is again the latter, something &quot;becomes&quot; beloved when it is loved. So then, continues Socrates, something beloved by the gods (θεοφιλές &quot;theofiles&quot;) becomes so &quot;because&quot; it is loved by them, to which Euthyphro agrees and Socrates moves to the conclusion that reveals his contradiction: What is beloved by the gods cannot be pious. Euthyphro seems to be taken aback so Socrates reminds him the definitions he gave previously (10e). He had said that something is loved by the gods &quot;because&quot; it is pious, which means that their love follows &quot;from&quot; something inherent in the pious. And yet they just agreed that what is beloved is put in that state as a result of being loved. So piety cannot belong to what is beloved by the gods since according to Euthyphro it does not acquire its characteristics by something (the act of being loved) but has them a priori, in contrast to the things that are beloved that are put in this state through the very act of being loved. It seems therefore that Euthyphro&#x27;s third argument is flawed.

At that juncture of their dialogue, Euthyphro does not understand what makes his definition of &quot;piety&quot; a circular argument; he agrees with Socrates that the gods like an action because it is pious. Socrates then argues that the unanimous approval of the gods is merely an attribute of &quot;piety&quot;, that divine approval is not a defining characteristic of &quot;piety&quot;. That divine approval does not define the essence of &quot;piety&quot;, does not define what is &quot;piety&quot;, does not give an idea of &quot;piety&quot;; therefore, divine approval is not a universal definition of &quot;piety&quot;.

;Linguistic note
Socrates&#x27; argument is convoluted not only because of its structure but because of the language used, and is said to have &quot;reduced translators to babble and driven commentators to despair&quot;. The text presents the argument through a distinction between the active and the passive voice, as for example when Socrates asks about the difference between a &quot;carried thing&quot; (φερόμενον) and &quot;being carried&quot; (φέρεται), both using the word &quot;carried&quot; in the English translation.

===Fourth definition===
In the second half of the dialogue, Socrates suggests a definition of &quot;piety&quot;, which is that &quot;piety is a part of justice&quot;, but he leads up to that definition with some other observations and questions, starting with:

... Are you not compelled to think that all that is pious is just?

Yet, Socrates later says that the information provided in his question to Euthyphro is insufficient for a clear definition of &quot;piety&quot;, because piety belongs to those actions we call just, that is, morally good; however, there are actions, other than pious actions, which we call just (12d); for example, bravery and concern for others. Piety is only a portion of Justice and is not sufficient in giving a clear view of justice. Socrates gives a comparison to even numbers. If a definition of even numbers were provided it would not be suitable to clarify what numbers are because it is only a group of numbers and not the entire thing as a whole. Socrates asks: What is it that makes piety different from other actions that we call just? We cannot say something is true, because we believe it to be true. We must find proof.

===Euthyphro&#x27;s response===
In response, Euthyphro says that piety is concerned with looking after the gods (12e), but Socrates objects, saying that &quot;looking after&quot;, if used in its ordinary sense (with which Euthyphro agrees) would imply that when one performs an act of piety one thus makes one of the gods better – an example of hubris, a dangerous human emotion frowned upon by the Greek gods. (13c) In turn, Euthyphro responds that &quot;looking after&quot; involves service to others, and Socrates asks: What is the end product of piety? Euthyphro replies with his earlier (third) definition, that: Piety is what is loved by all the gods. (14b).

===Final definition===
Euthyphro then proposes a fifth definition: &quot;Piety is an art of sacrifice and prayer&quot;. He proposes the notion of piety as a form of knowledge, of how to do exchange: Giving gifts to the gods, and asking favours in return. (14e) Socrates presses Euthyphro to say what benefit the gods perceive from human gifts – warning him that &quot;knowledge of exchange&quot; is a type of commerce. (14e) Euthyphro objects that the gifts are not a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, between man and deity, but are gifts of &quot;honour, esteem, and favour&quot;, from man to deity. (15a) In other words, Euthyphro admits that piety is intimately bound to the likes of the gods. The dialogue has come full circle, and Euthyphro leaves Socrates without a clear definition of &quot;piety&quot; as he faces a trial for impiety (ἀσέβεια &quot;asebeia&quot;).

==History==
Fragments of this dialogue exist on a papyrus from the 2nd century. The oldest surviving medieval manuscript was made in 895 by Arethas of Caesarea and copied by Johannes Calligraphus.

This dialogue is notable for containing one of the few surviving fragments of the poet Stasinus, a relative of Homer and author of the lost work &quot;Cypria&quot;. Socrates quotes him to show his disagreement with the poet&#x27;s notion that fear and reverence are linked. The quoted excerpt is as follows: &quot;Of Zeus, the author and creator of all these things,/ You will not tell: for where there is fear there is also reverence.&quot;

==Reception==
In the early 3rd century BC, the Epicurean Metrodorus of Lampsacus wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;Against the Euthyphro&quot; which is now lost. This is the oldest literary criticism of this dialogue in the ancient world.

Diogenes Laertius listed the dialogue as belonging to the first tetralogy in the 1st century BC. He considered it one of the &quot;tentative&quot; dialogues and gave &quot;On Holiness&quot; as an alternate title. He also mentioned that some teachers used it as the first dialogue in their courses meaning that it was in antiquity seen as the most suitable introduction to Plato&#x27;s works. He also claimed that after the events of this dialogue, Euthyphro was persuaded not to prosecute his father though that is not supported by any of Plato&#x27;s own writings.

In the surviving fragment of &quot;On Plato&#x27;s Secret Doctrines&quot; by Numenius of Apamea he suggests that the character of &quot;Euthyphro&quot; was entirely fictitious and represented the Athenian popular religion. He reasoned that Plato had to criticize the Athenian religion in dialogue form rather than directly attacking it in order to avoid being executed like Socrates himself.

In the &quot;Anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy&quot; it is stated that the &quot;Euthyphro&quot; was Plato&#x27;s first dialogue.

The dialogue returned to obscurity in the Latin speaking scholarly world until it was rediscovered in the Renaissance age. The dialogue was translated into Armenian in the 11th century. The Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras owned a copy of the &quot;Euthyphro.&quot; Francesco Filelfo completed the first Latin translation in 1436. Rinuccio da Castiglione completed a second translation a short time later in 1440 though it is considered of lower quality. Marsilio Ficino completed a third in 1484 in Florence in his translated collection of Plato&#x27;s dialogues. The first edition of the Greek text appeared in Venice in September 1513 by Aldo Manuzio under an edition published by Markos Musuros.

The influential Plato translator Friedrich Schleiermacher did not appreciate this dialogue. He saw it as &quot;a very inferior work compared to &quot;Laches&quot; and &quot;Charmides.&quot; Olof Gigon likewise rated it poorly in the 20th century. He felt the dialogue relied too heavily on word games and semantics.

Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff approved of the dialogue for separating piety from divine command theory. Michael Erler praised the dialogue for showing reflection on logical and grammatical issues.

One criticism of this dialogue that was raised by Peter Geach is that the dilemma implies you must search for a definition that fits piety rather than work backwards by deciding pious acts (i.e. you must know what piety is before you can list acts which are pious). It also implies something cannot be pious if it is only intended to serve the gods without actually fulfilling any useful purpose.

<text>Cal Henrik Max Magnus Norman (born July 30, 1973) is a Swedish artist, painter, and sculptor.

Norman was born in Sundsvall, Medelpad, he currently resides in Prague. He paints visions and dreamlike images as accurately as possible, which results in paintings with a photorealistic quality. His works are intended to spread virally among social networks on the Internet; his art and stunts often deal with everyday events spiced up with a touch of the absurd.

A few examples of such works created for the Internet are the illustrated essay &quot;The LED (minor) Artcrime Tutorial&quot; and the &quot;Moose graffiti&quot; stunt, where the artist sneaks up on a wild moose and paints graffiti on it. His sculpture and plastic arts projects have received some exposure in Sweden, such as his art project that consisted of a woodpecker placed on a traffic camera on the E4 near Stockvik.
In another of Max Magnus Norman&#x27;s art projects the artist created an unknown (but huge) number of plastic monkeys, about 1 metres in length. One night in early May 2009 he put up these monkeys in different settings all over the small city Sundsvall. One monkey was riding a crocodile in the middle of the central stream Selångersån and one was placed upon a traffic light making it look like the monkey controlled the traffic, some monkeys were even placed under water. A few of these monkeys still remain, amongst other one flying 20 metres up in the air, holding a beer can above the intersection Köpmangatan-Thulegatan.

In 2008, a statue of his, &quot;Kuken ska ha sitt,&quot; which includes a 30 cm. long penis, caused some local outcry which was noticed by the Swedish press: the &quot;obscene sculpture&quot; drew notice and commentary from the two largest Swedish papers, Aftonbladet and Expressen. As it happened, Norman&#x27;s sculpture coincided with a few other &quot;phallic&quot; Swedish works of art that year, including a full-frontal nude Jesus; the fact that Norman&#x27;s sculpture was provided with a warning for the young enhanced its reputation, as well as that of the artist.

== Alchemy ==

In 2014 Max Magnus Norman published the book &quot;Magnum Opus Part 1&quot; (2014, ) where he claims he unsought managed to create the philosopher&#x27;s stone. The book, written in Swedish, is built up as a manual on how to reach spiritual and physical enlightenment, thought it only covers a few physical and meditative exercises, layered with self biographical anecdotes.

<doc id="427814" wikidata="Q3359613" url="?curid=427814" title="Council of State (Denmark)">
<text>The Council of State (, , ) is the privy council of the Kingdom of Denmark. The body of advisors to the Danish monarch, the council is a formal institution, with largely ceremonial functions. Chaired by the monarch, the council comprises all cabinet ministers and the crown prince or princess when coming of age. When unavailable, the monarch is represented by the regent or Lord Protector ().

In its beginnings, the council was a place of debate amongst the ministers over government policy. However, since the formation of real political parties at the beginning of the 20th century, these debates were moved from the council to informal ministerial meetings where government policy could be coordinated – usually held every Wednesday. As a result, the primary function of the council today is to grant royal assent, which is done by the counter-signatures of the monarch and a minister. Before granting the assent, a relevant minister explains the general aim of the bill brought before the council. According to section 22 of the Danish constitution, a bill must be granted assent within thirty days of its passing by parliament, at the latest, for it to become an Act. In urgent cases, or if a passed law will be in conflict with this time limit if only signed at the next scheduled council meeting, the responsible minister for the law is also allowed to visit the royal institution at a separate meeting ahead of the scheduled council meeting, and ask for royal assent. The monarch cannot be held responsible for any granted assent.

Besides enacting parliamentary bills, as a rule all government bills also have to have formal approval by the monarch and a minister before introduction to parliament. Approval is also given by the council to all of the monarch&#x27;s official actions as head of state.

Council protocols are secret. Although being a formal part of the legal enactment procedure in Denmark, the royal assent is nowadays only a formality, as the Danish monarch does not directly participate in formal decision-making and is obliged to sign all passed laws at the monthly called Statsråd meetings. 

Unlike its British and Canadian counterparts, membership of the council does not carry along with it an entitlement to a special title or form of address.

==The Council and the Constitution==
Section 17 of the Danish constitution () in broad terms set the rules for the council. Section 18 of the constitution which allows for ministers to hold council meetings without the monarch, a so-called Council of Ministers, is no longer in effect.

Section 17&lt;br&gt;
(1) The body of Ministers shall form the Council
of State, in which the Heir to the Throne shall
have a seat when of age. The Council of State
shall be presided over by the King except in the
instance mentioned in section 8, and in instances
where the legislature in pursuance of section 9
may have delegated the conduct of government
to the Council of State.&lt;br&gt;
(2) All Bills and important government measures shall be discussed in the Council of State.

==From Council Presidium to Prime Minister&#x27;s Office==
From 1848 to 1918 the person in charge of the Council’s presidium () wore the title of President of the Council () and was the de facto prime minister. In 1918 the presidium had formed into a regular cabinet office and was transformed into what today is known as the Ministry of the State of Denmark ().

The office consists of the Prime Minister, a secretariat to the Prime Minister and a department headed by a permanent secretary of state. Besides being the office of the PM, it is also the ministry for the press and Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

<text>John Wentworth Jr. (July 17, 1745 – January 10, 1787) was a Founding Father of the United States and a lawyer who served as a New Hampshire delegate to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Articles of Confederation.

==Biography==
Wentworth was born to Judge John Wentworth in Somersworth, New Hampshire, in 1745, and was a descendant of Elder William Wentworth. He graduated from Harvard in 1768 before studying law. He moved to Dover, New Hampshire, where he started his practice. Governor John Wentworth, his cousin, appointed him the probate register for Strafford County, and he held that post until his death.

Wentworth was active in the various revolutionary committees, and was elected to the convention (later the State Assembly) from Dover every year from 1776 to 1780. He was a member of the state council, supporting Meshech Weare, from 1780 to 1784, and was a member of the New Hampshire Committee of Safety. That committee operated as the revolutionary government when the Assembly was not in session.

In 1778 and 1779, he was selected as one of the delegates to the Continental Congress. His term of service gave him the chance to sign the Articles of Confederation when the Congress passed that plan to unify the colonies. As the state established a more stable government, he was elected to the New Hampshire Senate from 1784 to 1786. He died in Dover and is buried in the Pine Hill Cemetery there.

<doc id="427819" wikidata="Q1758272" url="?curid=427819" title="Pyroclastic surge">
<text>A pyroclastic surge is a fluidised mass of turbulent gas and rock fragments that is ejected during some volcanic eruptions. It is similar to a pyroclastic flow but it has a lower density or contains a much higher ratio of gas to rock, which makes it more turbulent and allows it to rise over ridges and hills rather than always travel downhill as pyroclastic flows do.

The speed of pyroclastic density currents has been measured directly via photography only in the case of Mount St. Helens, where they reached 320-470 km/h, or . Estimates of other modern eruptions are around 360 km/h, or 100 m/s (225 mph). Pyroclastic flows may generate surges. For example, the city of Saint-Pierre in Martinique in 1902 was overcome by one. Pyroclastic surge include 3 types, which are base surge, ash-cloud surge, and ground surge.

== Base surge ==

Base surges were first recognized after the Taal Volcano eruption of 1965 in the Philippines, where a visiting volcanologist from USGS recognized the phenomenon as congruent to base surge in nuclear explosions. Very similar to the ground-hugging blasts associated with nuclear explosions, these surges are expanding rings of a turbulent mixture of fragments and gas that surge outward at the base of explosion columns. Base surges are more likely generated by the interaction of magma and water or phreatomagmatic eruptions. They develop from the interaction of magma (often basaltic) and water to form thin wedge-shaped deposits characteristic of maars.

== Ash-cloud surge ==
These are the most devastating. They form thin deposits, but travel at great speed (10–100 m/s) carrying abundant debris such as trees, rocks, bricks, tiles, etc. They are so powerful that they often blast and erode material (like sandblasting). They are possibly produced when conditions in an eruption column are close to the boundary conditions separating convection from collapse. That is, switching rapidly from one condition to the other.

== Ground surge ==
These deposits are often found at the base of pyroclastic flows. They are thinly bedded, laminated and often cross-bedded. Typically they are about 1 m. thick and consist mostly of lithic and crystal fragments (fine ash elutriated away). They appear to form from the flow itself, but the mechanism is not clear. One possibility is that the head of the flow expands through entrainment of air (which is then heated). This then results in the flow front surging forward, which is then over-run by the rest of the flow.

<doc id="427820" wikidata="Q7531145" url="?curid=427820" title="Sister Machine Gun">
<text>Sister Machine Gun is an American industrial rock band originally based in Chicago, Illinois.

Sister Machine Gun was formed in New York City by Chris Randall and Guilherme Machado. After a short hiatus, the band signed with Wax Trax! Records and released their debut album, &quot;Sins of the Flesh&quot;, in 1992. The band went through several lineup changes over the years, with their sound evolving throughout their career. After leaving Wax Trax! Records, they moved to Randall&#x27;s own label, Positron! Records. In 2007, the band disbanded, and Randall pursued a solo career. However, Sister Machine Gun returned in 2015 with a new album &quot;The Future Unformed&quot;, released on WTII Records.

==History==

===The early years===

Sister Machine Gun was formed by Chris Randall and Guilherme Machado in New York City. They performed at New Jersey&#x27;s Pipeline, and New York&#x27;s Limelight. The band went on a short hiatus after Chris Randall joined KMFDM&#x27;s tour as a stage technician. After the tour, Randall left New York City and relocated to Chicago. He then found work in the mailroom of Wax Trax! Records, and began recording a demo with Jim Marcus and Van Christie of Die Warzau. The rough demo was given to Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM for mixing. Konietzko passed the demo along to Jim Nash, head of Wax Trax! Records, where Randall worked. The label then signed the band to a record deal.

===The Wax Trax! years===
Sister Machine Gun&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sins of the Flesh&quot; was released on Wax Trax! in 1992. During this time, Chris Randall assembled a group of musicians to tour in support of the album. Tom Gaul and Steve Stoll joined the band, alongside Chris Kelly and Randall. Stoll left the band after this tour, and work on the next album began.

&quot;The Torture Technique&quot; was released in 1994. Tom Gaul left midway through the recording process, after contributing to the album. New members were recruited for the upcoming tour. Guitarist Greg Lucas (later a member of Final Cut) joined, as well as drummer Scott Churilla (later a member of The Reverend Horton Heat&#x27;s band). Sister Machine Gun went on to join the Angstfest tour with KMFDM and Chemlab.

After this tour, Kelly left the band. Prior to the recording of &quot;Burn&quot;, Sister Machine Gun went on another tour. The lineup during this time consisted of Randall, bassist Bob Jones, drummer Tom DeSalvo (former member of Chemlab), and Chris Smits on guitar.

The band then began work on the album &quot;Burn&quot;. Guitarist Geno Lenardo (of Filter) joined in the studio. &quot;Burn&quot; was released in 1995. The album peaked at #9 on the CMJ Radio Top 200. The title track became one of the band&#x27;s most recognizable songs, as it later appeared on the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; soundtrack.

The tour line-up at this time consisted of Randall, bassist Richard Deacon, and drummer Kevin Temple (formerly of Die Warzau and later Apartment 26). This line up remained mostly consistent throughout the touring for &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot;, with guitarists Pat Sprawl and Brian Sarche joining at various times.

The final Sister Machine Gun album on Wax Trax!, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, was released in 1997. The album spent more than 14 weeks on the CMJ Radio Top 200 chart, peaking at #7. Reeves Gabrels did guitar work on the album.

===The Positron! years===
After 1997&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; album, Sister Machine Gun left Wax Trax. The rest of the band&#x27;s material was released on Randall&#x27;s Positron! Records, the record label he founded and operates with his wife, Lisa. The band&#x27;s sound changed considerably after their move to the new label.

In 2007, Sister Machine Gun officially disbanded and Randall began a solo career.

===New material (2015)===
On November 5, 2014, a Facebook page for Sister Machine Gun was launched, along with a teaser image announcing the project&#x27;s return in early 2015 on WTII Records. This image was also shared on Randall&#x27;s personal Facebook account with the caption, &quot;Remember that thing I said I&#x27;d never do again? Yeah. I&#x27;m doing it. Spring &#x27;15 on WTII Records.&quot;

On March 13, 2015, the band released &quot;The Future Unformed&quot;.

==Primary member history==
Guilherme Machado joined Randall in Chicago for the recording of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sins of the Flesh&quot;. After recording some guitar parts, Machado left the band. After the completion of the album, Chris Kelly joined the band. After Kelly&#x27;s departure in 1995, Randall continued the band primarily as a solo project. Miguel Turanzas joined the band in 1999, and continued as a member until it was disbanded in 2007.

<text>Mary Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Taylor Bliss Dandridge ( Taylor; April 20, 1824 – July 25, 1909) was the youngest of the three surviving daughters of President Zachary Taylor and Margaret Smith.

In 1848, after her father was elected president, Mary Elizabeth married William Wallace Smith Bliss, an army officer who had served with her father. Taylor appointed William Bliss as Presidential Secretary. At the age of 24, Mary Elizabeth Bliss served as First Lady during her father&#x27;s presidency, as her mother declined the social role.

==Early life and education==
Betty Taylor was born the youngest of five daughters (two of whom died before she was born) of Peggy and Zachary Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, then on the frontier. She also had a younger brother, Dick Taylor. She and her siblings grew up alternately at their plantation in Louisville and U.S. Army forts, where her father, a career Army officer, was often in command. Her mother mostly taught the children at home, sometimes with the help of tutors or young army officers. In the late 1820s, the family moved to a plantation near Baton Rouge, as her father was purchasing land in the area.

In the early 1830s, the family was with Taylor at Fort Crawford as he waged the Black Hawk War. Later they returned to Baton Rouge, when he went to territorial Florida for the Second Seminole War and then to Texas.

==Marriage and political career==
On December 5, 1848, Betty married William Wallace Smith Bliss, an army officer who had served with her father.

Zachary Taylor was elected to the presidency in 1848, and was inaugurated in 1849. He appointed William Bliss as his Presidential Secretary.

As President Taylor&#x27;s wife declined the role, Betty Bliss – addressed as &quot;Miss Betty&quot; – served as First Lady for her father during official White House functions. She and her husband were excited about their roles in Washington, D.C.

In many respects, it was Betty Bliss who assumed responsibility for the family&#x27;s primary interaction with the general public. The President&#x27;s daughter was the public hostess of the Administration. At the Inaugural Ball, following the Russian Minister&#x27;s wife in red silk and diamonds, &quot;Miss Betty&quot; appeared in a simple white dress with a white flower in her hair, and her naturalness became her trademark. She presided over all public functions in the White House as the official hostess of the Taylor Administration. The public face of the Taylor women duo, Betty Bliss even had a popular dance song written in her honor.

On July 9, 1850, the Taylor presidency ended prematurely with Zachary Taylor&#x27;s death. Betty and her husband accompanied her widowed mother Peggy Taylor to Pascagoula, Mississippi, where Mrs. Taylor lived with another married daughter until her death two years later. The following year, William Bliss died of yellow fever contracted in New Orleans, leaving Mrs. Bliss a widow at 29.

On February 11, 1858, Betty married again, to Philip Pendleton Dandridge (1817–1881). She died on July 25, 1909, at 85, and was buried at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Winchester, Virginia. She was the last surviving child of Zachary Taylor.

<text>The Hydroscaphidae are a small family of water beetles known commonly as skiff beetles. As of 2010, there are 23 species in the family. Several are recently described.

These beetles are small, most under in length. They are tan to brown in color and the elytra are abbreviated, leaving several tapering tergites of the abdomen exposed. The wings are fringed with long setae. The larvae are fusiform, with a wide thorax and a narrowing abdomen.

Hydroscaphidae live on mats of algae with a thin layer of running water. This may be the accumulated algae lining the very edge of a stream of water. They tolerate a wide range of temperatures; they have been observed in hot springs and in icy snowmelt. The algae are their food source.

The reproductive cycle is not well known. In at least one species, the female lays a single large egg on the algal mat.

Hydroscaphid species have been reported from every continent except Antarctica.

Genera:

* &quot;Hydroscapha&quot; – United States and Europe.
* &quot;Scaphydra&quot; – Brazil.
* &quot;Yara&quot; – South America and Central America.
*&quot;Confossa&quot; – South America

<doc id="427833" wikidata="Q947588" url="?curid=427833" title="Jack Wrangler">
<text>John Robert Stillman (July 11, 1946 – April 7, 2009), billed professionally as Jack Wrangler, was an American gay pornographic film actor, theatrical producer, director, and writer. He performed in both gay and straight films.

Open about his homosexuality and adult film work throughout his career, Wrangler was an icon of the gay-liberation movement. The 2008 feature-length documentary &quot;&quot; examines his life and career.

==Early life==
Wrangler was born John Robert Stillman in Beverly Hills, California. His father was Hollywood film and television producer Robert Thurston Stillman, who produced such films as &quot;Champion&quot;, &quot;Second Chorus&quot;, and &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; and produced television series such as &quot;Boots and Saddles&quot;, &quot;Rawhide,&quot; and &quot;Bonanza.&quot; His mother, Ruth Clark Stillman, was a former dancer in Busby Berkeley musicals.

Stillman began his acting career at the age of nine in the television series &quot;The Faith of Our Children&quot; (1953–1955). The series, which starred Eleanor Powell, was a syndicated religious family show that won five local Emmy Awards.

He became aware of his homosexuality when he was 10 years old.

Stillman graduated in 1968 with a degree in theater from the College of Speech at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.

==Career==

===Adult film ===
Despite his good looks and acting skills, Stillman found only limited early work in Los Angeles, California, and New York City on the stage and as a model and dancer. One of his first roles was in Douglas Dean Goodman&#x27;s play &quot;Special Friends&quot;, one of the first gay-themed plays by a gay playwright to be performed in San Francisco, California. He played a former prostitute from Arkansas who becomes a bad go-go dancer in California, in a role which required extensive nudity. He finally settled in New York City and found work as a bartender and go-go dancer.

In 1970, he made his first appearance in a male strip show, using the name &quot;Jack Wrangler.&quot; (The pseudonymous last name was taken from the label on his Wrangler-brand work shirt.)

Wrangler was approached to appear in gay pornographic films by Magnum Studios, the pioneering gay adult film studio and magazine publisher, after studio heads saw a poster for &quot;Special Friends&quot; featuring him semi-nude. His first gay porn film was 1970&#x27;s &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; (also known as &quot;Eyes of a Gay Stranger&quot;; Magnum Studios), one of the first hard-core gay adult films to be released commercially in the United States. Wrangler performed in gay pornographic films for several reasons. First he saw them as culturally subversive and politically liberating:
At the time we were all trying to find out who the hell we were as individuals, what we wanted specifically on our own terms, who we wanted to be, what our potentials were, what our differences were, what made us unique… And I think that&#x27;s why the XXX-rated films were important, because it was like, Oh, my God, there are other people who like the same things as me, like leather, or being blown on a pool table. [Laughs] It was a start—literally stripping ourselves naked and trying to begin from there.Second, he &quot;wasn&#x27;t comfortable in his own skin&quot; and wanted some adventure in his life.

During his adult-film career, Wrangler appeared in 47 films. Among his more notable gay films were &quot;Kansas City Trucking Co.&quot;, &quot;Hot House&quot;, &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, and &quot;A Night at the Adonis&quot;.

In 1978, Wrangler made the move to heterosexual adult film, making his debut in &quot;China Sisters&quot; which included his first sexual encounter with a woman on film. &quot;China Sisters&quot; featured a plot involving two women who seduce a gay man and turn him straight. Wrangler told Terry Gross of NPR that the film crew knew he was gay and cheered him on while he lost his heterosexual virginity. He quickly made a number of well-known and popular straight-adult films, including &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, &quot;Roommates&quot;, and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones 2.&quot; He was a favorite of director Chuck Vincent, the critically acclaimed, openly gay director of some of the top straight-adult films of the 1970s and 1980s. Vincent&#x27;s films subvert straight porn&#x27;s traditional focus on the female body by focusing on Wrangler&#x27;s body and fixing the viewer&#x27;s eye on the male (rather than female) sexual experience.

As Wrangler, he became an icon of the gay-liberation movement. His popularity as a gay-porn star was so great that &quot;Jack Wrangler&quot; was prominently mentioned in playwright Doric Wilson&#x27;s 1984 play, &quot;Forever After.&quot;

===Theatre===
As Wrangler was achieving fame as one of the first iconic gay-porn stars, his acting career also blossomed. He co-starred alongside playwright and actor Robert Patrick in Patrick&#x27;s 1979 play &quot;T-Shirts&quot; at The Glines theater in New York City. In 1985, Wrangler wrote the book for the musical &quot;I Love You, Jimmy Valentine&quot; – which starred Whiting. In the mid-1980s, he appeared in the play &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, a comedy about a gay man whose lover has died of AIDS.

By this time Wrangler&#x27;s adult-film career was tapering off. He published his autobiography, &quot;The Jack Wrangler Story, or What&#x27;s a Nice Boy Like You Doing?&quot;, in 1984. But Whiting demanded that he give up his porn career and live erotic shows. In 1986 at the age of 40, he appeared in his final adult picture, a straight porn film titled &quot;Rising Star&quot; (Caballero Home Video).

Wrangler turned his attention to Whiting&#x27;s career and cabaret. He became a board member of the Johnny Mercer Foundation after its founding in 1982, and worked to promote Mercer&#x27;s music. He wrote and produced a 1985 cabaret show for Whiting which featured Mercer&#x27;s music, and in 1996 co-wrote and produced &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: The Jazz Concert&quot; (inspired by the Mercer music used in the film, &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;). A year later, he helped conceive the 1997 Broadway revue &quot;Dream&quot;, which starred Whiting and contained many Mercer songs. Wrangler conceived the idea of a ballet based on Mercer&#x27;s 1946 musical &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot;, which was performed by the Dance Theater of Harlem in 2003. Wrangler was also a promoter of the cabaret singer Carol Woods, writing and producing several shows for her between 1984 and 2001. Wrangler also wrote, directed, or produced a number of other plays, musicals and revues, including &quot;The Valentine Touch&quot;, &quot;The First Lady and Other Stories of Our Times&quot;, and &quot;Irina Abroad!&quot;

Wrangler authored a column on health and fitness, &quot;Wrangler&#x27;s Weights and Measures&quot;, for the short-lived, gay-lifestyle magazine &quot;Au Contraire&quot; in 1979.

==Personal life==
Wrangler was a virgin to heterosexual sex until college. In 1976, Wrangler met singer Margaret Whiting, 22 years his senior, in a nightclub; Wrangler later recalled: &quot;I was with my manager when I looked over at Margaret, who was surrounded by five guys in a booth. There she was with the hair, the furs and the big gestures. I thought, &#x27;Boy, now that&#x27;s New York! That&#x27;s glamour!&#x27; I had to meet her.&quot; Their romance began a few weeks later.

The couple was strongly criticized for the relationship, and Wrangler was accused of &quot;turning straight&quot; and entering the relationship simply for money. However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. &quot;I&#x27;m not bisexual and I&#x27;m not straight&quot;, Wrangler later said. &quot;I&#x27;m gay, but I could never live a gay lifestyle, because I&#x27;m much too competitive. When I was with a guy I would always want to be better than him: what we were accomplishing, what we were wearing—anything. With a woman you compete like crazy, but coming from different points of view, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, that was doable.&quot;

Nonetheless, the early years of their relationship were difficult, as Whiting and Wrangler struggled with the latter&#x27;s homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, &quot;Only around the edges, dear.&quot; Wrangler explained in an interview: &quot;When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that&#x27;s it. I went to her one night and said, I&#x27;m never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I&#x27;m good at that - very good at that, in fact.&quot; The couple was married from 1994 until his death.

In 1980, Wrangler, his step-grandmother, and his manager were attacked, pistol-whipped, and tied up by six burglars at his step-grandmother&#x27;s home in Bel Air, California. The robbers made off with more than $250,000 in furs and cash.

In 1998, Wrangler and Whiting filed a $3 million lawsuit against New York City when the 74-year-old Whiting tripped on loose pavement and broke her hip. Their suit claimed $2 million in damages for her injuries and $1 million for loss of conjugal relations.

In 2008, a feature-length documentary film about Wrangler, &quot;&quot;, premiered at Newfest and received the GayVN Award. It was produced and directed by Jeffrey Schwarz of Automat Pictures, and is distributed by TLA Releasing.

Wrangler died on April 7, 2009, at the age of 62 from complications from emphysema.

<text>Alexander Theodore Callinicos (born 24 July 1950) is a Rhodesian-born British political theorist and activist. An adherent of Trotskyism, he is a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and serves as its International Secretary. Between 2009 and 2020 he was the editor of &quot;International Socialism&quot;, the SWP&#x27;s theoretical journal, and has published a number of books.

==Biography==
===Early life===

He became involved in revolutionary politics as a student at Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied for a BA and came to know Christopher Hitchens, then himself active in the International Socialists (the SWP&#x27;s forerunner). He also received his DPhil at Oxford. The earliest writing by Callinicos for the International Socialists was an analysis of the student movement of the period. His other early writings focused on southern Africa and the French structuralist-Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser. In 1977, Callinicos married Joanna Seddon, a fellow Oxford doctoral student.

===Career and activism===
Callinicos participated in the Counter-Summit to the IMF/World Bank Meeting in Prague, September 2000 and the demonstration against the G8 in Genoa, June 2001. He has also been involved in organising the Social Forum movement in Europe. He was a contributor to &quot;Dictionnaire Marx Contemporain&quot; (2001), and has written articles in &quot;New Left Review&quot;.

He was Professor of Politics at the University of York before being appointed Professor of European Studies at King&#x27;s College London in September 2005. He succeeded Chris Harman as editor of &quot;International Socialism&quot; in January 2010 shortly after Harman died and is a British correspondent for &quot;Actuel Marx&quot;. Callinicos joined the central committee of the SWP in the late 1970s; he retains this position.

Callinicos was a critic of the humanitarian interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo, arguing that they were conducted solely to promote the global capitalist expansion. He has described Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine as &quot;an ongoing battle between imperialist rivals, driving forward by capitalist competition&quot;. He has argued against Western efforts to provide arms for Ukraine.

In January 2013, in the context of a serious crisis inside the UK Socialist Workers Party (SWP) associated with the party&#x27;s response to an allegation of rape against a leading member of the party, known as Comrade Delta, and with the demand for changes to the existing form of the system of democratic centralism within the SWP, he wrote a defence of Leninism and democratic centralism. Callinicos disagreed with those who argued for the need to change the existing system. He called the allegation of rape a &quot;difficult disciplinary case&quot;, a comment for which socialist feminist Laurie Penny thought he &quot;[mistook] a plea for some basic respect for women&#x27;s sexual autonomy as an attempt to undermine the revolution from within.&quot;

Callinicos took a prominent position on another issue which had divided the Socialist Workers Party (SWP): the use of the Internet in disagreements about confidential party issues. He complained about &quot;the dark side of the Internet&quot; in which individuals have &quot;used blogs and social media to launch a campaign within the SWP&quot;.

In order to disentangle a conference organised by the &quot;Historical Materialism&quot; journal in Delhi during 2013 from the SWP crisis, his invitation to the conference was withdrawn in March 2013.

<text>The Pontiac Solstice is a convertible sports car that was produced by Pontiac from 2005 to 2010. Introduced at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, the Solstice roadster began production in Wilmington, Delaware, starting in mid-2005 for the 2006 model year. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 2.4 L I4 engine, producing and of torque.

The exterior styling of the production Solstice is similar to that of the 2002 Solstice concept that preceded it. Production of the Solstice was to be running before summer 2005, but delays at the Wilmington plant pushed volume production to the fourth quarter. The new hardtop targa top 2009 model was announced in mid-2008. The Solstice uses the GM Kappa platform, which also underpins the Saturn Sky, Opel GT, and Daewoo G2X. It was the brand&#x27;s first two-seater since the Pontiac Fiero was discontinued in 1988. 

The Solstice was nominated for the &quot;North American Car of the Year&quot; award and &quot;Design of the Year&quot; award from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) for 2006. It was a runaway hit for Pontiac, with 7,000 orders in the first 10 days of availability and 6,000 more orders before winter. Although first-year production was planned at 7,000, GM apologized to customers for delays and increased production, delivering 10,000 by March 1. 
Following the 2008 economic recession, GM discontinued the Pontiac division. Production ended with the closure of the Wilmington Assembly plant in July 2009.

==GXP (2007–2009)==
The &quot;GXP&quot; version of the Solstice debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. Although heavier than the base model, it made much more power and torque with a new 2.0 liter (121.9 cu in) I4 Ecotec engine equipped with a dual-scroll turbocharger. The engine&#x27;s output is and . This is the highest specific output of any engine by cubic inches in the history of General Motors at 2.1 hp (1.6 kW) per cubic inch, and it is the first gasoline direct injection engine from an American automaker. According to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, the GXP targa accelerates from 0 to in 5.2 seconds, while the soft top GXP did so in 5.6 seconds.

Other GXP features include standard Stabilitrak traction control, a limited-slip differential, and anti-lock brakes. Summer tires on 18-inch wheels are standard. An available dealer installed option from 2008 onwards was a modified computer tune and two new sensors that resulted in an increased output to and on manual transmission models and and on automatic transmission models, further enhancing the performance of the GXP model.

== Solstice coupe (2009–2010) ==
A targa coupe version of the Solstice was unveiled at the 2008 New York Auto Show. Engine choices were the same as the convertible versions. The roof can be removed, but the hard roof cannot be fitted into the trunk. An optional cloth top was available, which can be fitted into the trunk.

The car went on sale in early 2009. The Pontiac Solstice coupes are considered to be quite rare: There were a total of 1,266 Solstice coupes that were able to be manufactured before the production line in Wilmington, Delaware, was shut down: 102 pre-production 2009 models, 1,152 sequential vin regular production 2009 models, and 12 pre-production 2010 models. This is in contrast to over 64,000 of the Pontiac Solstice convertibles that were manufactured.

==2010 production==
Starting in April 2009 the Wilmington, DE. plant was business as usual and pre-production builds began for the 2010 model year. Between April 21, 2009 and May 28, 2009 thirty 2010 model year VIN-coded cars were built on the Kappa platform. Of those, were 12 Pontiac Solstice Coupes and 8 Pontiac Solstice roadsters. Of the other remaining, 8 were Saturn SKYs and 2 were Opel GTs. They were then used as GM company vehicles to be evaluated and also as special event display vehicles. These vehicles were built to the 2010 model year specs with 2010 model year changes and had legal 2010 VINs. Following the end of use term within the GM fleet, the vehicles were sent to auction. After these 30 2010 models, more 2009-spec Solstices were produced and were the last ones made at the plant.

==Shared technology==
The sharing of technology and various components is a common practice among automakers, resulting in reduced parts costs. The Solstice shares major components with nearly every GM division:
* The rear axle and differential are from the Sigma-based Cadillac CTS
* The interior storage bin is from the Cadillac XLR
* The passenger side front airbag, steering column, and exterior and interior door handles are from the Chevrolet Cobalt
* The backup lights are from the GMC Envoy
* The heating, ventilating, and air conditioning modules are from the Hummer H3
* The front fog lamp assembly is from the Pontiac Grand Prix
* The steering wheel is also featured in the Pontiac G5, Chevrolet Corvette, Chevrolet Cobalt
* The 2.4 L Ecotec engine is shared with the Pontiac G6, Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet Malibu, and Chevrolet HHR
* The five-speed manual transmission is the same as in the Hummer H3, GMC Canyon, and Chevrolet Colorado
* The five-speed automatic is identical to those of the Cadillac CTS, STS, and SRX
* The seat frames are from the previous generation Opel Corsa

==Discontinuation==
In April 2009, after GM announced the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand by the end of 2010, CEO Fritz Henderson stated that the Solstice would not continue under another GM brand. Although they considered selling the Wilmington plant and the Solstice/Sky products to an outside business, the Wilmington assembly plant closed in July 2009. In October 2009, the new DeLorean Motor Company expressed interest in continuing production of the Solstice, going so far as to release concept artwork for a 2011 DeLorean Solstice. These plans were shelved shortly thereafter, when Fisker Automotive instead acquired the Wilmington Assembly where the Solstice was produced.

<doc id="427855" wikidata="Q7042996" url="?curid=427855" title="No. 155 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 155 Squadron RAF is a former Royal Air Force squadron.

==History==
===First World War===

No.155 Squadron was formed at RAF Chingford on 14 September 1918 as a bomber unit with Airco DH.9As after an earlier decision to form at RAF Feltham was abandoned. The war ended a few weeks later and the Squadron disbanded on 7 December 1918 as it had not yet become operational.

===Second World War===

On 1 April 1942, No.155 reformed at RAF Peshawar as a squadron but did not receive its first Curtiss Mohawk IVs until mid-August owing to the necessity to modify these aircraft for operational use. Air defense and convoy patrols began in September off Madras and in October the squadron moved to Bengal and detachments began operating over Burma. Reconnaissance, ground attack and bomber escort missions occupied the squadron until January 1944, when it finally replaced its Mohawks with Supermarine Spitfires. Initially these were used for air defense duties until the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service in Burma ceased to be a threat. Ground attack missions and escort for transport missions then became its main tasks, the Spitfires carrying 500-lb bombs during the last months of the campaign. In mid-September 1945, the squadron flew to Singapore soon after the Japanese surrender and in February 1946, moved to Sumatra to provide tactical support for the British Army units there until disbanded on 31 August 1946.

<text>Fahreta Živojinović (; ; born 20 October 1960), known by her stage name Lepa Brena (), is a Yugoslav singer, actress, and businesswoman. With around 40 million sold records, she is regarded as the commercially most successful recording artist from the former Yugoslavia. Brena is also often credited with creating the turbo-folk genre with her first two albums &quot;Čačak, Čačak&quot; (1982) and &quot;Mile voli disko&quot; (1982).

Lepa Brena grew up in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but has lived in Belgrade, Serbia since 1980, where she started her career. Lepa Brena is considered to be a symbol of the former Yugoslavia, due to the fact that she was one of the last popular acts to emerge before the breakup of the country. She has described herself as being &quot;Yugo-nostalgic&quot;. Along with her husband, Slobodan Živojinović and friend, Saša Popović, Brena co-founded and co-owned Grand Production, the biggest record label and production company in the Balkans. In 2019, they decided to sell Grand Production for €30 million.

==Early life==
Born into a Muslim family in the outskirts of Tuzla, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, she grew up in Brčko as the youngest child of Abid Jahić ( – 22 October 2010) and Ifeta (; 15 April 1934 – 21 November 2014) alongside her sister Faketa and brother Faruk. Both of her parents are originally from villages near Srebrenik; her father was born in Ježinac and her maternal family hailed from Ćehaje. At the start of the Bosnian War in 1992, her sister Faketa emigrated to Canada, where she lives today, while Brena stayed in Belgrade where she had been living since 1980.

Her first performance for an audience was in the fifth grade at a local festival, singing a Kemal Monteno song named &quot;Sviraj mi o njoj&quot;. She later reflected, &quot;It was the only time in my life that I&#x27;ve ever experienced stage fright.&quot; Afterwards, she started performing regularly at dance parties in Brčko.

While a guest on a Croatian television show in March 2014, she was asked if she had been ashamed of having a Muslim background, to which she replied: &quot;Why would I be ashamed? I was and stay what I am. Today I am Fahreta. I am proud of my parents and roots&quot;. She said of her stage name, that &quot;Brena&quot; was given to her by her basketball coach Vlado, while the epithet &quot;Lepa&quot; () was given to her by showman Minimaks.

==Career==

===1980–1983: Slatki Greh and career beginnings===
In early 1980, at the age of 19, Fahreta began singing with a band called Lira Show when the group&#x27;s original singer Spasa left the band because her husband, a boxer, did not want his wife to be a singer. Saša Popović, the band&#x27;s frontman, was initially opposed to the idea that Fahreta should be the band&#x27;s new singer, but later changed his opinion. She subsequently moved to Novi Sad and then to Belgrade. Brena&#x27;s first performance with Lira Show occurred on 6 April 1980 in the hotel Turist in Bačka Palanka. Lira Show changed their name to Slatki Greh (&quot;Sweet Sin&quot;) in 1981. Brena and Slatki Greh premiered their first studio album, &quot;Čačak, Čačak&quot;, on 3 February 1982. The album was written mostly by Milutin Popović-Zahar, and the career-manager was Vladimir Cvetković.

Since her career began in 1980, she has become arguably the most popular singer of the former Yugoslavia, and a top-selling female recording artist with more than 40 million records sold.
The same year Lepa Brena and Slatki Greh appeared in the first part of Yugoslav classic comedy film &quot;A Tight Spot&quot; with popular comedian Nikola Simić and actress Ružica Sokić, which raised their status and brought them almost instant fame. They would again team up with songwriter Milutin Popović-Zahar for their second studio album &quot;Mile voli disko&quot; (&quot;Mile Loves Disco&quot;), released 18 November 1982. In addition to the title song, the album had a couple of other hit songs: &quot;Duge noge&quot; (&quot;Long Legs&quot;) and &quot;Dama iz Londona&quot; (&quot;London Lady&quot;).

In 1983, Lepa Brena and Slatki Greh ended their collaboration with Milutin Popović-Zahar and Vladimir Cvetković. That same year Lepa Brena and Slatki Greh participated in &quot;Jugovizija&quot;, the Yugoslav selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song &quot;Sitnije, Cile, sitnije&quot;. The song was released on an extended play of the same name, along with another song. Their appearance on &quot;Jugovizija&quot; caused controversy, since the competition was traditionally dominated exclusively by pop artists, and Lepa Brena belonged to a drastically different music genre, which was folk-pop, or also called &quot;novokomponovana muzika&quot;. Although they did not qualify for the prestigious European competition, Lepa Brena and Slatki Greh gained even more popularity.

===1984–1990: &quot;Bato, Bato&quot; and &quot;Hajde da se volimo&quot;===
1984 saw Brena and her band begin a cooperation with a new manager and producer, Raka Đokić. &quot;Bato, Bato&quot; (&quot;Brother, Brother&quot;), their third album, was released the same year. A new provocative image was accompanied by a new musical style, different from the one fostered by Popović. Later that year, they held a concert in neighboring Romania, at the stadium in Timișoara to an audience of 65 000, what was at time among the most successful concerts of a Yugoslav musician outside their home country.

Lepa Brena established a cooperation with Serbian folk star Miroslav Ilić and recorded a collaborative extended play &quot;Jedan dan života&quot; (&quot;One Day of Life&quot;, 1985), which featured four songs, including a romantic duet called &quot;Jedan dan života&quot;, and the song &quot;Živela Jugoslavija&quot; (&quot;Long Live Yugoslavia&quot;), which was received with a mixed response. The latter song was in line with Brena&#x27;s only official political stance: an uncompromising support of a united Yugoslavia, with her becoming a symbol of this view.

Their next three albums—&quot;Pile moje&quot; (&quot;My Little One&quot;, 1984), &quot;Voli me, voli&quot; (&quot;Love Me, Love&quot;, 1986) and &quot;Uske pantalone&quot; (&quot;Tight Trousers&quot;, 1986)—would propel her to the throne of the Yugoslav music scene. By the end of 1986, Lepa Brena had become the star of Belgrade social jet-set, and the most popular public figure in Yugoslavia.

Brena&#x27;s manager Raka Đokić came up with the idea that her seventh studio album should be followed by a film in which she would play the lead role. This idea was successfully implemented in 1987 when the motion picture &quot;Hajde da se volimo&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Love Each Other&quot;) was filmed. The film shared the name with the album. Many then-popular Yugoslav actors co-starred in the film, including Dragomir &quot;Gidra&quot; Bojanić, Milutin &quot;Mima&quot; Karadžić, Velimir &quot;Bata&quot; Živojinović, Milan Štrljić, etc. 

Based on the success of the original, &quot;Hajde da se volimo: Još jednom&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Love Each Other: Again)&quot; got produced and premiered in 1989&quot;.&quot; On the premiere of the film, Brena met her now husband, Slobodan Živojinović. The movie was followed by the album &quot;Četiri godine&quot; (&quot;Four Years&quot;). It was released on 1 October 1989, and contained the song &quot;Jugoslovenka&quot; (&quot;Yugoslav Woman&quot;) with Montenegrin vocalist Danijel Popović, Croatian vocalist Vlado Kalember and Bosnian vocalist Alen Islamović. The music video for the pop song &quot;Čuvala me mama&quot; (&quot;Mum Protected Me&quot;) was filmed on the Croatian island Lopud.

After even more success, &quot;Hajde da se volimo: Udaje se Lepa Brena&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Love Each Other: Lepa Brena Is Getting Married)&quot; got released, making it a trilogy. It was followed by the studio album &quot;Boli me uvo za sve&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Care About Anything&quot;). &quot;Boli me uvo za sve&quot; also had multiple hit songs including &quot;Čik pogodi&quot; (&quot;Take a Guess&quot;), &quot;Biće belaja&quot; (&quot;There Will Be Trouble&quot;), &quot;Tamba lamba&quot;, and the title track. 

Lepa Brena and Slatki Greh held more than 350 concerts yearly, and would often hold two concerts in one day. They set a record by holding thirty-one concerts consecutively at Dom Sindikata, and seventeen concerts consecutively at the Sava Centar. On 24 July 1990, Brena landed with a helicopter at Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia, Bulgaria, and held a concert with an audience of 122 000 people. While she was in Bulgaria in July 1990, she met with the Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.

===1991–1999: &quot;Ja nemam drugi dom&quot; and Grand Production===

Brena and Slatki Greh released their second-to-last album together, &quot;Zaljubiška&quot; ( &quot;Lovelysh&quot;), in 1991.

In December 1993, after two-year hiatus, Brena premiered her first solo album &quot;Ja nemam drugi dom&quot; (&quot;I Have No Other Home&quot;), and held a famous &quot;concert in the rain&quot; on 13 June 1994 at Belgrade&#x27;s Tašmajdan Sports Centre which was attended by 35 000 people. After that, she recorded two more solo albums: &quot;Kazna Božija&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Punishment&quot;, 1994) and &quot;Luda za tobom&quot; (&quot;Crazy Over You&quot;, 1996). In the mid-90s she had many popular songs; 

* &quot;Kazna Božija&quot;
* &quot;Luda za tobom&quot;
* &quot;Sve mi dobro ide osim ljubavi&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Good at Everything But Love&quot;)
* &quot;Izdajice&quot; (&quot;Traitor)&quot;
* &quot;Moj se dragi Englez pravi&quot; (&quot;My Man&#x27;s Acting an Englishman&quot;)
* &quot;I da odem iza leđa bogu&quot; (&quot;Even If I Go Behind God&#x27;s Back&quot;)
* &quot;Ja nemam drugi dom&quot;
* &quot;Dva dana&quot; (&quot;Two Days&quot;)
* &quot;Ti si moj greh&quot; (&quot;You Are My Sin&quot;), among others.

The music video for &quot;Ti si moj greh&quot; had an ancient Egyptian theme, with Brena dressed as a pharaoh.

Brena became co-founder of the Serbian record label Grand Production in December 1998.

===2000–2016: &quot;Pomračenje sunca&quot;, hiatus===
After her marriage in 1991, when she briefly moved to the United States, she ceased cooperation with Slatki Greh. However, in 2000 they recorded another album together &quot;Pomračenje sunca&quot; (&quot;Solar Eclipse&quot;), their last album to date. After eight years of absence from the music business, Lepa Brena returned with &quot;Uđi slobodno...&quot; (&quot;Feel Free to Enter...&quot;, 2008) and &quot;Začarani krug&quot; (&quot;Vicious Circle&quot;, 2011). Both albums were major successes.

Beginning in 2012, Brena started recording sessions for two studio albums. The first, &quot;Izvorne i novokomponovane narodne pesme&quot; (&quot;Original and Newly Composed Folk Songs&quot;) was released in December 2013. She dedicated the album to her ailing mother Ifeta, who sang folk songs to her when she was a child. Ifeta died the following year.

In the month after that album&#x27;s release, Brena premiered two other songs: &quot;Ljubav čuvam za kraj&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Keeping Love For the End&quot;) on 28 December 2013 and &quot;Zaljubljeni veruju u sve&quot; (&quot;Those in Love Believe in Everything&quot;), with lyrics written by Hari Varešanović, on 12 January 2014.

On 19 December 2013, Brena, along with Dragana Mirković, Severina, Jelena Rozga, Haris Džinović, Aca Lukas and Jelena Karleuša, was a guest at a humanitarian concert by Goran Bregović at the Zetra Olympic Hall in the Bosnian capital city Sarajevo for the Roma in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Brena arrived in Sarajevo two days before the concert so that she could enjoy the city with friends before the concert. She said in an interview: &quot;Sarajevo has suffered and survived so much, I&#x27;m really glad to see positive people and happiness in this city&quot;.

Lepa Brena and Steven Seagal were the stars of Belgrade 2016 New Year party, an event held at Nikola Pašić Square in front of the Serbian National Assembly, and attended by 60 000 people.

=== 2017–2022: Comeback, World Tour, Lady B ===
In December 2017, Brena published two new songs &quot;Zar je važno da l&#x27; se peva ili pjeva&quot; (&quot;Does It Matter Whether It&#x27;s Sung&quot; (in Ijekavian) &quot;or Sung&quot; (in Ekavian)) and &quot;Boliš i ne prolaziš&quot; (&quot;You Hurt and You Don&#x27;t Heal&quot;) as teasers for her new album.

In support of her new album, she organised a world tour. The tour Zar je važno da l&#x27; se peva ili pjeva... World Tour started on 11 November 2017 in Vienna, Austria, at the Lugner City.

During the first European leg of her world tour, her album &quot;Zar je važno dal se peva ili pjeva&quot; was released on 1 March 2018, and it became a major hit in the Balkans.

After four legs of her World Tour, she announced a break because she wanted to be in Serbia, when her stepson Filip Živojinović and his wife Aleksandra Prijović get a baby.

Two months after the pause, she continued the World Tour. A year after, she postponed all of her Tour concerts because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The tour ended on 28 October 2022 in Cleveland.

One month afterwards, she teased her new socks brand, Lady B. She stated that it&#x27;s a &quot;brand for a woman from the 21st century&quot;. It went for sale a few weeks later, with sales growing more and more.

=== 2023–2024: Aleksandra Prijović concerts, BiH tour ===
Brena and Senidah were part of the first Red Bull SoundClash in Belgrade. They performed together in June.

On 30 September, Brena was a guest at Aleksandra Prijović&#x27;s second concert in Štark Arena. Their emotional moments together went viral on social media, and Aleksandra thanked Brena for treating her as her own child.

Brena performed with Aleksandra again, but this time with Jelena Rozga on 3 December in Arena Zagreb. Before the concert, she announced that she would be having a concert there, too, in December the next year. The tickets sold under 24 hours, and as for today there are four concerts announced there.

In 2024, she announced her Bosnia and Herzegovina tour Imam pesmu da vam pevam (&quot;I Have a Song to Sing to You&quot;), where she is looking forward traveling her home country. The same year, Lepa Brena covered the November issue of &quot;Vogue Adria&quot;, becoming the first musician to appear on the cover.

==Personal life==
Her wedding to Serbian tennis star Slobodan Živojinović on 7 December 1991 was a media event throughout Yugoslavia. The lavish ceremony took place at Belgrade&#x27;s InterContinental Hotel. The level of interest in the event was such that Brena&#x27;s manager Raka Đokić released a VHS tape of the wedding. Their public relationship has been providing steady fodder for various tabloid publications ever since. Upon marriage, Brena became the stepmother to Živojinović&#x27;s son Filip, born on 19 August 1985. Brena and Živojinović&#x27;s first child together, a son named Stefan, was born in New York City on 21 May 1992. Their second son Viktor was born 30 March 1998. On 6 March 2019, Brena became a step-grandmother after Filip&#x27;s wife Aleksandra Prijović gave birth to their first child together, son Aleksandar.

Brena broke her leg in a skiing accident in November 1992, and it took six months for her to heal. Her manager and producer Raka Đokić died suddenly on 30 October 1993.

On 23 November 2000, the couple&#x27;s elder son Stefan was kidnapped by members of the Zemun mafia. After they paid a ransom of 2,500 000 Deutsche Marks in cash, he was released, having been held for five days. She has resided in Belgrade since 1980 and currently lives there with her husband, while their sons are studying in the United States. In a 2014 interview, she stated that she was still healing from the trauma of the kidnapping incident.

After the debacle and family drama, she went on hiatus once again, lasting eight years, living between Belgrade and Miami, Florida with her family. Brena and her husband have a home in Coconut Creek, Florida, where they lived during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, although Brena visited Yugoslavia during the bombing and took part on one of the public morale-raising concerts on Belgrade&#x27;s Republic Square. She also has an apartment in Monte Carlo and another townhouse in Fisher Island, Florida. In 2010, Brena and her husband purchased a five-bedroom villa with an in-ground heated pool on one of Miami&#x27;s islands at a cost of $1.6 million.

In October 2010, her father, Abid Jahić, was severely injured when a bus hit him as he walked in the town of Brčko. He was transported to a hospital in Tuzla, where he died on 22 October 2010 aged 82. He was buried in a Muslim funeral three days after his death. Brena, her two siblings and mother, along with other family members and citizens of Brčko attended the funeral. She later regarded the months after her father&#x27;s death as the emotionally most difficult time of her life. Her mother Ifeta died 21 November 2014, aged 80. She was buried in a Muslim funeral in Brčko next to her husband.

Brena was hospitalized on 27 July 2012 when she complained of pain and was diagnosed as having venous thrombosis, a blood clot. She remained in the hospital for three days, then was released. A similar incident had occurred in October 2004 when a blood clot in her hand was removed. In August 2012, she was forced to cancel three months of scheduled concerts to deal with further complications with her illness.

She was again hospitalized on 25 July 2014 while at holiday in the Croatian resort of Novi Vinodolski where she fell down the stairs and broke both arms. She was hospitalized for five days and spent her month-long recovery at a local hotel. On 2 January 2015, Brena fell down the stairs again during a family vacation at Zlatibor, Serbia, and hurt her wrist. Unlike the previous incident, this injury did not require surgery. However, because of this, she stayed hospitalized in Belgrade and rescheduled upcoming performances in the Bosnian towns of Živinice and Travnik.

==Controversy==

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, ethnic tensions which started rising in Yugoslavia and eventually led to country&#x27;s breakup, made Lepa Brena become one of main tabloid targets at the time. Some Bosniaks viewed her as a traitor as she was a Bosniak who sang and spoke with an Ekavian accent (which is predominantly spoken in Serbia) and she married Serbian Slobodan Živojinović. Several tabloids claimed that she had converted from Islam to Serbian Orthodoxy and that she had changed her name from Fahreta to Jelena. She intensely denied these allegations. In socialist Yugoslavia, religions in general were an unpopular topic, and people acknowledged the religion to which belonged in relation to its family roots, but were overwhelmingly non-practitioners. In that sense, being a Yugoslav icon, Lepa Brena never publicly spoke about her religious beliefs beyond stating that she had grown up being Sunni Muslim.

In 2009, numerous Bosniaks and Croats protested when her concerts in Sarajevo on 30 May and in Zagreb on 13 June were announced. The reason behind the protests were pictures allegedly shot in 1993 during the Bosnian War in which she appears wearing the uniform of the Army of Republika Srpska in the besieged town of Brčko, where she grew up. In the pictures, taken and published by one Serbian magazine, she appears giving support to Bosnian Serb soldiers, which were at that time involved in intense fighting against Croatian and Bosniak forces in Posavina front. Croatian and Bosnian protesters called her a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;&quot;. The concerts went ahead as scheduled with no incidents. Brena then denied all of the allegations explaining that the uniform was a costume she used for the music video of her song &quot;Tamba lamba&quot; in &quot;Hajde da se volimo: Udajemo Lepu Brenu&quot;. She also explained that she went to Brčko to save her parents because she got a message that they would be killed.

<text>MEPIS was a set of Linux distributions, distributed as Live CDs or DVDs that could be installed onto a hard disk drive. MEPIS was started by Warren Woodford and MEPIS LLC.

The most popular MEPIS distribution was SimplyMEPIS, which was based primarily on Debian stable, with the last version of SimplyMEPIS being based on Debian 6. It could either be installed onto a hard drive or used as a Live DVD, which made it externally bootable for troubleshooting and repairing many operating systems. It included the KDE desktop environment.

==History==
MEPIS was designed as an alternative to SUSE Linux, Red Hat Linux, and Mandriva Linux (formerly Mandrake) which Woodford considered too difficult for the average user. MEPIS&#x27;s first official release was on May 10, 2003.

In 2006, MEPIS made a transition from using Debian packages to using Ubuntu packages. SimplyMEPIS 6.0, released in July 2006, was the first version of MEPIS to incorporate the Ubuntu packages and repositories.

SimplyMEPIS 7.0 discontinued the use of Ubuntu binary packages in favor of a combination of MEPIS packaged binaries based on Debian and Ubuntu source code, combined with a Debian stable OS core and extra packages from Debian package pools.

Major releases occurred about six months to one year apart until 2013, based mostly on Warren&#x27;s availability to produce the next version.

==Variants==
SimplyMEPIS, designed for everyday desktop and laptop computing. The default desktop environment is KDE-based, although Gnome and/or other GUI-environments can be installed. SimplyMEPIS 11.0 is based on Debian 6 and includes Linux 2.6.36.4, KDE 4.5.1 and LibreOffice 3.3.2, with other applications available from Debian and the MEPIS Community. It was released on May 5, 2011. Development halted during beta testing of Mepis 12.

antiX, a fast and lightweight distribution, was originally based on MEPIS for x86 systems in an environment suitable for old computers. It&#x27;s now based on Debian Stable.

MX Linux, a midweight distribution developed in collaboration between antiX and former MEPIS communities which is based on Debian Stable.

==Name==
According to Warren Woodford, the name MEPIS is pronounced like &quot;Memphis&quot;, with the extra letters removed. Originally, the word &quot;MEPIS&quot; didn&#x27;t mean anything in particular; it came about by mistake. When Woodford misunderstood a friend over the telephone, he decided to use the name because it was a simple five-letter word and there were no other companies or products with that name.

<doc id="427862" wikidata="Q2747476" url="?curid=427862" title="Conchoidal fracture">
<text>A conchoidal fracture is a break or fracture of a brittle material that does not follow any natural planes of separation. Mindat.org defines &quot;conchoidal fracture&quot; as follows: &quot;a fracture with smooth, curved surfaces, typically slightly concave, showing concentric undulations resembling the lines of growth of a shell&quot;. Materials that break in this way include quartz, chert, flint, quartzite, jasper, and other fine-grained or amorphous materials with a composition of pure silica, such as obsidian and window glass, as well as a few metals, such as solid gallium.

Crystalline materials such as quartz also exhibit conchoidal fractures when they lack a cleavage plane and do not break along a plane parallel to their crystalline faces. So, a conchoidal, or uneven fracture is not a specific indication of the amorphous character of a mineral, or a material. Amorphous, cryptocrystalline, and crystalline materials can all present conchoidal fracture when they lack a preferential cleavage plane.

Conchoidal fractures can occur in various materials if they are properly percussed (struck). Cryptocrystalline silica, such as chert, or flint, with this material property were widely sought after, traded, and fashioned into sharp tools in the Stone Age.

Conchoidal fractures often result in a curved breakage surface that resembles the rippling, gradual curves of a mussel shell; the word &quot;conchoid&quot; is derived from the word for this animal ( &quot;konchoeidēs&quot; &lt; &quot;konchē&quot;). A swelling appears at the point of impact called the &quot;bulb of percussion&quot;. Shock waves emanating outwards from this point leave their mark on the stone as ripples. Other conchoidal features include small s emanating from the bulb of percussion.

They are defined in contrast to the faceted fractures often seen in single crystals such as semiconductor wafers and gemstones and to the high-energy ductile fracture surfaces desirable in most structural applications.

==Subsets==
Several subdefinitions exist, for instance on the Webmineral website:

* Brittle—conchoidal: very brittle fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments
* Brittle—subconchoidal: brittle fracture with subconchoidal fragments
* Conchoidal—irregular: irregular fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments
* Conchoidal—uneven: uneven fracture producing small, conchoidal fragments
* Subconchoidal: fractures developed in brittle materials characterized by semi-curving surfaces

==Lithics==
In lithic stone tools, conchoidal fractures form the basis of flint knapping, since the shape of the broken surface is controlled only by the stresses applied, and not by some preferred orientation of the material. This property also makes such fractures useful in engineering, since they provide a permanent record of the stress state at the time of failure. As conchoidal fractures can be produced only by mechanical impact, rather than frost cracking for example, they can be a useful method of differentiating prehistoric stone tools from natural stones.

<text>Scouts Canada is a Canadian Scouting association that provides programs for young people ages 5 to 26. Its aim is &quot;to help develop well-rounded youth, better prepared for success in the world.&quot; Scouts Canada, in affiliation with the French-language Association des Scouts du Canada, is a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. 

In 2022-23, there were 41,733 youth members and 12,960 volunteers in Scouts Canada. The association has declined significantly in size since its peak in 1965: youth membership is down 85% from 288,084, and volunteers are down 61% from 33,524.

==Values==

Scouts Canada follows the Scouting Method, which includes elements such as the Scout Law and Promise, learning by doing, the team system, a symbolic framework, nature, personal progression, adult support, and community involvement. As part of the Canadian Path program, Scouts can earn a &quot;Religion in Life&quot; emblem by completing a denomination-specific program. In 2009, a &quot;Spirituality Award&quot; was introduced for Scouts and Guides who do not belong to a specific religious denomination. In 2020, alternative promises were introduced for Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, and higher levels, allowing individuals to pledge to their country or personal beliefs rather than to God or the King.

==History==

According to Scouts Canada, some Scouting groups were established in Canada in 1907.

In his 1981 book &quot;75 Years of Scouting in Canada,&quot; Robert Milks, the late Scouts Canada archivist, indicated that the first Scout groups in Canada were founded in 1908. St. Catharines and Merrickville are mentioned as among the locations of the first troops. Boy Scouts and the Scout Movement had a presence in Canada before the formation of Scouts Canada or its parent organization, The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom were formed.

The Boy Scouts Association was formed in the United Kingdom in 1910 and incorporated in 1912. Some sources suggest that its founder, Baden-Powell, wrote to Earl Grey, the Governor General of Canada in 1910, and asked him to organize Scouting in Canada. A branch of The Boy Scouts Association was established in Canada under The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Overseas Department. The Canadian General Council of The Boy Scouts Association was incorporated by an Act of the Canadian Parliament on 12 June 1914. The Canadian General Council continued to be represented internationally by The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom until 30 October 1946, when the Canadian General Council became a direct member of the Boy Scout World Conference, now the World Organization of the Scout Movement. The Canadian General Council of The Boy Scouts Association later changed its name to Boy Scouts of Canada by an amendment to its incorporating Act of Parliament. In 1976, the Scouts Canada logo was introduced and the organization, by its By-laws, adopted the name Scouts Canada. In 2007, the organization&#x27;s name was amended to Scouts Canada in the establishing legislation.

In 1972, Scouts Canada began accepting female participants as part of its Rover Section. This was expanded in the late 1970s (but some sources cite 1984) to include the Venturer Section. In 1992, co-ed Scouting became an option for all program sections and became policy for all sections in 1998. The following year, the organization introduced its first gay Rover Crew in Toronto, Ontario.

In 1990, Jim Blain, the Chief Executive of Scouts Canada, was awarded the 202nd &quot;Bronze Wolf&quot;, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. He was also a recipient of the Silver World Award.

In 2001, members saw a significant reorganization country wide. Regions and Districts were reorganized into Council and Areas. Many Districts employed their staff, had their youth assistance funds, and separated Jamboree funds. All of this was under the control and supervision of a local Board of Directors. This was made up of past commissioners and community business leaders, most of whom had a Scouting background in their youth. This was the group that handled staffing, helped identify future Trainers, Commissioners, and senior Service Scouters supervised budgets for employees and camps, and raised funds from the Community. There were other Districts, mainly rural and those in isolated communities that were not what were called &#x27;employing councils&#x27; and the change was made to attempt to change these differences. Likewise, at this time Provincial Councils such as the Provincial Council for Ontario were disbanded.

In March 2011, Scouts Canada introduced a significant re-design of the organization&#x27;s uniform that had been designed by Joe Fresh Style. Beavers&#x27; uniforms changed only in color and fabric. The major changes in the uniform design are seen in the changes to the style of the button-up shirt and its color from khaki to grey, green, blue, or red, for Cubs, Scouts, Venturers, Rovers/Leaders respectively. As part of the re-design, the sash was eliminated as a uniform component, which resulted in smaller proficiency badges being made for Cub Scouts and Scouts to sew directly onto their uniforms. Fashion magazine Flare described the new uniforms as stylish and comfortable. The material for the red uniform shirt (not the activity golf shirt) changed in mid-2016 because of performance issues.

From 2012 through to 2017, Scouts Canada&#x27;s National Youth Network launched an initiative to increase awareness of Scouting among members and the general public. The campaign was designed to encourage Canadians to do &#x27;good turns&#x27; for each other. For several years, silicon bracelets were distributed across Canada with the message &quot;Good Turn Week.&quot; In addition to the original initiative, a fund was established to sponsor selected community service projects.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ended its association with Scouts Canada at the end of 2019, leading to a membership decline of over 5%.

In 2021, Scouts Canada announced a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination requirement for all in-person meetings, effective from 1 November. The vaccine requirement was removed by Scouts Canada effective September 1, 2022.

==Organizational structure==

Scouts Canada is governed by a Board of Governors. The administration of the organization is divided into twenty Councils, each administering a whole province or large part thereof. The national body and Councils are organized around a key three which include a Scouter, Youth, and Staff member. The national body is made up of a National Commissioner appointed by the Voting Members, a National Youth Commissioner appointed by the Voting Members, and an Executive Commissioner appointed by the Board of Governors.

The Council Three is made up of a Council Commissioner appointed by the National Commissioner, a Council Youth Commissioner appointed by the National Youth Commissioner, and a Council Relationship Manager appointed by the Executive Commissioner. Council Commissioners in consultation with their respective key three furthermore appoint their management teams to manage the interests of the council. All positions are advertised publicly and a selection committee interviews members based on skill set. 

Scouts Canada is affiliated with Association des Scouts du Canada.

Under the World Organization of the Scout Movement&#x27;s constitution, only one organization is recognized in each country. Canada is the only country in which this recognition is held jointly. Many other countries also have more than one Scouting organization and some of these have formed national federations which are the World Organization of the Scout Movement members. Scouts Canada and L&#x27;Association des Scouts du Canada send a joint delegation to meetings of the World Organization of the Scout Movement; this is coordinated through the Committee on Cooperation.

The Patron Scout of Canada is the current Governor General of Canada. From 1910 to 1946, the position of Chief Scout &quot;for&quot; Canada and, from 1946 to 2013, the position of Chief Scout &quot;of&quot; Canada were held by successive Governors General of Canada. On 19 April 2013, the Scouts Canada Board of Governors appointed Terry Grant as Chief Scout of Canada, and the honorary title held by the governor general was renamed to Patron Scout.

==Sections==

===Full-time sections===

The full-time sections of Scouts Canada are divided primarily by participant age, with all following the organization&#x27;s fiscal year of 1 September to 31 August. As of September 2016, all full-time sections utilize a redeveloped model called the Canadian Path. This overhaul which had begun in 2013 was the first since 1965. It has been said that the redevelopment was driven in part to address falling membership and meet the expectations set out in the World Organization of the Scout Movement resolutions&#x27; World Scout Youth Programme Policy, &quot;to make programs relevant to the needs and demands of the current day&#x27;s youth, the goal of the project was to do just that.&quot; The new approach takes notes from traditional Scouting practices and is meant to allow youth to develop themselves along a common path (with section-specific themes) from Beaver Scouts up to and including Rover Scouts.

====Beaver Scouts====

Beaver Scouts is a Beavers section for children between ages 5 to 7. The Beaver Scout uniform includes a hat, a neckerchief, a neckerchief slide, and a vest. Activities include crafts, games, sports, music, hikes, and camping. Their motto is &quot;Sharing Sharing Sharing&quot;. A Beaver is a Totem animal or representation of nature, hence the name.

====Cub Scouts====

The Cub Scouts section is for children ages 8 to 10. Activities of the program include hiking, camping, and water activities such as canoeing and kayaking. The program&#x27;s purpose is to encourage members to &quot;try new and more challenging activities&quot;. Their motto is &quot;Do your best&quot;. A Wolf Cub is yet another representation of nature, hence the namesake.

====Scouts====
The Scouts section is for youth between 11 and 14 years old. Activities include outdoor activities, camping, and hiking, as well as participation in youth forums. It claims that its purpose is &quot;having fun while gaining valuable leadership skills and self-confidence&quot;.

====Venturer Scouts====

The Venturer Scout section is for teens between 15 and 17 years old. Its stated aim to &quot;offer exciting, real life, hands-on experiences for youth&quot;. Its activities include hiking, camping, and more advanced training programs: white water kayaking / canoeing, mountaineering, week-long expeditions in National parks and international activities including service projects.

====Rover Scouts====

Rover Scouts is the eldest youth section in Scouting and is for teens and young adults between 18 and 26 years old. Activities include &quot;high adventure activities&quot; ranging from multi-week expeditions with increasingly-difficult challenges, taking on leadership roles working with younger sections, and assisting with or running service projects at a local / national / international level.

====Vocational programs====
* Medical Venturers/Medical Rovers (Medvents/Medrovers) is a program that consists of Venturers and Rovers that learn and provide first-aid. Medical Venturers in Toronto have used an AED to assist a patient in cardiac arrest.
* Fire Venturers learn basic firefighting skills while working with fire departments
* Police Venturers learn firearm safety, crowd control, and similar skills while working with police departments
* Service Corps Venturers/Rovers provide community service within the Scouting Community as well as outside organizations including Heritage Canada, The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Food Bank and The Royal Canadian Legion&#x27;s Dominion Command.
In the Ottawa region (as a part of Scouts Canada&#x27;s Voyageur Council), the Voyageur Council Service Alliance (VCSA) includes MedVents, PoliceVents and the Service Corps. Among its many efforts, the VCSA: Service Corps assists the Canadian Heritage (previously National Capital Commission) with on-the-ground services (notably the Lost Children Service) during events such as: Canada Day, Winterlude (on-canal patrols to assist the public), Lighting the Capital at Christmas, the spring Tulip Festival, and others.

===Part-time programs===
Scouts Canada also has programs designated as Part-Time Programs.

====ScoutsAbroad====

ScoutsAbroad is a program which was created to support the Canadian Brotherhood Fund. Scouts in Canada support Scouts in developing countries through initiatives aimed at fostering self-sufficiency. The Canadian Brotherhood Fund provides through grants, &quot;seed money&quot; for many international development projects. The ScoutsAbroad program also promotes youth involvement in learning about their world through penpal programs, international events, and international exchanges.

===== International Development Projects =====
International Development Projects are known internally as Brotherhood Projects which stems from the Canadian Brotherhood Fund. Groups of Scouts in developing countries develop and carry out projects to improve their own lives and the future of their communities. In some cases, members of Scouts Canada participate in travelling abroad to assist in carrying out portions of a project. There has been over 13 projects completed since 2007.

====SCOUTSabout====
The SCOUTS about program aims to fulfill Scouting&#x27;s mission with those children who are not members of a Scouting organization. SCOUTSabout is implemented in 3-month long modules, often after school, to appeal to those families who do not want or cannot commit to year-round activities. Theme based, the focus is on structured play and learning by doing without uniforms, badge programs and ceremonies. SCOUTSabout is for children between 5 and 10 years old.

====Extreme Adventure====
Extreme Adventure offers the opportunity for young people aged from 14 to 17, to plan and participate in a variety of short-term adventure-based activities. Example activities are: hiking, long-term camping and travelling abroad to participate in humanitarian projects. The program seeks to realise Scouting&#x27;s mission with non-members. There is no uniform and are no ceremonies associated with this program. It is designed to include development of leadership skills and self-esteem and the participation in community projects that is also offered through the ordinary programs. Extreme Adventure is based on the Venturer Amory Adventure Award concept.

==Major youth awards==
Scouts Canada has several major youth awards which include:
* The Chief Scout&#x27;s Award was established in 1973 as the top award in the Scout section.
* The King&#x27;s Venturer Award is the top award in the Venturer section. In 1968, the normal upper age for members of the Scout section was reduced from 17 to 14 and the Venturer section was created for ages 14–17. As part of these changes, Queen&#x27;s Scout rank was replaced with the Queen&#x27;s Venturer Award.
* The Amory Adventure Award is awarded to the Venturer company that exhibits the most initiative in conceiving, planning, and executing an outdoor adventure.
* The Medal of the Maple was created in 2007 and is awarded for distinguished youth service and excellence within the Scouting Movement.

==Camps==

Scouts Canada operates over 125 camps across Canada. Popular camps include Camp Impeesa, Haliburton Scout Reserve, Camp Byng and Tamaracouta Scout Reserve. Tamaracouta Scout Reserve was among the oldest continually operating Scout camps in the world until its closure in 2019.

==National Youth Network==

The National Youth Network consists of Scouts Canada youth from across the country. The purpose of the National Youth Network is to ensure meaningful youth involvement in all Scouts Canada decisions, support the organization of Council Youth Networks, and encourage youth to take on leadership roles.

The National Youth Network typically consists of one National Youth Commissioner, three Assistant National Youth Commissioners and 20 Council Youth Commissioners.

===Projects===
Develop and promote FLEX, FAST and FOCUS – Scouts Canada&#x27;s Youth Leadership training programs for Cub Scouts, Scouts, and Venturer Scouts. In 2018, Scouts Canada released the Scouts Canada Youth Leadership Training which will replace FLEX, FAST, and FOCUS, introducing courses for all five sections which integrate with the new Canadian Path program. The Youth Network also maintains and adjudicates the Medal of the Maple for Distinguished Youth Service.

The National Youth Network is only a small part of the larger Scouts Canada Youth Network that is made up of the National Youth Network, the Council Youth Networks, the Area Youth Networks and other youth representatives across Canada.

==Initiatives==
Scouts Canada has implemented initiatives to increase membership nationwide. This process includes more direct program support to leaders; building on such things as a partnership with the Robert Bateman Foundation, a program help line, an award-winning Climate Change program and a variety of camping programs across the country.

==Controversies==

===Organizational structure===

Scouts Canada is governed, like all incorporated non-profit organizations, by a Board of Governors. Each Council elects three Voting Members of whom at least one must be a youth. All members are able to vote for and or be nominees for Council Voting Members. At the National Annual General Meeting of Members, Voting Members elect the Board of Governors and the National Commissioner.

There are Scouters, most notably members of an organization called SCOUT eh! who believe there is a lack of representation and lack of accountability of this governance structure.

===Child protection===
In 2012, the CBC ran a documentary suggesting that Scouts Canada had not always reported leaders who had sexually abused children to the police, relating to incidents that took place between 1960 and 1990. Scouts Canada subsequently posted a video apology followed by &quot;a thorough, arms-length review of all records held by Scouts Canada on Leader suspensions or terminations that are related to abuse&quot; by KPMG&#x27;s forensic investigations unit. The report from KPMG subsequently &quot;found no systemic intent to cover up or hide incidents of abuse&quot;.

====Youth Protection====
In the fall of 1996, Scouts Canada modernized its screening practices for adult members to require a Police Record Check, with a Vulnerable Sector Check added in 2015–2016. As part of this screening, local volunteers interview applicants and check the multiple references they must provide as part of the Volunteer Recruitment and Development (VRAD) process. Scouts Canada volunteers are prohibited from being alone with a youth member; two fully screened volunteers are required to be present at all times with any youth. In the event that a volunteer is suspected of misconduct, Scouts Canada policy requires that they are immediately suspended and the relevant authorities are notified with all information shared as part of an investigation into the volunteer&#x27;s actions.

Scouts Canada distributes a booklet called How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse: A Parent&#x27;s Guide, available in handbooks and online. In addition, it is a badge requirement in the Scout program for parents and youth to review a portion of &quot;How to Protect Your Children from Child Abuse: A Parent&#x27;s Guide&quot;

===Relations with other Scout associations===
In 1999, the Baden-Powell Service Association Federation of Canada (B-PSAFC) was ordered by Industry Canada &quot;to take the word &#x27;scout&#x27; out of its title.&quot; Scouts Canada also sought for the removal of the name Baden Powell, going on to say &quot;...there&#x27;s one scouting association in Canada, one in the world, every country has only one that&#x27;s how Baden Powell set up scouting...&quot; because &quot;[Baden Powell] felt anything else would dilute the program, cause confusion and hurt the programs for young people.&quot; The World Organization of the Scouting Movement website reinforces this policy which states, &quot;There can only be one [National Scout Organization] per country.&quot;

<doc id="427866" wikidata="Q1269450" url="?curid=427866" title="Vincent Persichetti">
<text>Vincent Ludwig Persichetti (June 6, 1915 – August 14, 1987) was an American composer, teacher, and pianist. An important musical educator and writer, he was known for his integration of various new ideas in musical composition into his own work and teaching, as well as for training many noted composers in composition at the Juilliard School.

His students at Juilliard included Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Larry Thomas Bell, Bruce Adolphe, Louis Calabro, Moshe Cotel, Michael Jeffrey Shapiro, Laurie Spiegel, Kenneth Fuchs, Richard Danielpour, Lawrence Dillon, Peter Schickele, Lowell Liebermann, Robert Witt, Elena Ruehr, William Schimmel, Leonardo Balada, Gitta Steiner, Hank Beebe, Roland Wiggins, Thomas Pasatieri, Randell Croley and Leo Brouwer. He also taught composition to Joseph Willcox Jenkins and conductor James DePreist at the Philadelphia Conservatory.

==Life==
Persichetti was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1915. Though neither of his parents was a musician, his musical education began early. Persichetti enrolled in the Combs College of Music at the age of five, where he studied piano, organ, double bass and later music theory and composition with Russel King Miller, whom he considered a great influence.

He first performed his original works publicly at the age of 14. By the time he reached his teens, Persichetti was paying for his own education by accompanying and performing. He continued to do so throughout high school, adding church organist, orchestral player and radio staff pianist to his experience. In addition to developing his musical talents, he attended art school and remained an avid sculptor until his death. He attended Combs for his undergraduate education as well. After receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1936, he was immediately offered a teaching position.

By the age of 20, Persichetti was simultaneously head of the theory and composition department at Combs, a conducting major with Fritz Reiner at the Curtis Institute, and a student of piano (with Olga Samaroff) and composition at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1941 and a doctorate in 1945 from the Conservatory, as well as a conducting diploma from Curtis. In 1941, while still a student, Persichetti headed the theory and composition department as well as the department of postgraduate study at Philadelphia Conservatory, where he taught from 1939–1962.

In 1941 Persichetti married Dorothea Flanagan who was a composer as well. They had a daughter Lauren, a dancer, and Garth, an actor.

From 1932 to 1948 he was organist and eventually choirmaster of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church. In 1947, William Schuman offered him a professorship at Juilliard. While at the Juilliard School, Persichetti was devoted to the wind band movement and advocated William Schuman and Peter Mennin to compose pieces for wind band. He was on staff at Juilliard for over forty years. Persichetti&#x27;s students included Einojuhani Rautavaara, Leonardo Balada, Steven Gellman, Peter Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach), Michael Jeffrey Shapiro, Claire Polin, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Robert Witt (who also studied with Persichetti at the Philadelphia Conservatory), Randell Croley and Philip Glass. He became editorial director of the Elkan-Vogel publishing house in 1952.

==Music==
Persichetti is one of the major figures in American music of the 20th century, both as a teacher and a composer. Notably, his &quot;Hymns and Responses for the Church Year&quot; has become a standard setting for church choirs. His numerous compositions for wind ensemble are often introductions to contemporary music for high school and college students. His early style was marked by the influences of Stravinsky, Bartók, Hindemith, and Copland before he developed his distinct voice in the 1950s.

Persichetti&#x27;s music draws on a wide variety of thought in 20th-century contemporary composition as well as Big Band music. His own style was marked by use of two elements he refers to as &quot;graceful&quot; and &quot;gritty&quot;: the former being more lyrical and melodic, the latter being sharp and intensely rhythmic. Especially true of his early compositions, Persichetti said he &quot;liked bumpy melodic lines and was crazy about music that moved along a zigzag path.&quot; He frequently used polytonality and pandiatonicism in his writing, and his music could be marked by sharp rhythmic interjections, but his embracing of diverse strands of musical thought makes characterizing his body of work difficult. This trend continued throughout his compositional career. His music lacked sharp changes in style over time. He frequently composed while driving in his car, sometimes taping staff paper to the steering wheel.

His piano music forms the bulk of his creative output, with a concerto, a concertino, twelve sonatas, and a variety of other pieces written for the instrument. These were virtuosic pieces as well as pedagogical and amateur-level compositions. Persichetti was an accomplished pianist. He wrote many pieces suitable for less mature performers, considering them to have serious artistic merit.

Persichetti is also one of the major composers for the concert wind band repertoire, with his 14 works for the ensemble. In 1950, Persichetti composed his first work for band, which was the &quot;Divertimento for Band&quot;. The Symphony No. 6 for band is of particular note as a standard larger work. This piece boasts complex percussion lines crucial to the work&#x27;s thematic material as well as utilizes the full spectrum of colors and timbres of the wind band. He wrote one opera, entitled &quot;The Sibyl.&quot; The music was noted by critics for its color, but the dramatic and vocal aspects of the work were found by some to be lacking.

He wrote nine symphonies, of which the first two were withdrawn, and four string quartets.

Many of his other works are organized into series. One of these, a collection of primarily instrumental works entitled &quot;Parables&quot;, contains 25 works, many for unaccompanied wind instruments (complete listing below). His 15 &quot;Serenades&quot; include such unconventional combinations as a trio for trombone, viola, and cello, as well as selections for orchestra, for band, and for duo piano.

During the 1950s, Persichetti was perceived to &quot;truly achieve his own distinctive voice,&quot; in the words of Walter G. Simmons. One of Persichetti&#x27;s most revered compositions is his Concerto for Piano, Four Hands. This duet was first performed at the Pittsburgh International Contemporary Music Festival on November 29, 1952. The piece itself gives the listener the illusion that the two pianists are having a pleasant conversation, without using words, but just musical notes. The duet featured both Vincent and Dorothea Persichetti as the performers. In his review in the Manchester Guardian, Colin Mason stated, &quot;The Concierto (sic) for Piano, Four Hands was for me one of the most interesting stimulating American works of the Pittsburgh International Contemporary Music Festival.&quot;

Persichetti&#x27;s esthetic was essentially conservative, a distinctive blend of Classical, Romantic and Modernist elements, contrapuntal, rhythmically charged and expertly scored. His musical imagination was multifaceted and highly virtuosic. &quot;Following the lineage of Mozart, Mendelssohn and Ravel, Persichetti&#x27;s music suggests the innocence and childlike joy of pure musical creativity&quot;, Walter Simmons wrote in the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of American Music&quot;. &quot;Hence many works for beginners stand, with neither condescension nor apology, alongside more difficult compositions.&quot;

Persichetti frequently appeared as a lecturer on college campuses, for which he was noted for his witty and engaging manner. He wrote the noted music theory textbook, &quot;Twentieth Century Harmony: Creative Aspects and Practice&quot;. He and Flora Rheta Schreiber wrote a monograph on William Schuman.

Persichetti was a big fan of collaboration between music and dance. He encouraged his students at Juilliard to work with the dance program to create compositions for the dancers choreography. Persichetti also collaborated with choreographers professionally. He worked with Martha Graham. He admired her seriousness and her commitment to movement. Persichetti believed that music has to stand on its own and can not be married to dance, one can not depend on the other. He once said, &quot;There isn&#x27;t such thing as dance music. Music is dance, it&#x27;s motion.&quot;

Persichetti performed many concerts consisting of improvisation. He believed any composer/artist must improvise to create.

<text>Christopher Robert Lionel Abrahams (born 1961, Oamaru, New Zealand) is a New Zealand-born, Australian-based musician. He is a founding mainstay member of experimental, jazz trio the Necks (1987–present), collaborated with Melanie Oxley as a soul pop duo (1989–2003), and has issued ten solo albums.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Christopher Robert Lionel Abrahams was born on 9 April 1961 in Oamaru, South Island, New Zealand. Abrahams, on keyboards, formed jazz group Benders, in 1980 in Sydney with Dale Barlow on tenor saxophone, Louis Burdett on drums and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar. By the time Benders disbanded in 1985, Abrahams had performed on all three of their albums, &quot;E&quot; (1983), &quot;False Laughter&quot; (1984) and &quot;Distance&quot; (1985). While still with Benders, late in 1983, he supplied piano for Laughing Clowns&#x27; second album, &quot;Law of Nature&quot; (1984).

=== The Necks, Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams ===

The Sparklers were a dance pop group formed in 1985 by Abrahams on keyboards, Bill Bilson on drums (ex-Sunnyboys), Gerard Corben on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders), Ernie Finckh (RenrocRab) on guitar and the Oxley siblings Melanie on lead vocals (ex-Sweet Nothings) and Peter on bass guitar (ex-Sunnyboys). Colin Bloxsom took over lead guitar by the following year. Sparklers released two singles, &quot;Overworking&quot; (October 1986) and &quot;So Often Dreaming&quot; (January 1987) before Abrahams left. The Sparklers issued their debut album, &quot;Persuasion&quot;, in 1988.

The Necks were formed as a jazz trio, in 1987, by Abrahams on piano, keyboards, organ and guitar with former bandmate, Swanton, on bass guitar and double bass, and Tony Buck on drums, percussion and guitar (ex-Great White Noise). For his compositions with the group he has won two APRA Awards (Australia) for Most Performed Jazz Work; &quot;Drive By&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Mosquito&quot; in 2006. As from March 2020 the trio have issued 16 studio albums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sonation, &quot;abstract, improvised, jazzy mood music.&quot;
In 1989, while still with the Necks, Abrahams formed a soul pop duo, Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams, with former the Sparklers&#x27; bandmate, Oxley. They released a four-track extended play (EP), &quot;Resisting Calm&quot;, via Spiral Scratch in late 1990. For that EP they used Abrahams&#x27; current and former bandmates, Buck on drums, Swanton on acoustic bass guitar, Corben (ex-the Sparklers) on guitar as well as Mike Bukovsky on trumpet, Guy Dickerson on guitar, Stuart Eadie on floor toms and Jackie Orszaczky on bass guitar. While periodically collaborating with Abrahams, Oxley maintained her career as a school teacher.

The duo&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Welcome to Violet&quot; (1992) and &quot;Coal&quot; (1994), were released via Remote Records/MDS. They were labelled as, &quot;moody, emotive soul/pop&quot; works by McFarlane. Their next album, &quot;Jerusalem Bay&quot; (1998), had Hamish Stuart on drums (ex-Ayers Rock, Wig World, the Catholics) and Mike Bukowski on trumpet (ex-Ten Part Invention). In 2001 the pair performed Abrahams&#x27; music for a radio travel documentary, &quot;South Island&quot;, which was broadcast by ABC Classic FM on 6 October 2003. It was created, narrated and produced by Abrahams with &quot;The Listening Room&quot;″s Sherre DeLys.

Melanie Oxley &amp; Chris Abrahams&#x27; next work, &quot;Blood Oranges&quot;, appeared in early 2003 via Remote Records/Vitamin Records. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s John Shand found, &quot;his lyrics are often bleaker than their past work, it is not a despairing bleakness, but one bolstered by stoicism, wit, hope and a love of beauty.&quot; Jeremy Green of &quot;dB Magazine&quot; observed, &quot;[it is] peculiarly ineffectual. It paws lazily at classic Motown pop but is totally sedated by dinky production and emotional primness.&quot;

=== Solo work ===
Abrahams issued his debut solo album, &quot;Piano&quot;, in 1985 via Hot Records/Making Waves. It was recorded at Sydney Opera House&#x27;s Recording Hall and mastered at Studios 301. Tony Mitchell of &quot;Cyclic Defrost&quot; described this album in 2017, &quot;nine improvisations... it suggests a virtuoso pianist in the making.&quot; After leaving the Sparklers, in 1987, he issued his second studio album, &quot;Walk&quot;.

His fifth solo album, &quot;Thrown&quot; appeared in 2005 via Room40. &quot;Cyclic Defrost&quot;″s Max Schaefer noticed, &quot;Technically formidable and conceptually refined, [he] pays homage to the piano by drawing it into tightly articulated and highly personalized forms.&quot; Abrahams performed, produced and arranged the music for the Australian film, &quot;The Tender Hook&quot; (2008), which was released as the soundtrack album, &quot;The Tender Hook: Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;. At the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards his work was nominated for Best Original Music Score.

&quot;Play Scar&quot; (2010), his seventh album, was reviewed by Oliver Laing of &quot;Cyclic Defrost&quot;, who declared, &quot;[it] is the glorious sound of well-established artist willing to push the boundaries of sound and technique into new realms.&quot; His next effort, &quot;Memory Night&quot; (2013), shows that &quot;even at his most ominous is also quite listenable, creating jumbled, but still quite accessible soundscapes&quot; according to 4ZZZ&#x27;s Chris Cobroft.

Abrahams has worked as a session musician on albums by the Triffids (&quot;Born Sandy Devotional&quot;, 1986), Ed Kuepper (&quot;Rooms of the Magnificent&quot;, 1986; &quot;Honey Steel&#x27;s Gold&quot;, 1991; &quot;This Is the Magic Mile&quot;, 2005), Skunkhour (&quot;Skunkhour&quot;, 1993), the Apartments (&quot;A Life Full of Farewells&quot;, 1995; &quot;Apart&quot;, 1997; &quot;In and Out of the Light&quot;, 2020), the Church (&quot;Magician Among the Spirits&quot;, 1996), the Whitlams (&quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;, 1997; &quot;Torch the Moon&quot;, 2002), Silverchair (&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, 1999), Midnight Oil (&quot;The Real Thing&quot;, 2000) and Wendy Matthews (&quot;Beautiful View&quot;, 2001).

== Musical style and composing ==
Some of Abrahams&#x27; music is experimental in nature—The Necks are an improvisational trio, and Abraham&#x27;s performance at the Room40 Tenth Anniversary in London was labelled &quot;ambient&quot;, &quot;free-jazz&quot; and &quot;industrial noise&quot; by (UK) Financial Times reviewer, Mike Hobart. Chris Reid of &quot;RealTime&quot; magazine wrote of his &quot;Germ Studies&quot; collaboration with Clare Cooper, an organiser of the NOWnow Festival who played the Chinese zither on the album, that &quot;it represents an extensive investigation into the endless range of sounds that can be created by combining the venerable DX7 synthesiser and the even more venerable Chinese zither, the guzheng [...] a deep exploration of musical language&quot;.

<text>The Benders were an Australian jazz band from 1980 to 1985. The group&#x27;s members included Chris Abrahams on keyboards, Dale Barlow on saxophone, Louis Burdett on drums, Andrew Gander on drums, Jason Morphett on saxophone, and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar. They issued three albums, &quot;E&quot; (1983), &quot;False Laughter&quot; (1984) and &quot;Distance&quot; (1985).

== History ==

The Benders were formed in 1980 in Sydney by Chris Abrahams on keyboards, Dale Barlow on tenor saxophone, Louis Burdett on drums and Lloyd Swanton on bass guitar. Burdett was replaced by Andrew Gander on drums. Abrahams, Barlow, Gander and Swanton had all attended New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. The Benders played at local music venues, including a residency at the Paradise Jazz Club, Kings Cross for three nights a week.

Swanton was advised by teachers at the conservatorium to hold non-jazz gigs to survive, &quot;Perhaps the teachers felt they were merely being pragmatic, but I, along with others of my generation, refused to accept this model, and The Benders were a clear expression of this belief.&quot; Jazz music writer, John Shand, remembered first seeing them in the early 1980s, &quot;I was stunned by their originality and the rock-band-like intensity, energy and performance qualities.&quot;

Barlow left the Benders late in 1982 to work in the United States, however he was recorded on their debut album, &quot;E&quot; (1983), before he was replaced by Jason Morphett. &quot;E&quot; had been recorded in September 1982 at radio station, 2MBS-FM&#x27;s studio with Abrahams and Swanton co-producing. Adrian Jackson of &quot;The Age&quot; described the group, &quot;a very exciting band indeed, playing worthy original themes and improvising with plenty of abandon.&quot;

Abrahams told Jackson how they had changed after recording the album, &quot;I think we&#x27;re playing a lot more freely in a sense. We play a few lesser-known standards, few Monk compositions, but we mainly do original tunes.&quot; Jackson caught their gig at the RMIT in October 1983 and observed, &quot;they have developed a firm group identity, playing aggressively and with a sense of purpose... Most numbers are played with the tempo fairly fast and the volume fairly loud: Swanton and Gander work unflaggingly to maintain the momentum while Abrahams and Morphett play twisting, increasingly heated solos.&quot; Also in that year Abrahams provided piano for the Laughing Clowns&#x27; album, &quot;Law of Nature&quot;, which was released in the following year.

&quot;False Laughter&quot; (1984), the Bender&#x27;s second album, was also co-produced by Abrahams and Swanton. Jackson opined, &quot;the skill these young musicians possess is certainly formidable. The strength of their mostly original repertoire is a plus for the Benders, but what really sets them apart from most other Australian groups is the way they play their music... Despite the success of their recent LP &quot;False Laughter&quot; (on Hot Records), and the acclaim they have received from a wide variety of audiences in Sydney and elsewhere. The Benders have recently been finding the music scene in Sydney quiet Lloyd Swanton told me last week: &#x27;We&#x27;ve only got one regular weekly gig at the moment, and we don&#x27;t even know if we&#x27;ll still have that when we get back from Melbourne&#x27;.&quot;

The group&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;Distance&quot;, followed in 1985. The group broke up and Abrahams issued his debut solo album, &quot;Piano&quot;, in the same year. He then formed the Sparklers (1985–87) before recombining with Swanton to form the Necks in 1987. Swanton was briefly a member of Dynamic Hepnotics in 1986 before the Necks.

<text>Tony Buck (born 1962) is an Australian drummer and percussionist. He graduated from the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music (now Sydney Conservatorium of Music), becoming involved in the Australian jazz scene.

Buck played in Great White Noise with Michael Sheridan and Sandy Evans during 1983, then Women and Children First with Sandy Evans.

<text>The Aegean Islands are the group of islands in the Aegean Sea, with mainland Greece to the west and north and Turkey to the east; the island of Crete delimits the sea to the south, those of Rhodes, Karpathos and Kasos to the southeast. The ancient Greek name of the Aegean Sea, &quot;Archipelago&quot; (, &quot;archipelagos&quot;), was later applied to the islands it contains and is now used more generally, to refer to any island group.

The vast majority of the Aegean Islands belong to Greece, being split among nine administrative regions. The only sizable possessions of Turkey in the Aegean Sea are Imbros (Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), in the northeastern part of the sea. Various smaller islets off Turkey&#x27;s western coast are also under Turkish sovereignty.

The islands have hot summers and mild winters, a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==Groups of islands==
The Aegean Islands are traditionally subdivided into seven groups, from north to south:

* Northeastern Aegean Islands
* Euboea
* Sporades (&quot;Northern Sporades&quot;)
* Cyclades
* Saronic Islands
* Dodecanese (&quot;Southern Sporades&quot;)
* Crete

The term Italian Islands of the Aegean () is sometimes used to refer to the Aegean Islands conquered by Italy during the Italo-Turkish War in 1912 and annexed (through the Treaty of Lausanne) from 1923 until 1947: the Dodecanese, including Rhodes and Kastellorizo. In the Treaty of Peace in 1947, these Italian-controlled islands were ceded to Greece.

<doc id="427899" wikidata="Q5442528" url="?curid=427899" title="Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches">
<text>The Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches (FEBC) is a small evangelical Christian denomination with an Anabaptist Mennonite heritage. Most of the denomination&#x27;s approximately 5000 members are in congregations located in the U.S. and Canada.

==Background==
The Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches was founded at Mountain Lake, Minnesota on October 14, 1889 as the &quot;&quot; (Conference of United Mennonite Brethren in North America). This body originated among Russian Mennonite immigrants that came to Canada and the United States from Russia around 1874. Their desire was to place greater evangelical emphasis on such doctrines as repentance, conversion, scriptural discipline and non-conformity to the world. Instrumental in the founding of the conference were Elder Isaac Peters of the Ebenezer Church in Henderson, Nebraska and Elder Aaron Wall, founder of the Brudertaler Church in Mountain Lake.

For many years member congregations used the name &quot;Brudertaler,&quot; (or Bruderthaler) probably under the influence of the Mountain Lake founding church, and the conference itself was popularly called the Brudertaler (Bruderthaler) Conference. In 1914 the name was officially changed to The Defenceless Mennonite Brethren in Christ of North America. Then, in 1937 the name was formally changed to Evangelical Mennonite Brethren (EMB).

In 1956, the conference&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Omaha, Nebraska from Mountain Lake, Minnesota.

The Evangelical Mennonite Brethren and the Evangelical Mennonite Church began talks of merger in 1953, but the effort ended without success in 1962. In this period, the Evangelical Mennonite Brethren Conference was also strengthening ties with the &quot;&quot; (Evangelical Mennonite Brethren of South America). These South American brethren shared similar background, language, doctrine, and practice. Affiliation was accomplished in 1958, with the South American group being made a district of the general conference, but with self-government.
Until 1983, the conference officially held the Mennonite position of non-resistance and not bearing arms in war. Since that year, their constitution, while maintaining the official position, has also recognized the individual&#x27;s right to their own conscience concerning these matters.

In the 1980s, a Canadian group which was originally known as the New Covenant Apostolic Order, separated from the EMB church, eventually becoming the Saskatchewan Diocese of the Evangelical Orthodox Church.

The Evangelical Mennonite Brethren Conference changed its name to the Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches on July 16, 1987. At that time the conference consisted of 36 congregations with a membership of 4583 (of which 1981 members in 20 congregations were in Canada and 423 members were in South America).

==Beliefs==
The Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches holds an orthodox Trinitarian theology, the infallible inspiration of the Scriptures, and is dispensational premillennial in eschatology. The body recognizes two ordinances — baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper. They practice water baptism of believers by immersion, but will recognize as valid other modes when administered by others, or when immersion is impossible due to a medical condition. Open communion is observed with bread and fruit of the vine. The Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches exists to increase fellowship between member congregations, promote evangelism and missions, and represent the congregations through membership in boards and organizations outside the FEBC.

==Membership==
In 2003 the FEBC in North America had 3,620 members (Canada - 2,170; USA - 1,450) in 36 congregations (Canada - 20; USA - 16), as well as 5 churches in Argentina and Paraguay. &quot;The Fellowship Focus&quot; is a bi-monthly magazine published by the FEBC. The conference headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska, having been moved there from Mountain Lake, Minnesota in 1956. They hold membership in the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada (org. 1964), and the Mennonite World Conference, and until January, 2023, they had held membership with the National Association of Evangelicals (USA, org. 1942).

In 2013, there were 44 congregations included on the FEBC rolls. Most of the churches were in the U.S. and Canada, with one being in Paraguay.

<text>In music theory, a trichord () is a group of three different pitch classes found within a larger group. A trichord is a three-note set from a musical scale or a twelve-tone row.

In musical set theory there are twelve trichords given inversional equivalency, and, without inversional equivalency, nineteen trichords. These are numbered 1–12, with symmetrical trichords being unlettered and with uninverted and inverted nonsymmetrical trichords lettered A or B, respectively. They are often listed in prime form, but may exist in different voicings; different inversions at different transpositions. For example, the major chord, 3-11B (prime form: [0,4,7]), is an inversion of the minor chord, 3-11A (prime form: [0,3,7]). 3-5A and B are the Viennese trichord (prime forms: [0,1,6] and [0,5,6]).

==Historical Russian definition==

In late-19th to early 20th-century Russian musicology, the term trichord (трихорд ()) meant something more specific: a set of three pitches, each at least a tone apart but all within the range of a fourth or fifth.
The possible trichords on C would then be:

Several of these pitch sets interlocking could form a larger set such as a pentatonic scale (such as C–D–F–G–B–C&#x27;). It was first coined by theorist in his 1888 book &quot;Русская народная музыка&quot; (&quot;Russian Folk Music&quot;) to explain the observed traits of the rural Russian folk music (especially from southern regions) that was just beginning to be recorded and published at this time. The term gained wide acceptance and usage, but as time went on it became less relevant to contemporary ethnomusicological findings; ethnomusicologist Kliment Kvitka opined in his 1928 article on Sokalsky&#x27;s theories that it should also properly be used for pitch sets of three notes in the interval of a third, which had been found to be just as characteristic of Russian folk traditions (but which was unknown in Sokalsky&#x27;s time). By mid-century, a group of Moscow-based ethnomusicologists (K. V. Kvitka, Ye. V. Gippius, A. V. Rudnyova, N. M. Bachinskaya, L. S. Mukharinskaya, among others) boycotted the use of the term altogether, yet it could still be seen in the mid-20th century due to its heavy use in the works of earlier theorists.

==Etymology==

The term is derived by analogy from the 20th-century use of the word &quot;tetrachord&quot;. Unlike the tetrachord and hexachord, there is no traditional standard scale arrangement of three notes, nor is the trichord necessarily thought of as a harmonic entity.

Milton Babbitt&#x27;s serial theory of combinatoriality makes much of the properties of three-note, four-note, and six-note segments of a twelve-tone row, which he calls, respectively, &quot;trichords&quot;, &quot;tetrachords&quot;, and &quot;hexachords&quot;, extending the traditional sense of the terms and retaining their implication of contiguity. He usually reserves the term &quot;source set&quot; for their unordered counterparts (especially hexachords), but does occasionally employ terms such as &quot;source tetrachords&quot; and &quot;combinatorial trichords, tetrachords, and hexachords&quot; instead.

Allen Forte occasionally makes informal use of the term &quot;trichord&quot; to mean what he usually calls &quot;sets of three elements&quot;, and other theorists (notably including Howard, and Carlton) mean by the term &quot;triad&quot; a three-note pitch collection which is not necessarily a contiguous segment of a scale or a tone row and not necessarily (in twentieth-century music) tertian or diatonic either.

==Number of unique trichords==

Typically, there are 12 tones in the western scale. Computing the number of unique trichords is a mathematical problem. A computer program can quickly iterate all the triads and remove the ones that are merely transpositions of others, leaving (as noted above) nineteen or, to within inversional equivalence, twelve. As an example, the following list contains all trichords that can be made including the note C, but includes 36 that are merely transpositions or transposed inversions of others:&lt;br&gt;

While some of these chords are recognizable and ubiquitous, many others are unusual or rarely used. Although this list enumerates only trichords containing the note C, the number of &quot;all&quot; possible trichords inside a single octave is 220 (the binomial coefficient of picking three keys out of twelve).

<text>Founded in 1908, The Scout Association of Malta (TSAM) is the Scouting organization in Malta. TSAM has always maintained a high and respectable Scouting tradition. Its leaders and members are committed to further the ideals of Scouting in line with those as traditionally established by the youth movement&#x27;s Founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell, and as further developed by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). TSAM is a forward looking youth movement which, as a non-governmental organisation (NGO), enjoys great respect both locally and internationally. It is the only association in Malta which is recognised by the WOSM, and is also a  member of the European Scout Region.

TSAM&#x27;s motto in Maltese is &quot;Kun Lest&quot;, translating as &quot;Be Prepared&quot; in English. The official logo and membership badge of TSAM features the Maltese eight-pointed cross and the Scout fleur-de-lys logo motif.

==A Brief History==
Scouting, also known as the Scout Movement, is a worldwide youth movement with the stated aim of supporting young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, so that they may play constructive roles in society. Scouting began in 1907 when Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell, a Lieutenant-General in the British Army, held the first Scouting encampment at Brownsea Island in England.

This brief summary and highlight of events and other notable dates of the Scouts in Malta prior, during and soon after the end of the First World War (WW1), gives a very good insight of other Scout activities during this period. Being part of the British Empire, Malta was one of the first countries where Scouting started.

The history of scouting in Malta is truly rich in events that mark its chequered history. The close connection the Islands have with the Scout Movement&#x27;s founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell started when he served in the rank of Captain as Assistant Military Secretary to his uncle, General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth who then was Governor of Malta, between 1890 and 1893.

Scouting in Malta started in 1908, only one year after its establishment in Great Britain, and the Maltese Scouts were the first Association formed outside of the British Isles, together with Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa. Maltese scout troops were officially recognised in 1909 and by the end of the year a total of one hundred and forty four Scouts were enrolled in seven different Troops” (Mizzi, 1989, p40). The 1st Sliema Scout Troop applied to be registered by The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom on October 12, 1909, and, a year later in 1910, it was registered as the second overseas troop with The Boy Scouts Association. At this time there were 338 Boy Scouts and 3 Scoutmasters listed as members in Malta.

Chief Scout Baden-Powell returned many times to the island, including during a part of his delayed honeymoon with Lady Olave, in February 1913, and when he inspected six Troops from Baracca, Dockyard, Floriana, Sliema, Tigne and Valletta. Baden-Powell recognised and shook hands with two of the Scouts he had tea with in London, during the Coronation in 1911.

On 15 September 1913, the Malta Boy Scouts Association was formally registered by Imperial Headquarters in London as an Overseas Branch of the Boy Scouts Association. The first known Maltese scout troop which was registered was the ‘Sliema Land Scouts’ in September 1909 (interestingly, the 1st Sliema Scout Group - Bernard&#x27;s Own - is the oldest surviving active Scout Group outside the UK, and in 2009 they celebrated the 100th Anniversary of scouting in Malta), followed by ‘Barracca Land Scouts’ in December 1911. The Boy Scouts Association formed a local association in Malta on 15 September 1913 which became The Boy Scouts Association Malta Branch.

War was declared in August 1914. The First World War had a significant impact on Scouting on Malta, since most of the Scoutmasters were also British and Maltese Servicemen, and who were ordered to the front in Europe. Within weeks of the declaration of hostilities, these Scouts from Malta were on their way to the Western Front. As camps were cancelled, the Scouts volunteered for war service as interpreters, in hospitals, in convalescent centres and in tea rooms, in the censor&#x27;s office and as coast watchers and messengers.

By November 1915, there were 84 scouts on war duty, 44 of whom had qualified for a special war badge. However, as the latter half of the war progressed, membership rose sharply, and the association&#x27;s general meeting on 30 November 1917, reported 1,200 members with 28 Scout Troops on the Island.

The first troop registered in Gozo was the &#x27;Gozo Secondary School’ in November 1916.

On Sunday October 14, 1917 a rally for all scouts was held at Mosta. On parade were two District Scoutmasters, 20 Scoutmasters, 33 Assistant Scoutmasters, 115 Patrol Leaders and 625 Scouts. The Chief Scout, Lord Methuen presented warrants to the first Island Commissioner of the Malta Boy Scouts Association, Mr. E. Bonavia.

An incident which occurred, and which shed some dark light on the Boy Scouts, was when some allegations were made that Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Movements had an alliance with the Evangelical Alliance, whereas their members were Roman Catholics. Thus, in August 1925, a group of Scouts from the United Kingdom were going to Rome to meet with the Pope, including a party of thirty-four Maltese Scouts. In his book &quot;Scouting in Malta: an Illustrated history&quot; (1989), John A. Mizzi states that Baden-Powell told the Scouts: By your behaviour and good conduct, show to the heads of your Church in Rome that as Scouts you have not two masters but that your only Master is God and your Church. Your Scout masters are merely your elder brothers, showing you how better to do your duty as good Catholics. I want you to remember that and to obey the discipline of your Church. (Mizzi, 1989, p115).

Mizzi (1989) also states that on his last visit to Malta, Baden-Powell said: &quot;I see a great change for the better in these boys as compared with the boys of the old days, now, as Scouts, they have interests, hobbies and aims in life and I would like your Scouters to realise that the time and energy which they put into Scouting is not thrown away; they are doing a big national service in giving their boys health of body, mind and spirit. They are thereby giving appreciable help respectively to the Church and Education.&quot; (Mizzi, 1989, p179).

Shortly before his death in 1940, Baden-Powell wrote in a final letter to the Islands&#x27; Scouts: &quot;to congratulate my old friends, the Maltese on the plucky way they have stood up to the infernal bombing of the Italians ... They have the spirit of fearlessness and patience which enables them to face danger with a smile to stick it out to the triumphant finish ...&quot;

The Second World War saw similar service from the Maltese Scouts, as they supported the Allied forces throughout the aerial siege of 1940 to 1943. This resulted in The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s branch and its members receiving a collective award of the Bronze Cross, &quot;in recognition of their courage and devotion to duty in the face of continuous enemy action in the war for freedom&quot;.

The Maltese Boy Scouts Association was then formed in October 1966, right after Malta became an independent nation earlier in 1964. In October 1966, an extraordinary general meeting of The Boy Scouts Association Malta Branch dissolved the branch and the Malta Boy Scouts Association was formed independent from The Scout Association of the United Kingdom. The association became a member of the Boy Scouts International Conference in December 1966. The vice-president of the International Conference, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, presented the registration certificate to the Chief Scout of Malta. In the years which followed, the association changed its name to The Scout Association of Malta (TSAM).

In 1966, the association became an independent body and a full member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). In 1976 the name of the association was re-styled as &quot;The Malta Scouts Association&quot;, and by a further amendment of its Policy, Organisation and Rules (P.O.R.) of 31 October 1978, in order to comply with the provisions of Act XXII of 1978 of the Laws of Malta, the name of the association was established as &quot;THE SCOUT ASSOCIATION&quot;.

In 2007, TSAM inaugurated the Beaver section in its training programmes.

Since its foundation, Scouting has been one of the &quot;most active and strongest youth organization on the Island&quot; (&quot;Brief History,&quot; 2012).

==Origins of Scouting in Gozo==
Introduction: The Scout Movement in Gozo owes its beginning to Mr Carmelo Joseph Flores, a Maltese teacher at the Secondary School in Gozo. The first Scout Troop, known as The Gozo Secondary School Troop (No. 16), was established on 1 November 1916 and it was registered on 24 November 1916. The Troop, with Mr Flores as Scoutmaster, was recognised officially by the Scout Association of Malta on 26 December 1916. On the day of registration, the Troop consisted of 19 Scouts, but a year later, the number had increased to about 27. One of the first problems which the Troop had to face, was that of having a place where to hold its meetings. Through the intervention of W.C. Millard, Gozo Secretary for the Government, the Scouts were allocated a Government property at Triq Żenqa in the Citadel. Since 1890, this building had housed the archives of the Gozo Law Courts but it was then refurbished so that it could be used by the Scouts.

This early experience of Scouting in Gozo is followed by a period during which there is no evidence of any form of Scouting activity on the island. The movement became popular again in the 1930s, when several Boy Scout Groups cropped up in Gozo namely Victoria, Lyceum, Għarb, Għasri, Żebbuġ, Xagħra, Xewkija, Għajnsielem and Nadur. A census on the number of Scouts in Malta, held in 1938, shows that in Gozo there were 359 Scouts in all: Għajnsielem 38, Għarb 37, Għasri 31, Lyceum 27, Nadur 68, Victoria 47, Xewkija 25, Xagħra 21 and Żebbuġ 15. At the time the Scouts used to meet in a building close to the chapel known as San Ġakbu in Main Square, nowadays known as Independence Square. When, World War II broke out, membership dwindled. However, during the war, the Victoria Scouts played a part in the ‘war effort’. The Scouts were used as messengers to give air raid alarms between police stations and churches.

When the war ended, the few members that had survived the war used to meet in Casa Bondì in the Citadel. In 1948, the Victoria Scout Group was amalgamated with the Salesian Scout Group of the Don Bosco Oratory. However, due to the numerous activities organised at the Oratory, the interest in the Scout Group waned gradually and this was dissolved in 1964. During the 1950s, the Lyceum Scout Troop was formed again. However its existence was short-lived. During the same period, other Troops were formed at Sannat, the Victoria Primary School, Għajnsielem, Nadur and the Xagħra Catholic Action Movement. These too functioned for only a short while.

The Victoria Scout Group: The Victoria Scout Group, as it is known today, was officially inaugurated on 13 July 1963. The first Group Scout Leader (GSL) was Mr. Joseph G. Grech, known as ‘Skip’ and the chaplain of the group was Fr Albert Curmi.

The Group used to meet in a house in Għajn Qatet Street, owned by the Group Scout Leader&#x27;s mother, Mrs Ġorġa Grech, who offered her house free of charge to be used ‘temporarily’ as the Group&#x27;s headquarters. The headquarters were opened by the District Commissioner, Mr Anton Vassallo and were blessed by H.L. Mons. Giuseppe Pace, Bishop of Gozo. Led by Mr Joe Grech, the Group continued to grow from strength to strength. In 1963, it started to publish its own newssheet. Its members took part in the fund-raising activity known as ‘bob-ajob’ week. The group had its own Scout band. It organised hikes and held two camps annually, in summer and during the Easter holidays. Its members took part in expeditions both locally and abroad. It performed good deeds. It helped out whenever it was asked to. Most important of all, it gave its members an education for life, according to the Scouting Method. The first GSL of the Group, Mr Joe Grech remained at the helm for 27 years. Towards the end of 1990, Mr Grech was chosen by the Scout Association of Malta to take up the post of Chief Commissioner of the association. This meant a new GSL was needed. The person chosen was Mr Lorrie Saliba who still occupies this post. In July 1989, the dream of the group of having its own premises came true when, after several years of hard work by council members, supporters, former Scouts and friends of the Group, a new Scout headquarters was inaugurated in Santa Dminka Street, Victoria. The Group had occupied the house lent by Mrs Ġorġa Grech for 27 years. Unfortunately, this great benefactor of the group was not there to see the realisation of this dream because she had died in March 1989. The Group is forever indebted to her. Were it not for her gesture way back in 1963, to provide the group with a premises it could call its headquarters, the story of the Group might have been quite different. The story of the headquarters did not end here. Another inauguration ceremony, this time of an extension to the headquarters was held in March 2001. The original headquarters had become too small to accommodate the ever increasing number of members so the Group had to undertake yet another major project to improve its facilities.

Both headquarters had their share of distinguished visitors. In February 1964, the Chief Scout of the Commonwealth Sir Charles McLean paid a visit. On 7 November 1998, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the arrival of Scouting in Malta, it was the turn of Dr Charles Moreillon, Secretary General of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement. Along the years, various presidents of Malta visited the headquarters. There were also visits by prime ministers, ministers and parliamentary secretaries, MEPs, bishops, officials of the Scout Association of Malta, various Scout groups from Malta and Scouts from all around the world. The headquarters also hosts foreign Scout Groups who are visiting Gozo.

The Group was also present during certain historical events, such as the consecration of Bishop N. Cauchi in 1967 and that of Bishop M. Grech in 2005 and the visit to Gozo by Pope John Paul II in May 1990. In 1967 and 1992, it took part in the activities held on the occasion of the visits to Gozo by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The present Group is still doing its best to continue the tradition of Scouting and offer a quality as well as fun experience to its members. While the training programme has evolved along the years to meet the needs and realities of today&#x27;s children and youths, the core values of Scouting have not changed. The Scout Law and Scout Promise are still the same and bind members to do their duty to God and country and to be of service to others. The principle of learning by doing, working in a team, caring for the environment, the support provided by adults and the importance of youth involvement from the planning stage to the actual carrying out of the activities undertaken by the Group are still of the utmost importance. The Group&#x27;s members attend the weekly meetings at headquarters as well as other outdoor activities and Group and sectional camps. Members of the Group participate in national activities such as national camps, the annual rally for all the Scout and Girl Guide Groups in Malta and Gozo, Scout Forums and joint activities between both Maltese or foreign Scout groups. They take part in expeditions around the Maltese Islands and abroad. They participate in youth exchange projects funded by the EU. The group still issues its Newssheet on a quarterly basis. Scouts carry out clean-ups or tree planting sessions in different localities. Leaders of the Group attend training courses at Island Headquarters in Malta before they are registered as qualified leaders. The Victoria Scout Group puts a special emphasis on the importance of being of service to others. Each year it organises different fund raising activities for the benefit of other philanthropic organisations, both local as well as international ones. These include car washes, walks for charity, bicycle hikes, lunches, barbeques, blood donating sessions, providing support in activities organised by the local councils and visits to the elderly. In this way it instills in its members the importance of thinking of others before one&#x27;s self, which words are an integral part of the Scout Law and Promise.

The Gozitan Scouts have participated in almost all the World Scout Jamborees held from 1920 onwards. Jamborees are international camps held once every four years in different countries where Scouts from all over the world come together for around ten days. The last Jamboree was held in Japan in July and August 2015 and the participants amounted to around 33,600. The next Jamboree will be held in the US in 2019 and the Victoria Scout Group will be represented by 18 members. In 2013, the Group celebrated its 50th anniversary by publishing a book which narrates its history. The author of this book is former Venture Scout Leader, Mr Carmel C.Cachia. In 2016, the Group celebrated the 100th anniversary of Scouting in Gozo. A parade was held around the streets of Victoria. The majority of the Maltese Scout groups and several Scout bands took part in this rally.

Presently, Gozo has 2 Scout Groups, the Victoria Scout Group and the Xagħra Scout Group. The latter Group was one of the first Scout Groups to be set up in Gozo and was one of the most active groups in the 1930s. In 1952 another attempt at reviving the group was made. In the 1970s, on the initiative of Vincent Vella, a leader with the Żejtun Group, the Xagħra Scout Group was revived. The same Scout Leader was instrumental in reopening the Xagħra Scout Group in May 2008. This Scout Group recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. Presently the Victoria Scout Group boasts of around 130 members, divided into four sections: Cubs, Scouts, Venture Scouts and Rover Scouts. This number also includes the members of the Group Council. The number of members in the Xagħra Scout Group amount to 111. This also includes members of their Group Council. The Xagħra Group is divided into four sections: the Beaver Colony, the Pack Section, the Scout Troop and the Venture Unit. The first GSL was Mr Vincent Vella who occupied the post from 2008 to 2012. In June 2012, Ms Loraine Borg became the 2nd GSL for the Xagħra Group. The present Group Scout Leader is Mr Josmar Azzopardi and he has occupied the post since October 2017. The Xagħra Scout Group can also boast of owning its own headquarters which was inaugurated in May 2016. During the year, the two Scout Groups organise several joint activities. Throughout the years, the Victoria Scout Group has received several recognitions for the services rendered to the Gozitan community. The Venture Unit was placed 2nd amongst 18 submissions in the Għarfien Nazzjonali Żgħażagħ fis-Soċjetà 2003. In 2007 the Group was awarded Ġieħ Għawdex by the Circolo Gozitano. In 2010, it was awarded Ġieħ il-Belt Vittoria by the local Council of Victoria. In 2010, it was chosen as the President&#x27;s Group in recognition for its efforts to raise a considerable amount of money (€4606) for the Strina campaign in aid of the Community Chest Fund.

==Organisation==
TSAM has at present four (4) Scouting districts: the main island of Malta has three of the Districts, with the fourth being the neighbouring island of Gozo (which currently has two groups, that of the towns of Victoria and of Xaghra .

Each TSAM scout group belongs to a particular district depending on its location. Around forty (40) Scout Groups are registered and active with TSAM which boasts a membership in the region of 3,000 youths and approximately 500 adult leaders, makingTSAM the largest voluntary organisation of the Maltese Islands.

There is a Chief Scout and an Island Headquarters of around 15 leaders and administrators.

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a values-oriented system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This is achieved by:

• involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process

• using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person

• assisting them to establish a values system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law

Scouting is about preparing for life. The motto &quot;Be Prepared&quot; has many applications especially when it comes to childhood development and its final scope is to aid in the development of active and responsible citizens thus contributing to the creation of a better world.

TSAM promotes the social, physical, intellectual, characterial, emotional and spiritual formation of its young adult members through a policy of inclusivity. TSAM offers its youth programme in five sections in accordance to the different age groups: Beavers (5 to 7), Cub Scouts (7 to 11), Scouts (11 to 14 1/2), Venture Scouts (14 1/2 to 18 ), Rover Scouts (18 to 26 ) and Leaders (18 to 65) which are divided into Scout Groups according to their locality.

In Scouting, children experience competitive and non-competitive activities that include physical and problem-solving activities, outdoor activities (such as water-sports, cooking, hiking, walking, aerial challenges and much more). Each Scout Group and Section within our Groups organize weekly outdoor activities ranging from community work to hikes, camping and life skills, which activities are all of a non-formal educational nature.

At national level, TSAM, through its departments, handles all the leaders&#x27; training, updating of all youth section&#x27;s programmes, organizes national events, manages administrative details and takes care of its national assets such as the Ghajn Tuffieha International Scout Campsite.

TSAM is also active internationally and apart from participating at World Scout Jamborees and similar gatherings, it has also been in a position to contribute to Scouting at a European Level with members from the National Team actively assisting at such fora.

==Sections==
youth members follow programmes in the following age sections:
*Beaver scouts - 5-7
*Cub scouts - 7-11
*Scouts - 10.5-14.5
*Venture scouts - 14.5-18
*Rover scouts - 18-26

<doc id="427917" wikidata="Q584617" url="?curid=427917" title="Treaty of London (1913)">
<text>The Treaty of London (1913) was signed on 30 May following the London Conference of 1912–1913. It dealt with the territorial adjustments arising out of the conclusion of the First Balkan War. The London Conference had ended on 23 January 1913, when the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état took place and Ottoman Grand Vizier Kâmil Pasha was forced to resign. Coup leader Enver Pasha withdrew the Ottoman Empire from the Conference, and the Treaty of London was signed without the presence of the Ottoman delegation.

==Combatants==
The combatants were the victorious Balkan League (Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Montenegro) and the defeated Ottoman Empire. Representing the Great Powers were the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.

==History==

Hostilities had officially ceased on 2 December 1912, except for Greece that had not participated in the first truce. Three principal points were in dispute:
* the status of the territory of present-day Albania, the vast majority of which had been conquered especially by Serbia, but also small regions by Montenegro, and Greece
* the status of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar formally under the protection of Austria-Hungary since the Treaty of Berlin in 1878
* the status of the other territories taken by the Allies: Kosovo vilayet; Macedonia; and Thrace

The Treaty was negotiated in London at an international conference which had opened there in December 1912, following the declaration of independence by Albania on 28 November 1912.

Austria-Hungary and Italy strongly supported the creation of an independent Albania. In part, this was consistent with Austria-Hungary&#x27;s previous policy of resisting Serb expansion to the Adriatic; Italy had designs on the territory, manifested in 1939. Russia supported Serbia and Montenegro. Germany and Britain remained neutral. The balance of power struck between the members of the Balkan League had been on the assumption that no Albanian polity would be formed and the later Albanian territory would be split between them.

==Terms==

The terms enforced by the Great Powers were:
* All European territory of the Ottoman Empire west of the line between Enos on the Aegean Sea and Midia on the Black Sea was ceded to the Balkan League, except Albania.
* His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans declares that he cedes to their Majesties the Allied Sovereigns the island of Crete and that he renounces in their favour all rights of sovereignty and all other rights which he possessed in that island.
* The borders of Albania and all other questions concerning Albania were to be settled by the Great Powers.

However, the division of the territories ceded to the Balkan League was not addressed in the Treaty, and Serbia refused to carry out the division agreed with Bulgaria in their treaty of March 1912. As a result of Bulgarian dissatisfaction with the &quot;de facto&quot; military division of Macedonia, the Second Balkan War broke out between the combatants on 16 June 1913. The Bulgarians were defeated, and the Ottomans made some gains west of the Enos-Midia line. A final peace was agreed at the Treaty of Bucharest on 12 August 1913. A separate treaty, the Treaty of Constantinople, was concluded between the Bulgarians and Turks, largely defining the modern-day borders between the two countries.

==Perceptions==
The delineation of the exact boundaries of the Albanian state under the Protocol of Florence (17 December 1913) was highly unpopular among the Greek population of southern Albania, who after their revolt managed to declare the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, was internationally recognised as an autonomous region inside Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Corfu.

Albanians have tended to regard the Treaty as an injustice imposed by the Great Powers, as roughly half of the predominantly Albanian territories and 40% of the population were left outside the new country&#x27;s borders.

<doc id="427922" wikidata="Q1260022" url="?curid=427922" title="Drug rehabilitation">
<text>Drug rehabilitation is the process of medical or psychotherapeutic treatment for dependency on psychoactive substances such as alcohol, prescription drugs, and street drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines. The general intent is to enable the patient to confront substance dependence, if present, and stop substance misuse to avoid the psychological, legal, financial, social, and medical consequences that can be caused.

Treatment includes medication for comorbidities, counseling by experts, and sharing of experience with other recovering individuals.

==Psychological dependency==
Psychological dependency is addressed in many drug rehabilitation programs by attempting to teach patients new methods of interacting in a drug-free environment. In particular, patients are generally encouraged, or possibly even required, to not associate with peers who still use addictive substances. Twelve-step programs encourage addicts not only to stop using alcohol or other drugs but to examine and change habits related to their addictions. Many programs emphasize that recovery is an ongoing process without culmination. For legal drugs such as alcohol, complete abstention—rather than attempts at moderation, which may lead to relapse—is also emphasized (&quot;One is too many, and a thousand is never enough.&quot;)

Whether moderation is achievable by those with a history of misuse remains a controversial point.

The brain&#x27;s chemical structure is altered by addictive substances and these changes are present long after an individual stops using. This change in brain structure increases the risk of relapse, making treatment an important part of the rehabilitation process.

==Types==
Various types of programs offer help in drug rehabilitation, including residential treatment (in-patient/out-patient), local support groups, extended care centers, recovery or sober houses, addiction counselling, mental health, and medical care. Some rehab centers offer age- and gender-specific programs.

In an American survey by three separate institutions (the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, Rational Recovery Systems and the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors) measuring treatment responses on the Spiritual Belief Scale (a scale measuring belief in the four spiritual characteristics Alcoholics Anonymous identified by Ernest Kurtz); the scores were found to explain 41% of the variance in the treatment provider&#x27;s responses on the Addiction Belief Scale (a scale measuring adherence to the disease model or the free-will model addiction).

Effective treatment addresses the multiple needs of the patient rather than treating addiction alone. In addition, medically assisted drug detoxification or alcohol detoxification alone is ineffective as a treatment for addiction. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends detoxification followed by both medication (where applicable) and behavioral therapy, followed by relapse prevention. According to NIDA, effective treatment must address medical and mental health services as well as follow-up options, such as community or family-based recovery support systems. Whatever the methodology, patient motivation is an important factor in treatment success.

For individuals addicted to prescription drugs, treatments tend to be similar to those who are addicted to drugs affecting the same brain systems. Medication like methadone and buprenorphine can be used to treat addiction to prescription opiates, and behavioral therapies can be used to treat addiction to prescription stimulants, benzodiazepines, and other drugs.

Types of behavioral therapy include:
* Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which seeks to help patients to recognize, avoid and cope with situations in which they are most likely to relapse.
* Multidimensional family therapy, which is designed to support the recovery of the patient by improving family functioning.
* Motivational interviewing, which is designed to increase patient motivation to change behavior and enter treatment.
* Motivational incentives, which uses positive reinforcement to encourage abstinence from the addictive substance.
* EEG Biofeedback augmented treatment improves abstinence rates of 12-step, faith-based, and medically assisted addiction for cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol use disorder, and opioid addictions.
Treatment can be a long process and the duration is dependent upon the patient&#x27;s needs and history of substance use. Research has shown that most patients need at least three months of treatment and longer durations are associated with better outcomes. Prescription drug addiction does not discriminate. It affects people from all walks of life and can be a devastatingly destructive force.

===Medications===
Certain opioid medications such as methadone and more buprenorphine are widely used to treat addiction and dependence on other opioids such as heroin, morphine or oxycodone. Methadone and buprenorphine are maintenance therapies intended to reduce cravings for opiates, thereby reducing illegal drug use, and the risks associated with it, such as disease, arrest, incarceration, and death, in line with the philosophy of harm reduction. Both drugs may be used as maintenance medications (taken for an indefinite period of time), or used as detoxification aids. All available studies collected in the 2005 Australian National Evaluation of Pharmacotherapies for Opioid Dependence suggest that maintenance treatment is preferable, with very high rates (79–100%) of relapse within three months of detoxification from levo-α-acetylmethadol (LAAM), buprenorphine, and methadone.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), patients stabilized on adequate, sustained doses of methadone or buprenorphine can keep their jobs, avoid crime and violence, and reduce their exposure to HIV and Hepatitis C by stopping or reducing injection drug use and drug-related high risk sexual behavior. Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist with few side effects. It is usually prescribed in outpatient medical conditions. Naltrexone blocks the euphoric effects of alcohol and opiates. Naltrexone cuts relapse risk in the first three months by about 36%. However, it is far less effective in helping patients maintain abstinence or retaining them in the drug-treatment system (retention rates average 12% at 90 days for naltrexone, average 57% at 90 days for buprenorphine, average 61% at 90 days for methadone).

Ibogaine is a hallucinogenic drug promoted by certain fringe groups to interrupt both physical dependence and psychological craving to a broad range of drugs including narcotics, stimulants, alcohol, and nicotine. To date, there have never been any controlled studies showing it to be effective, and it is not accepted as a treatment by physicians, pharmacists, or addictionologist. There have also been several deaths related to ibogaine use, which causes tachycardia and long QT syndrome. The drug is an illegal Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, and the foreign facilities in which it is administered tend to have little oversight and range from motel rooms to one moderately-sized rehabilitation center.

A few antidepressants have been proven to be helpful in the context of smoking cessation/nicotine addiction. These medications include bupropion and nortriptyline. Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of nor-epinephrine and dopamine and has been FDA approved for smoking cessation, while nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant which has been used to aid in smoking cessation it has not been FDA approved for this indication.

Acamprosate, disulfiram and topiramate (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) are also used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks, even months. Disulfiram produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high-risk situations. Patients who wish to continue drinking or may be likely to relapse should not take disulfiram as it can result in the disulfiram-alcohol reaction mentioned previously, which is very serious and can even be fatal.

Nitrous oxide, also sometimes known as laughing gas, is a legally available gas used for anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, in food preparation, and for the fueling of rocket and racing engines. People who use substances also sometimes use gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it is popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit substances. Misuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency that can lead to nerve damage.

Although dangerous and addictive in its own right, nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective treatment for a number of addictions.

===Residential treatment===
In-patient residential treatment for people with an alcohol use disorder is usually quite expensive without insurance. Most American programs follow a 28–30 day program length. The length is based solely upon providers&#x27; experience. During the 1940s, clients stayed about one week to get over the physical changes, another week to understand the program, and another week or two to become stable. 70% to 80% of American residential alcohol treatment programs provide 12-step support services. These include, but are not limited to AA, Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous and Al-Anon. One recent study suggests the importance of family participation in residential treatment patient retention, finding &quot;increased program completion rate for those with a family member or significant other involved in a seven-day family program&quot;.

=== Brain implants ===
Patients with severe opioid addiction are being given brain implants to help reduce their cravings, in the first trial of its kind in the US. Treatment starts with a series of brain scans. Surgery follows with doctors making a small hole in the skull to insert a tiny 1mm electrode in the specific area of the brain that regulates impulses such as addiction and self-control. This treatment is for those who have failed every other treatment, whether that is medicine, behavioral therapy, and/or social interventions. It is a very rigorous trial with oversight from ethicists and regulators and many other governing bodies.

==Recovery==
The definition of recovery remains divided and subjective in drug rehabilitation, as there are no set standards for measuring recovery. The Betty Ford Institute defined recovery as achieving complete abstinence as well as personal well-being while other studies have considered &quot;near abstinence&quot; as a definition. 

The Recovery Model originates in the psychiatric survivor movement in the US, which argues that receiving a certain diagnoses can be stigmatizing and disempowering. Some characteristics of the Recovery Model are social inclusion, empowerment to overcome substance use, focusing on strengths of the client instead of their deficits and providing help living more fulfilling lives in the presence of symptoms of addiction. Another key component of the Recovery Model is the collaborative relationship between client and provider in developing the client&#x27;s path to abstinence. Under the Recovery Model a program is personally designed to meet an individual clients needs, and does not include a standard set of steps one must go through.

The Recovery Model uses integral theory: a four-part approach focusing on the individual, the collective society, along with individual and external factors. The four quadrants corresponding with each in Integral Theory are Consciousness, Behavior, Culture and Systems. Quadrant One deals with the neurological aspect of addiction. Quadrant Two focuses on building self-esteem and a feeling of connectedness, sometimes through spirituality. Quadrant three works on mending the &quot;eroded relationships&quot; caused by active addiction. Quadrant Four often involves facing the harsh consequences of drug use such as unemployment, legal discrepancies, or eviction. The use of integral theory aims to break the dichotomy of &quot;using&quot; or &quot;not using&quot; and focuses instead on emotional, spiritual, and intellectual growth, along with physical wellness.

==Criminal justice==
Drug rehabilitation is sometimes part of the criminal justice system. People convicted of minor drug offenses may be sentenced to rehabilitation instead of prison, and those convicted of driving while intoxicated are sometimes required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. There are a great number of ways to address an alternative sentence in a drug possession or DUI case; increasingly, American courts are willing to explore outside-the-box methods for delivering this service. There have been lawsuits filed, and won, regarding the requirement of attending Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step meetings as being inconsistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, mandating separation of church and state.

In some cases, individuals can be court-ordered to drug rehabilitation by the state through legislation like the Marchman Act.

==Counseling==
Traditional addiction treatment is based primarily on counseling.

Counselors help individuals with identifying behaviors and problems related to their addiction. It can be done on an individual basis, but it&#x27;s more common to find it in a group setting and can include crisis counseling, weekly or daily counseling, and drop-in counseling supports. Counselors are trained to develop recovery programs that help to reestablish healthy behaviors and provide coping strategies whenever a situation of risk happens. It&#x27;s very common to see them also work with family members who are affected by the addictions of the individual, or in a community to prevent addiction and educate the public. Counselors should be able to recognize how addiction affects the whole person and those around him or her.
Counseling is also related to &quot;Intervention&quot;; a process in which the addict&#x27;s family and loved ones request help from a professional to get an individual into drug treatment.

This process begins with a professionals&#x27; first goal: breaking down denial of the person with the addiction. Denial implies a lack of willingness from the patients or fear to confront the true nature of the addiction and to take any action to improve their lives, instead of continuing the destructive behavior. Once this has been achieved, the counselor coordinates with the addict&#x27;s family to support them in getting the individual to drug rehabilitation immediately, with concern and care for this person. Otherwise, this person will be asked to leave and expect no support of any kind until going into drug rehabilitation or alcoholism treatment. An intervention can also be conducted in the workplace environment with colleagues instead of family.

One approach with limited applicability is the sober coach. In this approach, the client is serviced by the provider(s) in his or her home and workplace—for any efficacy, around-the-clock—who functions much like a nanny to guide or control the patient&#x27;s behavior.

===Twelve-step programs===
The disease model of addiction has long contended the maladaptive patterns of alcohol and substance use displays addicted individuals are the result of a lifelong disease that is biological in origin and exacerbated by environmental contingencies. This conceptualization renders the individual essentially powerless over his or her problematic behaviors and unable to remain sober by himself or herself, much as individuals with a terminal illness are unable to fight the disease by themselves without medication. Behavioral treatment, therefore, necessarily requires individuals to admit their addiction, renounce their former lifestyle, and seek a supportive social network that can help them remain sober. Such approaches are the quintessential features of Twelve-step programs, originally published in the book Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939. These approaches have met considerable amounts of criticism, coming from opponents who disapprove of the spiritual-religious orientation on both psychological and legal grounds. Opponents also contend that it lacks valid scientific evidence for claims of efficacy. However, there is survey-based research that suggests there is a correlation between attendance and alcohol sobriety. Different results have been reached for other drugs, with the twelve steps being less beneficial for addicts to illicit substances, and least beneficial to those addicted to the physiologically and psychologically addicting opioids, for which maintenance therapies are the gold standard of care.

===SMART Recovery===
SMART Recovery was founded by Joe Gerstein in 1994 by basing REBT as a foundation. It gives importance to the human agency in overcoming addiction and focuses on self-empowerment and self-reliance. It does not subscribe to disease theory and powerlessness. The group meetings involve open discussions, questioning decisions and forming corrective measures through assertive exercises. It does not involve a lifetime membership concept, but people can opt to attend meetings, and choose not to after gaining recovery. Objectives of the SMART Recovery programs are:
* Building and Maintaining Motivation,
* Coping with Urges,
* Managing Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors,
* Living a Balanced Life.
This is considered to be similar to other self-help groups who work within mutual aid concepts.

===Client-centered approaches===
In his influential book, &quot;Client-Centered Therapy&quot;, in which he presented the client-centered approach to therapeutic change, psychologist Carl Rogers proposed there are three necessary and sufficient conditions for personal change: unconditional positive regard, accurate empathy, and genuineness. Rogers believed the presence of these three items, in the therapeutic relationship, could help an individual overcome any troublesome issue, including but not limited to alcohol use disorder. To this end, a 1957 study compared the relative effectiveness of three different psychotherapies in treating alcoholics who had been committed to a state hospital for sixty days: a therapy based on two-factor learning theory, client-centered therapy, and psychoanalytic therapy. Though the authors expected the two-factor theory to be the most effective, it actually proved to be deleterious in the outcome. Surprisingly, client-centered therapy proved most effective. It has been argued, however, these findings may be attributable to the profound difference in therapist outlook between the two-factor and client-centered approaches, rather than to client-centered techniques. The authors note two-factor theory involves stark disapproval of the clients&#x27; &quot;irrational behavior&quot; (p. 350); this notably negative outlook could explain the results.

A variation of Rogers&#x27; approach has been developed in which clients are directly responsible for determining the goals and objectives of the treatment. Known as Client-Directed Outcome-Informed therapy (CDOI), this approach has been utilized by several drug treatment programs, such as Arizona&#x27;s Department of Health Services.

===Psychoanalysis===
Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic approach to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also explained substance use. This orientation suggests the main cause of the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, and at the same time to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesized specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesized to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of teratogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural, and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophobia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings to regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.

===Relapse prevention===
An influential cognitive-behavioral approach to addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt&#x27;s (1985) Relapse Prevention approach. Marlatt describes four psycho-social processes relevant to the addiction and relapse processes: self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one&#x27;s ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancy refers to an individual&#x27;s expectations about the psychoactive effects of an addictive substance. Attributions of causality refer to an individual&#x27;s pattern of beliefs that relapse to drug use is a result of internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in the consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.

For example: As a result of heavy traffic, a recovering alcoholic may decide one afternoon to exit the highway and travel on side roads. This will result in the creation of a high-risk situation when he realizes he is inadvertently driving by his old favorite bar. If this individual can employ successful coping strategies, such as distracting himself from his cravings by turning on his favorite music, then he will avoid the relapse risk (PATH 1) and heighten his efficacy for future abstinence. If, however, he lacks coping mechanisms—for instance, he may begin ruminating on his cravings (PATH 2)—then his efficacy for abstinence will decrease, his expectations of positive outcomes will increase, and he may experience a lapse—an isolated return to substance intoxication. So doing results in what Marlatt refers to as the Abstinence Violation Effect, characterized by guilt for having gotten intoxicated and low efficacy for future abstinence in similar tempting situations. This is a dangerous pathway, Marlatt proposes, to full-blown relapse.

===Cognitive therapy===
An additional cognitively-based model of substance use recovery has been offered by Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy and championed in his 1993 book &quot;Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse&quot;. This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as &quot;I am undesirable,&quot; activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits of substance use and, consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs (&quot;I can handle getting high just this one more time&quot;) are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist&#x27;s job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunction. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, homework assignments and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.

===Emotion regulation and mindfulness===
A growing literature is demonstrating the importance of emotion regulation in the treatment of substance use. Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psycho-pharmacological pathways, an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array of substance use. Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on negative reinforcement as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of nicotine withdrawal or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance use, including the treatment of polysubstance use disorder and tobacco smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.

===Dual diagnosis===
People who are diagnosed with a mental health disorder and a simultaneous substance use disorder are known as having a dual diagnosis. For example, someone with bipolar disorder who also has an alcohol use disorder would have dual diagnosis. On such occasions, two treatment plans are needed with the mental health disorder requiring treatment first. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 45 percent of people with addiction have a co-occurring mental health disorder.

==Behavioral models==

Behavioral models make use of principles of functional analysis of drinking behavior. Behavior models exist for both working with the person using the substance (community reinforcement approach) and their family (community reinforcement approach and family training). Both these models have had considerable research success for both efficacy and effectiveness. This model lays much emphasis on the use of problem-solving techniques as a means of helping the addict to overcome his/her addiction.

The way researchers think about how addictions are formed shapes the models we have. Four main Behavioral Models of addiction exist: the Moral Model, Disease Model, Socio-Cultural Model and Psycho-dynamic Model. The Moral Model of addiction theorizes that addiction is a moral weakness and that it is the sole fault of the person for becoming addicted. Supporters of the Moral Model view drug use as a choice, even for those who are addicted, and addicts as people of bad character. Disease Model of addiction frames substance abuse as &#x27;a chronic relapsing disease that changes the structure and function of the brain&#x27;. Research conducted on the neurobiological factors of addiction has proven to have mixed results, and the only treatment idea it offers is abstinence. The Socio-Cultural Model tries to provide an explanation of how certain populations are more susceptible to substance abuse than others. It focuses on how discrimination, poor quality of life, lack of opportunity and other problems common in marginalized communities can make them vulnerable to addiction. The Psycho-Dynamic Model looks at trauma and mental illness as a precursor to addiction. Many rehabilitation centers treat &quot;co-occurring&quot; disorders, which refer to substance abuse disorder paired with a mental health diagnosis.

== Barriers to treatment in the US ==
Barriers to accessing drug treatment may worsen negative health outcomes and further exacerbate health inequalities in the United States. Stigmatization of drug use, the War on Drugs and criminalization, and the social determinants of health should all be considered when discussing access to drug treatment and potential barriers.

Broad categories of barriers to drug treatment are: absences of problem, negative social support, fear of treatment, privacy concerns, time conflict, poor treatment availability, and admission difficulty. Other barriers to treatment include high costs, lack of tailored programs to address specific needs, and prerequisites that require participants to be house, abstinent from all substances, and/or employed. (See low-threshold treatment and housing first for more context on the latter point.)

=== Loss of Child/Dependent Access ===

In certain states, providers due to mandatory reporting methods and guidelines inform Child Protective Services of substance abusing parents for Schedule 1 substances including cannabis/marijuana. If a mother tests positive for using the substance during pregnancy in South Carolina she may be required to forfeit her child.

Further, barriers to treatment can vary depending on the geographical location, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and status of past or current criminal justice system involvement of the person seeking treatment.

==Criticism==

Despite ongoing efforts to combat addiction, there has been evidence of clinics billing patients for treatments that may not guarantee their recovery. This is a major problem as there are numerous claims of fraud in drug rehabilitation centers, where these centers are billing insurance companies for under-delivering much-needed medical treatment while exhausting patients&#x27; insurance benefits. In California, there are movements and laws regarding this matter, particularly the California Insurance Fraud Prevention Act (IFPA) which declares it unlawful to unknowingly conduct such businesses.

Under the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity Act, rehabilitation centers are able to bill insurance companies for substance use treatment. With long wait lists in limited state-funded rehabilitation centers, controversial private centers rapidly emerged. One popular model, known as the Florida Model for rehabilitation centers, is often criticized for fraudulent billing to insurance companies. Under the guise of helping patients with opioid addiction, these centers would offer addicts free rent or up to $500 per month to stay in their &quot;sober homes&quot;, then charge insurance companies as high as $5,000 to $10,000 per test for simple urine tests. Little attention is paid to patients in terms of addiction intervention as these patients have often been known to continue drug use during their stay in these centers. Since 2015, these centers have been under federal and state criminal investigation. As of 2017 in California, there are only 16 investigators in the CA Department of Health Care Services investigating over 2,000 licensed rehab centers.

==By country==
===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan since the Taliban took power in 2021, they have forced drug addicts into compulsory drug rehab.

===China===
As of 2013 China has compulsory drug rehabilitation centers. It was reported in 2018 1.3 million drug addicts were treated in China&#x27;s compulsory detox centers.

Compulsory drug rehabilitation has a long history in China: The Mao Zedong government is credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform. Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region.

===Indonesia===
In 2015 the National Narcotics Board (Indonesia) was pushing for compulsory drug treatment for people with drug dependence.

===Iran===
According to statistics best case scenario less than a 25% of addicts go back to being healthy.
There are two types of rehab one is Revolutionary Guard Corp or FARAJA run article 16 quarantine which is part of operations cleaning the cities from addicts and homeless just as well, the others article 15 and article 17 run by others including State Welfare Organization of Iran and also those run by Ministry of health and medical education. There are also places called Trust houses since July 2023 run by IRGC.

===Italy===
In 1963, Pierino Gelmini founded Comunità Incontro, a drug rehabilitation center in Amelia, Italy.

<text>Condensed milk is cow&#x27;s milk from which water has been removed (roughly 60% of it). It is most often found with sugar added, in the form of sweetened condensed milk, to the extent that the terms &quot;condensed milk&quot; and &quot;sweetened condensed milk&quot; are often used interchangeably today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product, which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. The product is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries.

A related product is evaporated milk, which has undergone a lengthier preservation process because it is not sweetened. Evaporated milk is known in some countries as unsweetened condensed milk.

==History==

According to the writings of Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century the Tatars were able to condense milk. Marco Polo reported that of milk paste was carried by each man, who would subsequently mix the product with water. However, this probably refers to the soft Tatar curd (katyk), which can be made into a drink (&quot;ayran&quot;) by diluting it, and therefore refers to fermented, not fresh, milk concentrate.

Nicolas Appert condensed milk in France in 1820 and in 1835, English civil engineer William Newton added sugar as an additional measure of preservation. Before these developments, milk could be kept fresh for only a short while and was available only in the immediate vicinity of a lactating cow. While returning to the United States from a trip to England in 1851, Gail Borden Jr. was devastated by the deaths of several children, apparently from poor milk obtained from shipboard cows. With less than a year of schooling and following a series of failures, both of his own and of others, Borden was inspired by the vacuum pan he had seen being used by Shakers to condense fruit juice and managed to reduce milk without scorching or curdling it. Even then his first two factories failed and only the third, built with new partner Jeremiah Milbank in Wassaic, New York, produced a usable milk derivative that was long-lasting and needed no refrigeration.

Probably of equal importance for the future of milk production were Borden&#x27;s requirements (the &quot;Dairyman&#x27;s Ten Commandments&quot;) for farmers who wanted to sell him raw milk: they were required to wash the cows&#x27; udders before milking, keep barns swept clean, and scald and dry their strainers morning and night. By 1858, Borden&#x27;s milk, sold as Eagle Brand, had gained a reputation for purity, durability and economy.

In 1864, Gail Borden&#x27;s New York Condensed Milk Company constructed the New York Milk Condensery in Brewster, New York. This was the largest and most advanced milk factory of its day and was Borden&#x27;s first commercially successful plant. More than 200 dairy farmers supplied 20,000 US gallons (17,000 imperial gallons; 76,000 litres) of milk daily to the Brewster plant as demand increased driven by the American Civil War.

The U.S. government ordered huge amounts of condensed milk as a field ration for Union soldiers during the war. This was an extraordinary field ration for the nineteenth century: a typical 10-oz (300-ml) can contained 1,300 calories (5440 kJ), each of protein and fat, and more than of carbohydrate.

Soldiers returning home from the war soon spread the word, and by the late 1860s, condensed milk was a major product. In 1866, American brothers George Ham Page and Charles Page established the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company and opened the first condensed milk factory in Europe in the Swiss municipality of Cham. The first Canadian condensery was built at Truro, Nova Scotia, in 1871. In 1899, E. B. Stuart opened the first Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company (later known as the Carnation Milk Products Company) plant in Kent, Washington. The condensed milk market developed into a bubble, with too many manufacturers chasing too little demand. In the early 1900s, Carnation and Eagle brands were introduced in Hong Kong, establishing significant market shares in the years to follow. In 1911, Nestlé constructed the world&#x27;s largest condensed milk plant in Dennington, Victoria, Australia. By 1912, high stocks of condensed milk led to a drop in price and many condenseries went out of business.

In 1914, Otto F. Hunziker, head of Purdue University&#x27;s dairy department, self-published &quot;Condensed Milk and Milk Powder: Prepared for the Use of Milk Condenseries, Dairy Students and Pure Food Departments&quot;. This text, along with the additional work of Hunziker and others involved with the American Dairy Science Association, standardized and improved condensery operations in the United States and internationally. Hunziker&#x27;s book was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press.

The First World War regenerated interest in, and the market for, condensed milk, primarily due to its storage and transportation benefits. In the U.S. the higher price for raw milk paid by condenseries created significant problems for the cheese industry.

== Production ==
Raw milk is clarified and standardised to a desired fat to solid-not-fat (SNF) ratio, and is then heated to for several seconds. This heating process destroys some microorganisms, decreases fat separation and inhibits oxidation. Water is evaporated from the milk and sugar is added until a 9:11 ratio of sugar to (evaporated) milk is reached. The sugar extends the shelf life of sweetened condensed milk. Sucrose increases the liquid&#x27;s osmotic pressure, which prevents microorganism growth. The sweetened evaporated milk is cooled and lactose crystallization is induced.

== Current use ==

Condensed milk is used in recipes for the Brazilian candy &quot;brigadeiro&quot; (where condensed milk is the main ingredient), key lime pie, caramel candies, and other desserts. Condensed milk and sweetened condensed milk are also sometimes used in combination with clotted cream to make fudge in certain countries such as the United Kingdom.

In parts of Asia and Europe, sweetened condensed milk is the preferred milk to be added to coffee or tea. Many countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, use condensed milk to flavor their hot or iced coffee. In Malaysia and Singapore, &quot;teh tarik&quot; is made from tea mixed with condensed milk, and condensed milk is an integral element in Hong Kong tea culture. In the Canary Islands, it is served as the bottom stripe in a glass of the local café cortado and, in Valencia, it is served as a café bombón. In Myanmar, condensed milk is an essential part of a vast majority of beverages such as coffee, milk tea and fruit juices along with the use of it as a sweetener in many desserts such as popsicles.

Borden&#x27;s Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk has noted that ice cream could be made quite simply at home with their product, cream, and various simple flavorings, being ready to serve after as little as four hours.

In New Orleans, sweetened condensed milk is commonly used as a topping on chocolate or similarly cream-flavored snowballs. In Scotland, it is mixed with sugar and butter and then boiled to form a popular sweet candy called tablet or Swiss milk tablet, this recipe is very similar to another version of the Brazilian candy brigadeiro called &quot;branquinho&quot;. In some parts of the Southern United States, condensed milk is a key ingredient in lemon ice box pie, a sort of cream pie. In the Philippines, condensed milk is mixed with some evaporated milk and eggs, spooned into shallow metal containers over liquid caramelized sugar, and then steamed to make a stiffer and more filling version of &quot;crème&quot; caramel known as &quot;leche flan&quot;, also common in Brazil under the name &quot;pudim de leite&quot;.

In Mexico, sweetened condensed milk is one of the main ingredients of the cold cake dessert (the leading brand is &quot;La Lechera&quot;, the local version of Swiss &quot;Milchmädchen&quot; or &quot;La Laitière&quot; by Nestlé), combined with evaporated milk, Marie biscuits, lemon juice, and tropical fruit. In Brazil, this recipe is also done by exchanging fruit for puddings, most commonly vanilla and chocolate, known as &quot;pavê&quot; or &quot;torta de bolacha&quot;. It is also used to make homemade &quot;dulce de leche&quot; by baking it in an oven. In Brazil, this is done by baking the unopened can in a &quot;bain-marie&quot;, the result being &quot;doce de leite&quot;. In Britain and Ireland, the contents of a boiled can are used as the layer between the biscuit base and the banana and cream level in banoffee. There is also a pastry-based tart that is popular in the county of Kent, England called Gypsy tart. The pastry case is then filled with a mixture of brown sugar and either condensed milk, evaporated milk, or a mixture of the two before being baked. In Latin American and Central American countries, condensed milk (along with evaporated milk and whole milk or canned cream) is used as a key ingredient in the tres leches cake dessert.

In Soviet culture, it was once common to boil a can of condensed milk in water for about three hours. The resulting product is a sweet semi-liquid substance that can be used as a cake icing or put between layers. It is essentially the same as &quot;dulce de leche.&quot; A similar product is called &quot;kajmak&quot; in Central Asia (although the original kaymak is a product similar to clotted cream). In Russia its called &quot;varionaya sguschyonka&quot; (translates as &quot;boiled condensed milk&quot;). The Soviet tradition and kaymak are also known in Poland.

==Substitutions==
Condensed milk can be made from evaporated milk by mixing one volume measure of evaporated milk with one and a quarter volume measure of sugar in a saucepan, then heating and stirring the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved, then cooling. It can also be made by simmering regular milk and sugar, until it is reduced by 60%.

<doc id="427925" wikidata="Q17004507" url="?curid=427925" title="Music of Guinea">
<text>Guinea is a West African nation, composed of several ethnic groups. Among its most widely known musicians is Mory Kanté – &quot;10 Cola Nuts&quot; saw major mainstream success in both Guinea and Mali while &quot;Yé ké yé ké&quot;, a single from &quot;Akwaba Beach&quot;, was a European success in 1988.

==National music==
French is the official language of Guinea and is the main language of communication in schools, government administration, the media, and the country&#x27;s security forces. Independence for Guinea came in 1958. Guinea&#x27;s President, Sekou Toure, disbanded all private dance orchestras and created a network of state-sponsored groups. The government soon formed the Syli Orchestre National, a dance orchestra that featured some of the best musicians in the land.

&quot;&quot; (Liberty) has been the national anthem of Guinea since independence in 1958. It was arranged by Fodéba Keïta, based on the melody &quot;Alfa yaya&quot;.

==Traditional music==
Guinea&#x27;s 10 million people belong to at least twenty-four ethnic groups. The most prominent are the Fula (40%), the Mandinka (30%) and the Susu (20%). Fula is widely used in the central Fouta Djallon, Maninka in the east and Susu in the northwestern coastal region. It is a predominantly Islamic country, with Muslims representing about 85 percent of the population. Christians, mostly Roman Catholic, about 10 percent of the population, are mainly found in the southern region of &quot;Guinée forestière&quot;.

Mandé music is dominated by the djelis, travelling singer-historians who sing praises to noble patrons. Traditionally, popular instruments include the ngoni, a distant relative of the banjo, and the balafon. Famous balafon players include El Hadj Djeli Sory Kouyaté and, early in his career, superstar Mory Kanté. The kora, a cross between a harp and a lute, is also widespread. Other popular folk music utilizes the cylindrical dunun paired with the goblet shaped djembe.

As in Mali, a roots revival occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with state support from Sekou Touré. He introduced a radical cultural policy called &quot;authenticite&quot;, whereby musicians and artists were instructed to &quot;look at the past&quot; for inspiration and to incorporate traditional practices in their arts. &quot;Authenticite&quot; ended with the death of Sekou Toure in 1984.

==Popular music==
After World War 2, the guitar was imported to Guinea and players like Kanté Facelli and his cousin Kanté Manfila developed their own style of playing. In modern times, the guitar plays a very important role.

Some of the early dance bands included popular groups like Keletigui Et Ses Tambourinis, Balla et ses Balladins, and Kebendo Jazz (also known as Orchestre de Danse de Guéckédou). Many of these bands recorded on Syliphone records. Bembeya Jazz National further enriched Guinea&#x27;s musical melting pot after visiting Cuba in 1965.

<doc id="427926" wikidata="Q281111" url="?curid=427926" title="Ghazal">
<text>The ghazal is a form of amatory poem or ode, originating in Arabic poetry. Ghazals often deal with topics of spiritual and romantic love and may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation from the beloved and the beauty of love in spite of that pain.

The ghazal form is ancient, tracing its origins to 7th-century Arabic poetry. The ghazal spread into the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century due to the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate, and is now most prominently a form of poetry of many Languages of South Asia and Turkey.

A ghazal commonly consists of five to fifteen couplets, which are independent, but are linked – abstractly, in their theme; and more strictly in their poetic form. The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, due to its highly allusive nature, the ghazal has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==

The word &quot;ghazal&quot; originates from the Arabic word (&quot;ġazal&quot;). This genre of Arabic poetry is derived from (ḡazal) or (ḡazila) - To sweet-talk, to flirt, to display amorous gestures.

The Arabic word &quot;ġazal&quot; is pronounced . In English, the word is pronounced or .

== Poetic form ==
The ghazal is a short poem consisting of rhyming couplets, called &quot;bayt&quot; or &quot;sher&quot;. Most ghazals have between seven and twelve &quot;bayts&quot;. For a poem to be considered a true ghazal, it must have no fewer than five couplets. Almost all ghazals confine themselves to less than fifteen couplets (poems that exceed this length are more accurately considered as &quot;qasidas&quot;). Ghazal couplets end with the same rhyming pattern and are expected to have the same meter. The ghazal&#x27;s uniqueness arises from its rhyme and refrain rules, referred to as the ″&quot;qafiya&quot;″ and ″&quot;radif&quot;″ respectively. A ghazal&#x27;s rhyming pattern may be described as AA BA CA DA, and so on.

In its strictest form, a ghazal must follow a number of rules:

# Matla&#x27;: The first &quot;sher&quot; in a ghazal is called the ″&quot;matla″&quot;″. Both lines of the &quot;matla″&quot; must contain the &quot;qafiya&quot; and &quot;radif&quot;. The &quot;matla″&quot; sets the tone of the ghazal, as well as its rhyming and refrain pattern. 
# Radif: The refrain word or phrase. Both lines of the &quot;matla″&quot; and the second lines of all subsequent &quot;shers&quot; must end in the same refrain word called the &quot;radif&quot;. 
# Qafiya: The rhyming pattern. The &quot;radif&quot; is immediately preceded by words or phrases with the same end rhyme pattern, called the &quot;qafiya&quot;. 
# Maqta&#x27;: The last couplet of the ghazal is called the &quot;maqta″&quot;. It is common in ghazals for the poet&#x27;s &quot;nom de plume&quot;, known as &quot;takhallus&quot; to be featured in the &quot;maqta″&quot;. The &quot;maqta″&quot; is typically more personal than the other couplets in a ghazal. The creativity with which a poet incorporates homonymous meanings of their &quot;takhallus&quot; to offer additional layers of meaning to the couplet is an indicator of their skill.
# Bahr: Each line of a ghazal must follow the same metrical pattern and syllabic (or morae) count.

Other optional rules include:

# Misra-e-uulaa: The first line of each verse must be a statement.
# Misra-e-sani: The second line of each verse must be the proof of statement given in the first line.

Unlike in a &quot;nazm&quot;, a ghazal&#x27;s couplets do not need a common theme or continuity. Each sher is self-contained and independent from the others, containing the complete expression of an idea. However, the &quot;shers&quot; all contain a thematic or tonal connection to each other, which may be highly allusive. A common conceit that traces its history to the origins of the ghazal form is that the poem is addressed to a beloved by the narrator.
Abdolhamid Ziaei considers the content of old Persian ghazal to include four elements: love, mysticism, education or excellence, and Qalandari.

== Interpreting a ghazal ==
The Ghazal tradition is marked by the poetry&#x27;s ambiguity and simultaneity of meaning. Learning the common tropes is key to understanding the ghazal.

There are several locations a Urdu &quot;sher&quot; might take place in:

* The Garden, where the poet often takes on the personage of the bulbul, a songbird. The poet is singing to the beloved, who is often embodied as a rose.

hoon garmi-i-nishat-i-tasavvur se naghma sanj

Main andalib-i-gulshan-i-na afridah hoon

- Ghalib

&quot;I sing from the warmth of the passionate joy of thought&quot;

&quot;I am the bulbul of a garden not yet created&quot;

* The Tavern, or the &quot;maikhana&quot;, where the poet drinks wine in search of enlightenment, union with God, and desolation of self.

mir un neem-baaz ankhon men saari masti sharab ki si hai

- Mir Taqi Mir

&quot; &#x27;Mir&#x27; is in those half-closed eyes&quot; &quot;all flirtation is a bit like wine&quot;
== History ==
=== Origins in Arabia ===
The ghazal originated in Arabia in the 7th century, evolving from the &quot;qasida&quot;, a much older pre-Islamic Arabic poetic form. &quot;Qaṣīdas&quot; were typically much longer poems, with up to 100 couplets. Thematically, &quot;qaṣīdas&quot; did not include love, and were usually panegyrics for a tribe or ruler, lampoons, or moral maxims. However, the &quot;qaṣīda&#x27;s&quot; opening prelude, called the &quot;nasīb,&quot; was typically nostalgic and/or romantic in theme, and highly ornamented and stylized in form. In time, the &quot;nasīb&quot; began to be written as standalone, shorter poems, which became the ghazal.

The ghazal came into its own as a poetic genre during the Umayyad era (661–750) and continued to flower and develop in the early Abbasid era. The Arabic ghazal inherited the formal verse structure of the &quot;qaṣīda&quot;, specifically, a strict adherence to meter and the use of the qafiya, a common end rhyme on each couplet (called a &quot;bayt&quot; in Arabic and a &quot;sher&quot; in Persian).

The nature of the ghazals also changed to meet the demands of musical presentation, becoming briefer in length. Lighter poetic meters, such as &quot;khafîf&quot;, &quot;ramal&quot;, and &quot;muqtarab&quot; were preferred, instead of longer, more ponderous meters favored for &quot;qaṣīdas&quot; (such as &quot;kâmil&quot;, &quot;basît&quot;, and &quot;rajaz&quot;). Topically, the ghazal focus also changed from nostalgic reminiscences of the homeland and loved ones, towards romantic or erotic themes. These included sub-genres with themes of courtly love (&quot;udharî&quot;), eroticism (&quot;hissî&quot;), homoeroticism (&quot;mudhakkar&quot;), and as a highly stylized introduction to a larger poem (&quot;tamhîdî&quot;).

During the Umayyad and early Abbasid eras, the ghazal blossomed. It inherited the structure of the qaṣīda, focusing on meter and end rhymes. With time, it adapted for musical presentation, becoming shorter. Lighter meters were preferred, and themes shifted towards romance and eroticism.

==== Spread of the Arabian ghazal ====
With the spread of Islam, the Arabian ghazal spread both westwards, into Africa and Spain, as well as eastwards, into Persia. The popularity of ghazals in a particular region was usually preceded by a spread of the Arabic language in that country. In medieval Spain, ghazals written in Hebrew as well as Arabic have been found as far back as the 11th century. It is possible that ghazals were also written in the Mozarabic language. Ghazals in the Arabic form have also been written in a number of major West African literary languages like Hausa and Fulfulde.

=== Dispersion into Persia ===

==== Early Arabo-Persian ghazals (10th to 11th century) ====
However, the most significant changes to the ghazal occurred in its introduction into Iran in the 10th century. The early Persian ghazals largely imitated the themes and form of the Arabian ghazal. These &quot;Arabo-Persian&quot; ghazals introduced two differences compared to their Arabian poetic roots. Firstly, the Persian ghazals did not employ radical enjambment between the two halves of the couplet, and secondly, the Persian ghazals formalized the use of the common rhyme in both lines of the opening couplet (&quot;matla&#x27;&quot;). The imitation of Arabian forms in Persia extended to the &quot;qaṣīda&quot;, which was also popular in Persia.

Because of its comparative brevity, thematic variety and suggestive richness, the ghazal soon eclipsed the &quot;qaṣīda&quot;, and became the most popular poetry form in Persia. Much like Arabian ghazals, early Persian ghazals typically employed more musical meters compared to other Persian poetry forms. Rudaki (858–941 CE) is considered the most important Persian ghazal poet of this period, and the founder of classical Persian literature.

==== Early Persian ghazal poetry (12th to early 13th century) ====
The Persian ghazal evolved into its own distinctive form between the 12th and 13th centuries. Many of those innovations created what we now recognize as the archetypical ghazal form. These changes occurred in two periods, separated by the Mongol Invasion of Persia from 1219 to 1221 AD.

The &#x27;Early Persian poetry&#x27; period spanned approximately one century, from the Ghaznavid era (which lasted until 1187) till a little after the Mongol Invasion. Apart from the movement towards brevity, this period also saw two significant and lasting changes to the ghazal form.

The first change was the adoption of the &quot;Takhallus&quot;, the practice of mentioning the poet&#x27;s penname in the final couplet (called the ″&quot;maqta″&quot;″). The adoption of the &quot;takhallus&quot; became a gradually accepted part of the ghazal form, and by the time of Saadi Shirazi (1210–1291 AD), the most important ghazal poet of this period, it had become &quot;de rigueur.&quot; The second marked change from Arabian ghazal form in Persian ghazals was a movement towards far greater autonomy between the couplets.

==== Late Persian poetry in the Early Mongol Period (1221–) ====
The ghazal later spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. It was famous all around the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries 

=== Introduction into Indian subcontinent ===


The ghazal was spread from Persia into Indian Subcontinent in the 12th century by the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic sultanates. This period coincided with the early Islamic Sultanates in India, through the wave of Islamic invasions into the region in that period.

The 13th century Chishti Sufi poet Hasan Sijzi is regarded as the originator of the Indo-Persian ghazal. Sijzi&#x27;s contemporary, the poet and musician Ameer Khusrow is not only credited as the first Urdu poet but also created Hindustani as we know today by merging braj, khadhi boli, Hindi, Urdu, Persian and other local dialects.

During the reign of the Sultan of Bengal Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, the city of Sonargaon became an important centre of Persian literature, with many publications of prose and poetry. The period is described as the &quot;golden age of Persian literature in Bengal&quot;. Its stature is illustrated by the Sultan&#x27;s own correspondence with the Persian poet Hafez. When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete ghazal by the ruler, the renowned poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the king&#x27;s court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry.

It is said that Atul Prasad Sen pioneered the introduction of Bengali ghazals. Residing in Lucknow, he was inspired by Persian ghazals and experimented with a stream of Bengali music which was later enriched profusely by the contribution of Kazi Nazrul Islam and Moniruddin Yusuf.

== Themes ==

=== Unconditional, superior love ===
A common theme is unconditional love for a higher being or for a mortal beloved which may lift the poet into the ranks of the wise or will bring satisfaction to the soul of the poet. Traditional ghazal law may or may not have an explicit element of sexual desire in it, and the love may be spiritual. The love may be directed to either a man or a woman.

The ghazal is always written from the point of view of the unrequited lover whose beloved is portrayed as unattainable. Most often, either the beloved has not returned the poet&#x27;s love or returns it without sincerity or else the societal circumstances do not allow it. The lover is aware and resigned to this fate but continues loving nonetheless; the lyrical impetus of the poem derives from this tension. Representations of the lover&#x27;s powerlessness to resist his feelings often include lyrically exaggerated violence. The beloved&#x27;s power to captivate the speaker may be represented in extended metaphors about the &quot;arrows of his eyes&quot;, or by referring to the beloved as an assassin or a killer. Take, for example, the following couplets from Amir Khusro&#x27;s Persian ghazal &quot;Nemidanam che manzel būd shab&quot;:
=== Sufism ===
Many of the major historical ghazal poets were either avowed Sufis themselves (like Rumi or Hafiz), or were sympathizers with Sufi ideas. Somewhat like American soul music, but with melancholy instead of funk, most ghazals can be viewed in a spiritual context, with the Beloved being a metaphor for God or the poet&#x27;s spiritual master. It is the intense Divine Love of Sufism that serves as a model for all the forms of love found in ghazal poetry.

Most ghazal scholars today recognize that some ghazal couplets are exclusively about Divine Love (). Others are about earthly love (), but many can be interpreted in either context.

Traditionally invoking melancholy, love, longing, and metaphysical questions, ghazals are often sung by Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian musicians. The form has roots in seventh-century Arabia, and gained prominence in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, thanks to such Persian poets as Rumi and Hafiz, and later to Indian poets such as Mirza Ghalib. In the eighteenth century, the ghazal was used by poets writing in Urdu. Among these poets, Ghalib is the recognized master.

== Important ghazal poets ==

Ghazals were written by Rumi, Hafiz and Saadi Shirazi of Persia; the Turkic poets Yunus Emre, Fuzuli and Nasimi in the Ottoman Empire; Mirza Ghalib and Muhammad Iqbal of North India; and Kazi Nazrul Islam of Bengal. Through the influence of Goethe (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century; the form was used extensively by Friedrich Rückert (1788–1866) and August von Platen (1796–1835). The Kashmiri poet Agha Shahid Ali was a proponent of the form, both in English and in other languages; he edited a volume of &quot;real Ghazals in English&quot;. Ghazals were also written by Moti Ram Bhatta (1866–1896), the pioneer of Nepali ghazal writing in Nepali. Ghazals were also written by Hamza Shinwari, He is known as the father of Pashto Ghazals.
== Translations and performance of classical ghazal ==
Enormous collections of ghazal have been created by hundreds of well-known poets over the past thousand years in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu as well as in the Central Asian Turkic languages. Ghazal poems are performed in Uzbek-Tajik Shashmakom, Turkish Makam, Persian Dastgah and Uyghur Muqam. There are many published translations from Persian and Turkish by Annemarie Schimmel, Arthur John Arberry and many others.

Ghazal &quot;Gayaki&quot;, the art of singing or performing the ghazal in the Indian classical tradition, is very old. Singers like Ustad Barkat Ali and many other singers in the past used to practice it, but the lack of historical records make many names anonymous. It was with Begum Akhtar and later on Ustad Mehdi Hassan that classical rendering of ghazals became popular in the masses. The categorization of ghazal singing as a form of &quot;light classical&quot; music is a misconception.

Classical ghazals are difficult to render because of the varying moods of the &quot;shers&quot; or couplets in the ghazal. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Amanat Ali Khan, Begum Akhtar, Talat Mahmood, Mehdi Hassan, Abida Parveen, Jagjit Singh, Farida Khanum and Ustad Ghulam Ali, Moinuddin Ahamed, are popular classical ghazal singers.

== Popularity ==
The ghazal has historically been one of the most popular poetic forms across the Middle East and South Asia. Even into the modern era the ghazal has retained its extreme popularity among South Asian royalty and nobility, among whom its education and patronisation has traditionally found shelter, especially with several Indian rulers including several Indian Emperors being profound composers of ghazals. In the 19th century ghazals gained popularity in Germany with Goethe&#x27;s translations, as well as with Spanish ghazal writers such as Federico García Lorca. Despite often being written in strong Urdu and rendered with classical Indian Ragas along with complex terminology most usually accessible to the upper classes, in South Asia ghazals are nonetheless popular among all ages. They are most popular in Turkey and South Asia, and readings or musical renditions of ghazals—such as at &quot;mehfils&quot; and &quot;mushairas&quot;—are well attended in these countries, even by the laity. Ghazals are popular in South Asian film music. The ragas to which ghazals are sung are usually chosen to be in consonance with their lyrical content.

The ghazal&#x27;s beauty goes beyond rich or poor, or where you come from. Whether it&#x27;s spoken in fancy places or sung in everyday life, its powerful words touch deep inside, staying with us for a long time.

Understanding the complex lyrics of traditional ghazals required education typically available only to the upper classes. The traditional classical &quot;rāgas&quot; in which the lyrics were rendered were also difficult to understand. The ghazal has undergone some simplification in recent years, in terms of words and phrasings, which helps it to reach a larger audience around the world. Modern shayars (poets) are also moving towards a less strict adherence to form and rules, using simpler language and words (sometimes even incorporating words from other languages, such as English - see Parveen Shakir), and moving away from a strictly male narrator.

Most of the ghazals are now sung in styles that are not limited to &quot;khayāl, thumri, rāga, tāla&quot; and other classical and light classical genres. However, those forms of the ghazal are looked down on by purists of the Indian classical tradition.

In Pakistan,Saleem Raza, 
Mehdi Hassan, Noor Jehan, Iqbal Bano, Abida Parveen, Farida Khanum, Ghulam Ali, Ahmed Rushdi, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan, and Parvez Mehdi are known for ghazal renditions. Indian Singers like Jagjit Singh (who first used a guitar in ghazals), Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain, Hariharan, Adithya Srinivasan, Pankaj Udhas, Umbayee and many others have been able to give a new shape to the ghazal by incorporating elements of Western music.

=== Ghazals in other South Asian languages ===
In addition to Urdu, ghazals have been very popular in the Gujarati language. For around a century, starting with Balashankar Kantharia, there have been many notable Gujarati ghazal writers including Kalapi, Barkat Virani &#x27;Befaam&#x27;, Asim Randeri, Shunya Palanpuri, Amrut Ghayal, Khalil Dhantejvi and many more. Some notable ghazals of those prominent writers have been sung by Bollywood playback singer Manhar Udhas.

Renowned ghazal singer, and pioneer of Telugu ghazals, Ghazal Srinivas popularized the ghazal in Telugu. Ghazals in the Kannada language were pioneered in the 1960s by poet Shantarasam, though recordings of their poetry only began to be made in the early 2000s. Legendary musician Umbayee composed ghazals in Malayalam and popularized this form of music across Kerala.

Suresh Bhat popularized ghazals in the Marathi language. Some of his amazing ghazals were sung by famous artists like Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosale. He was known as &quot;Ghazal Samrat&quot; (the Emperor of ghazals) for his exposition of the ghazal form of poetry and its adaptation to the Marathi language. His disciple Ilahi Jamadar continued the tradition, blending Urdu and Marathi verses in his work.

Kazi Nazrul Islam brought ghazals to the Bengali language, composing numerous poems which are still famous in both Bangladesh and India. Teg Ali Teg introduced ghazals in Bhojpuri, his ghazals collection Badmash Darpan was published in 1895.

Motiram Bhatta was the pioneer &amp; the one who introduced the ghazal in the world of Nepali literature due to which he is called Ghazal Samrat of Nepali Literature. They have become an important part of it.

== In English ==
After nearly a century of &quot;false starts,&quot; the early experiments of James Clarence Mangan, James Elroy Flecker, Adrienne Rich, Phyllis Webb, etc., many of whom did not adhere wholly or in part to the traditional principles of the form, experiments dubbed as &quot;the bastard Ghazal,&quot; the ghazal finally began to be recognized as a viable closed form in poetry of the English language some time in the early to mid-1990s. It came about largely as a result of serious, true-to-form examples being published by noted American poets John Hollander, W. S. Merwin and Elise Paschen as well as by Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali, who had been teaching and spreading word of the Ghazal at American universities over the previous two decades. Jim Harrison created his own free-form Ghazal true to his poetic vision in &quot;Outlyer and Ghazals&quot; (1971).

In 1996, Ali compiled and edited the world&#x27;s first anthology of English-language ghazals, published by Wesleyan University Press in 2000, as &quot;Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English&quot;. (Fewer than one in ten of the ghazals collected in &quot;Real Ghazals in English&quot; observe the constraints of the form.)

A ghazal is composed of couplets, five or more. The couplets may have nothing to do with one another except for the formal unity derived from a strict rhyme and rhythm pattern.

A ghazal in English observes the traditional restrictions of the form:

Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight?
Whom else from rapture&#x27;s road will you expel tonight?

Those &quot;Fabrics of Cashmere—&quot; &quot;to make Me beautiful—&quot;
&quot;Trinket&quot;— to gem– &quot;Me to adorn– How– tell&quot;— tonight?

I beg for haven: Prisons, let open your gates–
A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight.

God&#x27;s vintage loneliness has turned to vinegar–
All the archangels– their wings frozen– fell tonight.

Lord, cried out the idols, Don&#x27;t let us be broken
Only we can convert the infidel tonight.

Mughal ceilings, let your mirrored convexities
multiply me at once under your spell tonight.

He&#x27;s freed some fire from ice in pity for Heaven.
He&#x27;s left open– for God– the doors of Hell tonight.

In the heart&#x27;s veined temple, all statues have been smashed
No priest in saffron&#x27;s left to toll its knell tonight.

God, limit these punishments, there&#x27;s still Judgment Day–
I&#x27;m a mere sinner, I&#x27;m no infidel tonight.

Executioners near the woman at the window.
Damn you, Elijah, I&#x27;ll bless Jezebel tonight.

The hunt is over, and I hear the Call to Prayer
fade into that of the wounded gazelle tonight.

My rivals for your love– you&#x27;ve invited them all?
This is mere insult, this is no farewell tonight.

And I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee–
God sobs in my arms. Call me Ishmael tonight.

— Agha Shahid Ali

<text>In music theory, tertian (, &quot;of or concerning thirds&quot;) describes any piece, chord, counterpoint etc. constructed from the intervals of (major and minor) thirds. An interval such as that between the notes A and C encompasses 3 semitone intervals (A-B-B-C) and is termed a minor third while one such as that between C and E encompasses 4 semitones (C-D-D-E-E) and is called a major third. Tertian harmony (also called tertiary harmony) principally uses chords based on thirds; the term is typically used to contrast with quartal and quintal harmony which uses chords based on fourths or fifths.

A common triad chord can be regarded as consisting of a &quot;stack&quot; of two consecutive thirds. This allows for four permutations, each producing a chord with distinct quality:
A musical scale may also be analyzed as a succession of thirds.

The meantone temperament, a system of tuning that emphasizes pure thirds, may be called &quot;tertian&quot;.

Chords built from sixths may also be referred to as tertian because sixths are equivalent to thirds when inverted, and vice versa: any sixth can be taken as the inversion of a third. For instance, the interval C-A is a major sixth that, when inverted, gives the interval A-C, which is a minor third.

Tertian root movements have been used innovatively in chord progressions as an alternative to root motion in fifths, as for example in the &quot;thirds cycle&quot; used in John Coltrane&#x27;s Coltrane changes, as influenced by Nicolas Slonimsky&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns&quot;.

<text>In music or music theory, secundal is the quality of a chord made from seconds, and anything related to things constructed from seconds such as counterpoint. Secundal chords are often called tone clusters more generally, especially when non-diatonic. &quot;[Any] three or more pitches in secundal relationship may correctly be referred to as a tone cluster.&quot; Chords which may be considered as built from sevenths, because of musical inversion, are secundal. Polychords may create secundal chords.

The secundal harmony in Ross Lee Finney&#x27;s &quot;Playing Tag&quot; provides &quot;accentuation and forward motion&quot;, as well as the basis for the &quot;fragmentary melody&quot;:

<doc id="427950" wikidata="Q1036769" url="?curid=427950" title="Black Hawk Down (book)">
<text>Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War is a 1999 book by journalist Mark Bowden. It documents efforts by the Unified Task Force to capture Somali faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid in 1993, and the resulting battle in Mogadishu between United States forces and Aidid&#x27;s militia. One of the key events is the downing of two United States MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, from which the book derives its title, and the attempt to rescue their crews. United States forces included 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; 160th SOAR; Delta Force; 24th Special Tactics Squadron; DEVGRU Navy SEALs; 10th Mountain Division; as well as Malaysian and Pakistani United Nations peacekeeping forces.

The raid became the most intense close combat in U.S. military history since the Vietnam War. Although the overall mission to apprehend Aidid was officially codenamed Operation Gothic Serpent, the media colloquially termed the incident the Battle of Mogadishu as well as the Battle of the Black Sea.

==History==
&quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot; is based on a series of 29 articles written by journalist Mark Bowden for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. He did extensive research in US Army records, interviewed participants from both sides of the conflict, reviewed footage recorded by observation aircraft, and listened to recordings of radio traffic. Before the book was published, Bowden&#x27;s series had already begun to attract attention within the media. It consisted of a CD-ROM, an hour-long video, and an audiovisual series on The Inquirer&#x27;s Web site. 

Delta Force member Paul R. Howe provided much of the information about the Delta force operations for the writing of the book. Bowden met with Howe in 1997 after clearing it with Howe&#x27;s commanding officer. Other Delta Force members also consulted for the book, but did not allow the use of their real names. Howe has faced some criticism for allowing Bowden to use his real name.

In January 1991, militias overthrew the regime of President Siad Barre which led to the Somali Civil War. The United Nations later arranged a US-led intervention, with a mandate to engage in state building and encourage the militias to share power and begin to form a new government. President George H. W. Bush sent United States Marines into Somalia in December 1992 as part of a UN effort to secure transportation routes to deliver relief and food supplies, which had been disrupted by local militias. Uninterested in sharing power, Mohamed Farrah Aidid began to regard the ongoing UN mission as hostile and ambushed a peacekeeping convoy in June 1993, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. The UN mission&#x27;s commander, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe, declared Aidid an outlaw, and the faction leader&#x27;s forces and supporters subsequently began targeting the officer. The hunt for Aidid included a disputed attack on a house of clan officials and resulted in civilian casualties as well as increasing civilian hostility against the UN efforts, especially their use of helicopters. As a result, President Clinton approved Operation Gothic Serpent, a JSOC mission to apprehend Aidid. The operation created Task Force Ranger which was composed of Rangers, Delta Force, 24th Special Tactics Squadron airmen, DEVGRU Navy SEALs, and 160th SOAR aviators. One of the operation&#x27;s missions led to several Black Hawk helicopters being shot down and an extended bloody battle between task force and UN forces against Somali militia. After the battle, the hunt for Aidid was called off. The U.S. subsequently pulled out, with the UN following suit a few months later. In 1996, Aidid died from wounds sustained during a battle against a rival militia. A new interim central administration, the Transitional National Government, was eventually formed in 2000, a year after Bowden&#x27;s book was published.

==Critical reception==
Bowden&#x27;s narrative was generally praised, particularly his efforts at contextualizing the local and international politics and explaining how the peacekeeping mission devolved into armed conflict, later termed the &quot;Mogadishu Line&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; piece found he conveyed the battle as a gripping narrative, giving a minute-by-minute account of the United States campaign in Mogadishu, known as the Battle of the Black Sea. It added that Bowden rapidly shifts viewpoints after US ground forces enter the city, trying to extract a couple of Aidid leaders and then, when things go wrong, rescue US forces. Additionally, the piece remarked how Bowden simultaneously manages to capture the siege mentality felt by both civilians and the US soldiers, as well as the broad sentiment among many residents that the Rangers were to blame for the majority of the battle casualties.

The book was a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

==Adaptations==
* The story first ran on November 16, 1997, as a 29-part newspaper series that was then adapted to an online multimedia package, a first for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. Bowden had amassed a large number of notes, audiotapes, documents, photos, and radio transcripts, and worked with the digital team at the &quot;Inquirer&quot; to post it online. At the time it served as one of the more innovative examples of multimedia storytelling by a news organization. The published online package contained videos, audio clips, graphics, maps, and links to external resources. 
* The book was accompanied by a video, &quot;Somalia: Good Intentions, Deadly Results&quot;, produced by KVR Video, that was aired on CNN on 24 March 1999 in a 57-minute version, as &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War;&quot; it later won an Emmy.
* The book was adapted into a 2001 film, directed by Ridley Scott and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

<doc id="427952" wikidata="Q132636" url="?curid=427952" title="Aralia">
<text>Aralia , or spikenard, is a genus of the family Araliaceae, consisting of 68 accepted species of deciduous or evergreen trees, shrubs, and rhizomatous herbaceous perennials. The genus is native to Asia and the Americas, with most species occurring in mountain woodlands. &quot;Aralia&quot; plants vary in size, with some herbaceous species only reaching tall, while some are trees growing to tall.

&quot;Aralia&quot; plants have large bipinnate (doubly compound) leaves clustered at the ends of their stems or branches; in some species the leaves are covered with bristles. The stems of some woody species are quite prickly, as in &quot;Aralia spinosa&quot;. The flowers are whitish or greenish occurring in terminal panicles, and the spherical dark purple berry-like fruits are popular with birds.

&quot;Aralia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the common emerald (&quot;Hemithea aestivaria&quot;). There are many colours of aralia flowers. The main flower is whitish aralia.

Some species, notably &quot;Aralia cordata&quot;, are edible and are cultivated for human consumption.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic circumscription of the genus &quot;Aralia&quot; has varied greatly. Species formerly included in wider views of the genus are now included in such separate genera as &quot;Fatsia&quot;, &quot;Macropanax&quot;, &quot;Oreopanax&quot;, &quot;Panax&quot;, &quot;Polyscias&quot;, &quot;Pseudopanax&quot;, &quot;Schefflera&quot;, and &quot;Tetrapanax&quot;.

The genus &quot;Dimorphanthus&quot;, formerly considered distinct by some, is now included within &quot;Aralia&quot; as a section within that genus.

==Fossil record==
One fossil endocarp of †&quot;Aralia pusilla&quot; has been described from a middle Miocene stratum of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. Several fossil fruits of &quot;Aralia rugosa&quot; and †&quot;Aralia tertiaria&quot; have been extracted from bore hole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. Several &quot;Aralia&quot; macrofossils have been recovered from the late Zanclean stage of Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy.

<text>Jamboree on the Air, known by its acronym JOTA, is an international Scouting and Guiding activity held annually; it is on the third full weekend in October. First held in conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary of Scouting in 1957, it was devised by Leslie R. Mitchell, a radio amateur with the callsign G3BHK. It is now considered the largest event scheduled by the World Organization of the Scout Movement annually.

Amateur radio operators from all over the world participate with over 500,000 Scouts and Guides to teach them about radio and to assist them to contact their fellow Scouts and Guides by means of amateur radio and since 2004, by the VOIP-based Echolink. This provides the Scouts and Guides with a means of learning about fellow Scouts and Guides from around the world. Scouts and Guides are also encouraged to send paper or electronic confirmations known as &quot;QSL cards&quot;, or &quot;eQSLs&quot; when they are sent electronically. In recent years, a parallel Jamboree on the Internet (JOTI) has developed. It is an adjunct to the World Scout Jamboree.

The event is recognized as one of international participation by the various Scout and Guide organisations, and supports several awards which are a part of Scouting and Guiding programmes. The Boy Scouts of America recognizes this as an international Scouting event for Citizenship in the World Merit Badge.

<text>Jamboree on the Internet, known by its acronym JOTI, is an international Scouting activity held annually. Participants, through the use of designated Chats from all over the world, can contact their fellow Scouts by means of the Internet. Common communication methods include ScoutLink (IRC), e-mail, and VOIP. This provides the Scouts with a means of learning about fellow Scouts from around the world. JOTI operates alongside Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) and is an official event of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.

==History==

JOTI was pioneered in 1995 by Queanbeyan Rovers when one Rover, Norvan Vogt was on a student exchange in the Netherlands, with the home crew in Australia coordinated by Brett Sheffield. They connected Putten, Netherlands and Queanbeyan, Australia with dedicated IRC servers. In November 1996 the World Scout Committee, noting that Scouting already had a considerable presence on the Internet, there was already an informal and rapidly growing Jamboree on the Internet, decided that JOTI should become an official international Scouting event, it should be held on the same weekend as the Jamboree on the Air (JOTA), the third full weekend of October each year, starting at 00:00 hours local time on Saturday and concluding 48 hours later at 24:00 hours local time on Sunday.

Special Internet Jamborees may also be organized in conjunction with local, national and international Scouting events which are held at other times of the year. Getting together does not always require a physical presence. In 1957, the concept of the World Scout Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) was launched, and it has been a popular event which today involves more than half-a-million Scouts and Girl Guides who communicate with each other on the third weekend of each October by amateur radio and related technology. In the mid 1990s the means for international electronic communication became available to virtually anyone with a computer. Scouts have been among the first to use every technological development to &quot;get together&quot; electronically. The spontaneous and overwhelming involvement of Scouts on the Internet is proof that it is a viable way of bringing Scouts together in ways that Baden-Powell probably would have wanted to use to the fullest.

JOTI.org reports that JOTI had over 4,000 participants online at one time in 2005. 2011 saw the first ever &#x27;JOTI Radio&#x27; station founded by Scout Radio, a broadcast internet radio station based in the UK to provide entertainment for the JOTI weekend, which had live interviews from Scouts all over the world, the team that lead JOTI Radio are now made up of the &#x27;Avon Scout Radio&#x27; team, which are a County Active Support Unit for Avon Scouts and provide broadcast radio services within the Scouting movement worldwide. JOTI Radio is now part of the annual JOTA-JOTI weekend. In 2014, over 2,300 different computers were used to listen to JOTI Radio over the course of the weekend.

In 2014, almost 80% of participants used Scouts can speak, while 60% used the IRC platform provided by ScoutLink, while a further 30% used the ScoutLink TeamSpeak server.

In 2015, participants using IRC increased to 80%, while use of TeamSpeak decreased to 28% and 80% used Scouts can speak.

<text>The US Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches (USMB) is an association of Mennonite Brethren Churches in the United States.
==Background==
On January 6, 1860, a small group of Mennonites in Ukraine, influenced by Moravian Brethren and Lutheran Pietism, seeking greater emphasis on discipline, prayer and Bible study, met in the village of Elisabeththal, Molotschna and formed the &quot;Mennonite Brethren Church&quot;. Mennonite Brethren were among the migration of Mennonites from Russia to North America between 1874 and 1880, settling mainly in Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The earliest congregations in the United States were gathered in Kansas in 1874. In October 1879, representatives from those four states gathered in Henderson, Nebraska, to form a general conference. This general conference met annually until 1909; at which time the meetings were changed to every three years.

The first Mennonite Brethren congregation in Canada was founded in Winkler, Manitoba, in 1888 as a result of mission work from the United States. From 1923 to 1929, many Mennonite Brethren migrated from Russia to Canada, and some went to South America. In 1954, the desire of the Canadian churches for independence brought about the formation of two &quot;area conferences&quot; (as opposed to one general conference) of the Mennonite Brethren of North America - the subject of this article and the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches. The Krimmer Mennonite Brethren Conference formally merged with this body on November 14, 1960.

==Belief and practices==
The first confession of faith of the Mennonite Brethren was written in 1873, revised in 1900 and published in 1902. The USMB also esteems the historic creeds of the Mennonites. Their confession of faith reveals the churches of the US Conference accept God in three persons; the divinity, humanity, virgin birth, atonement, resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus; the Bible as the inspired word of God; the fall of man and his salvation through the atoning work of Christ; the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) as a day of worship; and the resurrection of all men, either to eternal punishment or eternal happiness with God. The Mennonite Brethren Church holds two ordinances - baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. 

Water baptism by immersion is the mode administered by local congregations, but they may receive on confession of faith persons who have been baptized by other modes. Those baptized as infants must receive baptism from a local Mennonite Brethren congregation on their profession of faith. Believers who have confessed their faith in Jesus Christ and understand the meaning of the Lord&#x27;s Supper are invited to participate, though the understanding of the Mennonite Brethren is that baptism should precede participation in the communion service. USMB members reject the swearing of oaths, membership in secret societies, and bearing of arms in warfare. The church allows alternative types of service during times of war.
Organization includes a general assembly held every two years, to which delegates are sent by local congregations to elect people to serve on the Board of Church Ministries and other offices. A board of some type governs each ministry of the U.S. Conference. 

==Members and congregations==

In 2003 there were Mennonite Brethren congregations in more than 20 countries. The largest conferences are located in India and Congo. Offices of the &quot;US Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches&quot; are located in Hillsboro, Kansas. They own and operate the higher education institutions of Tabor College, Kansas, Fresno Pacific University, and the Fresno Pacific University Biblical Seminary.

In 2003, the Mennonite Brethren had 188 congregations in the United States, with 26,219 members. In 2018 there were 34,857 baptized members in 200 congregations.

==Krimmer Mennonite Brethren Conference==
The &quot;Krimmer (or Crimean) Mennonite Brethren Church&quot; was founded September 21, 1869, by Jacob A. Wiebe (1839-1921), the outgrowth of the Kleine Gemeinde revival in a village near Simferopol, Crimea. Unlike the majority of Mennonites, this body adopted triune forward immersion as the mode of baptism. They left for America as a group in 1874, arriving in New York on July 15. They eventually settled in Marion County, Kansas, and founded the village of Gnadenau. The body incorporated as the &quot;Krimmer Mennonite Brethren Church of North America&quot; in 1917. At the time of the merger with the Mennonite Brethren (1960), the Krimmer Church represented 11 congregations with almost 2000 members.

<text>Jamboree on the Trail, known by its acronym JOTT, was a co-ordinated international Scouting activity held annually, following on the idea of the &quot;Join-in&quot; events from the World Jamboree Year. Scouts from all over the world simultaneously participated in their local area by holding a hiking event. 

The event took place on an annual basis on the 2nd Saturday in May. The event began in 1998, and grew into an international tradition, with millions of participants each year. It is a non-competitive event, and the emphasis is on fostering camaraderie, appreciation for nature, and a sense of global solidarity among Scouts worldwide.

Participants were awarded a JOTT badge as a recognition of having participated in this worldwide event. This provided the Scouts with a means of participating in an activity at the same time as fellow Scouts from around the world. It was an adjunct activity to the World Scout Jamboree as well as Jamboree on the Air and Jamboree on the Internet.

The final JOTT (#26) was held on May 13, 2023, after which the worldwide hike chief retired the event.

<doc id="427976" wikidata="Q14944797" url="?curid=427976" title="Esquimalt">
<text>The Township of Esquimalt () is a municipality at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. It is bordered to the east by the provincial capital, Victoria, to the south by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the west by Esquimalt Harbour and Royal Roads, to the northwest by the New Songhees 1A Indian reserve and the town of View Royal, and to the north by a narrow inlet of water called the Gorge, across which is the district municipality of Saanich. It is almost tangential to Esquimalt 1 Indian Reserve near Admirals Road. It is one of the 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria and part of the Capital Regional District.

Esquimalt had a population of 17,533 in 2021. It covers . It is home to the Pacific fleet of the Royal Canadian Navy.

==History==
The region now known as Esquimalt was settled by First Nations people approximately 4000 years before the arrival of Europeans. The treaties of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), signed in 1843, refer to these people as the Kosampsom group, though they are now known as the Esquimalt Nation. The word Esquimalt is a transliteration of &quot;Ess-whoy-malth,&quot; a phrase usually translated as &quot;place of the shoaling waters.&quot; The Songhees people (then called Songish), who now have a reserve in Esquimalt, were originally located on the western shore of what is now Victoria Harbour, but were relocated in 1911. Both nations spoke a North Straits Salish dialect called Lekwungen (which is also an alternate name for the Songhees).

The first Europeans to reach Esquimalt were the Spanish expedition of Manuel Quimper in &quot;Princesa Real&quot; in 1790, with Gonzalo López de Haro and Juan Carrasco as &quot;pilotos&quot; (equivalent to master). Quimper entered and carefully mapped Esquimalt Harbour, which his first mate named Puerto de Córdova after the 46th viceroy of New Spain. Quimper claimed the region for Spain and placed a wooden cross on a hill. When the Spanish returned later that summer the cross had vanished. In 1792 Captain George Vancouver extensively explored the region. Following resolution of the Nootka Crisis, control of the region went to the British and the British owned HBC.

In 1843, near the height of the Oregon Question, the HBC was looking for a new location for its Pacific base of operations. John McLoughlin, the company&#x27;s chief factor at Fort Vancouver, ordered James Douglas to build a new fort on Vancouver Island. Douglas liked Esquimalt Harbour, but rejected it as a site for a fort because there were too many trees there. Douglas chose a spot on the eastern shore of Victoria Harbour at the mouth of the Gorge Inlet. He called it Fort Camosun, but later renamed it Fort Victoria in honour of the British Queen.

However, ships continued to use Esquimalt Harbour to load and offload passengers and supplies. In 1852, sailors from a British naval ship, , built a trail through the forest linking the harbour with Victoria Harbour and the fort. This trail, since paved over, is now one of Esquimalt&#x27;s main streets, Old Esquimalt Road.

Meanwhile, the HBC decided to try its hand at farming. Douglas leased all of Vancouver Island for seven shillings a year from Great Britain, and had a division of the HBC, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, come in to develop the land. The Viewfield farm was the first in 1850, with the Constance Cove farm and Craigflower farms added later. The Craigflower farmhouse still exists as a heritage site, as does the Craigflower schoolhouse built to serve the settlers&#x27; children. Thomas Mackenzie, the bailiff in charge of the farm, named it for the ancestral home of one of his superiors. By the mid-1860s, the farms were considered failures and abandoned, and the property sold off in small parcels.

In 1855, the British Royal Navy constructed three hospital buildings on the harbour to treat casualties of the Crimean War. A small settlement grew up on the water&#x27;s edge near the naval installation. In 1858, the discovery of gold on the Fraser River triggered a massive influx of people, who came to Fort Victoria to buy permits and supplies before setting out for the mainland. Many of these ships landed in Esquimalt Harbour. Some of these people stayed in the area, including a few who opened up pubs, as well as some less-than-successful gold miners. With the growing population came the area&#x27;s first building boom.

Even after the Oregon Treaty of 1846, the boundary between the British Gulf Islands and the U.S. islands in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound was not fully defined. An incident involving an American settler shooting an HBC farm pig on San Juan Island led to the Pig War with the United States in 1859.

In 1865, the Royal Navy relocated the headquarters of its Pacific fleet from Valparaíso, Chile, to Esquimalt Harbour. In 1887, a military base was located at Work Point. In 1905, the Royal Navy abandoned the Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard, but the Pacific base of the new Royal Canadian Navy replaced it in 1910. Gradually, naval life and shipbuilding came to dominate the region&#x27;s sense of identity. On September 1, 1912, Esquimalt was incorporated as a District Municipality. After World War I, it became one of Canada&#x27;s major shipbuilding capitals. In 1887, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway was built through the centre of town.

In June 2010, the Royal Canadian Navy celebrated its 100th anniversary with a fleet review in the waters off Greater Victoria, by Canada&#x27;s Governor General Michaëlle Jean. The review was attended by warships from Canada, France, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United States, and US and Canadian Coast Guard vessels.

==Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt==
Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt (CFB Esquimalt) is home to Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) of the Royal Canadian Navy. The base facility dates back to the fur trade era, before the founding of the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849. It was first established as a military installation by the Royal Navy in 1855, and has been operated by the Royal Canadian Navy since 1910.

<text>The &quot;Trent&quot; Affair was a diplomatic incident in 1861 during the American Civil War that threatened a war between the United States and the United Kingdom. The U.S. Navy captured two Confederate envoys from a British Royal Mail steamer; the British government protested vigorously. American public and elite opinion strongly supported the seizure, but it worsened the economy and was ruining relations with the world&#x27;s strongest economy and strongest navy. President Abraham Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the envoys.

On November 8, 1861, , commanded by Union Captain Charles Wilkes, intercepted the British mail packet and removed, as contraband of war, two Confederate envoys: James Murray Mason from Virginia and John Slidell from  Louisiana. The envoys were bound for Britain and France to press the Confederacy&#x27;s case for diplomatic recognition and to lobby for possible financial and military support.

Public reaction in the United States was to celebrate the capture and rally against Britain, threatening war. In the Confederate States, the hope was that the incident would lead to a permanent rupture in Anglo-American relations and possibly even war, or at least diplomatic recognition by Britain. Confederates realized their cause potentially depended on intervention by Britain and France. In Britain, there was widespread disapproval of this violation of neutral rights and insult to their national honor. The British government demanded an apology and the release of the prisoners and took steps to strengthen its military forces in British North America (Canada) and the North Atlantic.

President Abraham Lincoln and his top advisors did not want to risk war with Britain over this issue. After several tense weeks, the crisis was resolved when the Lincoln administration released the envoys and disavowed Captain Wilkes&#x27;s actions, although without a formal apology. Mason and Slidell resumed their voyage to Europe.

==Background==
Relations with the United States were often strained and even verged on war when Britain came near to supporting the Confederacy in the early part of the American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington&#x27;s pandering to the mob, as in the Oregon boundary dispute of 1844 to 1846. These tensions came to a head during the &quot;Trent&quot; affair; this time London would draw the line.

The Confederacy and its president, Jefferson Davis, believed from the beginning that European dependence on Southern cotton for its textile industry would lead to diplomatic recognition and intervention, in the form of mediation. Historian Charles Hubbard wrote:


The Union&#x27;s main focus in foreign affairs was just the opposite: to prevent any British recognition of the Confederacy. The issues of the Oregon boundary dispute, British involvement in Texas, and the Canada–US border dispute had all been resolved in the 1840s, and despite the Pig War of 1859, a minor border incident in the Pacific Northwest, Anglo-American relations had steadily improved throughout the 1850s. Secretary of State William H. Seward, the primary architect of American foreign policy during the war, intended to maintain the policy principles that had served the country well since the American Revolution: non-intervention by the United States in the affairs of other countries and resistance to foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere.

British prime minister Lord Palmerston urged a policy of neutrality. His international concerns were centered in Europe, where both Napoleon III&#x27;s ambitions in Europe and Bismarck&#x27;s rise in Prussia were occurring. During the Civil War, British reactions to American events were shaped by past British policies and their own national interests, both strategically and economically. In the Western Hemisphere, as relations with the United States improved, Britain had become cautious about confronting the United States over issues in Central America.

As a naval power, Britain had a long record of insisting that neutral nations honor its blockades of hostile countries. From the earliest days of the war, that perspective would guide the British away from taking any action that might have been viewed in Washington as a direct challenge to the Union blockade. From the perspective of the South, British policy amounted to &quot;de facto&quot; support for the Union blockade and caused great frustration.

The Russian Minister in Washington, Eduard de Stoeckl, noted, &quot;The Cabinet of London is watching attentively the internal dissensions of the Union and awaits the result with an impatience which it has difficulty in disguising.&quot; De Stoeckl advised his government that Britain would recognize the Confederate States at its earliest opportunity. Cassius Clay, the US minister in Russia, stated, &quot;I saw at a glance where the feeling of England was. They hoped for our ruin! They are jealous of our power. They care neither for the South nor the North. They hate both.&quot;

At the beginning of the Civil War, the U.S. minister to the Court of St. James was Charles Francis Adams. He made clear that Washington considered the war strictly an internal insurrection affording the Confederacy no rights under international law. Any movement by Britain towards officially recognizing the Confederacy would be considered an unfriendly act towards the United States. Seward&#x27;s instructions to Adams included the suggestion that it be made clear to Britain that a nation with widely-scattered possessions, as well as a homeland that included Scotland and Ireland, should be very wary of &quot;set[ting] a dangerous precedent&quot;.

Lord Lyons, an experienced diplomat, was the British minister to the US. He warned London about Seward:

Despite his distrust of Seward, Lyons, throughout 1861, maintained a &quot;calm and measured&quot; diplomacy that contributed to a peaceful resolution to the &quot;Trent&quot; crisis.

==Issue of diplomatic recognition (February–August 1861)==

The &quot;Trent&quot; affair did not erupt as a major crisis until late November 1861. The first link in the chain of events occurred in February 1861, when the Confederacy created a three person European delegation consisting of William Lowndes Yancey, Pierre Rost, and Ambrose Dudley Mann. Their instructions from Confederate Secretary of State Robert Toombs were to explain to these governments the nature and purposes of the southern cause, to open diplomatic relations, and to &quot;negotiate treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation&quot;. Toombs&#x27; instructions included a long legal argument on states&#x27; rights and the right of secession. Because of the reliance on the double attack of cotton and legality, many important issues were absent from the instructions including the blockade of Southern ports, privateering, trade with the North, slavery, and the informal blockade the Southerners had imposed whereby no cotton was being shipped out.

British leaders—and those on the Continent—generally believed that division of the U.S. was inevitable. Remembering their own unsuccessful attempt to keep their former American colonies in the Empire by force of arms, the British considered Union efforts to resist a &quot;fait accompli&quot; to be unreasonable, but they also viewed Union resistance as a fact that they had to deal with. Believing the war&#x27;s outcome to be predetermined, the British saw any action they could take to encourage the end of the war as a humanitarian gesture. Lyons was instructed by Foreign Secretary Lord Russell to use his own office and any other parties who might promote a settlement of the war.

The commissioners met informally with Russell on May 3. Although word of Fort Sumter had just reached London, the immediate implications of open warfare were not discussed at the meeting. Instead the envoys emphasized the peaceful intent of their new nation and the legality of secession as a remedy to Northern violations of states&#x27; rights. They closed with their strongest argument: the importance of cotton to Europe. Slavery was discussed only when Russell asked Yancey whether the international slave trade would be reopened by the Confederacy (a position Yancey had advocated in recent years); Yancey&#x27;s reply was that this was not part of the Confederacy&#x27;s agenda. Russell was noncommittal, promising the matters raised would be discussed with the full Cabinet.

In the meantime, the British were attempting to determine what official stance they should have to the war. On May 13, 1861, on the recommendation of Russell, Queen Victoria issued a declaration of neutrality that served as recognition of Southern belligerency—a status that provided Confederate ships the same privileges in foreign ports that U.S. ships received. Confederate ships could obtain fuel, supplies and repairs in neutral ports but could not secure military equipment or arms. The availability of Britain&#x27;s far-flung colonial ports made it possible for Confederate ships to pursue Union shipping throughout much of the world. France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Brazil followed suit. Belligerency also gave the Confederate government the opportunity to purchase supplies, contract with British companies, and purchase a navy to search out and seize Union ships. The Queen&#x27;s proclamation made clear that Britons were prohibited from joining the military of either side, equipping any ships for military use in the war, breaking any proper blockade, and from transporting military goods, documents, or personnel to either side.

On May 18, Adams met with Russell to protest the declaration of neutrality. Adams argued that Great Britain had recognized a state of belligerency &quot;before they [the Confederacy] had ever showed their capacity to maintain any kind of warfare whatever, except within one of their own harbors under every possible advantage […] it considered them a maritime power before they had ever exhibited a single privateer upon the ocean.&quot; The major United States concern at this point was that the recognition of belligerency was the first step towards diplomatic recognition. While Russell indicated that recognition was not currently being considered, he would not rule it out in the future, although he did agree to notify Adams if the government&#x27;s position changed.

Meanwhile, in Washington, Seward was upset with both the proclamation of neutrality and Russell&#x27;s meetings with the Confederates. In a May 21 letter to Adams, which he instructed Adams to share with the British, Seward protested the British reception of the Confederate envoys and ordered Adams to have no dealings with the British as long as they were meeting with them. Formal recognition would make Britain an enemy of the United States. President Lincoln reviewed the letter, softened the language, and told Adams not to give Russell a copy but to limit himself to quoting only those portions that Adams thought appropriate. Adams in turn was shocked by even the revised letter, feeling that it almost amounted to a threat to wage war against all of Europe. When he met with Russell on June 12, after receiving the dispatch, Adams was told that Great Britain had often met with representatives of rebels against nations that Great Britain was at peace with, but that he had no further intention of meeting with the Confederate mission.

Further problems developed over possible diplomatic recognition when, in mid-August, Seward became aware that Britain was secretly negotiating with the Confederacy in order to obtain its agreement to abide by the Declaration of Paris. The 1856 Declaration of Paris prohibited signatories from commissioning privateers against other signatories, protected neutral goods shipped to belligerents except for &quot;contrabands of war&quot;, and recognized blockades only if they were proved effective. The United States had failed to sign the treaty originally, but after the Union declared a blockade of the Confederacy, Seward ordered the U.S. ministers to Britain and France to reopen negotiations to restrict the Confederate use of privateers.

On May 18 Russell had instructed Lyons to seek Confederate agreement to abide by the Paris Declaration. Lyons assigned this task to Robert Bunch, the British consul in Charleston, South Carolina, who was directed to contact South Carolina Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens. Bunch exceeded his instructions: he bypassed Pickens, and openly assured the Confederates that agreement to the Paris Declaration was &quot;the first step to [British] recognition&quot;. His indiscretion soon came to Union ears. Robert Mure, a British-born Charleston merchant, was arrested in New York. Mure, a colonel in the South Carolina militia, had a British diplomatic passport issued by Bunch, and was carrying a British diplomatic pouch (which was searched). The pouch contained some actual correspondence from Bunch to Britain, and also pro-Confederate pamphlets, personal letters from Southerners to European correspondents, and a Confederate dispatch which recounted Bunch&#x27;s dealings with the Confederacy, including the talk of recognition.

When confronted, Russell admitted that his government was attempting to get agreement from the Confederacy to adhere to the provisions of the treaty relating to neutral goods (but not privateering), but he denied that this was in any way a step towards extending diplomatic relations to the Confederates. Rather than reacting as he had to the earlier recognition of belligerency, Seward let this matter drop. He did demand Bunch&#x27;s recall, but Russell refused.

Under Napoleon III, France&#x27;s overall foreign policy objectives were at odds with Britain&#x27;s, but France generally took positions regarding the Civil War combatants similar to, and often supportive of, Britain&#x27;s. Cooperation between Britain and France was begun in the U.S. between Henri Mercier, the French minister, and Lyons. For example, on June 15 they tried to see Seward together regarding the proclamation of neutrality, but Seward insisted that he meet with them separately.

Edouard Thouvenel was the French Foreign Minister for all of 1861 until the fall of 1862. He was generally perceived to be pro-Union and was influential in dampening Napoleon III&#x27;s initial inclination towards diplomatic recognition of Confederate independence. Thouvenel met unofficially with Confederate envoy Pierre Rost in June and told him not to expect diplomatic recognition.

William L. Dayton of New Jersey was appointed by Lincoln as U.S. minister to France. He had no foreign affairs experience and did not speak French, but was assisted a great deal by the U.S. consul general in Paris, John Bigelow. When Adams made his protest to Russell on the recognition of Confederate belligerency, Dayton made a similar protest to Thouvenel. Napoleon offered &quot;his good office&quot; to the United States in resolving the conflict with the South and Dayton was directed by Seward to acknowledge that &quot;if any mediation were at all admissible, it would be his own that we should seek or accept.&quot;
When news of the Confederate victory at the First Battle of Bull Run reached Europe it reinforced British opinion that Confederate independence was inevitable. Hoping to take advantage of this battlefield success, Yancey requested a meeting with Russell but was rebuffed and told that any communications should be in writing. Yancey submitted a long letter on August 14 detailing again the reasons why the Confederacy should receive formal recognition and requesting another meeting with Russell. Russell&#x27;s August 24 reply, directed to the commissioners &quot;of the so-styled Confederate States of America&quot; reiterated the British position that it considered the war as an internal matter rather than a war for independence. British policy would change only if &quot;the fortune of arms or the more peaceful mode of negotiation shall have determined the respective positions of the two belligerents.&quot; No meeting was scheduled and this was the last communication between the British government and the Confederate envoys. When the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair erupted in November and December the Confederacy had no effective way to communicate directly with Great Britain and they were left totally out of the negotiation process.

By August 1861, Yancey was sick, frustrated, and ready to resign. In the same month, President Davis had decided that he needed diplomats in Britain and France. Specifically, ministers that would be better suited to serve as Confederate ministers, should the Confederacy achieve international recognition. He selected John Slidell of Louisiana and James Mason of Virginia. Both men were widely respected throughout the South, and had some background in foreign affairs. Slidell had been appointed as a negotiator by President Polk at the end of the Mexican War, and Mason had been chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1847 to 1860.

R. M. T. Hunter of Virginia was the new Confederate Secretary of State. His instructions to Mason and Slidell were to emphasize the stronger position of the Confederacy now that it had expanded from seven to eleven states, with the likelihood that Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky would also eventually join the new nation. An independent Confederacy would restrict the industrial and maritime ambitions of the United States and lead to a mutually beneficial commercial alliance between Great Britain, France, and the Confederate States. A balance of power would be restored in the Western Hemisphere as the United States&#x27; territorial ambitions would be restricted. They were to liken the Confederate situation to Italy&#x27;s struggles for independence which Britain had supported, and were to quote Russell&#x27;s own letters which justified that support. Of immediate importance, they were to make a detailed argument against the legality of the Union blockade. Along with their formal written instructions, Mason and Slidell carried a number of documents supporting their positions.

==Pursuit and capture (August–November 1861)==
The intended departure of the envoys was no secret, and the Union government received daily intelligence on their movements. By October 1 Slidell and Mason were in Charleston, South Carolina. Their original plan was to run the blockade in , a fast steamer, and sail directly to Britain. But the main channel into Charleston was guarded by five Union ships, and &quot;Nashville&quot;″s draft was too deep for any side channels. A night escape was considered, but tides and strong night winds prevented this. An overland route through Mexico and departure from Matamoros was also considered, but the delay of several months was unacceptable.

The steamer &quot;Gordon&quot; was suggested as an alternative. She had a shallow enough draft to use the back channels and could make over 12 knots, more than enough to elude Union pursuit. &quot;Gordon&quot; was offered to the Confederate government either as a purchase for $62,000 or as a charter for $10,000. The Confederate Treasury could not afford this, but a local cotton broker, George Trenholm, paid the $10,000 in return for half the cargo space on the return trip. Renamed &quot;Theodora&quot;, the ship left Charleston at 1 a.m. on October 12, and successfully evaded Union ships enforcing the blockade. On October 14, she arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas, but had missed connections with a British steamer going to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies, the main point of departure for British ships from the Caribbean to Britain. They discovered that British mail ships might be anchored in Spanish Cuba, and &quot;Theodora&quot; turned southwest towards Cuba. &quot;Theodora&quot; appeared off the coast of Cuba on October 15, with her coal bunkers nearly empty. An approaching Spanish warship hailed &quot;Theodora&quot;. Slidell and George Eustis Jr. went aboard, and were informed that British mail packets docked at Havana, but that the last one had just left, and that the next one, the paddle steamer , would arrive in three weeks. &quot;Theodora&quot; docked in Cárdenas, Cuba on October 16, and Mason and Slidell disembarked. The two men decided to stay in Cardenas before making an overland trip to Havana to catch the next British ship.

Meanwhile, rumors reached the Federal government that Mason and Slidell had escaped aboard &quot;Nashville&quot;. Union intelligence had not immediately recognized that Mason and Slidell had left Charleston on &quot;Theodora&quot;. U.S. Navy Secretary Gideon Welles reacted to the rumor that Mason and Slidell had escaped from Charleston by ordering Admiral Samuel F. DuPont to dispatch a fast warship to Britain to intercept &quot;Nashville&quot;. On October 15, the Union sidewheel steamer , under the command of John B. Marchand, began steaming towards Europe with orders to pursue &quot;Nashville&quot; to the English Channel if necessary. &quot;James Adger&quot; reached Britain and docked in Southampton Harbor in early November. The British government was aware that the United States would attempt to capture the envoys and believed they were on &quot;Nashville&quot;. Palmerston ordered a Royal Navy warship to patrol within the three-mile limit around &quot;Nashville&quot;&#x27;s expected port of call, to assure that any capture would occur outside British territorial waters. This would avoid the diplomatic crisis that would result if &quot;James Adger&quot; pursued &quot;Nashville&quot; into British waters. When &quot;Nashville&quot; arrived on November 21, the British were surprised that the envoys were not on board.

The Union steam frigate , commanded by Captain Charles Wilkes, arrived in St. Thomas on October 13. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; had cruised off the African coast for nearly a month before setting course westward with orders to join a U.S. Navy force preparing to attack Port Royal, South Carolina. In St. Thomas, Wilkes learned that the Confederate raider CSS &quot;Sumter&quot; had captured three U.S. merchant ships near Cienfuegos in July. Wilkes headed there, despite the unlikelihood that &quot;Sumter&quot; would have remained in the area. In Cienfuegos he learned from a newspaper that Mason and Slidell were scheduled to leave Havana on November 7 in the British mail packet , bound first for St. Thomas and then England. He realized that the ship would need to use the &quot;narrow Bahama Channel, the only deepwater route between Cuba and the shallow Grand Bahama Bank&quot;. Wilkes discussed legal options with his second in command, Lt. D. M. Fairfax, and reviewed law books on the subject before making plans to intercept. Wilkes adopted the position that Mason and Slidell would qualify as &quot;contraband&quot;, subject to seizure by a United States ship. Historians have concluded that there was no legal precedent for the seizure.

This aggressive decision making was typical of Wilkes&#x27; command style. On one hand, he was recognized as &quot;a distinguished explorer, author, and naval officer&quot;. On the other, he &quot;had a reputation as a stubborn, overzealous, impulsive, and sometimes insubordinate officer&quot;. Treasury officer George Harrington had warned Seward about Wilkes: &quot;He will give us trouble. He has a superabundance of self-esteem and a deficiency of judgment. When he commanded his great exploring mission he court-martialed nearly all his officers; he alone was right, everybody else was wrong.&quot;

&quot;Trent&quot; left on November 7 as scheduled, with Mason, Slidell, their secretaries, and Slidell&#x27;s wife and children aboard. Just as Wilkes had predicted, &quot;Trent&quot; passed through Bahama Channel, where &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was waiting. Around noon on November 8, lookouts aboard the &quot;San Jacinto&quot; spotted &quot;Trent&quot;, which unfurled the Union Jack as it neared. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; then fired a shot across the bow of &quot;Trent&quot;, which Captain James Moir of &quot;Trent&quot; ignored. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; fired a second shot from her forward pivot gun which landed right in front of &quot;Trent&quot;. &quot;Trent&quot; stopped after the second shot. Lieutenant Fairfax was summoned to the quarterdeck, where Wilkes presented him with the following written instructions:

Fairfax then boarded &quot;Trent&quot; from a cutter. Two cutters carrying a party of twenty men armed with pistols and cutlasses sidled up to &quot;Trent&quot;. Fairfax, certain that Wilkes was creating an international incident and not wanting to enlarge its scope, ordered his armed escort to remain in the cutter. Upon boarding, Fairfax was escorted to an outraged Captain Moir, and announced that he had orders &quot;to arrest Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell and their secretaries, and send them prisoners on board the United States war vessel nearby&quot;. The crew and passengers then threatened Lieutenant Fairfax, and the armed party in the two cutters beside &quot;Trent&quot; responded to the threats by climbing aboard to protect him. Captain Moir refused Fairfax&#x27;s request for a passenger list, but Slidell and Mason came forward and identified themselves. Moir also refused to allow a search of the vessel for contraband, and Fairfax failed to force the issue which would have required seizing the ship as a prize, arguably an act of war. Mason and Slidell made a formal refusal to go voluntarily with Fairfax, but did not resist when Fairfax&#x27;s crewmen escorted them to the cutter.

Wilkes would later claim that he believed that &quot;Trent&quot; was carrying &quot;highly important dispatches and were endowed with instructions inimical to the United States&quot;. Along with the failure of Fairfax to insist on a search of &quot;Trent&quot;, there was another reason why no papers were found in the luggage that was carried with the envoys. Mason&#x27;s daughter, writing in 1906, said that the Confederate dispatch bag had been secured by Commander Williams RN, a passenger on &quot;Trent&quot;, and later delivered to the Confederate envoys in London. This was a clear violation of the Queen&#x27;s Neutrality Proclamation.

International law required that when &quot;contraband&quot; was discovered on a ship, the ship should be taken to the nearest prize court for adjudication. While this was Wilkes&#x27; initial determination, Fairfax argued against this since transferring crew from &quot;San Jacinto&quot; to &quot;Trent&quot; would leave &quot;San Jacinto&quot; dangerously undermanned, and it would seriously inconvenience &quot;Trent&quot;&#x27;s other passengers as well as mail recipients. Wilkes, whose ultimate responsibility it was, agreed and the ship was allowed to proceed to St. Thomas, absent the two Confederate envoys and their secretaries.

&quot;San Jacinto&quot; arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, on November 15, where Wilkes wired news of the capture to Washington. He was then ordered to Boston where he delivered the captives to Fort Warren, a prison for captured Confederates.

==American reaction (November 16 – December 18, 1861)==

Most Northerners learned of the &quot;Trent&quot; capture on November 16 when the news hit afternoon newspapers. By Monday, November 18, the press seemed &quot;universally engulfed in a massive wave of chauvinistic elation&quot;. Everyone was eager to present a legal justification for the capture. Many newspapers argued for the legality of Wilkes&#x27; actions, and numerous lawyers stepped forward to add their approval. Harvard law professor Theophilus Parsons defended the action as did Caleb Cushing, a former Attorney General and many other legal experts. 

On December 2, Congress passed unanimously a resolution thanking Wilkes &quot;for his brave, adroit and patriotic conduct in the arrest and detention of the traitors, James M. Mason and John Slidell&quot; and proposing that he receive a &quot;gold medal with suitable emblems and devices, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of his good conduct&quot;.

But as the matter was given closer study, experts began to have doubts. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles reflected the ambiguity that many felt when he wrote to Wilkes of &quot;the emphatic approval&quot; of the Navy Department for his actions while cautioning him that the failure to take the &quot;Trent&quot; to a prize court &quot;must by no means be permitted to constitute a precedent hereafter for the treatment of any case of similar infraction of neutral obligations&quot;. On November 24, the &quot;New York Times&quot; claimed to find no actual on point precedent. Thurlow Weed&#x27;s &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot; suggested that, if Wilkes had &quot;exercised an unwarranted discretion, our government will properly disavow the proceedings and grant England &#x27;every satisfaction&#x27; consistent with honor and justice&quot;. It did not take long for others to comment that the capture of Mason and Slidell very much resembled the search and impressment practices that the United States had always opposed since its founding and which had previously led to the War of 1812 with Britain. The idea of humans as contraband failed to strike a resonant chord with many.

Leaders also started to realize that the issue might be resolved less on legalities and more on the necessity of avoiding a serious conflict with Britain. Elder statesmen James Buchanan, Thomas Ewing, Lewis Cass, and Robert J. Walker all publicly came out for the necessity of releasing them. By the third week of December much of the editorial opinion started to mirror these opinions and prepare the American citizens for the release of the prisoners. The opinion that Wilkes had operated without orders and had erred by, in effect, holding a prize court on the deck of the &quot;San Jacinto&quot; was being spread.

The United States was initially very reluctant to back down. Seward had lost the initial opportunity to immediately release the two envoys as an affirmation of a long-held U.S. interpretation of international law. He had written to Adams at the end of November that Wilkes had not acted under instructions, but would hold back any more information until it had received some response from Great Britain. He reiterated that recognition of the Confederacy would likely lead to war.
Lincoln was at first enthused about the capture and reluctant to let them go, but as reality set in he stated:

On December 4, Lincoln met with Alexander Galt, the future Canadian Minister of Finance. Lincoln told him that he had no desire for troubles with England or any unfriendly designs toward Canada. When Galt asked specifically about the &quot;Trent&quot; incident, Lincoln replied, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;ll be got along with.&quot; Galt forwarded his account of the meeting to Lyons who forwarded it to Russell. Galt wrote that, despite Lincoln&#x27;s assurances, &quot;I cannot, however, divest my mind of the impression that the policy of the American Govt is so subject to popular impulses, that no assurance can be or ought to be relied on under present circumstances.&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s annual message to Congress did not touch directly on the &quot;Trent&quot; affair but, relying on estimates from Secretary of War Simon Cameron that the U.S. could field a 3,000,000 man army, stated that he could &quot;show the world, that while engaged in quelling disturbances at home we are able to protect ourselves from abroad&quot;.

Finance also played a role: Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase was concerned with any events that might affect American interests in Europe. Chase was aware of the intent of New York banks to suspend gold payments, and he would later make a lengthy argument to the cabinet in support of Seward. Chase felt that the release of Mason and Slidell was very annoying but it was necessary to support the economy. Warren concludes that the diplomatic crisis worsened the financial crisis.

On December 15 the first news on British reaction reached the United States. Britain first learned of the events on November 27. Lincoln was with Senator Orville Browning when Seward brought in the first newspaper dispatches, which indicated Palmerston was demanding a release of the prisoners and an apology. Browning thought the threat of war by Britain was &quot;foolish&quot; but said, &quot;We will fight her to the death.&quot; That night at a diplomatic reception Seward was overheard by William H. Russell saying, &quot;We will wrap the whole world in flames.&quot; The mood in Congress had also changed. When they debated the issue on December 16 and 17, Clement L. Vallandigham, a peace Democrat, proposed a resolution stating that the U.S. maintain the seizure as a matter of honor. The motion was opposed and referred to a committee by the vote of 109 to 16. The official response of the government still awaited the formal British response which did not arrive in America until December 18.

==British reaction (November 27 – December 31, 1861)==

When arrived in Southampton and Commander Marchand learned from &quot;The Times&quot; that his targets had arrived in Cuba, he reacted to the news by boasting that he would capture the two envoys within sight of the British shore if necessary, even if they were on a British ship. As a result of the concerns raised by Marchand&#x27;s statements, the British Foreign Office requested a judicial opinion from the three Law Officers of the Crown (the queen&#x27;s advocate, the attorney general, and the solicitor general) on the legality of capturing the men from a British ship. The written reply dated November 12 declared:

On November 12, Palmerston advised Adams in person that the British nonetheless would take offense if the envoys were removed from a British ship. Palmerston emphasized that seizing the Confederates would be &quot;highly inexpedient in every way Palmerston could view it&quot; and a few more Confederates in Britain would not &quot;produce any change in policy already adopted.&quot; Palmerston questioned the presence of &quot;Adger&quot; in British waters, and Adams assured Palmerston that he had read Marchand&#x27;s orders (Marchand had visited Adams while in Great Britain) which limited him to seizing Mason and Slidell from a Confederate ship.

The news of the actual capture of Mason and Slidell did not arrive in London until November 27. Much of the public and many of the newspapers immediately perceived it as an outrageous insult to British honor, and a flagrant violation of maritime law. The &quot;London Chronicle&quot;″s response was typical:

The London &quot;Standard&quot; saw the capture as &quot;but one of a series of premeditated blows aimed at this country … to involve it in a war with the Northern States&quot;. A letter from an American visitor written to Seward declared, &quot;The people are frantic with rage, and were the country polled I fear 999 men out of 1,000 would declare for immediate war.&quot; Contrary to reports of overwhelming pro-Confederate sentiments amongst the British population, Karl Marx, exiled in London at that time, organized with and reported for British workers to publicly voice dissent against British coalition with the Confederacy: Convinced that the germ of the future revolution lay in the North, Marx supported the bourgeois republic in its struggle against the slave oligarchy. In this respect he had the wholehearted aid of the British proletariat. When in the latter part of 1861, the reactionary Palmerston government attempted to use the Trent affair as a pretext for a war against the North, English workers held protest meetings in Brighton and elsewhere. These demonstrations were called in spite of the fact that the British ruling classes did everything in their power to make the workers believe that an alliance with the Confederacy would result in the breaking of the Northern blockade of Southern ports, which in turn, would mean the importation of greater quantities of cotton with consequent re-employment and prosperity. Yet, the British workers could not be so easily fooled; despite widespread misery and starvation, they showed their &quot;indestructible excellence&quot; by opposing the warmongers and by demanding peace. Their pro-Union demonstrations forced the Palmerston government to adopt a more conciliatory tone throughout the entire Trent affair. Marx, in reporting these meetings to his American readers, requested them never to forget that &quot;at least the working classes of England&quot; were on their side.A member of Parliament stated that unless America set matters right the British flag should &quot;be torn into shreds and sent to Washington for use of the Presidential water-closets&quot;. The seizure provoked one anti-Union meeting, held in Liverpool (later a hub of Confederate sympathy) and chaired by the future Confederate spokesman James Spence.

&quot;The Times&quot; published its first report from the United States on December 4, and its correspondent, W. H. Russell, wrote of American reactions, &quot;There is so much violence of spirit among the lower orders of the people and they are … so saturated with pride and vanity that any honorable concession … would prove fatal to its authors.&quot; &quot;Times&quot; editor John T. Delane took a moderate stance and warned the people not to &quot;regard the act in the worst light&quot; and to question whether it made sense that the United States, despite British misgivings about Seward that went back to the earliest days of the Lincoln administration, would &quot;force a quarrel upon the Powers of Europe&quot;. This restrained stance was common in Britain: &quot;the press, as a whole, preached calm and praised it too, noting the general moderation of public temper it perceived&quot;.

The government got its first solid information on the &quot;Trent&quot; from Commander Williams who went directly to London after he arrived in England. He spent several hours with the Admiralty and the Prime Minister. Initial reaction among political leaders was firmly opposed to the American actions. Lord Clarendon, a former foreign secretary, expressed what many felt when he accused Seward of &quot;trying to provoke us into a quarrel and finding that it could not be effected at Washington he was determined to compass it at sea&quot;.

Resisting Russell&#x27;s call for an immediate cabinet meeting, Palmerston again called on the Law Officers to prepare a brief based on the actual events that had occurred, and an emergency cabinet meeting was scheduled two days later for Friday, November 29. Palmerston also informed the War Office that budget reductions scheduled for 1862 should be put on hold. Russell met briefly with Adams on November 29 to determine whether he could shed any light on American intent. Adams was unaware that Seward had already sent him a letter indicating Wilkes had acted without orders and was unable to provide Russell any information that might defuse the situation.

Palmerston, who believed he had received a verbal agreement from Adams that British vessels would not be interfered with, reportedly began the emergency cabinet meeting by throwing his hat on the table and declaring, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether you are going to stand this, but I&#x27;ll be damned if I do.&quot; The Law Officers&#x27; report was read and confirmed that Wilkes actions were:

Dispatches from Lyons were given to all in attendance. These dispatches described the excitement in America in support of the capture, referred to previous dispatches in which Lyons had warned that Seward might provoke such an incident, and described the difficulty that the United States might have in acknowledging that Wilkes had erred. Lyons also recommended a show of force including sending reinforcements to Canada. Palmerston indicated to Lord Russell that it was very possible that the entire incident had been a &quot;deliberate and premeditated insult&quot; designed by Seward to &quot;provoke&quot; a confrontation with Britain.

After several days of discussion, on November 30 Russell sent to Queen Victoria the drafts of the dispatches intended for Lord Lyons to deliver to Seward. The Queen in turn asked her husband and consort, Prince Albert, to review the matter. Although ill with typhoid that would shortly take his life, Albert read through the dispatches, decided the ultimatum was too belligerent, and composed a softened version. In his November 30 response to Palmerston, Albert wrote:

The cabinet incorporated in its official letter to Seward Albert&#x27;s suggestions that would allow Washington to disavow both Wilkes&#x27; actions and any American intent to insult the British flag. The British still demanded an apology and the release of the Confederate emissaries. Lyons&#x27; private instructions directed him to give Seward seven days to reply and to close the British Legation in Washington and return home if a satisfactory response was not forthcoming. In a further effort to defuse the situation, Russell added his own private note telling Lyons to meet with Seward and advise him of the contents of the official letter before it was actually delivered. Lyons was told that as long as the commissioners were released, the British would &quot;be rather easy about the apology&quot; and that an explanation sent through Adams would probably be satisfactory. He reiterated that the British would fight if necessary, and suggested that the &quot;best thing would be if Seward could be turned out and a rational man put in his place.&quot; The dispatches were shipped on December 1 via the &quot;Europa&quot;, reaching Washington on December 18.

===Diplomacy on hold===
While military preparations were accelerated, diplomacy would be on hold for the rest of the month while Britain waited for the American response. There had been unrest in the British financial markets since the news of the &quot;Trent&quot; was first received. Consols, which had initially declined in value in the early part of the month, fell by another 2 percent, reaching the level during the first year of the Crimean War. Other securities fell another 4 to 5 percent. Railway stocks and colonial and foreign securities declined. &quot;The Times&quot; noted that the financial markets were reacting as if war were a certainty.

In the early deliberations over the appropriate British response to the capture of the envoys, there was concern that Napoleon III would take advantage of a Union-British war to act against British interests in &quot;Europe or elsewhere&quot;. French and British interests clashed in Indochina, in building the Suez Canal, in Italy, and in Mexico. Palmerston saw French stockpiling of coal in the West Indies as indicating France was preparing for war with Britain. The French Navy remained smaller, but had otherwise shown itself equal to the Royal Navy in the Crimean War. A possible buildup of ironclads by the French would present a clear threat in the English Channel.

France quickly alleviated many of Britain&#x27;s concerns. On November 28, with no knowledge of the British response or any input from Mercier in the U.S., Napoleon met with his cabinet. They had no doubts about the illegality of the U.S. actions and agreed to support whatever demands Britain made. Thouvenel wrote to Count Charles de Flahault in London to inform Britain of their decision. After learning of the actual content of the British note, Thouvenel advised the British ambassador Lord Cowley, that the demand had his complete approval, and on December 4 instructions were sent to Mercier to support Lyons.

A minor stir occurred when General Winfield Scott, until recently the commander of all Union troops, and Thurlow Weed, a known confidant of Seward, arrived in Paris. Their mission, to counter Confederate propaganda efforts with propaganda efforts of their own, had been determined before the &quot;Trent&quot; affair, but the timing was considered odd by Cowley. Rumors circulated that Scott was blaming the whole incident on Seward who had somehow manipulated Lincoln into acquiescing with the seizure. Scott put the rumors to rest with a December 4 letter that was published in the Paris &quot;Constitutional&quot; and reprinted throughout Europe, including most London papers. Denying the rumors, Scott stated that &quot;every instinct of prudence as well as of good neighborhood prompts our government to regard no honorable sacrifice too great for the preservation of the friendship of Great Britain.&quot;

The benign intentions of the United States were also argued by John Bright and Richard Cobden, strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain. Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations &quot;before we have made a representation to the American Government, before we have heard a word from it in reply, [we] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?&quot; Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings that he could not attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.

===Military preparations (December 1860 – December 1861)===

Even before the Civil War erupted, Britain, with her worldwide interests, needed to have a military policy regarding the divided United States. In 1860 Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Milne took command of the North America and West Indies station of the Royal Navy. On December 22, 1860, with secession still in its early stages, Milne&#x27;s orders were to avoid &quot;any measure or demonstration likely to give umbrage to any party in the United States, or to bear the appearance of partizanship on either side; if the internal dissensions in those States should be carried to the extent of separation&quot;. Until May 1861, in compliance with these instructions and as part of a long-standing policy of the Royal Navy to avoid ports where desertion was likely, Milne avoided the American coast. In May the Neutrality Proclamation of May 13 was issued. This increased British concern over the threat of Confederate privateers and Union blockading ships to British neutral rights, and Milne was reinforced. On June 1 British ports were closed to any naval prizes, a policy that was of great advantage to the Union. Milne did monitor the effectiveness of the Union blockade, but no effort to contest its effectiveness was ever attempted, and the monitoring was discontinued in November 1861.

Milne received a letter from Lyons on June 14 that said he did not &quot;regard a sudden declaration of war against us by the United States as an event altogether impossible at any moment&quot;. Milne warned his scattered forces, and in a June 27 letter to the Admiralty asked for further reinforcements and deplored the weakness of the defenses in the West Indies. Referring to Jamaica, Milne reported conditions that included, &quot;works badly contrived and worse executed—unserviceable guns—decayed gun cartridges—corroded shot—the absence of stores of all kinds and of ammunition, with dilapidated and damp powder magazines&quot;. Milne made it clear that his existing forces were totally absorbed simply in protecting commerce and defending possessions, many inadequately. He had only a single ship available &quot;for any special service that may be suddenly required&quot;.

The Duke of Somerset, the First Lord of the Admiralty, opposed Palmerston&#x27;s inclination to reinforce Milne. He felt that the existing force made up largely of steam ships was superior to the primarily sail ships of the Union fleet, and he was reluctant to incur additional expenses while Britain was in the process of rebuilding her fleet with iron ships. This resistance by Parliament and the cabinet led historian Kenneth Bourne to conclude, &quot;When, therefore the news of the &quot;Trent&quot; outrage arrived in England the British were still not properly prepared for the war which almost everyone agreed was inevitable if the Union did not back down.&quot;

====Land forces====

On the land, at the end of March 1861, Britain had 2,100 regular troops in Nova Scotia, 2,200 in the rest of Canada, and scattered posts in British Columbia, Bermuda, and the West Indies. Lieutenant General Sir William Fenwick Williams, Commander in Chief, North America, did what he could with his small forces, but he wrote repeatedly to the authorities back in Britain that he needed considerable reinforcements to prepare his defenses adequately.

Some land reinforcements were sent in May and June. When Palmerston, alarmed by the blockade and the &quot;Trent&quot; affair, pressed for increasing the number of regular troops in Canada to 10,000, he met resistance. Sir George Cornwall Lewis, head of the War Office, questioned whether there was any real threat to Great Britain. He judged it &quot;incredible that any Government of ordinary prudence should at a moment of civil war gratuitously increase the number of its enemies, and, moreover, incur the hostility of so formidable a power as England&quot;. In the debate in Parliament on June 21 there was general opposition to reinforcements, based on political, military, and economic arguments. A long standing issue was the attempt by Parliament to shift more of the burden of Canadian defense to the local government. Colonial secretary Newcastle felt that the requests by Williams were part of a pattern of the &quot;last few years&quot; in which he had &quot;been very fertile of demands and suggestions&quot;. Newcastle was also concerned that there were no winter quarters available for additional troops and he feared desertions would be a serious problem.

From the beginning of the &quot;Trent&quot; crisis British leaders were aware that a viable military option was an essential part of defending the nation&#x27;s interests. The First Lord of the Admiralty believed Canada could not be defended from a serious attack by the U.S. and winning it back later would be difficult and costly. Bourne noted, &quot;After 1815 the ambiguity of Anglo-American relations, the parsimony of the house of commons [sic] and the enormous practical difficulties involved always seemed to have prevented adequate preparations being made for an Anglo-American war.&quot; Somerset suggested a naval war as opposed to a ground war.

Military preparation began quickly after news of the &quot;Trent&quot; reached Great Britain. Secretary of War Sir George Lewis proposed within a week to send &quot;thirty thousand rifles, an artillery battery, and some officers to Canada&quot;. He wrote to Lord Palmerston on December 3, &quot;I propose to engage a Cunard Steamer &amp; send out one regiment &amp; one battery of artillery next week&quot; followed as quickly as possible by three more regiments and more artillery. Given the realities of the North Atlantic in winter, the reinforcements would have to land in Nova Scotia, since the Saint Lawrence River begins to ice up in December.

Russell was concerned that Lewis and Palmerston might take actions prematurely that would eliminate what chances for peace that there were, so he requested &quot;a small committee …[to] assist Lewis, &amp; the Duke of Somerset&quot; with their war plans. The group was created and convened on December 9. The group consisted of Palmerston, Lewis, Somerset, Russell, Newcastle, Lord Granville (foreign secretary) and the Duke of Cambridge (commander-in-chief of the British Army), advised by Earl de Grey (Lewis&#x27; undersecretary), Lord Seaton (a former commander-in-chief in Canada), General John Fox Burgoyne (the inspector general of fortifications) and Colonel Patrick Leonard MacDougall (the former commander of the Royal Canadian Rifles). The first priority of the committee was Canadian defense, and the committee relied on both plans developed by previous explorations of the issue and information that the committee developed on its own from the testimony of experts.

The current resources in Canada consisted of five thousand regular troops and about an equal number of &quot;ill-trained&quot; militia of which only one-fifth were organized. During December the British managed to send 11,000 troops using 18 transport ships and by the end of the month they were prepared to send an additional 28,400 men. By the end of December, as the crisis ended, reinforcements had raised the count to 924 officers and 17,658 men against an anticipated American invasion of from 50,000 to 200,000 troops. Including the units sent overland and the British forces already in the Province of Canada, British field forces in the province would have amounted to nine infantry battalions and four field artillery batteries by mid-March, 1862, a force equivalent to three brigades (i.e., one division), with four infantry battalions and two field artillery batteries (the equivalent of two more brigades) split between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There were also 12 batteries of garrison artillery – six in the Province of Canada, three in Nova Scotia, two in New Brunswick and one in Newfoundland—and three companies of engineers in Canada, plus various headquarters, service, and support elements including two battalions of the Military Train

Five infantry battalions, three field artillery batteries, and six garrison artillery batteries moved by sea from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Saint John, New Brunswick, then overland by sleigh from Saint John to Riviere du Loup, Province of Canada, between January 1 and March 13, 1862. The 10-day-long overland passage, and the railway from Riviere du Loup to Ville du Quebec, was within a day&#x27;s march of the border (in some locations, the overland trail was almost within rifle shot from U.S. territory in Maine), so the British staff planned on deploying infantry to defend the road, if necessary. The 96th Regiment, travelling on the &quot;Calcutta&quot;, reached New Brunswick in February; the other half were forced to abandon their voyage in the Azores when their ship, the &quot;Victoria&quot;, nearly sank. The Headquarters staff, who landed in Halifax on 5 January 1862 after the crisis was over, decided to take a quicker route to Montreal and, covering up their military baggage labels to disguise their identities, took a Cunard steamer to Boston from where they caught the railway to Montreal.

In Canada, General Williams had toured the available forts and fortifications in November and December. Historian Gordon Warren wrote that Williams found that, &quot;forts were either decaying or nonexistent, and the amount of necessary remedial work was stupefying.&quot; To defend Canada, the British government estimated their manpower requirements as 10,000 regulars and 100,000 auxiliary troops, the latter forming garrisons and harassing the enemy&#x27;s flanks and rear. Canada offered two potential sources of such auxiliary troops: the Sedentary Militia, which consisted of all Canadian males between ages 16 and 60, and volunteer organisations similar to the British rifle volunteers. Bourne summed up these two forces as follows:

Williams&#x27; task in raising, arming and disciplining this army was not dissimilar to the one that the Union and Confederates had faced at the beginning of the Civil War, a year earlier. In the Province of Canada there were 25,000 arms, 10,000 of them smoothbores, and in the Maritimes there were 13,000 rifles and 7,500 smoothbores: though weapons were readily available in England, the difficulty was in transporting them to Canada. 30,000 Enfield rifles were sent on December 6 with the &quot;Melbourne&quot;, and by February 10, 1862, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that modern arms and equipment for 105,550 had arrived in Canada along with 20 million cartridges.

On December 2, at Williams&#x27; urging, the Canadian government agreed to raise its active volunteer force to 7,500. The risk of war pushed the number of volunteers to 13,390 by May 1862, although the number of &quot;efficient&quot; volunteers was only 11,940. On December 20, Williams also began training one company of 75 men from each battalion of the Sedentary Militia, about 38,000 men in total, with the intention of raising this to 100,000. Warren describes the Sedentary militia on their initial muster, before arms and equipment were served out to them:

By the summer of 1862, long after the crisis had subsided, the available Canadian volunteers numbered 16,000; 10,615 infantry; 1,615 cavalry; 1,687 artillery; 202 volunteer engineers besides new corps not yet accepted into service and the militia. Militia returns for 1862 show 470,000 militiamen in Canada, but with the volunteers it was not expected to raise more than 100,000 Canadian troops for active service. It was within the context of a generally unprepared Canadian military that military ground plans were formulated—plans contingent on troops that would not be available until spring 1862. Canada was not prepared for war with the United States. In the War Cabinet there had been disagreement between MacDougall, who believed that the Union would suspend the war and turn its full attention to Canada, and Burgoyne, who believed the war would continue. Both agreed that Canada would face a major ground assault from the United States—an assault that both recognized would be difficult to oppose. The defense depended on &quot;an extensive system of fortifications&quot; and &quot;seizing command of the lakes&quot;. While Burgoyne stressed the natural tactical advantages of fighting on the defense out of strong fortifications, the fact was that the fortification plans previously made had never been executed. On the Great Lakes, both Canada and the United States had no naval assets to speak of in November. The British would be vulnerable here at least until the spring of 1862.

====Invasion plans====

In order to counter their weaknesses to an American offensive, the idea of a British invasion of the United States from Canada was proposed. It was hoped that a successful invasion would occupy large sections of Maine, including Portland. The British believed that this would require the U.S. to divert troops that would otherwise be occupied with an invasion of Canada directed at its east-west communication and transportation lines. Burgoyne, Seaton, and MacDougall all supported the plan and Lewis recommended it to Palmerston on December 3. No preparations for this attack were ever made, and success depended on the attack being initiated at the very beginning of the war. MacDougall believed that &quot;a strong party is believed to exist in Maine in favor of annexation to Canada&quot; (a belief that Bourne characterizes as &quot;dubious&quot;), and that this party would assist a British invasion. The Admiralty hydrographer, Captain Washington, and Milne both felt that if such a party existed that it would be best to postpone an attack and wait until it became apparent that &quot;the state was inclined to change masters.&quot;

On December 28, 1861, Governor of the Colony of British Columbia James Douglas wrote to Secretary of State for the Colonies Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle, arguing that Britain should have the opportunity to take parts of the U.S.-held Pacific Northwest while America was preoccupied with the Civil War. He lay out his reasoning in the letter regarding the military strength of both nations in the region:

====Naval forces====

It was at sea that the British had their greatest strength and their greatest ability to bring the war to the United States if necessary. The Admiralty, on December 1, wrote to Russell that Milne &quot;should give his particular attention to the measures that may be necessary for the protection of the valuable trade between America, the West Indies, and England&quot;. Somerset issued provisional orders to British naval units around the world to be prepared to attack American shipping wherever it might be found. The Cabinet was also agreed that establishing and maintaining a tight blockade was essential to British success.

In 1864 Milne wrote that his own plan was:

Regarding possible joint operations with the Confederacy, Somerset wrote to Milne on December 15:

Somerset was opposed to attacking heavily fortified positions and Milne concurred:

The British strongly believed that they had naval superiority over the Union. Although Union ships outnumbered Milne&#x27;s available force, many of the United States fleet were simply remodeled merchant ships, and the British had an advantage in the number of total guns available. Bourne suggested that this advantage could change during the war as both sides turned more to ironclads. In particular, British ironclads had a deeper draught and could not operate in American coastal waters, leaving a close blockade dependent on wooden ships vulnerable to Union ironclads.

Of course, the military option was not needed. If it had been, Warren concluded that, &quot;Britain&#x27;s world dominance of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had vanished; the Royal Navy, although more powerful than ever, no longer ruled the waves.&quot; Military historian Russell Weigley concurs in Warren&#x27;s analysis and adds:

Some contemporaries were less sanguine about the U.S. Navy&#x27;s prospects in a war with Britain. On 5 July 1861, Lieutenant David Dixon Porter wrote to his old friend, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox:

In February 1862, the Duke of Cambridge, the British Army&#x27;s commander-in-chief, gave his analysis of British military reaction to the &quot;Trent&quot; affair:

==Resolution (December 17, 1861 – January 14, 1862)==
On December 17, Adams received Seward&#x27;s November 30 dispatch stating that Wilkes acted without orders, and Adams immediately told Russell. Russell was encouraged by the news, but deferred any action until a formal response to the British communication was received. The note was not released to the public, but rumors were published by the press of the Union intent. Russell refused to confirm the information, and John Bright later asked in Parliament, &quot;How came it that this dispatch was never published for the information of the people of this country?&quot;

In Washington, Lyons received the official response and his instructions on December 18. As instructed, Lyons met with Seward on December 19 and described the contents of the British response without actually delivering them. Seward was told that the British would expect a formal reply within seven days of Seward&#x27;s receipt of the official communication. At Seward&#x27;s request, Lyons gave him an unofficial copy of the British response which Seward immediately shared with Lincoln. On Saturday December 21 Lyons visited Seward to deliver the &quot;British ultimatum&quot;, but after further discussion they agreed that the formal delivery would be postponed for another two days. Lyons and Seward reached an agreement that the seven-day deadline should not be considered as part of the official communication from the British government.

Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent consultant to President Lincoln on foreign relations, had recognized immediately that the United States must release Mason and Slidell, but he had remained publicly silent during the weeks of high excitement. Sumner had traveled in England and carried on regular correspondence with many political activists in Britain. In December, he received particularly alarming letters from Richard Cobden and John Bright. Bright and Cobden discussed the preparations of the government for war and the widespread doubts, including their own, of the legality of Wilkes&#x27; actions. The Duchess of Argyll, a strong antislavery advocate in Great Britain, wrote Sumner that the capture of the envoys was &quot;the maddest act that ever was done, and, unless the [United States] government intend to force us to war, utterly inconceivable.&quot;

Sumner took these letters to Lincoln, who had just learned of the official British demand. Sumner and Lincoln met daily over the next week and discussed the ramifications of a war with Great Britain. In a December 24 letter Sumner wrote that the concerns were over the British fleet breaking the blockade and establishing their own blockade, French recognition of the Confederacy and movement into Mexico and Latin America, and the post-war (assuming Confederate independence) widespread smuggling of British manufactures via the South that would cripple American manufacturing. Lincoln thought that he could meet directly with Lyons and &quot;show him in five minutes that I am heartily for peace&quot;, but Sumner persuaded him of the diplomatic impropriety of such a meeting. Both men ended up agreeing that arbitration might be the best solution, and Sumner was invited to attend a cabinet meeting scheduled for Christmas morning.

Relevant information from Europe flowed to Washington right up to the time of the cabinet meeting. On December 25 a letter written on December 6 by Adams was received in Washington. Adams wrote:

Two messages from American consuls in Great Britain were also received at the same time. From Manchester the news was that Britain was arming &quot;with the greatest energy&quot; and from London the message was that a &quot;strong fleet&quot; was being built with work going on around the clock, seven days a week. Thurlow Weed, who had moved from Paris to London to ensure that General Scott&#x27;s letter was circulated, also sent a letter advising Seward that &quot;such prompt and gigantic preparations were never known.&quot;

The disruption of trade threatened the Union war effort as well as British prosperity. British India was the only source of the saltpeter used in Union gunpowder. Within hours of learning of the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair Russell moved to halt the export of saltpeter and two days later the Cabinet banned the export of arms, ammunition, military stores and lead. Britain was one of the few sources of weapons designated &quot;first class&quot; by the Union army, and between 1 May 1861 and 31 December 1862 it supplied more than 382,500 muskets and rifles and 49,982,000 percussion caps to the Union. One historian concluded of the Union&#x27;s source of weapons that &quot;The domestic market, which consisted of few sporting arms and a few hastily manufactured and often inferior rifles and muskets, was soon exhausted… Foreign arms became the major source of supply in the first year and a half of the war… British and European arms allowed the Union army to take the field early in the war.&quot;

The wider U.S. economy was soon hit by the effects of the &quot;Trent&quot; crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock exchange fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase&#x27;s broker refused to sell some of the secretary&#x27;s holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community &quot;trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough&quot;. A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25–15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs &quot;General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?&quot; The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of &quot;greenbacks&quot; to meet its obligations.

With all of the negative news, the official response from France also arrived. Dayton had already told Seward of his own meeting with Thouvenel, in which the French foreign minister had told him that Wilkes&#x27; actions were &quot;a clear breach of international law&quot; but that France would &quot;remain a spectator in any war between the United States and England&quot;. A direct message was received on Christmas Day from Thouvenel (it was actually delivered during the cabinet meeting) urging that the United States release the prisoners and in so doing affirm the rights of neutrals on the seas that France and the United States had repeatedly argued against Great Britain.

Seward had prepared a draft of his intended response to the British prior to the cabinet meeting and he was the only one present who had a detailed, organized position to present. His main point in the debate was that releasing the prisoners was consistent with the traditional American position on the right of neutrals, and the public would accept it as such. Both Chase and Attorney General Edward Bates were strongly influenced by the various messages from Europe, and Postmaster Montgomery Blair had been in favor of releasing the captives even before the meeting. Lincoln clung to arbitration but received no support, the primary objection being the time that would be involved and an impatient Britain. No decision was made at the meeting and a new meeting was scheduled for the next day. Lincoln indicated he wished to prepare his own paper for this meeting. The next day Seward&#x27;s proposal to release the prisoners was accepted without dissent. Lincoln did not submit a counter argument, indicating afterwards to Seward that he had found he was unable to draft a convincing rebuttal to Seward&#x27;s position.

Seward&#x27;s reply was &quot;a long, highly political document&quot;. Seward stated that Wilkes had acted on his own and denied allegations by the British that the seizure itself had been conducted in a discourteous and violent manner. The capture and search of &quot;Trent&quot; was consistent with international law, and Wilkes&#x27; only error was in failing to take &quot;Trent&quot; to a port for judicial determination. The release of the prisoners was therefore required in order &quot;to do to the British nation just what we have always insisted all nations ought to do to us&quot;. Seward&#x27;s reply, in effect, accepted Wilkes&#x27; treatment of the prisoners as contraband and also equated their capture with the British exercise of impressment of British citizens off of neutral ships. This response contradicted itself in a number of ways. Citing the precedent of impressment implied that Mason and Slidell had been removed for their status as American nationals, rather than as contraband; it was a reversal of America&#x27;s previous position on the topic, referred to a right the British had not exercised for half a century, and—as Mason and Slidell were taken prisoner rather than being conscripted into the navy—was irrelevant to the case. More fundamentally, Seward&#x27;s stance assumed that a state of war was in effect: otherwise, Federal warships would have had no legal status as belligerents with the right of search. At the time of the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair, the North was not only refusing to acknowledge a state of war, but was still demanding that the British government withdraw its recognition of Confederate belligerency in the form of the Proclamation of Neutrality.

Lyons was summoned to Seward&#x27;s office on December 27 and presented with the response. Focusing on the release of the prisoners rather than Seward&#x27;s stated analysis of the situation, Lyons forwarded the message and decided to remain in Washington until further instructions were received. The news of the release was published by December 29 and the public response was generally positive. Among those opposed to the decision was Wilkes who characterized it &quot;as a craven yielding and an abandonment of all the good … done by [their] capture&quot;. Such was the sense of urgency in Britain to learn of the outcome that special trains carried the news from its landfall in Wales to London, breaking speed records on the way.

Mason and Slidell were released from Fort Warren and boarded the Royal Navy screw sloop at Provincetown, Massachusetts. The &quot;Rinaldo&quot; took them to St. Thomas; on January 14, they left on the British mail packet &quot;La Plata&quot; bound for Southampton. The news of their release reached Britain on January 8. The British accepted the news as a diplomatic victory. Palmerston noted that Seward&#x27;s response contained &quot;many doctrines of international law&quot; contrary to the British interpretation, and Russell wrote a detailed response to Seward contesting his legal interpretations, but, by this time, the crisis was over.

==Aftermath==

Historian Charles Hubbard describes the Confederate perspective to the resolution of the crisis:

The issue of diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy remained alive. It was considered further throughout 1862 by the British and French governments within the context of formally extending an offer, difficult to refuse, for mediation of the war. As the war in America intensified and the bloody results of the Battle of Shiloh became known, the humanitarian reasons for European intervention seemed to have more merit. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September 1862 made it clear that the issue of slavery was now at the forefront of the war. At first the British reaction to the Battle of Antietam and the preliminary announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation was that this would only create a slave rebellion within the South as the war itself became progressively more violent. Only in November 1862 did the momentum for European intervention reverse course.

Historians have given special credit to Seward and Lincoln for their handling of the crisis. Seward always favored handing back the captives. Lincoln, realizing the disaster that war would bring, also had to deal with an angry public opinion. Biographer James Randall argues that Lincoln&#x27;s contribution was decisive, as it lay:

in his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department&#x27;s attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America&#x27;s true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.

<text>Charles-Gilbert Romme (26 March 1750 – 17 June 1795) was a French politician and mathematician who developed the French Republican Calendar.

==Biography==
Charles Gilbert Romme was born in Riom, Puy-de-Dôme, in the Auvergne region of France, where he received an education in medicine and mathematics. After spending five years in Paris, he went to Russia to become the tutor of Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov. He returned to Paris in 1788 and entered political life.

He was a member of the Masonic lodge, Les Neuf Sœurs.

Elected on 10 September 1791 to the Legislative Assembly, Romme aligned himself with the Girondists, but after his election to the National Convention on 6 September 1792, he sided with the Montagnards.

He voted in favour of the death sentence for Louis XVI. Later, in the events leading up to the Reign of Terror, he was arrested by Girondist supporters and was imprisoned in Caen for two months.

During his tenure in National Convention, Romme served in the (&quot;Comité de l’instruction Publique&quot;), where he presented his report on the republican calendar on 17 September 1793 and then developed an agricultural almanac based on the new calendar. Aware of their military importance, he was also an early supporter of semaphore telegraphs. He served as president of the Convention from 21 November to 6 December 1793. 

Because he was on an assignment to organise gun production for the navy, he had no hand in the coup of 9 Thermidor &quot;an II&quot; (27 July 1794), which resulted in the fall of the Robespierre (and ultimately led to the return of the Girondists).

When rioting sans-culottes, demanding bread and the Jacobin constitution, violently occupied the Convention on 1 Prairial &quot;an III&quot; (20 May 1795), Romme supported their demands. This insurrection was quickly put down however, and he and other Montagnards were arrested. While waiting for their trial, the defendants agreed to commit suicide in case of a death sentence.

On 29 Prairial (17 June), Paris, France, Romme and five others were sentenced to the guillotine. With a knife hidden by Jean-Marie Goujon, he stabbed himself repeatedly while on the staircase leading from the courtroom, and died — his last words are reported to have been &quot;I die for the republic&quot;.

In &quot;Romme le Montagnard&quot; (1833), Marc de Vissac described Romme as a small, awkward and clumsy man with an ill complexion and a dull orator but also as possessing a pleasant and instructive style of conversation.

<text>Nona Bernis Hendryx (born October 9, 1944) is an American vocalist, record producer, songwriter, musician, and author. Hendryx is known for her work as a solo artist as well as for being one-third of the trio Labelle, who had a hit with &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. In 1977, Hendryx released her self-titled debut solo album, a commercial failure that resulted in Hendryx being released from her recording contract. In the early 1980s, Hendryx sang with experimental funk group Material, achieving the hit &quot;Busting Out&quot;.
Material produced her second album, &quot;Nona&quot; (1983), containing the modest Top 30 R&amp;B and Dance charts hit &quot;Keep It Confidential&quot;. The album cut &quot;Transformation&quot; became a Hendryx signature song. In 1985, Hendryx wrote and recorded the Grammy nominated song &quot;Rock This House&quot; with Keith Richards from her fourth solo album &quot;The Heat&quot; (1985). Hendryx went on to record the theme for &quot;Moving Violations&quot; and &quot;I Sweat (Going Through the Motions)&quot;, a commercial hit for Hendryx from the Jamie Lee Curtis film &quot;Perfect&quot;. She also took part in the Artists United Against Apartheid project with the international hit, &quot;Sun City&quot;, from the album of the same title. Hendryx&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;Why Should I Cry?&quot;, from her fifth album became a Top 10 R&amp;B chart hit. She recorded &quot;Transparent&quot; from the 1988 Eddie Murphy vehicle, &quot;Coming to America&quot;. Hendryx received an Emmy nomination as a composer of &quot;People: A Musical Celebration&quot; in 1996 for Outstanding Music and Lyrics.

She has also appeared on the third season of &quot;The L Word&quot;.Her music has ranged from soul, funk, and R&amp;B to hard rock, new wave, and new-age. She stated in an interview that her family&#x27;s last name was originally spelled with an &#x27;i&#x27; and that she is a distant cousin of guitarist Jimi Hendrix.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Hendryx, who is of African American heritage, was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1944. There, she met fellow New Jersey native Sarah Dash and later met Philadelphia-born singer Patricia Holte (Patti LaBelle). After a short-lived tenure as a member of the Del-Capris, Hendryx and Dash formed a singing group with Holte (once the lead singer of a girl group in Philadelphia called The Ordettes). In 1961, Cindy Birdsong, from Camden, New Jersey, became the fourth member of the group, who became the Bluebelles and signed their first deal with Newtown Records.

After the release of their debut hit, 1962&#x27;s &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;, their name altered again to Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. Hendryx&#x27;s husky alto differed from Dash&#x27;s sharp soprano, LaBelle&#x27;s mezzo-soprano and Birdsong&#x27;s second soprano. During this tenure, the group became known for their emotional live performances and their renditions of classic standards such as &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. The group often found themselves competing against girl groups such as The Chantels, Shirelles, and The Supremes. In 1967, Hendryx, LaBelle, and Dash were shocked to discover that Birdsong had secretly joined the Supremes after Florence Ballard was ousted from the group by Motown. Different members of the group were in touch with Birdsong over the years. Birdsong&#x27;s relationships with the Bluebelles healed and they came together again for the ceremony when the group won an R&amp;B Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.

===Labelle===
For the next three years, the group struggled to compete against the changing musical landscape for which their girl group sound had fallen out of favor with popular audiences. In 1971, they moved to England, where they had a cult fan base, and on the advice of Vicki Wickham, changed their name to Labelle and ditched the dresses and bouffant wigs for jeans and Afros. Releasing transitional albums including 1971&#x27;s &quot;Labelle&quot; and 1972&#x27;s &quot;Moon Shadow&quot;, the group recorded material that included sexual and political subject matter – unheard of for an all-female black group. The transition was hard for lead singer LaBelle, who was a fan of the group&#x27;s early-era ballads, but she eventually gave in. Member Dash remained neutral throughout the tenure of the group. Shortly after releasing &quot;Labelle&quot;, the group became the opening act for The Who, whose producer Kit Lambert had produced the group&#x27;s Warner debut. They also opened for Laura Nyro during that same time and sang backup on her album &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot;.

Beginning with the &quot;Moon Shadow&quot; album, Hendryx became the chief songwriter for most of the group&#x27;s records while LaBelle and Dash occasionally wrote their own material. After successfully opening for The Rolling Stones during the group&#x27;s American tour in 1973, the group released &quot;Pressure Cookin&#x27;&quot;, where they once again adopted a new look as &quot;glam rock, space-age divas&quot;. As a songwriter, Hendryx subsequently wrote powerful ballads (&quot;You Turn Me On&quot; and &quot;Nightbird&quot; from &quot;Nightbirds&quot;, &quot;Going Down Makes Me Shiver&quot; from Labelle&#x27;s final album, &quot;Chameleon&quot;), and a wealth of more uptempo numbers (&quot;Space Children&quot;, &quot;Messin&#x27; with My Mind&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Moths&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching the Watcher&quot;). Her themes were unconventional, diverse, and often experimental. Her composition &quot;A Man in a Trenchcoat (Voodoo)&quot; from &quot;Chameleon&quot; also marked Hendryx&#x27;s first time singing lead vocal on an album. In 1974, the group hit gold with the release of &quot;Nightbirds&quot; following the release of the smash hit &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. In her memoir &quot;Don&#x27;t Block the Blessings&quot;, Labelle frontwoman Patti LaBelle attributed the band&#x27;s 1976 breakup to musical and personal tensions within the group. Labelle, Dash, and Hendryx all embarked on solo careers; Wickham stayed on with Hendryx to manage her solo career.

===Solo career===

In 1977, Hendryx released her first solo album, a self-titled collection. A blend of soul and hard rock, it contained notable tracks such as her cover of &quot;Winning&quot; and the ballad &quot;Leaving Here Today&quot;. It quickly disappeared from the shelves, and Hendryx was dropped from Epic. Subsequently, she recorded four singles for Arista (London), which also did not achieve chart success. She did find success doing session work during this period, most notably providing background vocals for Talking Heads and touring with them, appearing first at the major Heatwave festival in August 1980. She contributed to Dusty Springfield&#x27;s album &quot;It Begins Again&quot; in 1978 (the first of Springfield&#x27;s multiple attempts at a comeback) by writing the song &quot;Checkmate&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Hendryx fronted her own progressive art rock group, Zero Cool, which included guitarist Naux (China Shop, Richard Hell), bassist Michael Allison (Darshan Ambient), guitarist Kevin Fullen and drummer Jimmy Allington. Simultaneously, she sang with experimental funk group Material, achieving a giant club hit with &quot;Busting Out&quot;. She had two other major club hits soon after: a dance remake of The Supremes&#x27; &quot;Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart&quot;, and, in a lead vocal guest spot for the Cage, &quot;Do What You Wanna Do&quot;. Material also produced her second album &quot;Nona&quot; in 1983. The hip, contemporary dance sound of this album proved to be more charts-compatible, with the disco music times, and the single &quot;Keep It Confidential&quot; becoming a modest R&amp;B hit written by Ellie Greenwich, Jeff Kent, Ellen Foley, and a remix of &quot;B-boys&quot; finding major success on the dance charts. &quot;Transformation&quot; became a Hendryx staple, and later was covered by Fierce Ruling Diva. Another particularly noteworthy track on the album is the ballad &quot;Design for Living&quot;, which featured guests Laurie Anderson, Gina Shock of The Go-Go&#x27;s, Valerie Simpson of Ashford &amp; Simpson, Tina Weymouth of Tom Tom Club and Talking Heads, Nancy Wilson of Heart, and former bandmate Patti LaBelle.

In the mid-1980s, Hendryx was recruited by RCA to record songs for various soundtracks, including the theme for &quot;Moving Violations&quot;; &quot;I Sweat (Going Through the Motions)&quot;, a commercial hit for Hendryx from the Jamie Lee Curtis film &quot;Perfect&quot;; and &quot;Transparent&quot; from the Eddie Murphy vehicle, &quot;Coming to America&quot;. Her album &quot;The Art of Defense&quot; was released in 1984.

In 1985, Hendryx wrote and recorded &quot;Rock This House&quot; with Keith Richards from her album &quot;The Heat&quot;. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female at the 28th Grammy Awards. The same year, the MTV broadcast of the video &quot;I Need Love&quot; co-written by Jean Beauvoir, stirred some controversy for featuring drag queens. As a result, it quickly was removed from MTV&#x27;s playlist.

In the same year, she also took part in the Artists United Against Apartheid project with the song, &quot;Sun City&quot;, from the album of the same title. The song was recorded along with other artists Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, Bono from U2, Eddie Kendricks, Hall &amp; Oates, Bobby Womack, Lou Reed and many others. This was one of the greatest and strongest protest songs against South Africa&#x27;s Apartheid during those days.

Her biggest commercial success came with 1987&#x27;s single &quot;Why Should I Cry?&quot;, a top 5 R&amp;B hit which also reached No. 58 on the Billboard 100. The accompanying album, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, boasted an impressive list of contributors, including Dan Hartman (who also served as a producer), Peter Gabriel, Prince (&quot;Baby Go Go&quot;), George Clinton, David Van Tieghem and Mavis Staples. Around this time, she became a member of the Black Rock Coalition, founded by Vernon Reid of Living Colour.

Hendryx took a detour from commercial music with &quot;Skin Diver&quot;, a new age record produced with long-time Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann. The album generally was greeted with positive feedback from critics, but was commercially unsuccessful. The title track did attract some attention, as did &quot;Women Who Fly&quot;, which later was covered by Jefferson Starship.

In addition to the duet-album &quot;You Have to Cry Sometime&quot; with Billy Vera in 1992 and a couple of compilation-only tracks, Hendryx has recorded more than five albums worth of music, but she has been unable to release any of it due to lack of interest from major and independent record labels. Her Epic, RCA and EMI albums have been out of print and only recently attracted the attention of specialist reissue labels, but a greatest hits album titled &quot;Transformation&quot; was released in 1999 by Razor &amp; Tie. Her 1977 debut solo album was issued for the first time on CD by the T-Bird imprint of the UK reissue label Cherry Red in the fall of 2010. UK R&amp;B reissue label Funky Town Grooves released &quot;The Heat&quot; on CD in late 2011, which included three bonus tracks. Funky Town Grooves announced plans to release both &quot;Nona&quot; and &quot;The Art of Defense&quot; in early 2012. Each CD is to include seven bonus tracks.

Hendryx also dabbled in acting. She wrote and performed the theme for &quot;Landlord Blues&quot; (1987), while also having a small part in the film as attorney Sally Viscuso. She played herself in the late-1990s Pam Grier series &quot;Linc&#x27;s&quot;, and at the end of the show, accompanied herself on the piano for &quot;Lift Every Voice&quot;. Most recently, she appeared in the third season of &quot;The L Word&quot;, which closed with Grier, Hendryx, and the trio BETTY singing a cover of the Hendryx track &quot;Transformation&quot;.

Hendryx has been involved in many musical collaborations, both for her vocals and her songwriting. One of her early collaborations was with Jerry Harrison&#x27;s (Talking Heads) &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; album in 1981. In 1992, she recorded a duet with Billy Crawford, &quot;Urgently in Love&quot;. In 1998, she performed in the video of the rap hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Party&quot; with Bounty Killer. She has written songs for Dusty Springfield and Ultra Nate. She has produced albums for Lisa Lisa and The Bush Tetras. Other artists with whom she has recorded with over the years include David Johansen, Yoko Ono, Cameo, Talking Heads (3 albums: &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, &quot;The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads&quot; and &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;), Garland Jeffreys, Dan Hartman, Afrika Bambaata (performing a duet of &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel&quot; with Boy George), Rough Trade, Curtis Hairston, and Graham Parker on &quot;Soul Christmas&quot;.

In the beginning of the current decade, Hendryx was asked to appear on two of Paul Haslinger&#x27;s albums. She sang lead vocals for two tracks &quot;Higher Purpose&quot; and &quot;Beginning to End&quot;, featured on the soundtrack for the Showtime series &quot;Sleeper Cell&quot;.

===Later career and Labelle reunions===
Hendryx still tours and has written music for the theatre, songs for the play with music &quot;Blue&quot;. Sandra St. Victor (The Family Stand) recruited daughters of famous African American soul/blues icons – including Lalah Hathaway, Simone, Indira Khan, and Leah McCrae – together with &quot;spiritual daughters&quot; Joyce Kennedy, Caron Wheeler, and Nona, to form the group Daughters of Soul, which has enjoyed much success, especially on the European tour circuit.

Hendryx formed Rhythmbank, her own record label with Bob Banks, in 2005. They signed and released several EPs and albums, the Showtime series Sleeper Cell, and a gospel album by protégé Najiyah Threatt.

Since the breakup of Labelle, Patti, Sarah, and Nona have reunited on occasion. These reunions include Patti LaBelle&#x27;s &quot;Live in New York&quot; video, the dance hit &quot;Turn It Out&quot; from the soundtrack &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; (1995), and two television specials. In January 2006, Labelle again reunited to record &quot;Dear Rosa&quot;, a tribute to civil rights leader Rosa Parks. Labelle also performed the theme song for the soundtrack for the film &quot;Preaching to the Choir&quot;, with Nona being the composer of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In late 2008, Labelle released their comeback album &quot;Back to Now&quot;, and went on a successful concert tour that carried through the spring of 2009.

Speaking in April 2009 to noted UK soul/R&amp;B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues &amp; Soul, Hendryx discussed the background to Labelle reuniting for &quot;Back to Now&quot;: &quot;Well, there were lots of ongoing times when we&#x27;d discussed doing it. And a lot of it was really down to the fact that the fans were DEMANDING that we did it! But, rather than just going back and doing what we&#x27;d done in the past, we did want to be able to make an album of new music before coming back out together. And it was really once we&#x27;d recorded the song &#x27;Dear Rosa&#x27;, together that Patti finally became convinced that yes, we should make a new record and then go out and tour behind it. So I&#x27;d say basically our reunion was down to two things – pressure from the fans; plus Patti hearing a sound again that she loved and hadn&#x27;t heard for many years.&quot;

Hendryx has written a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;The Brownies&quot;.

On May 27, 2010, Hendryx performed selections from &quot;Skindiver,&quot; a sci-fi musical she is co-writing with Charles Randolph-Wright. The surprise show was at Busboys and Poets in Washington DC and sponsored by Arena Stage. Hendryx &amp; Wright presented two late-night staged readings of &quot;Skindiver&quot; at Arena Stage in 2011.In September 2012, Hendryx&#x27;s digital-only album, &quot;Mutatis Mutandis&quot;, received a CD release. To promote the album, Hendryx appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on 28 November 2012, where she performed two tracks, Let&#x27;s Give Love A Try, and Temple Of Heaven (the latter only being available to watch online via BBC iPlayer). In February 2013, she appeared as a special guest as part of The World of Captain Beefheart, a tribute concert arranged by Dutch radio presenter, Co de Kloet, and featuring Gary Lucas with the 60 piece Metropole Orchestra.

Hendryx released several singles in 2016, including a collaboration with American DJ and production duo, Soul Clap, which resulted in the single, Shine (This Is It). Shine (This Is It) was included on Soul Clap&#x27;s self-titled album in October 2016, and an EP featuring different remixes of the track was released the following year. Hendryx also collaborated with guitarist, Gary Lucas, that same year, which resulted in the album, &quot;The World of Captain Beefheart&quot;, a collection of cover versions of songs by avant-garde artist Captain Beefheart.

In February 2018, Hendryx released an EP, &quot;Keep Funkin&quot;, which was produced by Soul Clap, and featured contributions from Nile Rogers and Jason Miles. Hendryx also contributed vocals to another track, &quot;Peel Back&quot;, produced by FSQ, which was included as a bonus track on digital versions of the Keep Funkin EP (as well as FSQ&#x27;s own album in 2020).

==Personal life and activism==
Hendryx has been living in the Upper West Side of New York City since the early 1970s. Her long-term partner is English talent manager Vicki Wickham, and she discussed her bisexuality in an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine.

Hendryx is a gay-rights activist; in summer 2008, she joined Cyndi Lauper on her True Colors Tour, raising awareness of discrimination and the LGBT community.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-5:1999, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 5: Latin/Cyrillic alphabet&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1988. It is informally referred to as Latin/Cyrillic.

It was designed to cover languages using a Cyrillic alphabet such as Bulgarian, Belarusian, Russian, Serbian and Macedonian but was never widely used. The 8-bit encodings KOI8-R and KOI8-U, IBM-866, and also Windows-1251 are far more commonly used. In contrast to the relationship between Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1, Windows-1251 is not closely related to ISO 8859-5. However, the main Cyrillic block in Unicode uses a layout based on ISO-8859-5.

ISO 8859-5 would also have been usable for Ukrainian in the Soviet Union from 1933 to 1990, but it is missing the Ukrainian letter &quot;ge&quot;, ґ, which is required in Ukrainian orthography before and since, and during that period outside Soviet Ukraine. As a result, IBM created Code page 1124.

ISO-8859-5 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The Windows code page for ISO-8859-5 is code page 28595 a.k.a. Windows-28595. IBM assigned code page 915 to ISO-8859-5 until that code page was extended.

==Codepage layout==

Differences from ISO 8859-1 are shown with its Unicode equivalent code point.

==History and related code pages==
The ECMA-113 standard has been equivalent to ISO-8859-5 since its second edition, its first edition (ISO-IR-111) having been an extension of the earlier KOI-8 (defined by GOST 19768-74), which lays out the Russian letters in the same way as their ASCII Roman equivalents where possible. The initial draft of ISO-8859-5 (DIS-8859-5:1987) followed ISO-IR-111, but was revised after GOST 19768-74 was replaced by the new ISO-IR-153 in 1987, which re-arranged the Russian letters into alphabetical order (except for Ё). ISO-IR-153 contains the Russian letters, including Ё, and the non-breaking space and soft hyphen, whereas the full Cyrillic set of ISO-8859-5 is also called ISO-IR-144.

Possibly as a consequence of this confusion, erroneously lists yet another code page as &quot;ISO-IR-111&quot;, combining the letter order and case order of ISO-8859-5 with the row order of ISO-IR-111 (and consequently compatible with neither in practice, but in practice partially compatible with Windows-1251).

IBM Code page 915 is an extension of ISO/IEC 8859-5, adding some semigraphic and other symbols in the C1 area. IBM Code page 1124 is mostly identical to ISO-8859-5, but replaces ѓ with ґ for Ukrainian use.

ISO-IR-200, &quot;Uralic Supplementary Cyrillic Set&quot;, was registered in 1998 by Everson Gunn Teoranta (which Michael Everson was a director of, prior to the founding of Evertype in 2001), and changes several of the non-Russian letters in order to support the Kildin Sami, Komi and Nenets languages, not supported by ISO-8859-5 itself. Michael Everson also introduced Mac OS Barents Cyrillic for the same languages on classic Mac OS. FreeDOS calls it code page 59283.

ISO-IR-201, &quot;Volgaic Supplementary Cyrillic Set&quot;, was similarly introduced by Everson Gunn Teoranta in order to support the Chuvash, Komi, Mari and Udmurt languages, spoken in the titular republics of Russia. FreeDOS calls it code page 58259.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-6:1999, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 6: Latin/Arabic alphabet&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. It is informally referred to as Latin/Arabic. It was designed to cover Arabic. Only nominal letters are encoded, no preshaped forms of the letters, so shaping processing is required for display. It does not include the extra letters needed to write most Arabic-script languages other than Arabic itself (such as Persian, Urdu, etc.).

ISO-8859-6 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The text is in logical order, so BiDi processing is required for display. Nominally ISO-8859-6 (code page 28596) is for &quot;visual order&quot;, and ISO-8859-6-I (code page 38596) is for logical order. But in practice, and required for HTML and XML documents, ISO-8859-6 also stands for logical order text. There is also ISO-8859-6-E which supposedly requires directionality to be explicitly specified with special control characters; this latter variant is in practice unused. IBM has assigned code page/[[CCSID]] 1089 to ISO 8859-6. It is an emulation for their AIX operating system.

ISO-8859-6 was used as the reference standard for encoding the Arabic script in Unicode but is now technologically obsolete. Unicode is preferred in modern applications, especially on the Internet; meaning the dominant UTF-8 encoding for web pages (see also Arabic script in Unicode, for complete coverage, unlike for e.g. ISO-8859-6 or Windows 1256 that do not cover extras). Less than 0.0002% of all web pages use ISO-8859-6, and it is not even the third-most popular encoding option for Arabic on the web.

==History==
ASMO 708 was devised by the now defunct Arab Standardization and Metrology Organization in 1986 to be the 8-bit standard to be used in Arabic-speaking countries. The design of this character set was inspired by the previous 7-bit standard — ASMO 449 — but it is not simply the 7-bit character set moved to the upper part; there are some differences.

ASMO 708 is a &quot;bidirectional&quot; character set. The lower part of the character set differs from standard ISO 646 in the digits and in some punctuation. Depending on the context (whether the numbers are within Latin script or Arabic script), the digits are rendered either as Latin digits or Arabic digits. Also, depending on the context, symmetrical punctuation marks are reversed, i.e., whenever there is an opening punctuation mark, the shape is rendered differently according to the direction of the script.

The upper part of the character set has only the Arabic letters, Arabic punctuation that is different from Latin punctuation, plus few other characters.

ASMO 708 was designed in close cooperation with ECMA, which adopted it as its own ECMA-114 standard in 1986. It was also approved as an ISO standard as ISO 8859-6. It was also registered in the International Register of Coded Character Sets as IR 127 in 1986.

==Relationship with other character sets==
Some other character sets are related to ASMO 708:

*ASMO 708/French 1 adds French lower case characters;
*French 1/ASMO 708 adds French lower case characters in their ISO 8859-1 code points and &quot;dislocates&quot; the Arabic ones;
*ISO/IR 167 adds French and German characters;
*Microsoft&#x27;s code page 708, for MS-DOS, adds French characters in their typical code points from code page 437 and adds box-drawing characters;
*Both Microsoft&#x27;s code page 710 (Transparent Arabic) and Microsoft&#x27;s code page 720 (Transparent ASMO), for MS-DOS, add French characters in their typical code points from code page 437 but &quot;dislocates&quot; the Arabic characters to allow the box-drawing characters from code page 437 to be in their original code points;
*Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 1256 adds French lower case characters in their Windows 1252 code points and &quot;dislocates&quot; the Arabic ones;

==Code chart==
Code values 0xEB–0xF2 are assigned to combining characters.

<text>Targets is a 1968 American crime thriller film directed by Peter Bogdanovich in his theatrical directorial debut, and starring Tim O&#x27;Kelly, Boris Karloff, Nancy Hsueh, Bogdanovich, James Brown, Arthur Peterson and Sandy Baron. The film depicts two parallel narratives which converge during the climax: one follows Bobby Thompson, a seemingly ordinary and wholesome young man who embarks on an unprovoked killing spree; the other depicts Byron Orlok, an iconic horror film actor who, disillusioned by real-life violence, is contemplating retirement.

Produced by Roger Corman and written by Polly Platt and Bogdanovich, the film was loosely based on the case of Charles Whitman, a mass shooter who committed the Tower shooting at the University of Texas in 1966. The film was shot in late 1967 in the Los Angeles area.

Released by Paramount Pictures shortly after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, it was considered a box-office bomb. Despite initial commercial failure, the film was well-received by critics, and was included in the 2003 book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

==Plot==
Byron Orlok, an aged, embittered horror movie actor, abruptly announces his decision to retire from Hollywood and return to his native England to live out his final days. Orlok considers himself outdated because he believes that people are no longer frightened by old-fashioned horror, citing real-life news stories as more horrifying than anything in his films. However, after much persuasion, particularly from young director Sammy Michaels, Orlok agrees to make a final in-person promotional appearance at a Reseda drive-in theater before leaving Hollywood for good.

Bobby Thompson is a young, quiet, clean-cut insurance agent who lives in the suburban San Fernando Valley area with his wife and his parents. Thompson is also deeply disturbed and an obsessive gun collector, but his family takes little notice. One morning, after his father leaves for work, Thompson murders his wife, his mother, and a grocery delivery boy at his home. That afternoon, Thompson continues the killing spree, shooting people in passing cars from atop an oil storage tank that sits alongside a busy freeway. When an employee investigates the gunshots, Thompson shoots him as well. Leaving some of his guns and ammunition at the crime scene, Thompson flees to the same drive-in theater where Orlok is set to appear that evening.

After sunset, Thompson perches himself on the framing inside the screen tower. While the Orlok film is shown, Thompson kills the theater&#x27;s projectionist and shoots at the patrons throughout the parking lot via a hole in the screen. After Thompson wounds Orlok&#x27;s secretary, Jenny, Orlok confronts Thompson, who is disoriented by Orlok&#x27;s simultaneous appearance before him and on the large movie screen behind him, allowing the actor to disarm Thompson using his walking cane. Looking at the defeated Thompson, a visibly shaken Orlok remarks, &quot;Is &quot;that&quot; what I was afraid of?&quot; Moments later, police officers arrive to arrest Thompson for the murders he has committed; as they lead him away, Thompson states with apparent satisfaction that he &quot;hardly ever missed&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The character and actions of Bobby Thompson are patterned after Charles Whitman, who committed the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966. The character of Byron Orlok, named after Max Schreck&#x27;s vampire Count Orlok in 1922&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, was based on Karloff, with a fictional component of being embittered with the movie business and wanting to retire. The role was Karloff&#x27;s last appearance in a major American film. Karloff gives a celebrated 100-second single-take performance of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s retelling of the Babylonian fable &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot;. In the film&#x27;s finale at a drive-in theater, Orlok—the old-fashioned, traditional screen monster who always obeyed the rules—confronts the new, realistic, nihilistic late-1960s &quot;monster&quot; in the shape of a clean-cut, unassuming multiple murderer.

Bogdanovich got the chance to make &quot;Targets&quot; because Boris Karloff owed studio head Roger Corman two days&#x27; work. Corman told Bogdanovich he could make any film he liked provided he used Karloff and stayed under budget. Bogdanovich used clips from Corman&#x27;s Napoleonic-era thriller &quot;The Terror&quot; in the movie. The clips from &quot;The Terror&quot; feature Jack Nicholson, Dick Miller and Boris Karloff. A brief clip of Howard Hawks&#x27; 1931 film &quot;The Criminal Code&quot; featuring Karloff was also used. Polly Platt was the film&#x27;s production designer, in addition to developing the story, and it was her idea to set the ending at a drive-in movie theater.

Interviewed in 2003, Bogdanovich explained that filming on or near the freeway was not permitted, so the freeway shooting spree was filmed guerilla-style in a two-day period. To save money, the whole sequence was filmed without sound, and editor Verna Fields added the effects afterwards. Bogdanovich has said that Samuel Fuller provided generous help on the screenplay and refused to accept either a fee or a screen credit, so Bogdanovich named his own character Sammy Michaels (Fuller&#x27;s middle name was Michael) in tribute. Fuller advised Bogdanovich to save as much money in the film&#x27;s budget as possible for the film to have an action-packed conclusion.

===Casting===
Bogdanovich cast Tim O&#x27;Kelly as the lead role of murderer Bobby Thompson, who impressed him during an audition for the film. Nancy Hsueh was cast by Bogdanovich after he met the actress while she was appearing in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964).

===Filming===
&quot;Targets&quot; was filmed in Los Angeles, with principal photography beginning November 27, 1967, and concluding December 15, 1967. Interior sequences were shot on makeshift sound stages in a lumberyard building on Santa Monica Boulevard.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Targets&quot; premiered in New York City on August 13, 1968. It later screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in September of that year. American International Pictures offered to release, but Bogdanovich wanted to try to see if the film could get a deal with a major studio. It was seen by Robert Evans of Paramount Pictures, who bought it for $150,000, giving Corman an instant profit on the movie before it was released.

Although the film was written and production photography completed in late 1967, it was not released until after the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and that of of Robert F. Kennedy in the summer of 1968, thus having topical relevance.

Bogdanovich, who appears in the film as a young writer-director, credits it with getting him noticed by the studios, which in turn led to his directing three very successful studio films (&quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, and &quot;Paper Moon&quot;) in the early 1970s.

Around five years after release, in March 1973, New Zealand refused to issue a &#x27;certificate of approval&#x27; for the film&#x27;s trailer on the basis that it was &quot;contrary to public order and decency&quot;.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Targets&quot; has an approval rating of 89% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A startling directorial debut by Peter Bogdanovich mixes an homage to Boris Karloff horror films with a timely sniper story to create a thriller with modern baggage and old school shock and awe.&quot;

Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film an &quot;original and brilliant melodrama&quot;, and concluded that &quot;&quot;Targets&quot; scores an unnerving bullseye.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; called the film &quot;an interesting response to the demands of low-budget genre film making.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;Aware of the virtue of implied violence, Bogdanovich conveys moments of shock, terror, suspense and fear.&quot; In a retrospective review of the film, Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;a fascinatingly complex commentary on American mythology, exploring the relationship between the inner world of the imagination and the outer world of violence and paranoia, both of which were relevant to contemporary American traumas.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote that &quot;&quot;Targets&quot; isn&#x27;t a very good film, but it is an interesting one.&quot; He called Karloff&#x27;s performance &quot;fascinating&quot; but noted that the film may have been &quot;more direct and effective&quot; without his scenes. A review of the film published by &quot;Time&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Targets&quot; eventually falls victim to artistic overkill.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Targets&quot; showed considerable skill, but was trapped in Movieland, in more than subject matter&quot;. John Simon wrote- &quot;&quot;Targets&quot; handled a valid subject but in a trashy way.&quot;

In 2018, on the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Mark Lager wrote on &quot;Cinema Retro&quot; that &quot;Bogdanovich had been deeply disturbed by Charles Whitman&#x27;s mass shooting and felt compelled to write a screenplay based on the event. &quot;Targets&quot; was released in August 1968 and was especially relevant that year in the wake of the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy&quot;.

In 2020, Quentin Tarantino called &quot;Targets&quot; &quot;the most political movie Corman ever made since &quot;The Intruder&quot;. &quot;And forty years later it&#x27;s still one of the strongest cries for gun control in American cinema. The film isn&#x27;t a thriller with a social commentary buried inside of it (the normal Corman model), it&#x27;s a social commentary with a thriller buried inside of it... It was one of the most powerful films of 1968 and one of the greatest directorial debuts of all time. And I believe the best film ever produced by Roger Corman.&quot;

===Home media===
Paramount Home Entertainment released &quot;Targets&quot; on DVD on August 12, 2003.

In 2023, &quot;Targets&quot; was remastered in 4K and released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. BFI released Targets on 25th September 2023 for the first time on Blu-ray in the UK.

<doc id="427991" wikidata="Q95893" url="?curid=427991" title="Julius Lippert">
<text>Julius Lippert (9 July 1895 – 30 June 1956) was a German Nazi Party politician who served as the &quot;Staatskommissar&quot; (State Commissioner) for Berlin from 1933 to 1937 and as its &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; and &quot;Stadtspräsident&quot; (City President) from 1937 to 1940.

== Early life ==
Born in Basel, Switzerland, Lippert became an extreme antisemite in his youth after reading the antisemitic philosophers Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. He was educated in the &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Wiesbaden and passed his abitur in 1914. He joined the Imperial German Army at the outbreak of the First World War, was wounded twice, and ended the war as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; of reserves in the artillery. Between 1918 and 1922 he studied political science and received his degree from the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. Lippert was a member of the Black Reichswehr, and then worked as a journalist and editor at several newspapers from 1923 to 1927. A member of the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party from 1919 to 1921, he joined the even more extreme German Völkisch Freedom Party from 1921 to 1923.

== Nazi career ==
On 19 April 1927, Lippert enrolled in the Nazi Party (membership number 59,957) and became prominent due to his rabid antisemitism. He became a protégé of Joseph Goebbels, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin and became the editor-in-chief of Goebbels&#x27; paper, &quot;Der Angriff&quot; from June 1927 to January 1933. He was elected to the Berlin City Council in November 1929, becoming the deputy leader (1929–1933) and then the leader (1930–1933) of the Nazi faction on the Council. In the 1932 Prussian state election, he failed in his bid to be elected to the Landtag of Prussia. However, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, Lippert was appointed the &quot;Staatskommissar&quot; (State Commissioner) for Berlin on 14 March 1933. He purged the capital&#x27;s government of opposition and was responsible for much of the early persecution of Jews in Berlin. In October 1933, he was made an inaugural member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. Also in October 1933, he entered the Nazi paramilitary organization, the SA, with the rank of SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. He commanded the SA–Gruppe Berlin-Brandenburg from January 1934 and would eventually rise to the rank of SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. On 16 October 1934, he was made the president of the Prussian Provincial Council for Berlin. 
In October 1935, Goebbels commissioned him to begin preparatory work for the Berlin Olympic games, and in February 1936 he joined the Olympic Organizational Committee.

In December 1936, a new law combined Lippert&#x27;s position, now titled &quot;Stadtspräsident&quot; (City President), with the office of &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; (Lord Mayor) of Berlin. Despite considerable doubts about Lippert&#x27;s capabilities, Goebbels agreed to have him formally appointed to this post on 5 January 1937. He was also appointed to the Prussian State Council by Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring. Also in 1937, Lippert was named as a senator of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society. He was now at the height of his power. 

However, by 1938 Goebbels was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Lippert and, in August of that year, even contemplated appointing a special commissioner over him. He did not seek to remove Lippert, but continued to express his displeasure over the following months and his criticism increased. Goebbels referred to Lippert as &quot;a real numbskull with the stature of a Mecklenburg village mayor&quot;. In May 1940, Goebbels issued &quot;severe reproaches&quot; to Lippert on &quot;Berlin&#x27;s disorganization&quot;, particularly regarding long lines outside shops which, he felt, marred the capital city&#x27;s image by demonstrating war-related shortages. Finally Adolf Hitler, who had become increasingly hostile to Lippert, agreed to his removal in July 1940. Albert Speer recalled in his memoir how Lippert had incurred Hitler&#x27;s displeasure years earlier by a lack of enthusiasm over the &quot;Führer&#x27;s&quot; planned grandiose remodeling of Berlin, with Hitler expressing his frustrations by stating: “Lippert is an incompetent, an idiot, a failure, a zero.” 

Lippert was succeeded by his deputy, Ludwig Steeg, and his departure from his prominent position led to rumors that he had been executed. However, he had actually joined the Wehrmacht, and from 1941 to 1943 was the commander of the &quot;Southeast Propaganda Department&quot; in Belgrade. He then was transferred to Belgium where he was the commandant of Arlon from May 1943 to August 1944. His next and last assignment was as the commander of a &quot;Feldjägerkorps&quot; regiment in Slovakia and Hungary.

== Post-war ==
In the closing days of the war, Lippert was captured in April 1945 and interned in Hamburg by British troops. He was extradited to Belgium in January 1946 for trial. He was sentenced to six years of hard labor on 29 June 1951, for involvement in war crimes. Although the sentence was increased to eight years in early 1952, he was released on 15 April 1952 on the basis of time served. Subsequently, on 1 September 1953, he was classified as a Nazi activist by a de-Nazification tribunal in Hesse. He was prohibited from holding political office or receiving a public pension. He lectured at universities until his death on 30 June 1956, in Bad Schwalbach.

<doc id="427992" wikidata="Q826849" url="?curid=427992" title="Water hammer">
<text>Hydraulic shock (colloquial: water hammer; fluid hammer) is a pressure surge or wave caused when a fluid in motion is forced to stop or change direction suddenly: a momentum change. It is usually observed in a liquid but gases can also be affected. This phenomenon commonly occurs when a valve closes suddenly at an end of a pipeline system and a pressure wave propagates in the pipe.

This pressure wave can cause major problems, from noise and vibration to pipe rupture or collapse. It is possible to reduce the effects of the water hammer pulses with accumulators, expansion tanks, surge tanks, blowoff valves, and other features. The effects can be avoided by ensuring that no valves will close too quickly with significant flow, but there are many situations that can cause the effect.

Rough calculations can be made using the Zhukovsky (Joukowsky) equation, or more accurate ones using the method of characteristics.

== History ==

In the 1st century B.C., Marcus Vitruvius Pollio described the effect of water hammer in lead pipes and stone tubes of the Roman public water supply. 
Water hammer was exploited before there was even a word for it.

In 1772, Englishman John Whitehurst built a hydraulic ram for a home in Cheshire, England. In 1796, French inventor Joseph Michel Montgolfier (1740–1810) built a hydraulic ram for his paper mill in Voiron. In French and Italian, the terms for &quot;water hammer&quot; come from the hydraulic ram: &quot;coup de bélier&quot; (French) and &quot;colpo d&#x27;ariete&quot; (Italian) both mean &quot;blow of the ram&quot;. As the 19th century witnessed the installation of municipal water supplies, water hammer became a concern to civil engineers. Water hammer also interested physiologists who were studying the circulatory system.

Although it was prefigured in work by Thomas Young, the theory of water hammer is generally considered to have begun in 1883 with the work of German physiologist Johannes von Kries (1853–1928), who was investigating the pulse in blood vessels. However, his findings went unnoticed by civil engineers. Kries&#x27;s findings were subsequently derived independently in 1898 by the Russian fluid dynamicist Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky (1847–1921), in 1898 by the American civil engineer Joseph Palmer Frizell (1832–1910), and in 1902 by the Italian engineer Lorenzo Allievi (1856–1941).

==Cause and effect==
Water flowing through a pipe has momentum. If the moving water is suddenly stopped, such as by closing a valve downstream of the flowing water, the pressure can rise suddenly with a resulting shock wave. In domestic plumbing this shock wave is experienced as a loud banging resembling a hammering noise. Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is sufficiently high. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.

For example, the water traveling along a tunnel or pipeline to a turbine in a hydroelectric generating station may be slowed suddenly if a valve in the path is closed too quickly. If there is of tunnel of diameter full of water travelling at , that represents approximately of kinetic energy. This energy can be dissipated by a vertical surge shaft into which the water flows which is open at the top. As the water rises up the shaft its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, avoiding sudden high pressure. At some hydroelectric power stations, such as the Saxon Falls Hydro Power Plant In Michigan, what looks like a water tower is in fact a surge drum.

In residential plumbing systems, water hammer may occur when a dishwasher, washing machine or toilet suddenly shuts off water flow. The result may be heard as a loud bang, repetitive banging (as the shock wave travels back and forth in the plumbing system), or as some shuddering.

Other potential causes of water hammer:
* A pump stopping
* A check valve which closes quickly (i.e., &quot;check valve slam&quot;) due to the flow in a pipe reversing direction on loss of motive power, such as a pump stopping. &quot;Non-slam&quot; check valves can be used to reduce the pressure surge. 
* Filling an empty pipe that has a restriction such as a partially open valve or an orifice that allows air to pass easily as the pipe rapidly fills, but with the pressure increasing once full the water encounters the restriction.

=== Related phenomena ===
&quot;Steam hammer&quot; can occur in steam systems when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the piping. The steam forcing the liquid water along the pipe forms a &quot;slug&quot; which impacts a valve of pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and high pressure. Vacuum caused by condensation from thermal shock can also cause a steam hammer. Steam hammer or &quot;steam condensation induced water hammer (CIWH)&quot; was exhaustively investigated both experimentally and theoretically more than a decade ago because it can have radical negative effects in nuclear power plants. It is possible to theoretically explain the 2 millisecond duration 130 bar overpressure peaks with a special 6 equation multiphase thermohydraulic model, similar to RELAP.

Steam hammer can be minimized by using sloped pipes and installing steam traps. 

On turbocharged internal combustion engines, a &quot;gas hammer&quot; can take place when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. There is no shockwave but the pressure can still rapidly increase to damaging levels or cause compressor surge. A pressure relief valve placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger&#x27;s intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger (blowoff valve).

==Mitigation measures==

Water hammers have caused accidents and fatalities, but usually damage is limited to breakage of pipes or appendages. An engineer should always assess the risk of a pipeline burst. Pipelines transporting hazardous liquids or gases warrant special care in design, construction, and operation. Hydroelectric power plants especially must be carefully designed and maintained because the water hammer can cause water pipes to fail catastrophically.

The following characteristics may reduce or eliminate water hammer:
* Reduce the pressure of the water supply to the building by fitting a regulator.
* Lower fluid velocities. To keep water hammer low, pipe-sizing charts for some applications recommend flow velocity at or below .
* Fit slowly closing valves. Toilet fill valves are available in a quiet fill type that closes quietly.
*Non-slam check valves do not rely on fluid flow to close and will do so before the water flow reaches significant velocity.
* High pipeline pressure rating (does not reduce the effect but protects against damage).
* Good pipeline control (start-up and shut-down procedures).
* Water towers (used in many drinking water systems) or surge tanks help maintain steady flow rates and trap large pressure fluctuations.
* Air vessels such as expansion tanks and some types of hydraulic accumulators work in much the same way as water towers, but are pressurized. They typically have an air cushion above the fluid level in the vessel, which may be regulated or separated by a bladder. Sizes of air vessels may be up to hundreds of cubic meters on large pipelines. They come in many shapes, sizes and configurations. Such vessels often are called accumulators or expansion tanks.
* A hydropneumatic device similar in principle to a shock absorber called a &#x27;Water Hammer Arrestor&#x27; can be installed between the water pipe and the machine, to absorb the shock and stop the banging.
* Air valves often remediate low pressures at high points in the pipeline. Though effective, sometimes large numbers of air valves need be installed. These valves also allow air into the system, which is often unwanted. Blowoff valves may be used as an alternative.
* Shorter branch pipe lengths.
* Shorter lengths of straight pipe, i.e. add elbows, expansion loops. Water hammer is related to the speed of sound in the fluid, and elbows reduce the influences of pressure waves.
* Arranging the larger piping in loops that supply shorter smaller run-out pipe branches. With looped piping, lower velocity flows from both sides of a loop can serve a branch.
* Flywheel on a pump.
* Pumping station bypass.

==Magnitude of the pulse==
One of the first to successfully investigate the water hammer problem was the Italian engineer Lorenzo Allievi.

Water hammer can be analyzed by two different approaches—&quot;rigid column theory&quot;, which ignores compressibility of the fluid and elasticity of the walls of the pipe, or by a full analysis that includes elasticity. When the time it takes a valve to close is long compared to the propagation time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, then rigid column theory is appropriate; otherwise considering elasticity may be necessary.
Below are two approximations for the peak pressure, one that considers elasticity, but assumes the valve closes instantaneously, and a second that neglects elasticity but includes a finite time for the valve to close.

===Instant valve closure; compressible fluid===
The pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the Joukowsky equation

: formula_1

So for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximal magnitude of the water hammer pulse is

: formula_2

where Δ&quot;P&quot; is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the fluid (kg/m3), &quot;a&quot;0 is the speed of sound in the fluid (m/s), and Δ&quot;v&quot; is the change in the fluid&#x27;s velocity (m/s). The pulse comes about due to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and the continuity equation applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.

====Equation for wave speed====
As the speed of sound in a fluid is formula_3, the peak pressure depends on the fluid compressibility if the valve is closed abruptly.

: formula_4

where
: &quot;a&quot; = wave speed,
: &quot;B&quot; = equivalent bulk modulus of elasticity of the system fluid–pipe,
: &quot;ρ&quot; = density of the fluid,
: &quot;K&quot; = bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid,
: &quot;E&quot; = elastic modulus of the pipe,
: &quot;D&quot; = internal pipe diameter,
: &quot;t&quot; = pipe wall thickness,
: &quot;c&quot; = dimensionless parameter due to on wave speed.

===Slow valve closure; incompressible fluid===
When the valve is closed slowly compared to the transit time for a pressure wave to travel the length of the pipe, the elasticity can be neglected, and the phenomenon can be described in terms of inertance or rigid column theory:
: formula_5

Assuming constant deceleration of the water column (&quot;dv&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; = &quot;v&quot;/&quot;t&quot;), this gives
: formula_6

where:
: &quot;F&quot; = force [N],
: &quot;m&quot; = mass of the fluid column [kg],
: &quot;a&quot; = acceleration [m/s2],
: &quot;P&quot; = pressure [Pa],
: &quot;A&quot; = pipe cross-section [m2],
: &quot;ρ&quot; = fluid density [kg/m3],
: &quot;L&quot; = pipe length [m],
: &quot;v&quot; = flow velocity [m/s],
: &quot;t&quot; = valve closure time [s].

The above formula becomes, for water and with imperial unit,

: formula_7

For practical application, a safety factor of about 5 is recommended:

: formula_8

where &quot;P&quot;1 is the inlet pressure in psi, &quot;V&quot; is the flow velocity in ft/s, &quot;t&quot; is the valve closing time in seconds, and &quot;L&quot; is the upstream pipe length in feet.

Hence, we can say that the magnitude of the water hammer largely depends upon the time of closure, elastic components of pipe &amp; fluid properties.

==Expression for the excess pressure due to water hammer==

When a valve with a volumetric flow rate &quot;Q&quot; is closed, an excess pressure Δ&quot;P&quot; is created upstream of the valve, whose value is given by the Joukowsky equation:

: formula_9

In this expression:
: Δ&quot;P&quot; is the overpressurization in Pa;
: &quot;Q&quot; is the volumetric flow in m3/s;
: &quot;Z&quot; is the hydraulic impedance, expressed in kg/m4/s.
The hydraulic impedance &quot;Z&quot; of the pipeline determines the magnitude of the water hammer pulse. It is itself defined by

: formula_10

where
: &quot;ρ&quot; the density of the liquid, expressed in kg/m3;
: &quot;A&quot; cross sectional area of the pipe, m2;
: &quot;B&quot; equivalent modulus of compressibility of the liquid in the pipe, expressed in Pa.

The latter follows from a series of hydraulic concepts:
* compressibility of the liquid, defined by its adiabatic compressibility modulus &quot;B&quot;l, resulting from the equation of state of the liquid generally available from thermodynamic tables;
* the elasticity of the walls of the pipe, which defines an equivalent bulk modulus of compressibility for the solid &quot;B&quot;s. In the case of a pipe of circular cross-section whose thickness &quot;t&quot; is small compared to the diameter &quot;D&quot;, the equivalent modulus of compressibility is given by the formula formula_11, in which &quot;E&quot; is the Young&#x27;s modulus (in Pa) of the material of the pipe;
* possibly compressibility &quot;B&quot;g of gas dissolved in the liquid, defined by formula_12
*: γ being the specific heat ratio of the gas,
*: α the rate of ventilation (the volume fraction of undissolved gas),
*: and &quot;P&quot; the pressure (in Pa).

Thus, the equivalent elasticity is the sum of the original elasticities:
: formula_13

As a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by:
* increasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column;
* employing the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus);
* introducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator;
* where possible, increasing the fraction of undissolved gases in the liquid.

==Dynamic equations==
The water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations.

: formula_14

: formula_15

where &quot;V&quot; is the fluid velocity inside pipe, formula_16 is the fluid density, &quot;B&quot; is the &quot;equivalent&quot; bulk modulus, and &quot;f&quot; is the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor.

==Column separation==
Column separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water-hammer event. If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure). This is most likely to occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases. This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space. The liquid on either side of the vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference. The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.

==Simulation software==
Most water hammer software packages use the method of characteristics to solve the differential equations involved. This method works well if the wave speed does not vary in time due to either air or gas entrainment in a pipeline. The wave method (WM) is also used in various software packages. WM lets operators analyze large networks efficiently. Many commercial and non-commercial packages are available.

Software packages vary in complexity, dependent on the processes modeled. The more sophisticated packages may have any of the following features:
* Multiphase flow capabilities.
* An algorithm for cavitation growth and collapse.
* Unsteady friction: the pressure waves dampen as turbulence is generated and due to variations in the flow velocity distribution.
* Varying bulk modulus for higher pressures (water becomes less compressible).
* Fluid structure interaction: the pipeline reacts on the varying pressures and causes pressure waves itself.

==Applications==
* The water hammer principle can be used to create a simple water pump called a hydraulic ram.
* Leaks can sometimes be detected using water hammer.
* Enclosed air pockets can be detected in pipelines.
* The water hammer from a liquid jet created by a collapsing microcavity is studied for potential applications noninvasive transdermal drug delivery.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-9:1999, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 9: Latin alphabet No. 5&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1989. It is designated ECMA-128 by Ecma International and TS 5881 as a Turkish standard. It is informally referred to as Latin-5 or &quot;Turkish&quot;. It was designed to cover the Turkish language (and the vast majority of users use it for that language, even though it can also be used for some other languages), designed as being of more use than the ISO/IEC 8859-3 encoding. It is identical to ISO/IEC 8859-1 except for the replacement of six Icelandic characters (Ðð, Ýý, Þþ) with characters unique to the Turkish alphabet (Ğğ, İ, ı, Şş). And the uppercase of i is İ; the lowercase of I is ı.

ISO-8859-9 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. In modern applications Unicode and UTF-8 are preferred; authors of new web pages and the designers of new protocols are instructed to use UTF-8 instead. Since 2023, less than 0.05% of all web pages use ISO-8859-9, while 2.1% of web pages located in Turkey declare use of ISO-8859-9. However, the WHATWG Encoding Standard, which specifies the character encodings which are permitted in HTML5 and which compliant browsers must support, requires that web pages marked as ISO-8859-9 be handled as Windows-1254, which differs from ISO-8859-9 by using the CR range which ISO-8859-9 reserves for C1 control codes for additional graphical characters instead (analogous to the relationship between ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252).

Microsoft has assigned code page 28599 a.k.a. Windows-28599 to ISO-8859-9 in Windows. IBM has assigned code page 920 (CCSID 920) to ISO-8859-9. It is published by Ecma International as ECMA-128.

<text>Jerry Alan Fodor ( ; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had &quot;an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960.&quot; At the time of his death in 2017, he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University, and had taught previously at the City University of New York Graduate Center and MIT.

==Life and career==

Jerry Fodor was born in New York City on April 22, 1935, and was of Jewish descent. He received his degree (&quot;summa cum laude&quot;) from Columbia University in 1956, where he wrote a senior thesis on Søren Kierkegaard. and studied with Sidney Morgenbesser and Arthur Danto. He then earned a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in 1960, under the direction of Hilary Putnam.

From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the City University of New York (CUNY). From 1988, until his retirement in 2016 as emeritus, he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University.

Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor followed opera and regularly wrote columns for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; on that and other topics. Fodor&#x27;s first marriage was to the applied psychologist Iris Goldstein, with whom he had one son. After their divorce, he married the linguist Janet Dean. Janet and he lived in Manhattan and had a daughter. He died at home on November 29, 2017.

== Philosophical work ==

Fodor argued in his 1975 book &quot;The Language of Thought&quot; that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.

For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or &quot;organs&quot;, which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the &quot;central processing&quot; part of the mind, which has a more global and less &quot;domain specific&quot; character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.

Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian theories of natural selection as an explanation of mind.

=== Fodor and the nature of mental states ===

Despite the changes in many of his positions over the years, Fodor&#x27;s idea that mental states embodying intentionality, propositional attitudes, like beliefs and desires are relational never changed. He attempted to show how mental representations, specifically sentences in the language of thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first denies the relational character of mental states, while the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages, and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences. Fodor&#x27;s own position, instead, is that to properly account for the nature of intentional attitudes, it is necessary to employ a &quot;three-place&quot; relation between individuals, representations and propositional contents.

Considering mental states as three-place relations in this way, representative realism makes it possible to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.

=== Functional architecture of the mind ===

==== Psychological nativism and modularity ====

Following in the path paved by linguist Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed a strong commitment to the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms led him to formulate his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.

Fodor noted the evidence from perceptual errors like the Müller-Lyer illusion that processes such as visually estimating the length of a line are not interfered with by the knowledge that the two lines are actually the same length. He took this to mean that the visual processes were in a separate module from knowledge.

The idea can be traced back to the 19th century phrenology movement. Its founder Franz Joseph Gall claimed that mental faculties were associated with specific regions of the brain. Hence, someone&#x27;s level of intelligence, for example, could be &quot;read off&quot; from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven in the 20th century.

Fodor revived the idea of modularity, without the notion of precise physical localizability, in the 1980s, and became a vocal proponent of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph &quot;The Modularity of Mind&quot;, where he points to Gall through Bernard Hollander&#x27;s &quot;In search of the soul&quot;. Two properties of modularity, &quot;informational encapsulation&quot; and &quot;domain specificity&quot;, make it possible to relate functional architecture to mental content. A person&#x27;s ability to elaborate information independently from their background beliefs allows Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of mental content. The main idea is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, not just on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, but also on their causal relations with the external world.

==== Adoption by cognitive and evolutionary psychologists ====

Fodor&#x27;s notions of mental modularity, informational encapsulation and domain specificity were taken up and expanded, much to Fodor&#x27;s chagrin, by cognitive scientists such as Zenon Pylyshyn and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker and Henry Plotkin. Fodor complained that Pinker, Plotkin and other members of what he sarcastically called &quot;the New Synthesis&quot; had taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. He insisted that the mind is not &quot;massively modular&quot; and that, contrary to these researchers, the mind was a long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model. The main reason for this is that most cognition is abductive and global, hence sensitive to all possibly relevant background beliefs to (dis)confirm a belief. This creates the frame problem for the computational theory, because the relevance of a belief is not one of its local, syntactic properties but context-dependent.

===Intentional realism===

In &quot;A Theory of Content and Other Essays&quot; (1990), Fodor takes up another of his central notions: the question of the reality of mental representations. He sought to justify representational realism, so as to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.

====Fodor&#x27;s criticism of Dennett====

Fodor starts with some criticisms of so-called &quot;standard realism&quot;. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts that there is an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.

In particular, Fodor criticizes the instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett maintains that it is possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining &quot;why&quot; the intentional strategy works:

=== Productivity, systematicity and thought ===

==== Building on Chomsky ====

Fodor also has &quot;positive&quot; arguments in favour of the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.

Productivity is a representational system&#x27;s unbounded ability to generate new representations from a given set of symbols, using its cognitive architecture. &quot;John&quot;, &quot;loves&quot;, and &quot;Mary&quot; allow for the construction of the sentences &quot;John loves Mary&quot; and &quot;Mary loves John&quot;. Fodor&#x27;s language of thought theorizes that representations are decomposable into constituent parts, and these decomposed representations are built into new strings.

More important than productivity is systematicity since it does not rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition. The argument states that a cognizer is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another. For example, no one who understands &quot;John loves Mary&quot; is unable to understand &quot;Mary loves John&quot;, and no one who understands &quot;P and Q&quot; is unable to understand &quot;P&quot;. Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics, but some challenge that thought is systematic in the same way languages are. Still others from the connectionist tradition have tried to build non-classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language.

The fact that systematicity and productivity depend on the compositional structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics. If thought also has such a combinatorial semantics, then, Fodor stated, there must be a language of thought.

==== Formalizing thought processes ====

The second argument that Fodor provides in favour of representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on the relation between the representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand in hand with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the &quot;form&quot; of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.

For Fodor, this formal notion of thought processes also has the advantage of highlighting the parallels between the causal role of symbols and the contents which they express. In his view, syntax plays the role of mediation between the causal role of the symbols and their contents. The semantic relations between symbols can be &quot;imitated&quot; by their syntactic relations. The inferential relations which connect the &quot;contents&quot; of two symbols can be imitated by the formal syntax rules which regulate the derivation of one symbol from another.

===The nature of content===

From the beginning of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content contrasts sharply with the inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career. Fodor went on to criticize inferential role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.

====Anti-holism====

Fodor, while following W.V.O. Quine&#x27;s confirmation holism, criticised semantic holism, the idea that every connection of a concept is part of its meaning. The identity of the content of a mental state, under semantic holism, can only be determined by the &quot;totality&quot; of its epistemic bonds. Fodor argued that this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:

====The asymmetric causal theory====

Having criticized the idea that semantic evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system, Fodor can adopt an externalist position with respect to mental content and meaning. For Fodor, later in his life, the problem of naturalization of the mental is tied to the possibility of giving &quot;the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to (expresses, represents, is true of) another piece&quot; in non-intentional and non-semantic terms. If this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of the mind, then the challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non-logical symbols of the LOT. Fodor&#x27;s initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for &quot;water&quot; in Mentalese expresses the property H2O is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water. The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the &quot;Crude Causal Theory&quot;. According to this theory, the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence. The term &quot;horse&quot;, for example, says of a horse that it is a horse. In order to do this, it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol &quot;horse&quot; be in a law-like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of &quot;horse&quot;.

The main problem with this theory is that of erroneous representations. There are two unavoidable problems with the idea that &quot;a symbol expresses a property if it is ... necessary that all and only the presences of such a property cause the occurrences&quot;. The first is that not &quot;all&quot; horses cause occurrences of &quot;horse&quot;. The second is that not &quot;only&quot; horses cause occurrences of &quot;horse.&quot; Sometimes the &quot;A&quot;(&quot;horses&quot;) are caused by A (horses), but at other times—when, for example, because of the distance or conditions of low visibility, one has confused a cow for a horse—the &quot;A&quot; (&quot;horses&quot;) are caused by B (cows). In this case the symbol &quot;A&quot; doesn&#x27;t express just the property A, but the disjunction of properties A or B. The crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing the case in which the content of a symbol is disjunctive from the case in which it isn&#x27;t. This gives rise to what Fodor calls the &quot;problem of disjunction&quot;.

Fodor responds to this problem with what he defines as &quot;a slightly less crude causal theory&quot;. According to this approach, it is necessary to break the symmetry at the base of the crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of &quot;A&quot; caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are &quot;ontologically dependent&quot; on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (&quot;A&quot;= A) and the false ones (&quot;A&quot;=A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:

===Functionalism===

During the 1960s, philosophers such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and folk psychology while adhering to a materialist vision of the world which did not violate the &quot;generality of physics&quot;. Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation &quot;between&quot; mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.

One can solve these problems, according to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis which was designed to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate (&quot;realize&quot;) the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of &quot;token materialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fodor 1981 Mind/Body&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===

Fodor and the biolinguist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini co-authored the book &quot;What Darwin Got Wrong&quot; (2010). In the same, the authors argue that much neo-Darwinian literature is &quot;distressingly uncritical&quot; and that Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution &quot;overestimates the contribution the environment makes in shaping the phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates the effects of endogenous variables&quot;. Evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne describes this book as &quot;a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection&quot; and &quot;as biologically uninformed as it is strident&quot;. Moral philosopher and anti-scientism author Mary Midgley praises &quot;What Darwin Got Wrong&quot; as &quot;an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities&quot;. 

==Awards and honors==

Fodor was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent&#x27;s Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (Princeton University), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), Fulbright Fellowship (University of Oxford), Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in 1993. His lecture series for the Prize was published as &quot;The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics&quot; (1995). In 1996–1997, Fodor delivered the John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford, titled &quot;Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong&quot;, which went on to become a 1998 book. He also delivered the Patrick Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism (2004) and the Royce Lecture on Philosophy of Mind (2002) to the American Philosophical Association, of whose Eastern Division he served as President (2005–2006). In 2005, he won the Mind &amp; Brain Prize.

== Criticism ==

Philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor&#x27;s ideas.

=== Simon Blackburn ===

Simon Blackburn in &quot;Spreading the Word&quot; (1984) has accused the language of thought hypothesis of falling prey to an infinite regress. If a person understands a word like &quot;dog&quot; through a mental representation which indicates that the word denotes dogs, then a regress takes place. Fodor replies that the language of thought does not involve denoting things. On this view, the process of reasoning works directly to give a result but does not allow the person to examine how it works.

=== Daniel Dennett ===

In 1981, Daniel Dennett formulated another argument against the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, on the basis of the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as &quot;It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left.&quot; We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually &quot;thinking&quot; or &quot;believing&quot; somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude &quot;I believe I can kick this guy&#x27;s butt&quot; in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as &quot;desiring to breathe clear air&quot; in a stuffy environment.

=== Kent Bach ===

Linguists and philosophers of language such as Kent Bach have criticized Fodor&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;extreme&quot; concept nativism. Bach takes Fodor to task for his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as &quot;keep&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;make&quot; and &quot;put&quot;. He suggests that, alternatively, &quot;keep&quot; simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, &quot;keep your clothes on&quot;, &quot;keep your receipt&quot; and &quot;keep washing your hands&quot; will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor&#x27;s theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can&#x27;t retain one&#x27;s clothes on or retain washing one&#x27;s hands. Fodor&#x27;s theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, &quot;differently&quot;, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of &quot;fast&quot; in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor&#x27;s own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in &quot;Concepts&quot;: &quot;People sometimes used to say that &quot;exist&quot; must be ambiguous because look at the difference between &#x27;chairs exist&#x27; and &#x27;numbers exist&#x27;. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don&#x27;t also need &#x27;exist&#x27; to be polysemic.&quot;

Some critics find it difficult to accept Fodor&#x27;s insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls &quot;lexical concepts&quot; (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.

=== Fiona Cowie ===

In her 1999 book &quot;What&#x27;s Within&quot;, Fiona Cowie argued against Fodor&#x27;s innatist view, preferring a John Locke-style empiricism. Fodor replied at length in a 1999 article titled &quot;Doing Without &quot;What&#x27;s Within&quot;; Fiona Cowie&#x27;s Critique of Nativism&quot;, stating that he was aiming at a position halfway between nativism and empiricism.

<text>The Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches (CCMBC) is a Mennonite Brethren denomination in Canada. It is a member of the Mennonite World Conference and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

Offices of the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches are located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Calgary, Alberta, and Abbotsford, British Columbia.

==History==

The Mennonite Brethren church began in Russia as a new expression of Mennonite faith in 1860 after Radical Pietism spread there. The Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches (CCMBC) &quot;trace[s] [its] history to several villages in the Molotschna colony in Ukraine.&quot;

The Canadian conference incorporated and adopted its current name in 1946. It had previously been a constituent unit of the General Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches of North America. CCMBC is part of the worldwide community of Mennonite Brethren through its connection with the International Community of Mennonite Brethren.

The mid- to late twentieth century saw significant growth in the conference by means of evangelism. The conference grew from 87 congregations and 14,185 members in 1960 to 125 congregations and 17,025 members by 1970. In the 1980s, it had as many as 190 congregations and 27,277 members. According to a census published in 2018, it would have 237 churches and 34,693 baptized members.

==Structure==
Every year, the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches hosts an annual general meeting that takes place in conjunction with Gathering (on even years) or study conference (on odd years). Gathering is the biennial national convention where MBs from across Canada gather for worship, fellowship. Study conference, held biennially, is hosted by the Board of Faith and Life and provides opportunities for MBs to interpret scripture and choose a direction together.

===Provincial conferences===
The CCMBC &quot;is a national body which regulates the membership of area churches, which ... are known as provincial conferences.&quot; Local congregations first join their respective provincial conferences, and by virtue of that, become part of the Canadian Conference. Both national and provincial bodies are committed to working together in serving congregations and helping them succeed in growth and mission and are involved in ongoing collaborative dialogue to achieve that. British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec have separate conferences of MB churches.

===MB Seminary===
MB Seminary (Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary) is the national seminary for the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches. MB Seminary exists to educate and equip men and women to help lead the church in reaching Canada and beyond with the Good News of Jesus Christ. MB Seminary is a Canadian ministry with an international reach, and a Mennonite Brethren ministry with multi-denominational relationships.

MB Seminary partners with multiple institutions in Canada to provide training that is accessible and collaborative. These partnerships include:

* ACTS Seminaries (Langley, British Columbia) 
* Canadian Mennonite University (Winnipeg, Manitoba)

==Confession of faith==
The Mennonite Brethren Church blends aspects of evangelicalism with its historic Anabaptist understanding of Christianity. Mennonite Brethren recognize the teachings and authority of the Bible, emphasize personal salvation, baptize confessed believers in Jesus Christ, and encourage community, discipleship, diversity, peacemaking, and reaching out.

The detailed Mennonite Brethren Confession of Faith lists 18 articles of confession.

<doc id="427999" wikidata="Q1202686" url="?curid=427999" title="List of nearest galaxies">
<text>This is a list of known galaxies within 3.8 megaparsecs (12.4 million light-years) of the Solar System, in ascending order of heliocentric distance, or the distance to the Sun. 
This encompasses about 50 major Local Group galaxies, and some that are members of neighboring galaxy groups, the M81 Group and the Centaurus A/M83 Group, and some that are currently not in any defined galaxy group.

The list aims to reflect current knowledge: not all galaxies within the 3.8 Mpc radius have been discovered. Nearby dwarf galaxies are still being discovered, and galaxies located behind the central plane of the Milky Way are extremely difficult to discern. It is possible for any galaxy to mask another located beyond it.
Intergalactic distance measurements are subject to large uncertainties. Figures listed are composites of many measurements, some of which may have had their individual error bars tightened to the point of no longer overlapping with each other.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-10:1998, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 10: Latin alphabet No. 6&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1992. It is informally referred to as Latin-6. It was designed to cover the Nordic languages, deemed of more use for them than ISO 8859-4.

ISO-8859-10 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Microsoft has assigned code page 28600 a.k.a. Windows-28600 to ISO-8859-10 in Windows. IBM has assigned Code page 919 to ISO-8859-10. It is published by Ecma International as ECMA-144.

==Codepage layout==
Differences from ISO-8859-1 have the Unicode code point number below the character.

==ISO-IR 158 Codepage layout==
ISO-IR 158 is a supplementary ISO 2022 graphical set, containing characters which are absent in ISO-8859-10, but which are required for writing Skolt Sami or historic Sami orthographies. It is intended to be used in an ISO 4873 profile for Sami languages, as a G2 or G3 set (i.e. prefixed with 0x8E/ or 0x8F/ respectively) alongside the main Latin-6 (ISO 8859-10) G1 set. ISO-IR-158 and ISO-IR-197 are both referenced in an informative ISO 8859 annex as allowing for a more adequate coverage of the orthography of certain Sámi languages such as Skolt Sámi than ISO-8859-4 or plain ISO-8859-10.

The code chart gives a symbol used in older orthographies to denote an aspirated consonant, usually written as a reversed apostrophe or raised left-half ring, the unusual name of &quot;high ogonek&quot;. The table below shows the additional graphical set.

<text>Extremism is &quot;the quality or state of being extreme&quot; or &quot;the advocacy of extreme measures or views&quot;. The term is primarily used in a political or religious sense to refer to an ideology that is considered (by the speaker or by some implied shared social consensus) to be far outside the mainstream attitudes of society. It can also be used in an economic context. The term may be used pejoratively by opposing groups, but is also used in academic and journalistic circles in a purely descriptive and non-condemning sense.

Extremists&#x27; views are typically contrasted with those of moderates. In Western countries, for example, in contemporary discourse on Islam or on Islamic political movements, the distinction between extremist and moderate Muslims is commonly stressed. Political agendas perceived as extremist often include those from the far-left politics or far-right politics, as well as radicalism, reactionism, chauvinism, fundamentalism, and fanaticism.

== Definitions ==

Peter T. Coleman and Andrea Bartoli give observation of definitions: Extremism is a complex phenomenon, although its complexity is often hard to see. Most simply, it can be defined as activities (beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions, strategies) of a character far removed from the ordinary. In conflict settings it manifests as a severe form of conflict engagement. However, the labeling of activities, people, and groups as &quot;extremist&quot;, and the defining of what is &quot;ordinary&quot; in any setting is always a subjective and political matter. Thus, we suggest that any discussion of extremism be mindful of the following: Typically, the same extremist act will be viewed by some as just and moral (such as pro-social &quot;freedom fighting&quot;), and by others as unjust and immoral (antisocial &quot;terrorism&quot;) depending on the observer&#x27;s values, politics, moral scope, and the nature of their relationship with the actor. In addition, one&#x27;s sense of the moral or immoral nature of a given act of extremism (such as Nelson Mandela&#x27;s use of guerilla war tactics against the South African Government) may change as conditions (leadership, world opinion, crises, historical accounts, etc.) change. Thus, the current and historical context of extremist acts shapes our view of them. Power differences also matter when defining extremism. When in conflict, the activities of members of low power groups tend to be viewed as more extreme than similar activities committed by members of groups advocating the status quo.

In addition, extreme acts are more likely to be employed by marginalized people and groups who view more normative forms of conflict engagement as blocked for them or biased. However, dominant groups also commonly employ extreme activities (such as governmental sanctioning of violent paramilitary groups or the attack in Waco by the FBI in the U.S.).

Extremist acts often employ violent means, although extremist groups will differ in their preference for violent extremism vs. nonviolent extremism, in the level of violence they employ, and in the preferred targets of their violence (from infrastructure to military personnel to civilians to children). Again, low power groups are more likely to employ direct, episodic forms of violence (such as suicide bombings), whereas dominant groups tend to be associated with more structural or institutionalized forms (like the covert use of torture or the informal sanctioning of police brutality).

In Germany, extremism is explicitly used for differentiation between democratic and non-democratic intentions. The German Ministry of Home Affairs defines extremism as an intention that rejects the democratic constitution state and fundamental values, its norms and its laws.

Although extremist individuals and groups are often viewed as cohesive and consistently evil, it is important to recognize that they may be conflicted or ambivalent psychologically as individuals, or contain difference and conflict within their groups. For instance, individual members of Hamas may differ considerably in their willingness to negotiate their differences with the Palestinian Authority and, ultimately, with certain factions in Israel. Ultimately, the core problem that extremism presents in situations of protracted conflict is less the severity of the activities (although violence, trauma, and escalation are obvious concerns) but more so the closed, fixed, and intolerant nature of extremist attitudes, and their subsequent imperviousness to change.

=== Difference from radicalism ===
Astrid Bötticher notes several differences between radicalism and extremism, among them in goals (idealistic vs. restorative, emancipatory vs. anti-democratic), morals (universal vs. particular), approach towards diversity (acceptance vs. disdain), and use of violence (pragmatic and selective vs. legitimate and acceptable).

== Theories of extremism ==
Eric Hoffer and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. were two political writers during the mid-20th century who gave what they purported to be accounts of &quot;political extremism&quot;. Hoffer wrote &quot;The True Believer&quot; and &quot;The Passionate State of Mind&quot; about the psychology and sociology of those who join &quot;fanatical&quot; mass movements. Schlesinger wrote &quot;The Vital Center&quot;, championing a supposed &quot;center&quot; of politics within which &quot;mainstream&quot; political discourse takes place, and underscoring the alleged need for societies to draw definite lines regarding what falls outside of this acceptability.

Seymour Martin Lipset argued that besides the extremism of the left and right there is also an &quot;extremism of the center&quot;, and that it actually formed the base of fascism.

Laird Wilcox identifies 21 alleged traits of a &quot;political extremist&quot;, ranging from &quot;a tendency to character assassination&quot; and hateful behavior like &quot;name calling and labelling&quot;, to general character traits like &quot;a tendency to view opponents and critics as essentially evil&quot;, &quot;a tendency to substitute intimidation for argument&quot; or &quot;groupthink&quot;.

&quot;Extremism&quot; is not a standalone characteristic. The attitude or behavior of an &quot;extremist&quot; may be represented as part of a spectrum, which ranges from mild interest through &quot;obsession&quot; to &quot;fanaticism&quot; and &quot;extremism&quot;. The alleged similarity between the &quot;extreme left&quot; and &quot;extreme right&quot;, or perhaps between opposing religious zealots, may mean only that all these are &quot;unacceptable&quot; from the standpoint of the mainstream or majority.

Economist Ronald Wintrobe argues that many extremist movements, even though having completely different ideologies, share a common set of characteristics. As an example, he lists the following common characteristics between &quot;Jewish fundamentalists&quot; and &quot;the extremists of Hamas&quot;:

=== Psychological ===
Among the explanations for extremism is one that views it as a plague. Arno Gruen said, &quot;The lack of identity associated with extremists is the result of self-destructive self-hatred that leads to feelings of revenge toward life itself, and a compulsion to kill one&#x27;s own humanness.&quot; In this context, extremism is seen as not a tactic, nor an ideology, but as a pathological illness which feeds on the destruction of life. Dr. Kathleen Taylor believes religious fundamentalism is a mental illness and is &quot;curable.&quot; There are distinct psychological features of extremists that contribute to conflict among societal groups; Jan-Willem van Prooijen identified them as psychological distress, cognitive simplicity, overconfidence and intolerance.

Another view is that extremism is an emotional outlet for severe feelings stemming from &quot;persistent experiences of oppression, insecurity, humiliation, resentment, loss, and rage&quot; which are presumed to &quot;lead individuals and groups to adopt conflict engagement strategies which &quot;fit&quot; or feel consistent with these experiences&quot;.

Extremism is seen by other researchers as a &quot;rational strategy in a game over power&quot;, as described in the works of Eli Berman.

In a 2018 study at University College London, scientists have demonstrated that people with extreme political views (both extreme right and extreme left) had significantly worse metacognition, or the ability of a person to recognize they are wrong and modify their views when presented with contrary evidence, thus creating an opinion that supports only their idea of wrong and right. People found on either of the political extremes were shown to have much greater (but misplaced) confidence in their beliefs, and resisted change.

A 2019 study found that political extremism on both the left and right tended to have four common psychological features: psychological distress stimulates the adoption of an extreme ideological outlook, extreme ideologies tend to have relatively simplistic black-white perceptions of the social world, said mental simplicity causes overconfidence in judgements, and political extremists are less tolerant of different groups and opinions than moderates.

== Criticism of term ==
After being accused of extremism, Martin Luther King Jr. criticized the mainstream usage of the term in his Letter from Birmingham Jail,
&quot;But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love…Was not Amos an extremist for justice…Was not Martin Luther an extremist…So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?&quot;

In his 1964 acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican National Convention, Barry Goldwater said, &quot;I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&quot;

Robert F. Kennedy said &quot;What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents.&quot;

In Russia, the laws prohibiting extremist content are used to suppress the freedom of speech through very broad and flexible interpretation. Published material classified as &quot;extremist&quot;, and thus prosecuted, included protests against the court rulings in the Bolotnaya Square case (&quot;calling for illegal action&quot;), criticism of overspending by a local governor (&quot;insult of the authorities&quot;), publishing a poem in support of Ukraine (&quot;inciting hatred&quot;), an open letter against a war in Chechnya by the writer Polina Zherebcova, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses movement in Russia, Raphael Lemkin, and articles by the initiator of the Genocide Convention of 1948.

Tushar Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s great-grandson, says India&#x27;s Hindu nationalism is a threat to Gandhi&#x27;s legacy and that the ideology of hate, division and polarization that led to Gandhi&#x27;s assassination by a religious zealot in 1948 has captured India.

==Other terms==

Since the 1990s, in United States politics, the term &quot;Sister Souljah moment&quot; has been used to describe a politician&#x27;s public repudiation of an allegedly extremist person or group, statement, or position which might otherwise be associated with his own party.

The term &quot;subversive&quot; was often used interchangeably, in the United States at least, with &quot;extremist&quot; during the Cold War period, although the two words are not synonymous.

<doc id="428004" wikidata="Q927112" url="?curid=428004" title="Less Than Jake">
<text>Less Than Jake is an American ska punk band from Gainesville, Florida, formed in 1992. The band consists of Chris DeMakes (guitars, vocals), Roger Lima (bass, vocals), Buddy Schaub (trombone), Peter &quot;JR&quot; Wasilewski (saxophone) and Matt Yonker (drums).

The group released its debut album, &quot;Pezcore&quot;, in 1995, following a series of independent seven-inch single releases. The band&#x27;s subsequent two studio albums, &quot;Losing Streak&quot; (1996) and &quot;Hello Rockview&quot; (1998), were released on a major label, Capitol Records, leading to increased exposure. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Borders and Boundaries&quot;, was released in 2000 on Fat Wreck Chords. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Anthem&quot; (2003), was the group&#x27;s most commercially successful to date, featuring the singles &quot;She&#x27;s Gonna Break Soon&quot; and &quot;The Science of Selling Yourself Short&quot;.

In 2008, the band founded its own label, Sleep It Off Records, and released its seventh full-length album, &quot;GNV FLA&quot;. The band has recently stated its preference for EP releases, and independently issued &quot;Greetings from Less Than Jake&quot; (2011) and its counterpart, &quot;Seasons Greetings from Less Than Jake&quot; (2012). In late 2012, the band combined the two to create the compilation album &quot;Greetings and Salutations&quot; (2012). The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;See the Light&quot;, was released on November 12, 2013.

In February 2017, the band released &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot;, an EP which became their final release with founding member, drummer and lyricist Vinnie Fiorello, who departed from the band the following year. Fiorello was replaced by former Teen Idols drummer Matt Yonker, who contributed to the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Silver Linings&quot; (2020). A seven-song EP, &quot;Uncharted&quot;, was released in November 2024 and produced by Jason Livermore and Bill Stevenson of Descendents and Black Flag.

== History ==
=== Formation and &quot;Pezcore&quot; (1992–1995) ===
Before the formation of Less Than Jake, vocalist and guitarist Chris DeMakes, drummer Vinnie Fiorello, and bassist Shaun Grief led a local band named Good Grief while attending high school in Port Charlotte, Florida. Good Grief broke up when DeMakes moved north to attend the University of Florida. On July 13, 1992, Less Than Jake was born. While Grief moved to New York City (he would later return as the band&#x27;s roadie), DeMakes and Fiorello began writing songs on the weekends before Fiorello would join DeMakes at the University of Florida. When united, the pair decided they needed a bass player, but first, they wanted a name. Fiorello said:

Band members have told various media outlets different versions of the origin of the band&#x27;s name. DeMakes has stated in interviews that the band&#x27;s name came from Fiorello&#x27;s family&#x27;s pet parrot. His story claimed that the parrot would squawk during the band&#x27;s practice sessions, leading to Fiorello&#x27;s mother telling the band that they needed to stop playing because they were disturbing the bird. This would lead to the band referring to themselves as being &quot;less than Jake&quot;. In June 2020, however, Fiorello clarified that Jake was not a parrot but was, in fact, an English Bulldog. After practicing with a different bass player for a couple of weeks, the band met Roger Lima, a guitarist who also attended the University of Florida. After Lima practiced with the band on guitar for a few hours, the band fired the current bass player and recruited him instead. Citing influence from Snuff, the band decided it wanted to add a horn section.

In 1993, the group added its first horn player, Jessica Mills, and released its first 7-inch record, &quot;Smoke Spot&quot;, with the band members hand pressing all 300 records themselves. Soon after, trombone player Buddy Schaub joined the band. Over the first few years, the band put out its first EP, &quot;Better Class Of Losers&quot;, made compilation appearances, and released several vinyl records (featuring songs that would later appear on the 1995 &quot;Losers, Kings, and Things We Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; compilation), before Mike Park agreed to release the band&#x27;s debut album on Dill Records. Right before the band&#x27;s first U.S. tour in June 1995 with Skankin&#x27; Pickle, Schaub had already made plans to travel to Europe with his friends. The band found a temporary replacement in saxophonist Derron Nuhfer, who filled in for Schaub during his absence. Derron became a permanent member in August 1995.

Less Than Jake&#x27;s first full-length LP &quot;Pezcore&quot; debuted in August 1995, featuring such staples as &quot;Liquor Store&quot; and &quot;My Very Own Flag&quot;. Originally on Dill Records, the CD contained 21 tracks, including two covers of the TV theme songs for Jeffersons and Laverne and Shirley (which were omitted on the subsequent reissues on Asian Man and Fueled By Ramen records). The title of the album stems from Roger and Vinnie&#x27;s unexplained fondness for Pez candy, clearly apparent in their reportedly sizable Pez dispenser collections, and the pervasively used suffix &quot;core&quot;. Ever since, Pez dispenser motifs have been a common feature of Less Than Jake&#x27;s merchandise.

=== &quot;Losing Streak&quot; and &quot;Hello Rockview&quot; (1996–1999) ===
Shortly following the release of &quot;Pezcore&quot;, the band was signed to Capitol Records. The group debuted on the label in 1996 with &quot;Losing Streak&quot;, containing ska-punk songs. Following the 1997 Warped Tour, saxophonist Jessica Mills left the band to perform with Citizen Fish. Mills was replaced by ex-Slapstick trombonist Pete Anna in January 1998 (trombonist Lars Nylander served as a fill-in during the fall of 1997). Around this time, Vinnie Fiorello also started his own record label, Fueled by Ramen, with friend John Janick. During 1997 the band embarked on the Caffeine Nation Tour with the Descendents, Guttermouth, and Handsome; the Race Around Uranus Tour with Blink-182 and Frenzal Rhomb; and the Warped Tour.

In 1998, after participating in the Ska Against Racism Tour with such ska acts as the Toasters and Mustard Plug, and the Warped Tour, the band released &quot;Hello Rockview&quot;. The band spawned a minor college radio hit with &quot;History of a Boring Town&quot;, which reached No. 39 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, despite not being released as a video single.

===&quot;Borders and Boundaries&quot; (2000–2002)===

After recording what would be &quot;Borders &amp; Boundaries&quot;, the band opted to buy out its contract from the major label and release the album on Fat Wreck Chords instead.

In October 2000, the band released &quot;Borders &amp; Boundaries&quot;, and landed the opening spot on Bon Jovi&#x27;s North American tour. While it was not as commercially successful as previous releases initially, the album contained singles &quot;Look What Happened&quot; (which received minor airplay on college stations) and the group&#x27;s home-town anthem, &quot;Gainesville Rock City&quot; (which received some airtime on MTV2). Shortly after the album&#x27;s recording, Derron Nuhfer left the band (going on to join Gunmoll and later Escape Grace), and Less Than Jake found a replacement in former Spring Heeled Jack saxophonist, Pete Wasilewski. To avoid the confusion of having two Petes within the band, Pete Wasilewski was nicknamed JR (as in &quot;Peter Junior&quot;). In 2001 the band took part in the Vans Warped Tour, after which the first Pete departed. That year, the band toured the US along with New Found Glory, Anti-Flag, and the Teen Idols.

In 2002, Less Than Jake spent time touring with Bad Religion and Hot Water Music while spending most of the summer touring in Europe. Less Than Jake re-released its compilation album, &quot;Goodbye Blue and White&quot;, which included various 7-inch releases spanning from 1996 to 2001, and provided a different track listing from the first pressing. The album was named in honor of the group&#x27;s original tour van, with the liner notes having the band recounting memories of the van. To celebrate the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary, &quot;Pezcore&quot; was re-released and the band&#x27;s first four 7-inch releases, &quot;Smoke Spot&quot;, &quot;Pez Kings&quot;, &quot;Unglued&quot;, and &quot;Rock-n-Roll Pizzeria&quot;, were repressed and included in a limited edition Cereal Box (which also featured a T-shirt, bobblehead, and pin).
===&quot;Anthem&quot; (2003–2004)===
Less Than Jake returned to major label status with its next album &quot;Anthem&quot;, releasing the 2003 LP on Warner Bros./Sire Records. Debuting at No. 45 on the Billboard 200 (the band&#x27;s highest to date), the album featured three major singles in both the US and the UK, with &quot;She&#x27;s Gonna Break Soon&quot; (which spent a couple weeks on TRL), &quot;The Science Of Selling Yourself Short&quot; (which spent five weeks on the Billboard Top 40, peaking at No. 37), and &quot;The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out&quot; (featuring Billy Bragg), which spent time in the UK Top 40. Actress Alexis Bledel, known for her role as Rory Gilmore on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, appeared in the video for &quot;She&#x27;s Gonna Break Soon&quot;, where she played the unnamed subject of the song, an angsty teen girl who has a nervous breakdown and destroys her bedroom over the course the song. The band spent the rest of the year promoting the new album by playing the Warped Tour and gained support from Fall Out Boy, Yellowcard, and Bang Tango during its fall 2003 tour. The band released &quot;B Is for B-sides&quot; in July 2004. The album comprised tracks that didn&#x27;t make &quot;Anthem&quot;&#x27;s final cut and was produced by Less Than Jake. The DVD retrospective &quot;The People&#x27;s History of Less Than Jake&quot; appeared a month later, featuring both professional and bootleg recordings of the band. The band also held the opening spot on the main stage during the Projekt Revolution tour in the summer of 2004 with Linkin Park, Korn, Snoop Dogg, and The Used before taking a long break to write the group&#x27;s next record.

=== &quot;In with the Out Crowd&quot; (2005–2007) ===
After spending the majority of 2005 writing and recording, the band opened 2006 by going on a full U.S. and Europe tour that also featured Catch 22, A Wilhelm Scream, The Loved Ones, The New Mexican Disaster Squad, Rock-n-Roll Soldiers, Damone, Dropkick Murphys, and Far From Finished. In April 2006, the band released its four-song &quot;Absolution for Idiots and Addicts&quot; EP, with the group&#x27;s next full-length, &quot;In with the Out Crowd&quot;, following a month later on Sire Records. The album was also issued in a limited edition that came in a leather-bound case complete with bonus multimedia discs that contained music videos, bonus tracks, and an elaborate photo gallery.

In February 2007, Less Than Jake played six shows in Florida that each featured the band playing one of its albums in its entirety, plus B-sides and rarities. The band played two shows each in Jacksonville, Orlando, and St. Petersburg, to be recorded for a possible DVD release. The records performed were &quot;Borders and Boundaries&quot;, &quot;Pezcore&quot;, &quot;Losing Streak&quot;, &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;Hello Rockview&quot;, and &quot;In with the Out Crowd&quot;. The group then did the same in London, United Kingdom, in September 2007, playing at the Astoria II for 6 nights in a row.

On May 21, 2007, after much speculation, Vinnie Fiorello announced on his blog that the band had asked and been granted its release from its contract with Sire Records and Warner Bros. Following this split, the band released five high-quality (MP3, 320 kbit/s), DRM-free, unedited recordings of the band&#x27;s live shows, taken directly from the mixing console at each show. These recordings are being released for sale on the band&#x27;s website via Snocap. During the 6 Albums / 6 Shows / 6 Nights in London, Chris stated that Less Than Jake&#x27;s new record label in the UK and Europe would be Cooking Vinyl.

In summer 2007, Less Than Jake embarked on the Shout It Loud Tour, co-headlining with Reel Big Fish and featuring support from Streetlight Manifesto and Against All Authority. During the shows, the band held a spoof of The Price Is Right, quizzing the contestants on various Less Than Jake &quot;trivia&quot;, having them play a few games from the shows, using the games to determine which album the band would play selections from, and giving prizes to the winners. The band reunited with Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto for a Japan and Australia tour in December 2007.

===&quot;GNV FLA&quot; (2008–2009)===
On January 8, 2008, after speculation that the next Less Than Jake record could be released on Fat Wreck Chords or Victory Records, CMJ reported that the band was starting its own label, named Sleep It Off Records, the name taken from the title of a song from the &quot;B is for B-sides&quot; record. The purpose of the new label is to release the band&#x27;s forthcoming album in summer 2008 and to reissue the group&#x27;s back catalog. Reissues of &quot;Goodbye Blue And White&quot;, &quot;Pezcore&quot;, &quot;Losers, Kings And Things We Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, and the DVD &quot;The Peoples History Of Less Than Jake&quot; were released on March 18. The reissues include new artworks and bonus DVDs.

Upon talking about the group&#x27;s new album, Vinnie mentioned his desire to &quot;combine third wave ska and pop punk in each song,&quot; hinting at a possible return to the band&#x27;s older sound. He also had the following to say:

On April 20, Vinnie announced via his blog that the new album, recorded at Atlas Studios in Chicago, was totally finished. On April 23, Vinnie revealed the title of the album would be &quot;GNV FLA&quot;, the name being an abbreviation for Gainesville&#x27;s airport code. Buddy Schaub stated the reason behind the album title was &quot;to get back to our roots&quot;. The first single from &quot;GNV FLA&quot; was &quot;Does The Lion City Still Roar?&quot;, &quot;GNV FLA&quot; was officially released June 24, 2008. Touring in support of the album included the Reading and Leeds Festivals and a tour of UK during the fall containing thirteen dates with the band Zebrahead.

&quot;Conviction Notice&quot; was the second and final single off the album. The group also stated at other various concerts during its recent Europe tour that the band was recording video footage for a new DVD.

In June 2009, Internet radio station PunkRadioCast teamed up with Jones Soda to create a punk pop 6 pack featuring labels designed by PunkRadioCast and five punk artists, one of which was &quot;Less Than Jake – Root Beer&quot;.

=== EP releases and &quot;See the Light&quot; (2010–2017) ===

On July 7, 2010, the band announced that it had started recording again. On October 12, 2010, the group released &quot;TV/EP&quot;, consisting of sixteen covers of television theme songs in the span of thirteen minutes: &quot;Spanning from the vintage adverts of yesteryear to the frenetic promos of modern day, &quot;TV/EP&quot; reimagines a world where pop punk and ska is the music de rigueur, and this is the soundtrack to your couch potato life. Tracklisted as anonymously numbered channels, the experience they have planned is akin to the feeling of flipping random television channels.&quot; The first revealed track off the disc is a rendition of the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; theme song.

The band also performed in Tavares, Florida along with the Supervillains and local acts to support funding for the surrounding counties&#x27; high school band programs.

On June 20, 2011, the band released an EP entitled &quot;Greetings from Less Than Jake&quot;, which was made available on the group&#x27;s online store and was sold on Warped Tour 2011 as well. On February 16, 2012, Less Than Jake released a follow-up EP entitled &quot;Seasons Greetings from Less Than Jake&quot;. The band announced both EPs would be re-released, with 2 previously unreleased songs, as part of a new album called &quot;Greetings and Salutations from Less Than Jake&quot;, released in October 2012 through Fat Wreck Chords, who had released &quot;Borders and Boundaries&quot;. On April 17, 2013, Less Than Jake announced through its Facebook page that the band had signed back to Fat Wreck Chords and would release its first album full of new material since 2008 sometime in the Fall. On August 9, the album&#x27;s title, track listing and release date were announced, and &quot;See the Light&quot; was subsequently released on November 12, 2013.

On July 29, 2016, at Vans Warped Tour 2016, Peter &quot;JR&quot; Wasilewski told Fuse, &quot;We&#x27;re working on a new record right now, nothing to really speak of, but it will be coming out in 2017 for sure.&quot; Less Than Jake launched a tour with Pepper in the January and February 2017 to promote their latest release, the &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot; EP. Released on February 3, 2017, by Pure Noise Records, it debuted at 114 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Vinnie Fiorello&#x27;s departure, &quot;Silver Linings&quot; and &quot;Uncharted&quot; (2018–present)===

On October 24, 2018, Fiorello stated that, while he would remain a member of Less Than Jake, he would no longer be touring with the band. On October 26, following Fiorello&#x27;s announcement, the band announced that former Teen Idols drummer Matt Yonker would be the touring drummer moving onwards. Yonker subsequently joined the band on a full-time basis, having worked with the band previously in a number of behind-the-scenes capacities. Roger Lima noted: &quot;It was a fairly smooth transition having long time friend and LTJ workhorse Matt Yonker jump on the drum kit late in 2018. He had done merch, guitar tech, stage, and more recently, live sound and tour managing and management for us! So we had some restructuring to do.&quot;

In October 2020, Lima reflected on Fiorello&#x27;s departure: &quot;He was the primary lyricist for the band, and it took a bit of refocusing of creative juices as the rest of us took on that role as part of the songwriting, absolutely. Vinnie was becoming tired of life on the road and wanted to spend more time with his daughter. No bad feelings, I am just happy we got to where we got and I&#x27;m ready to pick up the torch and continue forward on this crazy path.&quot; Fiorello has since joined a new supergroup The Inevitables with other colleagues from other ska/punk bands.

In an email to fan club members, the title of their next album was announced to be &quot;Silver Linings&quot;. An official release was delayed due to COVID-19; the album was ultimately released on December 11, 2020.

In 2022, Less Than Jake and Bowling for Soup performed over forty shows as part of their Back for the Attack Tour, which also featured The Aquabats on some dates.

On November 15, 2024, the band released a seven-song EP, &quot;Uncharted&quot;, produced by Jason Livermore and Bill Stevenson of Descendents and Black Flag.

==Side projects==
In 1996, Vinnie and his friend John Janick launched the independent record label Fueled by Ramen, leaving it in 2006. On May 13, 2008, Vinnie launched his new indie label, called Paper + Plastick. In the press release, Vinnie stated the inspiration for the name; &quot;If you think about it, prints and books are the paper side, while vinyl records and toys are the plastic side. It&#x27;s a simple and to-the-point concept.&quot;

Vinnie also owns a toy company called Wünderland War, originally called &quot;Monkey VS Robot&quot;. The name was changed due to legal issues. Vinnie has also started a second toy company with a friend called Symptoms. Many of these toys have been featured in art books and shows.

Roger has a side-project called Rehasher, who have recorded an album &quot;Off Key Melodies&quot; on Gainesville-based record label No Idea Records in 2004. He plays guitar for Rehasher and is also the group&#x27;s lead singer. Roger also has a recording studio at his home, dubbed as the &quot;Moat House&quot;. Some local bands record music here, and Rehasher&#x27;s second album, &quot;High Speed Access To My Brain&quot;, was recorded here.

JR composes his own solo music on top of working with a promoting company called the CT Mafia. He contributed one track to the Drive-Thru Records tribute to Bob Dylan, under the name &quot;The Stay at Home Joneses&quot;, which also featured secondary vocals by Roger.

In 1996, Vinnie, Chris, and Roger served as backup musicians for Asian Man Records owner Mike Park in The Bruce Lee Band (former sax player Derron also provided horns on some of the tracks).

Buddy is involved in a side band called PB&amp;J, in which he provides the bass, vocals and occasional trombone, as well as the band Black Ice that he plays all instruments for. Buddy is one half of Coffee Project along with Jake Crown, who released a self-titled album on the aforementioned Paper + Plastick label. Together they decided that &quot;a couple of acoustic guitars and a trombone was all they really needed&quot;.

Chris has been recording his own solo music while not working with Less Than Jake. He is a guest vocalist on the 2010 album &quot;The Seven Degrees Of Stephen Egerton&quot; by Descendents guitarist Stephen Egerton. He performed on the Ska Goes Solo Tour with JT Turret of The Arrogant Sons of Bitches and Ryan Eldred of Catch 22 in 2014. He released the song &quot;Up&quot; on the Ska Goes Solo split 7-inch prior to the tour.

Chris also is the host of his own podcast called Chris DeMakes a Podcast. Every week, he and a guest from the world of music discuss the subject of songwriting.
