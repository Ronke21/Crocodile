<text>The Stirling council area (; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and has an estimated population of (). It was created in 1975 as a lower-tier district within the Central region. The district covered parts of the historic counties of Stirlingshire and Perthshire, which were abolished for local government purposes. In 1996 the Central region was abolished and Stirling Council took over all local government functions within the area.

The administrative centre of the area is the city of Stirling, with the headquarters at Old Viewforth.

The area borders the council areas of Clackmannanshire (to the east), North Lanarkshire (to the south), Falkirk (to the south east), Perth and Kinross (to the north and north east), Argyll and Bute (to the north and north west), and both East and West Dunbartonshire to Stirling&#x27;s southwest.

The majority of the population of the area is located in its southeast corner, in the city of Stirling and in the surrounding lowland communities: Bridge of Allan and Dunblane to the north, Bannockburn to the immediate south, and the three former coal mining communities of Cowie, Fallin, and Plean, known collectively as the &quot;Eastern Villages&quot;.

The rest of the council area&#x27;s population is sparsely distributed across the rural, mainly highland, expanse in the north and west of the area. The southern half of this rural area comprises the flat western floodplain of the River Forth, bounded on the south by the Touch Hills and the Campsie Fells. North of the glen lie the Trossachs mountains, and the northern half of the council area is generally mountainous in character.

==History==
Stirling district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Stirling was one of three districts within the Central region. As created in 1975 the Stirling district covered five districts from Stirlingshire and four districts from Perthshire, which were all abolished at the same time:

&quot;From Perthshire:&quot;
*Callander Burgh
*Doune Burgh
*Dunblane Burgh
*Western District, except Ardoch (which went to Perth and Kinross)

&quot;From Stirlingshire:&quot;
*Bridge of Allan Burgh
*Central No. 1 District
*Stirling Burgh
*Western No. 1 District
*Western No. 2 District

The new district and its neighbour Falkirk were together made a new Stirling and Falkirk lieutenancy area. The last Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire became the first Lord Lieutenant of Stirling and Falkirk.

Local government was reformed again in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which abolished the regions and districts which had been created in 1975, replacing them with unitary council areas. Central Region was abolished and each of the area&#x27;s three districts, including Stirling, became council areas. Stirling District Council was therefore replaced by the current Stirling Council.

==Governance==
===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2007. Following the 2022 election a minority Labour administration formed to run the council.

The first election to Stirling District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the change to council areas which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control since 1975 has been as follows:

Stirling District Council
Stirling Council
===Leadership===
The first leader of the council, Corrie McChord, had been the last leader of the Central Regional Council. The leaders since 1996 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance, the composition of the council was:

A by-election was held in 15 August 2024 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Ewan Dillon. Following Chris Kane being elected as MP for Stirling and Strathallan, Labour Councillor Margaret Brisley became leader of the Council, but died on 27 October 2024, and a by-election was held to fill the vacancy caused by her death. The next full council election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

The council is based at Old Viewforth on Pitt Terrace in Stirling. The oldest part of the building is a converted house called Viewforth, which had been built in 1855. The house was bought by Stirlingshire County Council in 1931 for £5,250 and converted to become its headquarters. A large art deco extension was added to the rear of the house, opening in 1937. A new building called New Viewforth was built alongside the older premises in 1972, shortly before Stirlingshire County Council was abolished.

Between 1975 and 1996 the premises at Viewforth served as the headquarters of Central Regional Council, whilst Stirling District Council was based at the Municipal Buildings at 8–10 Corn Exchange Road in Stirling, which had been completed in 1918 for the old Stirling Town Council. On local government reorganisation in 1996 Stirling Council took over Viewforth. The 1972 building known as New Viewforth was demolished in 2014.

==Elections==
Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:

The wards are:

<doc id="443118" wikidata="Q2449727" url="?curid=443118" title="Dasa">
<text>Dasa () is a Sanskrit word found in ancient Indian texts such as the &quot;Rigveda, Pali canon, and the&quot; &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. The term may mean &quot;slave&quot;, &quot;enemy&quot; or &quot;servant,&quot; but &quot;Dasa&quot; or &quot;Das&quot; can also have the following connotations: &quot;slave of god&quot;, &quot;devotee,&quot; &quot;votary&quot; or &quot;one who has surrendered to God.&quot; Dasa may be a suffix of a given name to indicate a &quot;slave&quot; of a revered person or a particular deity.

&quot;Dasa&quot;, in some contexts, is also related to &quot;dasyu&quot; and &quot;asura&quot;, which have been translated by some scholars as &quot;demon&quot;, &quot;harmful supernatural forces,&quot; &quot;slave,&quot; &quot;servant,&quot; or &quot;barbarian,&quot; depending on the context in which the word is used.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Dāsa&quot; first appears in Vedic texts from the second millennium BCE. There is no consensus on its origins.

Karl Heinrich Tzschucke in 1806, in his translations of the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela, noted etymological and phonological parallels between &quot;dasa&quot; and the ethnonyms of the Dahae – Persian داها; Sanskrit &quot;Dasa&quot;; Latin &quot;Dahae&quot;; Greek Δάοι &quot;Daoi&quot;, Δάαι, Δᾶαι &quot;Daai&quot; and Δάσαι &quot;Dasai&quot; – a people who lived on the south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea in ancient times (and from whom modern Dehestan/Dehistan takes its name).

Monier Monier-Williams in 1899, stated that the meaning of &quot;dasa&quot; varies contextually and means &quot;mysterious forces&quot;, &quot;savages&quot;, &quot;barbarians&quot; or &quot;demons&quot; in the earliest layer of Vedic literature – in other contexts, is a self-effacing way to refer oneself as &quot;worshipper&quot; or &quot;devotee aiming to honor a deity&quot;, or a &quot;servant of god&quot;. In later Indian literature, according to Monier-Williams, usage of &quot;dasa&quot; is used to refer to &quot;a knowing man, or a knower of the universal spirit&quot;. In the latter sense, &quot;dāsa&quot; is masculine, while the feminine equivalent is &quot;dāsi&quot;. Some early 20th century translators, such as P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar (1912), translate &quot;dasa&quot; as &quot;slave&quot;.

Kangle in 1960, and others suggest that, depending on the context, &quot;dasa&quot; may be translated as &quot;enemy&quot;, &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;religious devotee&quot;. More recent scholarly interpretations of the Sanskrit words &quot;dasa&quot; or &quot;dasyu&quot; suggest that these words used throughout the Vedas represents &quot;disorder, chaos and dark side of human nature&quot;, and the verses that use the word &quot;dasa&quot; mostly contrast it with the concepts of &quot;order, purity, goodness and light.&quot; In some contexts, the word &quot;dasa&quot; may refer to enemies, in other contexts it may refer to those who had not adopted the Vedic beliefs, and yet other contexts it may refer to mythical enemies in the battle between good and evil.

In Pali texts, the term &quot;dasa&quot; is mentioned to denote a slave. &quot;Dasa&quot; in Buddhist texts can mean &quot;servant&quot;. In Pali language, it is used as suffix in Buddhist texts, where &quot;Amaya-dasa&quot; was translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a &quot;slave by birth&quot;, &quot;Kila-dasa&quot; translated as a &quot;bought slave&quot;, and &quot;Amata-dasa&quot; as &quot;one who sees &quot;Amata&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Amrita&quot;, nectar of immortality) or &quot;Nibbana&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Nirvana&quot;)&quot;.

According to Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, regarding the Dasas, the question is whether there is any connection between the Azhi-Dahaka of the Zend Avesta. The name Azhi-Dahaka is a compound name which consists of two parts. Azhi means serpent or dragon and Dahaka comes from the root &quot;Dah&quot; meaning &quot;to sting, to do harm&quot; 

Michael Witzel compares the etymological root of &quot;dasa&quot; to words from other Indo-European languages that imply &quot;enemy, foreigner&quot;, including the Avestan &quot;dahåka&quot; and &quot;dŋha&quot;, Latin &quot;dahi&quot; and Greek &quot;daai&quot;.

Asko Parpola in 2015, has proposed that &quot;dasa&quot; is related to the ancient Iranian and proto-Saka word &quot;daha&quot;, which means &quot;man&quot;. This is contrasted with &quot;arya&quot;, the word for &quot;man&quot; used by, and of, Indo-Iranian people from Central Asia.

== Identification of Dasa ==

=== As people ===
Based on the Arya-Dasa conflict described in Rigvedic text, scholars have tried to identify the Dasa as a population in South and Central Asia.

Max Müller proposed that referred to indigenous peoples living in South Asia before the arrival of the Aryans.

Michael Witzel in his review of Indo-Iranian texts in 1995, states that in the Vedic literature represented a North Iranian tribe, who were enemies of the Vedic Aryans, and meant &quot;enemy, foreigner.&quot; He notes that these enemies could have apparently become slaves if captured.

Asko Parpola states that referred only to Central Asian peoples. Vedic texts that include prayers for the defeat of the as an &quot;enemy people&quot;, according to Parpola, possibly refers to people from the so-called Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), who spoke a different language and opposed Aryan religious practices. Parpola uses archaeological and linguistic arguments to support his theory. Among the evidences cited were recent BMAC excavation results where forts in circular shapes were found, the shape described in the early parts of the Rigveda as the enemy forts of Indra. He also found that Rigvedic words with vocalic &quot;ṛ&quot; in their first syllable - for instance, &quot;ṛbīsa&quot;- “oven” or &quot;śṛgāla&quot;- “jackal” - are likely loanwords from the unknown BMAC language.

=== As spiritual entity ===

Authors like Sri Aurobindo believe that words like Dasa are used in the Rig Veda symbolically and should be interpreted spiritually, and that Dasa does not refer to human beings, but rather to demons who hinder the spiritual attainment of the mystic. Many Dasas are purely mythical and can only refer to demons. There is for example a Dasa called Urana with 99 arms (RV II.14.4), and a Dasa with six eyes and three heads in the Rig Veda.

Aurobindo commented that in the RV III.34 hymn, where the word Arya varna occurs, Indra is described as the increaser of the thoughts of his followers: &quot;the shining hue of these thoughts, , is evidently the same as that sukra or sveta Aryan hue which is mentioned in verse 9. Indra carries forward or increases the &quot;colour&quot; of these thoughts beyond the opposition of the Panis, pra varnam atiracchukram; in doing so he slays the Dasyus and protects or fosters and increases the Aryan &quot;colour&quot;, .&quot;

According to Aurobindo (The Secret of the Veda), RV 5.14.4 is a key for understanding the character of the Dasyus:

:&quot;Agni born shone out slaying the Dasyus, the darkness by the light, he found the Cows, the Waters, Swar.&quot; (transl. Aurobindo)

Aurobindo explains that in this verse the struggle between light and darkness, truth and falsehood, divine and undivine is described. It is through the shining light created by Agni, god of fire, that the Dasyus, who are identified with the darkness, are slain. The Dasyus are also described in the Rig Veda as intercepting and withholding the Cows, the Waters and Swar (&quot;heavenly world&quot;; RV 5.34.9; 8.68.9). It is not difficult, of course, to find very similar metaphors, equating political or military opponents with evil and darkness, even in contemporary propaganda.

K.D. Sethna (1992) writes: &quot;According to Aurobindo,(...) there are passages in which the spiritual interpretation of the Dasas, Dasyus and Panis is the sole one possible and all others are completely excluded. There are no passages in which we lack a choice either between this interpretation and a nature-poetry or between this interpretation and the reading of human enemies.&quot;

== Hindu Texts ==

=== Rig Veda ===
&quot;Dasa&quot; and related words such as &quot;Dasyu&quot; are found in the Rig Veda. They have been variously translated, depending on the context. These words in some context represent &quot;disorder, chaos and dark side of human nature&quot;, and the verses that use the word &quot;dasa&quot; mostly contrast it with the concepts of &quot;order, purity, goodness and light.&quot; In other contexts, the word &quot;dasa&quot; refers to enemies and in other contexts, those who had not adopted the Vedic beliefs.

A. A. Macdonell and A. B. Keith in 1912 remarked that, &quot;The great difference between the Dasyus and the Aryans was their religion... It is significant that constant reference is made to difference in religion between Aryans and Dasa and Dasyu.&quot;

==== Dasa with the meaning of Barbarians ====
Rig Veda 10.22.8 describes Dasyus as &quot;savages&quot; who have no laws, different observances, a-karman (who do not perform rites) and who act against a person without knowing the person.

==== Dasa with the meaning of Demons ====
Within the Vedic texts, &quot;Dasa&quot; is the word used to describe supernatural demonic creatures with many eyes and many heads. This has led scholars to interpret that the word &quot;Dasa&quot; in Vedic times meant evil, supernatural, destructive forces. For example, Rigveda in hymn 10.99.6 states,

==== Dasa with the meaning of Servant ====
Dasa is also used in Vedic literature, in some contexts, to refer to &quot;servants&quot;, a few translate this as &quot;slaves&quot;, but the verses do not describe how the Vedic society treats or mistreats the servants. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is &quot;dāsa&quot;, and this sense of use is traceable to four verses out of 10,600 verses in Rigveda, namely 1.92.8, 1.158.5, 10.62.10 and 8.56.3. The translation of word &quot;dasa&quot; to servant or slave varies by scholars. HH Wilson, for example, translates &quot;Dasa&quot; in Rigvedic instances identified by Sharma, as servant rather than slave, as in verse 10.62.10:

R. S. Sharma translates &quot;dasi&quot; in a Vedic era Upanishads as &quot;maid-servant&quot;.

==== Aryan-Dasa conflict ====

Hermann Oldenberg states that no distinction between historical events and mythology existed for the Vedic poets. For them, the conflict between the Aryans and Dasas extended into the realms of gods and demons with the hostile demon being on the same level as the hated and despised savages.

Bridget Allchin and Raymond Allchin suggest Indo-Aryans were not the only inhabitants of the region when they arrived to &quot;Sapta-Sindhava&quot; or land of seven rivers and their encounter with Dasyu was not entirely peaceful.

Ram Sharan Sharma states that the Rig-Vedic society was primarily organized on basis of tribe, kin and lineage. The &quot;Aryan&quot; tribes mentioned by the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; therefore may not have been of the same ethnicity, but may have been united by a common language and way of life. He states that while it has been argued that Dasyu and Dasa were not non-Aryans, it is more true in the case of the latter. Further the Dasas are said to be organized into tribes called &quot;viś&quot;, a term used for Vedic people or tribes. The god Indra is said to be the conqueror of Dasas, who appear mostly human. There are more references to the destruction of Dasyus by Indra instead of Dasas. He is said to have protected the Aryan varna by killing them. The Aryans also fought between themselves. The god Manyu is invoked to overcome both Aryans and Dasyus. Indra is asked to fight against the godless Dasyus and Aryans, who are the enemies of his followers. (X, 88, 3 &amp; XX, 36, 10).

The fight between Aryans and their enemies consisted mostly of fortresses and walled settlements of the latter. Both Dasas and Dasyus were in the possession of them. Sharma states that this reminds us of the later discovery of fortifications of Harappan settlements, though there is no clear archaeological evidence of mass-scale confrontation between Aryans and Harappans. He adds that the Aryans seemed to be attracted to their wealth over which regular warfare took place. The worshiper in the Rig Veda expects that those who offered no oblation should be killed and their wealth be divided (I, 176, 4). However, it was the cattle which held the most importance to Aryans who were cattle-herders. For example, it is argued that Kikatas didn&#x27;t need cows because they made no use of milk products in sacrifice.

Sacrifice played an important part in Aryan way of life, however the Dasyus or Dasas did not offer sacrifices. An entire passage in the seventh book of Rig Veda uses adjectives such as &quot;akratün&quot;, &quot;aśraddhān&quot; and &quot;ayajñān&quot; applied to Dasyus emphasizes their non-sacrificing character. Indra is asked to discriminate between them and the sacrificing Aryas. Sharma states that the word &quot;anindra&quot; (without Indra) may refer to Dasyus, Dasa and Aryan dissenters. Per the Aryan view, the Dasyus practiced black magic and &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; refers to them as evil spirits to be scared away from the sacrifice. The Atharva Veda states that the god-blaspheming Dasyus are to be offered as victims. The Dasyus are believed to be treacherous, not practicing Aryan observances, and are hardly human.

Tony Ballantyne states that &quot;Rig Veda&quot; depicts the cultural differences between the Aryan invaders and non-Aryans of Indus valley. He states that although the inter-Aryan conflict is prominent in its hymns, a cultural opposition is drawn between Aryans and the indigenous people of North India. According to him, it depicts the indigenous tribes such as the &quot;Pani&quot; and &quot;Dasas&quot; as godless, savage and untrustworthy. Panis are cattle thieves who seek to deprive Aryans of them. He states Dasas were savages, whose godless society, darker complexion and different language were culturally different from Aryans. They are called barbarians (&quot;rakshas&quot;), those without fire (&quot;anagnitra&quot;) and flesh-eaters (&quot;kravyad&quot;). The Aryas were on the other hand presented as noble people protected by their gods Agni and Indra. He adds that their names were extended beyond them to denote savage and barbarian people in general. He concurs that this continued into later Sanskritic tradition where &quot;dasa&quot; came to mean a slave while &quot;Arya&quot; meant noble.

=== Later Vedic texts ===
The three words Dasa, Dasyu and Asura are used interchangeably in almost identical verses that are repeated in different Vedic texts, such as the Rig Veda, the Saunaka recension of &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;, the &quot;Paippalada Samhita&quot; of the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; and the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; text in various Vedas. Such comparative study has led scholars to interpret &quot;Dasa&quot; and &quot;Dasyu&quot; may have been a synonym of &quot;Asura&quot; (demons or evil forces, sometimes simply lords with special knowledge and magical powers) of later Vedic texts.

Sharma states that the word &quot;dasa&quot; occurs in &quot;Aitareya&quot; and &quot;Gopatha Brahmanas&quot;, but not in the sense of a slave.

=== Arthashastra ===
Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; dedicates the thirteenth chapter on &quot;dasas&quot;, in his third book on law. This Sanskrit document from the Maurya Empire period (4th century BCE), has been translated by several authors. Shamasastry&#x27;s translation in 1915, Kangle&#x27;s translation in the 1960s and Rangarajan&#x27;s translation in 1987 all map &quot;dasa&quot; as slave. However, Kangle suggests that the context and rights granted to &quot;dasa&quot; by Kautilya, such as the right to the same wage as a free labourer and the right to freedom on payment of an amount, distinguish this form of slavery from that of contemporary Greece. Edmund Leach points out that the &quot;Dasa&quot; was the antithesis of the concept of &quot;Arya&quot;. As the latter term evolved through successive meanings, so did &quot;Dasa&quot;: from &quot;indigenous inhabitant&quot; to &quot;serf,&quot; &quot;tied servant,&quot; and finally &quot;chattel slave.&quot; He suggests the term &quot;unfreedom&quot; to cover all these meanings.

According to &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, anyone who had been found guilty of &quot;nishpatitah&quot; (Sanskrit: निष्पातित, ruined, bankrupt, a minor crime) may mortgage oneself to become &quot;dasa&quot; for someone willing to pay his or her bail and employ the &quot;dasa&quot; for money and privileges.

According to Arthashastra, it was illegal to force a &quot;dasa&quot; (slave) to do certain types of work, to hurt or abuse him, or to force sex on a female &quot;dasa&quot;.



== Buddhist texts ==
Words related to &quot;dasa&quot; are found in early Buddhist texts, such as &quot;dāso na pabbājetabbo&quot;, which Davids and Stede translate as &quot;the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu&quot;. This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monastic is found in &quot;Vinaya Pitakam&quot; i.93, &quot;Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikāya&quot;, Tibetan &quot;Bhiksukarmavakya&quot; and &quot;Upasampadajnapti&quot;.
In Buddhist scriptures, slavery is a backdrop to the narratives, and &quot;dasas&quot; (slaves) were among the donations to the monastic community. Various terms were used, like &quot;bondsmen,&quot; &quot;proper slave,&quot; and &quot;proper bondman&quot;, and individuals were treated as property and could be donated as such to monks and monasteries. In various &quot;Vinayas&quot;, The Buddha permits the offering and utilization of household servants and slaves, along with land, mats, livestock, tools, and medicinal items. At times, slaves were tasked with carrying out actions that were explicitly prohibited for monks

== Other uses ==

=== Use of religious &quot;devotees&quot; ===
In Tamil &quot;dasa&quot; is commonly used to refer to devotees of Vishnu or Krishna.

In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, devotees often use &quot;dasa&quot; (meaning slave of Krishna) as part of their names, as in &quot;Hari Dasa&quot;.

=== As a surname or byname ===

Dasa or Das is also a surname or middle name found among Hindus and Sikhs, typically in northern half of India, where it literally means &quot;votary, devotee, slave of God.&quot; For example, Mohandas Gandhi&#x27;s first name, Mohandas, means slave of Mohan or Krishna. Also, the name Surdas means slave of Sur or Deva. In the past, many saints of the Bhakti movement added it to their names, signifying their total devotion or surrender to God.

== Comparative linguistics ==
Dasa and related terms have been examined by several scholars. While the terms &quot;Dasa&quot; and &quot;Dasyu&quot; have a negative meaning in Sanskrit, their Iranian counterparts &quot;Daha&quot; and &quot;Dahyu&quot; have preserved their positive (or neutral) meaning. This is similar to the Sanskrit terms &quot;Deva&quot; (a &quot;positive&quot; term) and &quot;Asura&quot; (a &quot;negative&quot; term). The Iranian counterparts of these terms (&quot;Daeva&quot; and &quot;Ahura&quot;) have opposite meanings.

Asko Parpola states the original &quot;Dasa&quot; is related to the Old Persian word &quot;Daha&quot; which also means &quot;man&quot;, but refers specifically to a regional ethnic minority of Persia. Parpola contrasts &quot;Daha&quot; with &quot;Arya&quot;, stating that the latter also referred to &quot;man&quot; but specifically to the incoming Indo-Iranians from Central Asia. The Vedic text that include prayers to help defeat the &quot;Dasa as enemy people&quot;, states Parpola, may refer to the wars of the Indo-Iranians against the bearers of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) culture. The latter spoke a different language and opposed Indo-Iranian religious practices. Parpola uses archaeological and linguistic arguments to support his theory, but his theory is controversial.

<text>In biology a section () is a taxonomic rank that is applied differently in botany and zoology.

==In botany==

Within flora (plants), &#x27;section&#x27; refers to a &quot;botanical&quot; rank below the genus, but above the species:
* Domain &gt; Kingdom &gt; Division &gt; Class &gt; Order &gt; Family &gt; Tribe &gt; Genus &gt; Subgenus &gt; Section &gt; Subsection &gt; Species

==In zoology==
Within fauna (animals), &#x27;section&#x27; refers to an uncommonly used &quot;zoological&quot; rank below the order, but above the family:

* Domain &gt; Kingdom &gt; Phylum &gt; Class &gt; Order &gt; Section &gt; Family &gt; Tribe &gt; Genus &gt; Species

The rank of Superfamily is commonly adopted instead.

==In bacteriology==
The International Code of Nomenclature for Bacteria states that the Section rank is an informal one, between the subgenus and species (as in botany).

<text>Cumbernauld United Football Club are a football club based in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. They play at Guy&#x27;s Meadow in the Cumbernauld Village area of the town.

Formed in 1964, they currently compete in the , having previously played in the SJFA West Region before moving to the senior pyramid in 2020.

Club colours are maroon and blue, and the club&#x27;s nickname is &quot;United&quot;.

The club has a full youth academy with teams from the under-6 age group up to under-19 level. The academy plays its home games on the &#x27;HatTrix&#x27; astroturf park adjacent to the Guy&#x27;s Meadow pitch, as well as on that pitch itself when weather permits.

The club also has a successful five a side complex and social club.

The team are managed by former Partick Thistle midfielder Andy Frame, who replaced previous manager George Shaw in January 2017.

==Guy&#x27;s Meadow==
Guy&#x27;s Meadow is the home to Cumbernauld United. The stadium currently has a capacity of 2,500 which consists of mainly standing areas.

===Facilities===
The stadium has few facilities, however the Hat-Trix sports bar lies at one end of the park and two terraced stands are situated at either side of the pitch. The facility also includes an impressive astroturf facility, mainly used to host five-a-side football. The stadium&#x27;s record attendance was set when 2,200 people watched Cumbernauld play Pollok in 1983.

===Kirkintilloch Rob Roy===
From 2014 to 2024, fellow West of Scotland League club Kirkintilloch Rob Roy used the stadium as their home venue while they searched for new home to replace the historic Adamslie Park, where they played for almost 100 years.

From the start of the 24/25 season, Kirky vacated Guy&#x27;s Meadow and moved into the Kirkintilloch Community Sports Complex.

==Notable former players==
*Kenny Dalglish: The former Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland International played for Cumbernauld United during season 1967–68.

<doc id="443123" wikidata="Q285165" url="?curid=443123" title="Black francolin">
<text>The black francolin (Francolinus francolinus) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes. It was formerly known as the black partridge. It is the state bird of Haryana state, India (locally known as &quot;kaala teetar&quot;, काला तीतर). Fried black francolin is eaten in Azerbaijani cuisine.

== Taxonomy ==

There are six recognized subspecies:
* &quot;F. f. francolinus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – western black francolin - Cyprus, southern Turkey to Iraq and Iran
* &quot;F. f. arabistanicus&quot; (Zarudny and Harms, 1913) – Iranian black francolin – southern Iraq and western Iran
* &quot;F. f. asiae&quot; (Bonaparte, 1856) – Indian black francolin – northern India
* &quot;F. f. henrici&quot; (Bonaparte, 1856) - South Persian black francolin – southern Pakistan to western India
* &quot;F. f. bogdanovi&quot; (Zarudny, 1906) – southern Iran and Afghanistan to southern Pakistan
* &quot;F. f. melanonotus&quot; (Hume, 1888) – eastern India to Sikkim and Bangladesh.

==Description==

The black francolin has a length range around and weight about . The male is black with a white patch on the cheek, a chestnut collar and white spots on the flanks. The back and wings are scalloped with shades of golden brown with sub-terminal tawny-buff bands and pale edges. The rounded tail is black with narrow white or greyish bars. The legs and neck are reddish-brown to red. The extent of the white spotting on the flanks varies substantially across the species&#x27; range and the depth of colour of the females similarly varies. 

The female is mainly brown, but has a chestnut hind neck. The head is curved with brown irises, brown crown and black throat. The upper plumage, wings and tail as in the male, but the black is replaced by mottled brown and the brown bars on the lower back and tail are wider. The female is duller, with no cheek patch, and the collar is replaced with a nuchal patch. The head and underparts are buff where the male shows black. The rump and upper tail coverts are light brown.

Similar species: the grey francolin has a grey-brown and buff body, buff instead of black throat, and lacks the rufous collar.

===Voice===
The call of the black francolin, described as a loud ringing &quot;klik cheek-cheek-cheerakik&quot;, &quot;kik-kik-kik&quot; or &quot;kwee-kweeeee-kwee&quot;, can be heard in the mornings and evenings and almost all day during the breeding season. The male calls while standing on an earth mound, bund, rock or a low tree branch and is soon joined by other birds answering from all directions.

==Distribution and habitat==
Black francolins are resident breeders from south-eastern Turkey eastwards through Iran to southwest Turkmenistan and northeast India, and Kazipara, Panchagarh of Bangladesh. The species&#x27; range was formerly more extensive, but over-hunting has reduced its distribution and numbers. Fragmented populations occur in the western part of its range. 

Black francolins were introduced to the Calcasieu and Cameron parishes of southwestern Louisiana in 1961. Additional introductions have also occurred in south Florida. Elsewhere, black francolins have been introduced to Guam and the Hawaiian Islands.

The birds are found in scrubby habitats with plenty of cultivated crops tall enough to offer shelter and open beneath to provide escape routes and easy travel. They prefer areas of thick vegetation, usually near water. They are not forest birds but will frequent scrubland and forest edges associated with grassland. They appear to be more closely associated to water than chukars are, and in drier areas.

==Behaviour==

The black francolin only flies when disturbed. It has a pheasant&#x27;s explosive flight, but prefers to creep away unseen. The flight is short and direct, punctuated by glides on rounded wings.

===Breeding===

Black francolins are monogamous. They normally nest in tall grasslands from late March to May. The male may be seen standing on a rock or low tree attracting attention with its extraordinary creaking call. It may be heard all day long in April, during nesting, and less persistently in March and May as well as the summer months. Both parents tend chicks after hatching. Young stay with parents through their first winter. The most likely breeding locations Savanna, Grasslands, Scrub vegetation areas under the cultivated crops. They have a loud call during the breeding season. Males may also become aggressive during the breeding season, make sure there is plenty of cover and escape routes for the hen and it maybe necessary to house her separate and allow limited access for breeding only. They are generally monogamous in the wild.

In aviculture it is best to house only one pair per aviary. Well planted aviaries with little surrounding traffic would be best for breeding. They are fairly winter hardy, but always provide some shelter during the coldest months breeds from late March to September depending on the range. The normal clutch size lies between 10 and 14 eggs, and only the hen incubates. The eggs are white-spotted olive or pale brown. The incubation period is 18 to 19 days, the breeding season is April to June and the young appear from April to October.

===Feeding===
The birds forage on the ground for plant material and small invertebrates, including grain, grass seeds, fallen berries, shoots, tubers, termites and ants. In aviculture they eat small mealworms and wax worms, but care must be used when feeding chicks as they are prone to toe-picking. .

<doc id="443124" wikidata="Q839659" url="?curid=443124" title="Phyllotaxis">
<text>In botany, phyllotaxis () or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of patterns in nature.

== Leaf arrangement ==
The basic arrangements of leaves on a stem are opposite and alternate (also known as spiral). Leaves may also be whorled if several leaves arise, or appear to arise, from the same level (at the same node) on a stem.

With an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise from the stem at the same level (at the same node), on opposite sides of the stem. An opposite leaf pair can be thought of as a whorl of two leaves.

With an alternate (spiral) pattern, each leaf arises at a different point (node) on the stem.

Distichous phyllotaxis, also called &quot;two-ranked leaf arrangement&quot; is a special case of either opposite or alternate leaf arrangement where the leaves on a stem are arranged in two vertical columns on opposite sides of the stem. Examples include various bulbous plants such as &quot;Boophone&quot;. It also occurs in other plant habits such as those of &quot;Gasteria&quot; or &quot;Aloe&quot; seedlings, and also in mature plants of related species such as &quot;Kumara plicatilis&quot;.

In an opposite pattern, if successive leaf pairs are 90 degrees apart, this habit is called decussate. It is common in members of the family Crassulaceae Decussate phyllotaxis also occurs in the Aizoaceae. In genera of the Aizoaceae, such as &quot;Lithops&quot; and &quot;Conophytum&quot;, many species have just two fully developed leaves at a time, the older pair folding back and dying off to make room for the decussately oriented new pair as the plant grows.

If the arrangement is both distichous and decussate, it is called secondarily distichous.


The whorled arrangement is fairly unusual on plants except for those with particularly short internodes. Examples of trees with whorled phyllotaxis are &quot;Brabejum stellatifolium&quot; and the related genus &quot;Macadamia&quot;.

A whorl can occur as a basal structure where all the leaves are attached at the base of the shoot and the internodes are small or nonexistent. A basal whorl with a large number of leaves spread out in a circle is called a rosette.

== Repeating spiral ==
The rotational angle from leaf to leaf in a repeating spiral can be represented by a fraction of a full rotation around the stem.

Alternate distichous leaves will have an angle of 1/2 of a full rotation. In beech and hazel the angle is 1/3, in oak and apricot it is 2/5, in sunflowers, poplar, and pear, it is 3/8, and in willow and almond the angle is 5/13. The numerator and denominator normally consist of a Fibonacci number and its second successor. The number of leaves is sometimes called rank, in the case of simple Fibonacci ratios, because the leaves line up in vertical rows. With larger Fibonacci pairs, the pattern becomes complex and non-repeating. This tends to occur with a basal configuration. Examples can be found in composite flowers and seed heads. The most famous example is the sunflower head. This phyllotactic pattern creates an optical effect of criss-crossing spirals. In the botanical literature, these designs are described by the number of counter-clockwise spirals and the number of clockwise spirals. These also turn out to be Fibonacci numbers. In some cases, the numbers appear to be multiples of Fibonacci numbers because the spirals consist of whorls.

==Determination==
The pattern of leaves on a plant is ultimately controlled by the accumulation of the plant hormone auxin in certain areas of the meristem. Leaves become initiated in localized areas where auxin concentration is higher. When a leaf is initiated and begins development, auxin begins to flow towards it, thus depleting auxin from area on the meristem close to where the leaf was initiated. This gives rise to a self-propagating system that is ultimately controlled by the ebb and flow of auxin in different regions of the meristematic topography.

== History ==

Some early scientists—notably Leonardo da Vinci—made observations of the spiral arrangements of plants. In 1754, Charles Bonnet observed that the spiral phyllotaxis of plants were frequently expressed in both clockwise and counter-clockwise golden ratio series. Mathematical observations of phyllotaxis followed with Karl Friedrich Schimper and his friend Alexander Braun&#x27;s 1830 and 1830 work, respectively; Auguste Bravais and his brother Louis connected phyllotaxis ratios to the Fibonacci sequence in 1837.

Insight into the mechanism had to wait until Wilhelm Hofmeister proposed a model in 1868. A primordium, the nascent leaf, forms at the least crowded part of the shoot meristem. The golden angle between successive leaves is the blind result of this jostling. Since three golden arcs add up to slightly more than enough to wrap a circle, this guarantees that no two leaves ever follow the same radial line from center to edge. The generative spiral is a consequence of the same process that produces the clockwise and counter-clockwise spirals that emerge in densely packed plant structures, such as &quot;Protea&quot; flower disks or pinecone scales.

In modern times, researchers such as Mary Snow and George Snow continued these lines of inquiry. Computer modeling and morphological studies have confirmed and refined Hoffmeister&#x27;s ideas. Questions remain about the details. Botanists are divided on whether the control of leaf migration depends on chemical gradients among the primordia or purely mechanical forces. Lucas numbers rather than Fibonacci numbers have been observed in a few plants and occasionally, the leaf positioning appears to be random.

==Mathematics==

Physical models of phyllotaxis date back to Airy&#x27;s experiment of packing hard spheres. Gerrit van Iterson diagrammed grids imagined on a cylinder (rhombic lattices). Douady et al. showed that phyllotactic patterns emerge as self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. In 1991, Levitov proposed that lowest energy configurations of repulsive particles in cylindrical geometries reproduce the spirals of botanical phyllotaxis. More recently, Nisoli et al. (2009) showed that to be true by constructing a &quot;magnetic cactus&quot; made of magnetic dipoles mounted on bearings stacked along a &quot;stem&quot;. They demonstrated that these interacting particles can access novel dynamical phenomena beyond what botany yields: a &quot;dynamical phyllotaxis&quot; family of non local topological solitons emerge in the nonlinear regime of these systems, as well as purely classical rotons and maxons in the spectrum of linear excitations.

Close packing of spheres generates a dodecahedral tessellation with pentaprismic faces. Pentaprismic symmetry is related to the Fibonacci series and the golden section of classical geometry.

==In art and architecture==

Phyllotaxis has been used as an inspiration for a number of sculptures and architectural designs. Akio Hizume has built and exhibited several bamboo towers based on the Fibonacci sequence which exhibit phyllotaxis. Saleh Masoumi has proposed a design for an apartment building in which the apartment balconies project in a spiral arrangement around a central axis and none shade the balcony of the apartment directly beneath.

<text>Calanais () is a village (township) on the west side of the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides (Western Isles), Scotland. Calanais is within the parish of Uig. A linear settlement with a jetty, it is on a headland jutting into Loch Roag, a sea loch west of Stornoway. Calanais is situated alongside the A858, between Breasclete and Garynahine.

The Calanais Stones &quot;Calanais I&quot;, a cross-shaped setting of standing stones erected around 3000 BC, are one of the most spectacular megalithic monuments in Scotland. A modern visitor centre provides information about the main circle and other lesser monuments nearby, numbered as Calanais II to X.

<doc id="443138" wikidata="Q1420043" url="?curid=443138" title="Shinjuku Ni-chōme">
<text>Shinjuku Ni-chōme (新宿二丁目), referred to colloquially as Ni-chōme or simply Nichō, is Area 2 in the Shinjuku District of the Shinjuku Special Ward of Tokyo, Japan. With Tokyo home to 13 million people, and Shinjuku known as the noisiest and most crowded of its 23 special wards, Ni-chōme further distinguishes itself as Tokyo&#x27;s hub of gay subculture, housing the world&#x27;s highest concentration of gay bars.

Within close walking distance from three train stations (Shinjuku San-chōme Station, Shinjuku Gyoenmae Station, and Japan&#x27;s busiest train station, Shinjuku Station), the Shinjuku Ni-chōme neighborhood provides a specialized blend of bars, restaurants, cafes, saunas, love hotels, gay pride boutiques, cruising boxes (hattenba), host clubs, nightclubs, massage parlors, parks, and gay book and video stores. In fact within the five blocks centering on street Naka-Dōri between the BYGS building at the Shinjuku San-chōme Station and the small Shinjuku park three blocks to the east, an estimated 300 gay bars and nightclubs provide entertainment.

==History==

The history of Ni-chōme as a gay neighborhood generally begins around the time of the American Occupation of Japan (1945–1952) and ties strongly to the fall of its red-light districts (akasen). As early as 1948, there is mention of a gay Shinjuku tea shop, and by the 1950s gay bars publicly emerged both in name and form in Ni-chōme.

Before 1957, Tokyo&#x27;s red-light districts had flourished as legally-licensed centers for sex workers but, armed with a new constitution and an Equal Rights amendment, post-occupation Japanese women&#x27;s Christian groups and the like successfully lobbied the Diet to pass the Prostitution Prevention Law in 1956. For the first time, prostitution in Japan became illegal. As the traditional sex industry left Ni-chōme, a gay subculture began to fill its place. By the late 1950s Ni-chōme was known for its popularity in the gay subculture, and a club scene began to emerge.

More recent years have seen the establishment of a counseling room for young gay men in 1976, the first AIDS candlelight vigil in 1986, the 1992 inauguration of Tokyo&#x27;s annual International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Japan&#x27;s first lesbian and gay pride parade in 1994, and the founding of its first gay community center, AKTA. Today Shinjuku Ni-chōme continues to provide a home base for many milestones in the history of Japan&#x27;s LGBT community.

&quot;The Japan Times&quot; reported in February 2010 that the area was in decline, with the number of gay-oriented clubs and bars having declined by one-third. The decline was attributed to the construction of the nearby Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, which has pushed up property values in the area, and the rise of the Internet.

In 2012, the dancing ban in night clubs began to be enforced in a number of popular clubs in Ni-chōme, including Arty Farty, Annex, Arch, and Aisotope. The ban was lifted in 2014 and now clubs like Dragon Men, Aisotope, and Arty Farty permit dancing. 

==Scene specialization==
The lifeblood of the gay neighborhood, the majority of Nichōme&#x27;s hundreds of night clubs typically seat fewer than a dozen customers, who preferably represent a club&#x27;s specialized subset of the gay subculture. In a society where traditionally most of the population was expected to marry, many LGBT Japanese choose to privately express their sexuality within the anonymity of specialty clubs in areas like Ni-chōme. To achieve this specialization, clubs are typically segregated by &quot;scene&quot;. There are bars that cater specifically to the bear community, BDSM, muscular men, young men, butch and femme lesbians, etc. 

While most bar owners do accommodate new and non-Japanese customers, the scene is primarily geared toward regular customers who are Japanese. Some venues discourage or prohibit non-Japanese from entering, regardless of Japanese language ability. At most bars in Shinjuku Ni-chōme, patrons sit at a counter and chat with the bartender. Karaoke is popular, and gay magazines are often available. Most bars offer a “bottle keep” (ボトルキープ) system, so many regular customers choose to keep their own bottles of liquor at their favorite bars. This loyalty is then repaid by bar-organized outings to onsen, hanami parties, picnics, and gay sporting events. Bars maintain large commemorative photo albums of these outings.

==Neighborhood events==
Although few gay clubs in Ni-chōme can hold more than 100 customers, large gay events held throughout the year attract up to several thousand people to the area:
* Rainbow Reel Tokyo (previously known as Tokyo International Lesbian &amp; Gay Film Festival)
* Tokyo Rainbow Pride (including a parade which usually begins near Shibuya Station, heading to Harajuku along Meiji Avenue and Omotesando, and ending in Yoyogi Park)

==Education==
The Shinjuku City (the Shinjuku Ward) Board of Education (新宿区教育委員会) operates public elementary and junior high schools. Shinjuku 2-chome is zoned to Hanazono Elementary School (花園小学校) in Shinjuku 1-chōme and Yotsuya Junior High School (四谷中学校).

Most area public high schools are operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education.

<text>A war memorial is a building, monument, statue, or other edifice to celebrate a war or victory, or (predominating in modern times) to commemorate those who died or were injured in a war.

==Symbolism==

===Historical usage===

It has been suggested that the world&#x27;s earliest known war memorial is the White Monument at Tell Banat, Aleppo Governorate, Syria, which dates from the 3rd millennium BC and appears to have involved the systematic burial of fighters from a state army.

The Nizari Ismailis of the Alamut period (the Assassins) had made a secret roll of honor in Alamut Castle containing the names of the assassins and their victims during their uprising.

The oldest war memorial in the United Kingdom is Oxford University&#x27;s All Souls College. It was founded in 1438 with the provision that its fellows should pray for those killed in the long wars with France.

War memorials for the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) were the first in Europe to have rank-and-file soldiers commemorated by name. Every soldier that was killed was granted a permanent resting-place as part of the terms of the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871).

To commemorate the millions who died in World War I, war memorials became commonplace in communities large and small around the world.

===Modern usage===
In modern times the main intent of war memorials is not to glorify war, but to honor those who have died. Sometimes, as in the case of the Warsaw Genuflection of Willy Brandt, they may also serve as focal points of increasing understanding between previous enemies.

Using modern technology an international project is currently archiving all post-1914 Commonwealth war graves and Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials to create a virtual memorial (see The War Graves Photographic Project for further details).

==History==

===World War I===

During WWI, many nations saw massive devastation and loss of life. More people lost their lives in the east than in the west, but the outcome was different. In the west, and in response to the victory there obtained, most of the cities in the countries involved in the conflict erected memorials, with the memorials in smaller villages and towns often listing the names of each local soldier who had been killed in addition (so far as the decision by the French and British in 1916 to construct governmentally designed cemeteries was concerned) to their names being recorded on military headstones, often against the will of those directly involved, and without any opportunity of choice in the British Empire (whose war graves were administered by the Imperial War Graves Commission). Massive British monuments commemorating thousands of dead with no identified war grave, such as the Menin Gate at Ypres and the Thiepval memorial on the Somme, were also constructed.

The Liberty Memorial, located in Kansas City, Missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in the Great War. For various reasons connected with their character, the same may be said to apply to certain governmental memorials in the United Kingdom (The Cenotaph in London, relating to the Empire in general, and the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh, also with a reference to the Empire, but with particular connections to the United Kingdom, having been opened by the Prince of Wales in 1927 and with the King and the Queen the first visitors and contributors of a casket of the Scottish names for addition within the Shrine). In Maryland, in the center of the city of Baltimore facing the Baltimore City Hall to the west is a geometric paved tree-lined plaza with the War Memorial Building to the east with a large marble decorated civic auditorium and historical and veterans museum below, designed by Laurence Hall Fowler, dedicated 1925.

===Pacifist war memorials and those relating to war and peace===
After World War I, some towns in France set up pacifist war memorials. Instead of commemorating the glorious dead, these memorials denounce war with figures of grieving widows and children rather than soldiers. Such memorials provoked anger among veterans and the military in general. The most famous is at Gentioux-Pigerolles in the department of Creuse. Below the column which lists the name of the fallen stands an orphan in bronze pointing to an inscription &#x27;Maudite soit la guerre&#x27; (Cursed be war). Feelings ran so high that the memorial was not officially inaugurated until 1990 and soldiers at the nearby army camp were under orders to turn their heads when they walked past. Another such memorial is in the small town of Équeurdreville-Hainneville (formerly Équeurdreville) in the department of Manche. Here the statue is of a grieving widow with two small children.

There seems to be no exact equivalent form of a pacifist memorial within the United Kingdom but evidently sentiments were in many cases identical. Thus, and although it seems that this has never been generally recognized, it can be argued that there was throughout the United Kingdom a construction of war memorials with reference to the concept of peace (e.g. West Hartlepool War Memorial in what is now known as Hartlepool (previously West Hartlepool) with the inscription &#x27;Thine O Lord is the Victory&#x27; relating to amongst other architecture the 1871 Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences with a frieze including the same words and concluding &#x27;Glory be to God on high and on earth peace&#x27;).

===World War II and later===
In many cases, World War I memorials were later extended to show the names of locals who died in the World War II in addition.

Since that time memorials to the dead in other conflicts such as the Korean War and Vietnam War have also noted individual contributions, at least in the West.

In relation to actions which may well in point of fact be historically connected with the world wars even if this happens, for whatever reason, not to be a matter of general discussion (e.g. occupation by Western forces in the 1920s of Palestine and other areas being the homelands of Arabs in the Near East and followed eighty years later in 2001 by the &#x27;9/11&#x27; raid on New York and elsewhere in the United States) similar historically and architecturally significant memorials are also designed and constructed (vide National September 11 Memorial).

==Types==
* War memorials can differ significantly in type and composition. Many war memorials often take the form of a traditional monument or statue, while others consist of entire buildings, often containing a museum, while yet others are simple plaques. War memorials can take a variety of other forms, including, but not limited to, commemorative gardens, stadiums, eternal flames, urban plazas, stained glass windows, gateways, fountains and/or pools of water, military equipment, and parks.
* War memorials often serve as a meeting place for commemorative services. As such, they are often found near the centre of town, or contained in a park or plaza to allow easy public access.
* Many war memorials bear plaques listing the names of those that died in battle. Sometimes these lists can be very long. Some war memorials are dedicated to a specific battle, while others are more general in nature and bear inscriptions listing various theatres of war.
* Many war memorials have epitaphs relating to the unit, battle or war they commemorate. For example, an epitaph which adorns numerous memorials in Commonwealth countries is &quot;The Ode&quot; by Laurence Binyon:

* The Memorial Arch at the Royal Military College of Canada, which remembers ex-cadets who died on military service includes lines of Rupert Brooke&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Dead&quot;:

* In the years following the end of World War I a heated debate occurred in the United States as to whether memorials should be the standard sort that were created after the Civil War or a more progressive sort of &quot;living memorials&quot;. These consisted of bridges, parks, libraries, playgrounds, community centers, civic auditoriums and athletic fields. Examples include Soldier Field and Veterans Stadium.
* Underwater memorials commemorate veterans and soldiers who served as divers during their wartime missions.

===Tank monument===
A tank monument or armoured memorial is a tank withdrawn from military service and displayed to commemorate a battle or a military unit. Obsolete tanks may also be displayed as gate guards outside military bases.

Immediately following the First World War, a number of obsolete tanks were presented to towns and cities throughout Britain for display and for use as memorials: most were scrapped in the 1920s and 1930s, but one that survives is a Mark IV Female tank at Ashford, Kent.

Several Second World War tanks are preserved as memorials to major armoured offensives in the Ardennes, such as the Battle of Sedan and the Battle of the Bulge. These include:
* an Achilles tank destroyer in La Roche
* a Panther tank in the village Celles
* a Sherman tank in the town square of Bastogne
* a Tiger II tank in the village of La Gleize

A plinth-mounted T-35/85 tank commemorates the soldiers of the 5th Guards Tank Army, at Znamianka in Ukraine.

==In cemeteries==
Many cemeteries tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission have an identical war memorial called the Cross of Sacrifice designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield that varies in height from 18 ft to 32 ft depending on the size of the cemetery. If there are one thousand or more burials, a Commonwealth cemetery will contain a Stone of Remembrance, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens with words from the Wisdom of Sirach: &quot;Their name liveth for evermore&quot;; all the Stones of Remembrance are 11 ft 6 ins long and 5 ft high with three steps leading up to them.

Arlington National Cemetery has a Canadian Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during the Korean War and two World Wars.

==Controversy==
War memorials can sometimes be politically controversial. A notable case is that of the Yasukuni Shrine in Japan, where a number of convicted World War II war criminals are interred. Chinese and Korean representatives have often protested against the visits of Japanese politicians to the shrine. The visits have in the past led to severe diplomatic conflicts between the nations, and Japanese businesses were attacked in China after a visit by former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to the shrine was widely reported and criticized in Chinese and Korean media.

In a similar case, former German chancellor Helmut Kohl was criticised by writers Günter Grass and Elie Wiesel for visiting the war cemetery at Bitburg (in the company of Ronald Reagan) which also contained the bodies of SS troops. Unlike the case of the Yasukuni Shrine, there was no element of intentional disregard of international opinion involved, as is often claimed for the politician visits to the Japanese shrine.

Soviet World War II memorials included quotes of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s texts, frequently replaced after his death. Such memorials were often constructed in city centres and now are sometimes regarded as symbols of Soviet occupation and removed, which in turn may spark protests (see Bronze Soldier of Tallinn).

The Fusiliers&#x27; memorial arch to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who fought in the Boer War, erected at 1907 in St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin, was called &quot;Traitors&#x27; Gate&quot; by the Redmondites and later Irish Republicans, from whose point of view Irish soldiers going off to fight the British Empire&#x27;s wars were traitors to Ireland. The sharpness of the controversy gradually faded, and while the term &quot;Traitors&#x27; Gate&quot; is still in occasional colloquial use in Dublin daily life, it has mostly lost its pejorative meaning.

In Australia, in 1981, historian Henry Reynolds raised the issue of whether war memorials should be erected to Indigenous Australians who had died fighting against British invaders on their lands.
How, then, do we deal with the Aboriginal dead? White Australians frequently say that &#x27;all that&#x27; should be forgotten. But it will not be. It cannot be. Black memories are too deeply, too recently scarred. And forgetfulness is a strange prescription coming from a community which has revered the fallen warrior and emblazoned the phrase &#x27;Lest We Forget&#x27; on monuments throughout the land. [...] [D]o we make room for the Aboriginal dead on our memorials, cenotaphs, boards of honour and even in the pantheon of national heroes? If we are to continue to celebrate the sacrifice of men and women who died for their country can we deny admission to fallen tribesmen? There is much in their story that Australians have traditionally admired. They were ever the underdogs, were always outgunned, yet frequently faced death without flinching. If they did not die for Australia as such they fell defending their homelands, their sacred sites, their way of life. What is more the blacks bled on their own soil and not half a world away furthering the strategic objectives of a distant Motherland whose influence must increasingly be seen as of transient importance in the history of the continent.
Reynolds&#x27; suggestion proved controversial. Occasional memorials have been erected to commemorate Aboriginal people&#x27;s resistance to colonisation, or to commemorate white massacres of Indigenous Australians. These memorials have often generated controversy. For example, a 1984 memorial to the Kalkadoon people&#x27;s &quot;resistance against the paramilitary force of European settlers and the Queensland Native Mounted Police&quot; was &quot;frequently shot at&quot; and &quot;eventually blown up&quot;.

With the advent of long war, some memorials are constructed before the conflict is over, leaving space for extra names of the dead. For instance, the Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial in Irvine, CA, memorializes an ongoing pair of US wars, and has space to inscribe the names of approximately 8,000 fallen servicemembers, while the UK National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield in England hosts the UK&#x27;s National Armed Forces Memorial which displays the names of the more than 16,000 people who have already died on active service in the UK armed forces since World War II, with more space available for future fatalities.

<text>Dumbarton Football Club is a semi-professional football club in Dumbarton, Scotland. Founded on 23 December 1872, they are one of the oldest football clubs in Scotland.

The club plays home games at the Dumbarton Football Stadium next to Dumbarton Castle.

They were one of the most successful of the nineteenth century, winning the Scottish Football League in the first two seasons of the competition (the first jointly with Rangers).

The club ceased playing in 1901 and did not return to action until 1905. Although at the time it was emphasised that this was a new club, subsequent directives by the SFA and Scottish Combination appear to countermand this, possibly to fast-track the re-formed club into their competitions.

Since then, the club have spent the majority of their history outside the top flight, with their last appearance at the top level coming in 1984–85 and the side currently playing in Scottish League One. The club were the first team (and one of only two) to win at least one league title in each of the top four tiers in the Scottish football league system.

Stephen Farrell is the club&#x27;s manager, having been appointed in May 2021.

In May 2021, it was announced that Dumbarton were to change ownership, with previous owners Brabco selling their majority share to Cognitive Capital.

In November 2024 the club was placed in administration.

==Colours and badge==
For 2024–25, the side will wear strips from the Macron brand for the third season. The home strip is mainly white with a black and gold band. The away kit is gold and black.

The club&#x27;s badge features an elephant with a castle on its back, this represents Dumbarton Rock with Dumbarton Castle upon it, based on the historic town crest. Dumbarton Rock, a volcanic plug, is said to resemble an elephant. The team&#x27;s nickname &#x27;The Sons&#x27; is derived from the phrase &#x27;Sons of The Rock&#x27;, a term used for those born in the town of Dumbarton.

==Stadium==


Dumbarton play their home games at Dumbarton Football Stadium (commonly referred to as &quot;The Rock&quot; by supporters). The all seated stadium has been used since 2 December 2000. The only stand is overshadowed by Dumbarton Rock &amp; sits aside the banks of the River Leven. The stadium has been named for sponsorship purposes for most of its existence:

* Strathclyde Homes Stadium (Dec 2000 – Sep 2011) until the receivership of Strathclyde Homes
* Dumbarton Football Stadium (Sep 2011 – Feb 2012)
* Dumbarton Football Stadium Sponsored by DL Cameron (Feb 2012 – Jul 2012)
* The BetButler Stadium (Jul 2012 – Sep 2014) until the liquidation of BetButler
* Dumbarton Football Stadium (Sep 2014 – Jun 2015)
* The Cheaper Insurance Direct Stadium (Jul 2015 – May 2017)
* The YOUR Radio 103FM Stadium (July 2017 – May 2018)
* C&amp;G Systems Stadium (May 2018 – May 2021)
*Dumbarton Football Stadium (May 2021 – September 2021)
*Moreroom.com Stadium (September 2021 – March 2022)

Prior to December 2000, the team played at Boghead Park from 1879 until the end of the 1999–00 season; at that time their tenure of 121 years was the longest a senior Scottish club had stayed at the same ground. Between May and November 2000, Dumbarton shared Cliftonhill in Coatbridge with Albion Rovers.

In November 2014 the club&#x27;s owners, Brabco, formally announced their intention to move to a new ground after only 15 years at their home, situated in what is Young&#x27;s Farm to the North of Dumbarton between Dalreoch and Renton. The proposed development would have doubled the existing capacity to 4,000, with the existing site being used to build 180 houses and a walkway along the River Clyde connecting the town centre with Dumbarton Castle. The plans were rejected by West Dunbartonshire Council in March 2018.

===Attendances===
==Supporters and culture==

Dumbarton were the first league club in Scotland to have a supporters&#x27; trust, which works to strengthen the links between the club and the fans. The trust own a significant number of shares in the club and are the fourth largest shareholder. Following a £25,000 direct investment, the trust also has a representative on the club board of directors. The supporters&#x27; trust works with the club to produce the match programme &amp; run the club website. As well as those important functions, the trust&#x27;s main role at the club is that of overseeing commercial activity.

<doc id="443163" wikidata="Q2565001" url="?curid=443163" title="Red Book of Westmarch">
<text>The Red Book of Westmarch (sometimes the Thain&#x27;s Book after its principal version) is a fictional manuscript written by hobbits, related to the author J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s frame stories. It is an instance of the found manuscript literary device, to explain the source of his legendarium. In the fiction, it is a collection of writings in which the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were recounted by their characters, and from which Tolkien supposedly derived these and other works. The name of the book comes from its red leather binding and casing, and from its having been housed in the Westmarch, a region of Middle-earth next to the Shire. 

In reality, Tolkien modelled its name on the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, and followed a tradition in English literature established by Samuel Richardson in the 18th century. He was also attempting, according to the scholar Gergely Nagy, to fit &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into his presentation of his legendarium as a genuine-seeming collection of tales and myths, by ascribing the documents to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.

== Fictional development ==
The &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; is part of Tolkien&#x27;s framing of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as part of a long tradition of manuscripts, which he happened to have found.

===&quot;There and Back Again&quot;===

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien writes of the protagonist and title character Bilbo Baggins composing his memoirs. Bilbo thinks of calling his work &quot;There and Back Again, A Hobbit&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s full name for the novel is indeed &quot;The Hobbit or There and Back Again&quot;.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, this record is said to be written in his red leather-bound diary. Bilbo says to Gandalf that his intended ending would be him living &quot;happily ever after to the end of his days&quot;. This is in fact a rephrased line from the final chapter of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, originally conveyed through third-person narrative voice.

=== &quot;The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

Bilbo expands his memoirs into a record of the events of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, including the exploits of his kinsman Frodo Baggins and others. He leaves the material for Frodo to complete and organize. Frodo writes down the bulk of the final work, using Bilbo&#x27;s diary and &quot;many pages of loose notes&quot;. At the close of Tolkien&#x27;s main narrative, the work is almost complete, and Frodo leaves the task to his gardener Samwise Gamgee.

In the last chapter of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, Tolkien provides a &quot;title page&quot; for the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; inscribed with a succession of rejected titles. The final title is Frodo&#x27;s:

=== &quot;Translations from the Elvish&quot; ===

Bilbo had translated material from Elvish lore from the Elder Days. This work, &quot;Translations from the Elvish, by B.B.&quot;, comprised three volumes, also bound in red leather. After the defeat of Sauron (the Lord of the Rings) Bilbo gives these volumes to Frodo. These four volumes were &quot;probably&quot; (according to Tolkien) kept in a single red case.

===&quot;Red Book&quot;===

The volumes then pass into the keeping of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo&#x27;s servant and later mayor of the Shire. In time, the volumes are left in the care of Sam&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elanor Fairbairn, and her descendants (the &quot;Fairbairns of the Towers&quot; or &quot;Wardens of Westmarch&quot;). A fifth volume containing Hobbit genealogical tables and commentaries is composed and added at unknown dates, presumably over a long period of time, by unknown hands in Westmarch. This collection of writings is collectively called the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;.

=== &quot;Thain&#x27;s Book&quot; ===

Tolkien states that the original &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; was not preserved, but that several copies, with various notes and later additions, were made. The first copy was made on the request of King Elessar of Arnor and Gondor, and was brought to Gondor by Thain Peregrin I, who had been one of Frodo&#x27;s companions. This copy was known as &quot;The Thain&#x27;s Book&quot; and &quot;contained much that was later omitted or lost&quot;. In Gondor it underwent much annotation and correction, particularly regarding Elvish languages. Also added was a short version of &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot; by Faramir&#x27;s grandson Barahir.

The story then runs that a copy of a revised and expanded &quot;Thain&#x27;s Book&quot; was made probably by request of Peregrin&#x27;s great-grandson and delivered to the Shire. It was written by the scribe &quot;Findegil&quot; and stored at the Took residence in &quot;Great Smials&quot;. Tolkien says this copy was important because it alone contained the whole of Bilbo&#x27;s &quot;Translations from the Elvish&quot;.

This version somehow then survives until Tolkien&#x27;s time, and he translates the &quot;Red Book&quot; from the original languages into English and other representative languages or varieties, such as Old English for Rohirric.

=== Related works ===

A similar work in some respects was the fictional &quot;Yearbook of Tuckborough&quot;, the annals of the Took family of hobbits of Tuckborough. It was described as the oldest known book in the Shire, and was most likely kept at the Great Smials of Tuckborough. The story runs that it was begun around the year and chronicled events dating from the foundation of the Shire in T.A. 1601 onwards. For comparison, the narrative in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; commences in the year T.A. 3001.

The &quot;Yearbook&quot; recorded births, deaths, marriages, land-sales, and other events in Took history. Much of this information was later included in the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;. Tolkien wrote that it was also known as the &quot;Great Writ of Tuckborough&quot; and &quot;the Yellowskin&quot;, suggesting that it was bound in yellow leather or some other yellow material. Tolkien mentions several other supposedly historical documents related to the &quot;Red Book&quot;, but it is unclear whether these were integrated into editions. These works include the &quot;Tale of Years&quot; (part of which was used as the timeline for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;) and &quot;Herblore of the Shire&quot;, supposedly written by Frodo&#x27;s contemporary Meriadoc Brandybuck, used for information about pipe-weed.

== Relationship to Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth books ==

As a memoir and history, the contents of the &quot;Red Book&quot; correspond to Tolkien&#x27;s work as follows:

However, according to the Tolkien scholar Vladimir Brljak, readers are probably not intended to imagine Tolkien&#x27;s published works as direct translations from the fictitious Red Book, but rather as Tolkien&#x27;s own scholarly and literary adaptations of this supposed source material.

Some events and details concerning Gollum and the magic ring in the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were rewritten for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was later revised for consistency. Tolkien explains the discrepancies as Bilbo&#x27;s lies (influenced by the ring, now the sinister One Ring).

== Analysis ==

The Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker writes that the Red Book of Westmarch owes its name to a collection of Welsh history and poetry including the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the 15th century &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;.

The title &quot;There and Back Again&quot; represents an archetypal Hobbit outlook on adventures. Frodo looks upon the going &quot;there and back again&quot; as an ideal throughout &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; similar to the Greek concept of νόστος (&quot;nostos&quot;, a heroic return). In the Tolkien scholar Richard C. West&#x27;s view, Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot; is a pastiche of scholarship. It functions, he writes, as what scholars would call a spurious source, but the authority it imparts is by an appeal not to the old and familiar, but to the modern mystique of scholarly research. The &quot;found manuscript conceit&quot;, employed by Tolkien to situate &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a part of &quot;The Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, has been used in English literature since Samuel Richardson&#x27;s novels &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740) and &quot;Clarissa; or, The History of a Young Lady&quot; (1747–1748); Tolkien used it also in his incomplete time travel novel, &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;.

Gergely Nagy notes that Tolkien wanted to present the complex set of writings of his legendarium as a seemingly-genuine collection of tales and myths within the frame of his fictional Middle-earth; he modified &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to ascribe the documents to Bilbo, supposedly written in the years he spent in Rivendell, and preserved in the fictitious &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;There and Back Again&quot; provided the basis for the voiceover for the scene &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, greatly extended in the Special Extended Edition. Bilbo&#x27;s writing of it provides his motive for wanting privacy in the film, substituting for a more complicated situation in the novel. Bilbo only says his line about his intended &quot;happy ending&quot; after he gives up the One Ring. The exchange is tweaked to symbolize Bilbo&#x27;s unburdening from the great weight of the ring; this frees him to choose his own story&#x27;s ending. In Jackson&#x27;s film version, the book that Bilbo hands over to Frodo is subtitled &quot;A Hobbit&#x27;s Tale&quot; rather than &quot;A Hobbit&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. The &quot;Red Book&quot; in full (rather than just its title page) appears at the end of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. In 1974, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt published a one-volume edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, bound in red imitation leather.

<text>The International Fellowship of Christian Assemblies (IFCA), formerly known as the Christian Church of North America (CCNA), is a North American Pentecostal denomination with roots in the Italian-American community, but is now a multicultural denomination. Central offices are located in Transfer, Pennsylvania. Ministries of the church include Benevolence, Home Missions, FOCUS, Foreign Missions, Education, Lay Ministries, and Public Relations. A convention is held annually, and their official publication is &quot;Vista&quot;, a quarterly magazine. Membership in 2000 was about 7,200 in 96 churches in the United States. They also have thousands of affiliated congregations internationally in Africa, Australia, Canada, Europe, South America, and Asia with a strong presence in India with over 100,000 members in over 1,000 churches. Brother Rick George is the general overseer of the denomination.

==History==
The International Fellowship of Christian Assemblies is part of the larger Pentecostal movement that began in the United States during the first part of the 20th century and is rooted in a revival movement among the ethnic Italians in Chicago. Reverend Louis Francescon organized the first Italian-American Pentecostal church there in 1907 after hearing Pentecostal preacher William Howard Durham and having experienced the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. William Durham had prophesied that Francescon had been divinely appointed to bring the Pentecostal message to the Italian people. The IFCA remains committed to evangelism to people and communities with Italian roots, but is now a multicultural denomination and holds strongly to the mission of the Great Commission. Francescon, Pietro Ottolini, and several other early Italian-immigrant Pentecostals soon traveled to Brazil and Italy in order to evangelize to Italian communities outside of the United States. Reverend Francesco Emma (1875–1948) started the first church in New York City for Italian immigrants. News outlets at the time reported that his funeral lasted five days as seven thousand people visited from various parts of the world. The Rev. Joseph Giordano (1890-1955), continued with an Italian and later English ministry in Jersey City, New Jersey from 1927 through the 1950s. Following his passing, the Rev Biagio Parisi (1914-1992) continued the Jersey City ministry. The Rev. Joseph De Mola (1912–1987), who had come out of the Rev Joseph Giordano&#x27;s ministry, continued with an Italian and English ministry in Staten Island during the 1950s and 1960s. The first convention of the &quot;Italian Pentecostal Movement&quot; was called in Niagara Falls, New York, in 1927, where the group adopted articles of faith and organized into a cooperative fellowship known as the &quot;Unorganized Italian Christian Churches of the United States.&quot; This helped build the movement into a cohesive whole. Later, the fellowship slightly modified its name to the &quot;Italian Christian Churches of North America&quot;. By the 1940s, &quot;Italian&quot; was dropped, in order to convey the message that its message was not just restricted to Italians. In 1948, the movement was incorporated in Pennsylvania as &quot;The Missionary Society of the Christian Church of North America&quot;. In 1963, the body was restructured as the &quot;General Council of the Christian Church of North America&quot;. In 2006, it adopted its current name.

==Beliefs==
The IFCA is conservative and Pentecostal in their beliefs and practices. They stress order in their congregations when it comes to manifestations of the Holy Spirit among the congregants. Explaining their desire for order, the IFCA says that they &quot;frankly abhor the excesses tolerated or practiced among the churches using the same name [of Pentecostalism].&quot; The denomination&#x27;s first General Council in 1927 had a mural which read, &quot;Let all things be done decently and in order,&quot; a quotation from I Corinthians 14:40. The IFCA deems themselves a &quot;Full Gospel Church&quot;, but this should not be confused with the four-fold Full Gospel concept found in some other Pentecostal denominations. They explain the Full Gospel as meaning that they &quot;embrace every doctrine of the New Testament.&quot;

===Articles of Faith===
The beliefs of the IFCA are set forth in their 13-point &quot;Articles of Faith&quot; which was originally set forth in 1927, but its wording and focus has been modified over the years. These articles are deemed &quot;binding upon all members&quot; who are affiliated with the IFCA. Below is a summary of these articles:

# The inerrancy and inspiration of the Bible and the use of the Historical-Grammatical Method in studying the scriptures.
# A Trinitarian and Classical Theism understanding of God as &quot;sovereign, holy, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, immutable, immense, immanent, and transcendent.&quot;
# The Divinity of Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity and his sacrifice being the only salvation from sin. Also mentions the Virgin Birth, Miracles, and Resurrection of Jesus.
# The existence of the &quot;Demonic Realm&quot; and the reality of Satan and his &quot;demonic spirits&quot; as being against the works and people of God. It adds that &quot;Christ conquered them through Calvary.&quot;
# The fall of mankind from perfection through Original Sin. That people cannot remedy their sinful state on their own and need salvation through Jesus in order to be saved.
# That people receive a &quot;new birth&quot; through faith in Jesus and become &quot;new creatures.&quot; Those who have faith in Jesus &quot;have been justified, are being sanctified, and will ultimately be glorified.&quot;
# Article on the meaning and purpose of the church. Belief in the &quot;universal&quot; church. Includes holding to two ordinances; The Lord&#x27;s Supper and Water Baptism by full immersion.
# The Pentecostal belief in Spirit Baptism available to all believers &quot;with tongues as the initial physical evidence of having received the gift.&quot;
# Enumeration of the Gifts of the Spirit and that the &quot;purpose of the gifts is for the exhortation, edification and comfort of the Church.&quot;
# That Divine healing may occur through prayer (individual or communal), direct divine intervention, or by the &quot;spiritual gifts of healing.&quot;
# The Premillennial second coming of Jesus.
# The future resurrection when all saved individuals will go to Heaven for eternity and all unbelievers &quot;will be judged before the Great White Throne&quot; and sent to hell for eternity in a &quot;conscious punishment.&quot;
# A list of &quot;Beliefs concerning lifestyle requirements in obedience to God&#x27;s Word&quot; including Holy Living, Marriage, Sanctity of Human Life, Missions (Evangelism), Financial Stewardship (Tithing), and the &quot;Authority of Statement of Faith&quot; as a proper interpretation of the Bible but as subservient to it.

===Holiness Emphasis===
Despite the IFCA descending from Finished Work Pentecostalism of William Durham instead of Wesleyan Holiness, they put an emphasis on Biblical Holiness. The IFCA believes &quot;in the necessity of living a consistent life marked by obedience of God&#x27;s Word, holiness, and evidencing godly spiritual fruit&quot; and they give specific definitions for what they see as Biblical Marriage and Sexuality, speaking out against homosexuality, transgenderism, and gay marriage. Sister denominations such as the Christian Congregation in Brazil also focus on outward Holiness in dress and lack of beards, but the IFCA generally lacks this focus, instead detailing the avoidance of &quot;sinful pleasures, practices and associations.&quot; In earlier editions of their Articles of Faith, it contained a rare statement which is a belief to &quot;abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, and from things strangled,&quot; citing the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15. It remains on some websites affiliated with the IFCA. This statement dates to early debates in the denomination&#x27;s history where different leaders discussed whether or not the Council of Jerusalem regulations were currently binding to Christians. The Christian Congregation Movement and Assemblies of God in Italy, also founded by Louis Francescon and Italian-ancestry Pentecostals, likewise contain articles of faith related to the Jerusalem Council.

==Organization==
The IFCA is a Cooperative Fellowship of member congregations and ministries unified under their Articles of Faith and mutual cooperation. As a whole the IFCA operates under a presbyterian polity with an executive board composed of 13 offices and a general overseer. On the local level, churches hold a high level of autonomy (Congregationalist polity) and are &quot;free to adopt administrative rules and regulations.&quot; In the United States, IFCA churches are assigned to geographical districts, each with a district overseer. As of 2000, there were approximately 7,200 congregants in 96 member churches. By 2020, despite growth overseas, the number of member churches in the United States had dropped to 69 congregations. Presently there are 7 districts:
*Northwestern District (Western Pennsylvania and Ohio)
*Great Lakes District (Michigan, Illinois and Indiana)
*New England District (Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire)
*Eastern District (New Jersey, Connecticut, Southern New York and Eastern Pennsylvania)
*Niagara Mohawk District (Upstate New York)
*Southern District (South Carolina and Florida)
*West Coast District (California, though &quot;minimal&quot;)

While the majority of district members are physical church congregations, district fellowship members also include ministries focused on overseas activities which are headquartered from the United States. These include ministries which operate orphanages, Bible schools, and hospitals in other countries. The IFCA also operates a Bible college and seminary in Richmond Heights, Ohio, which offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in partnership with the SUM Bible College.

===Affiliates===
While based out of the United States, the IFCA is in fellowship/affiliation with ministries and groups internationally. This global structure includes churches, orphanages, Bible colleges, schools, and food programs. These fellowship members are geared towards a common goal, which includes the Great Commission of evangelism, and are united in certain doctrinal points. Below are some of the global statistics per region according to the IFCA&#x27;s global missions department:
*Africa: 6,600 members in 122 churches
*South Asia: 185,100 members in 1,685 churches
*Australia &amp; Southeast Asia: 2,500 members in 120 churches
*Europe: 10,455 members in 104 churches

While not in official fellowship, the IFCA has strong cooperative ties with other Pentecostal groups also founded by Louis Francescon such as the Assemblies of God in Italy and the Christian Congregation in Brazil.

==Associations==
The IFCA holds to interdenominational ecumenism with Christian groups of &quot;like precious faith&quot;. They are members of the National Association of Evangelicals and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America.

<text>The 1892 United Kingdom general election was held from 4 to 26 July 1892. It saw the Conservatives, led by Lord Salisbury again win the greatest number of seats, but no longer a majority as William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals won 80 more seats than in the 1886 general election. The Liberal Unionists who had previously supported the Conservative government saw their vote and seat numbers go down.

Despite being split between Parnellite and anti-Parnellite factions, the Irish Nationalist vote held up well. As the Liberals did not have a majority on their own, Salisbury refused to resign on hearing the election results and waited to be defeated in a vote of no confidence on 11 August. Gladstone formed a minority government dependent on Irish Nationalist support.

The Liberals had engaged in failed attempts at reunification between 1886 and 1887. Gladstone however was able to retain control of much of the Liberal party machinery, particularly the National Liberal Federation. Gladstone used the annual NLF meetings as a platform to consolidate various Liberal causes, particularly the Newcastle meeting of 1891, which gave its name to the radical Newcastle Programme. This programme placed Irish Home Rule first, followed by Welsh and Scottish disestablishment, reduction in factory work hours, free education, electoral reform, land reform, reform or abolition of the House of Lords, and the removal of duties on basic foods. This programme would later be disowned by the party leadership following the Liberal defeat in the 1895 election.

<text>The 1886 United Kingdom general election took place from 1 to 27 July 1886, following the defeat of the Government of Ireland Bill 1886. It resulted in a major reversal of the results of the 1885 election as the Conservatives, led by Lord Salisbury, were joined in an electoral pact with the breakaway Unionist wing of the Liberals led by Lord Hartington (later the Duke of Devonshire) and Joseph Chamberlain. The new Liberal Unionist party elected 77 members and gave the Conservatives their parliamentary majority, but did not join them in a formal coalition.

William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals, who supported the Irish Home Rule movement, and their sometimes allies the Irish Parliamentary Party, led by Charles Stewart Parnell, were placed a distant second. The split in the Liberal Party ended the period of Liberal dominance. They had held power for 18 of the 27 years since 1859 and won five of the six elections held during that time, but would only be in power for three of the next nineteen years. The political realignment resulting from the Liberal Unionist split also meant that between this election and the end of the Second World War, only one election (in 1906) would result in a party other than the Conservatives forming a majority government (though the Liberals, and later the Labour Party, would form minority governments with support from smaller parties). This was also the first election since the 1841 election in which the Conservatives won a plurality or majority of the popular vote. They would ultimately win at least a plurality of the popular vote in every general election until 1945, again with the exception of the 1906 election.
==Electoral system==
Most of the MPs were elected through first-past-the-post voting in single-member district.
Conversely, 54 MPs were elected in two-seat districts by the use of plurality block voting, where each voter could cast up to two votes.

<text>A key is a component of a musical instrument, the purpose and function of which depends on the instrument. However, the term is most often used in the context of keyboard instruments, in which case it refers to the exterior part of the instrument that the player physically interacts in the process of sound production.

On instruments equipped with tuning machines such as guitars or mandolins, a key is part of a tuning machine. It is a worm gear with a key shaped end used to turn a cog, which, in turn, is attached to a post which winds the string. The key is used to make pitch adjustments to a string.

With other instruments, zithers and drums, for example, a key is essentially a small wrench used to turn a tuning machine or lug.

On woodwind instruments such as a flute or saxophone, keys are finger operated levers used to open or close tone holes, the operation of which effectively shortens or lengthens the resonating tube of the instrument. By doing so, the player is able to physically manipulate the range of resonating sound frequencies capable of being produced by the tubes that has been altered into various “effective” lengths, based on specific key configurations. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various mechanical valves. However, rather than directed influencing the paths the airflow takes within the same tube, the configuration of these valves instead determines through which of the numerous separate organ pipes, each of which tuned for a specific note, the air stream flows through. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds.

On other keyboard instruments, a key may be a lever which mechanically triggers a hammer to strike a group of strings, as on a piano, or an electric switch which energizes an audio oscillator as on an electronic organ or a synthesizer. 

Piano keys have often been made from ivory over the instrument&#x27;s history, such that a common phrase for playing the piano has been to &quot;tickle the ivories&quot;.

<text>The 1885 United Kingdom general election was held from 24 November to 18 December 1885. The first general election after an extension of the franchise and redistribution of seats, it saw the Liberals lose their majority.

The election saw the Liberals, led by William Gladstone, win the most seats, but not an overall majority, so a minority government was necessary. The Irish Nationalists held the balance of power between the Liberals and the Conservatives who sat with a large number of allied Unionist MPs (their name referred to their support for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland). The pressure of minority government status exacerbated divisions within the Liberals over Irish Home Rule. This led to a Liberal split that caused another general election the following year.

The 1885 election saw the first socialist party participate, with the Social Democratic Federation led by H. M. Hyndman standing three candidates. None were elected.

<text>The 1880 United Kingdom general election was held from 31 March to 27 April 1880. It saw the Liberal opposition triumph with 352 seats.

Its intense rhetoric was led by the Midlothian campaign of the Liberals, particularly the fierce oratory of Liberal leader William Gladstone. He vehemently attacked the foreign policy of the government of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, as utterly immoral. The endeavours of the Disraeli government in Africa, India, Afghanistan and Europe, which were only partially successful and often accompanied by early, humiliating defeats, gave a good deal of fodder to Gladstone for his attacks. Further, Disraeli&#x27;s favoured dealing with the Turks, who were responsible for horrendous atrocities against Balkan Christians also laid him open to religious attacks, especially in Gladstone&#x27;s pamphlet “The Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East” (1876). Gladstone&#x27;s campaign was a synthesis of the two approaches in a populist manner adapted towards liberalism.

Liberals secured one of their largest-ever majorities, leaving the Conservatives a distant second. As a result of the campaign, the Liberal Commons leader, Lord Hartington and that in the Lords, Lord Granville, stood back in favour of Gladstone, who thus became Prime Minister a second time. It was the last general election in which any party other than the Conservatives won a majority of the total votes (rather than a mere plurality), as well the only time (except for 1906) until 1945 in which any party other than the Conservatives won a majority.
==Issues==
The Conservative government was doomed by the poor condition of the British economy and the vulnerability of its foreign policy to moralistic attacks by the Liberals. William Gladstone, appealing to moralistic evangelicals, led the attack on the foreign policy of Benjamin Disraeli (now known as Lord Beaconsfield) as immoral. Historian Paul Smith paraphrases the rhetorical tone which focused on attacking &quot;Beaconsfieldism&quot; (in Smith&#x27;s words) as a:

Smith notes that there was indeed some substance to the allegations, but: &quot;Most of this was partisan extravaganza, worthy of its target&#x27;s own excursions against the Whigs.&quot;
Disraeli himself was now the Earl of Beaconsfield in the House of Lords, and custom did not allow peers to campaign; this denuded the Conservatives of other important figures such as the Marquess of Salisbury and Lord Cranbrook, and the party was unable to deal effectively with the rhetorical onslaught. Although he had improved the organisation of the Conservative Party, Disraeli was firmly based in the rural gentry, and had little contact with or understanding of the urban middle class that was increasingly dominating his party.

Besides their trouble with foreign policy issues, it was even more important that the Conservatives were unable to effectively defend their economic record on the home front. The 1870s coincided with a long-term global depression caused by the collapse of the worldwide railway boom of the 1870s which previously had been so profitable to Britain. The stress was growing by the late 1870s; prices fell, profits fell, employment fell, and there was downward pressure on wage rates that caused much hardship among the industrial working class. The free trade system supported by both parties made Britain defenceless against the flood of cheap wheat from North America, which was exacerbated by the worst harvest of the century in Britain in 1879. The party in power got the blame, and Liberals repeatedly emphasised the growing budget deficit as a measure of bad stewardship. In the election itself, Disraeli&#x27;s party lost heavily up and down the line, especially in Scotland and Ireland, and in the urban boroughs. His Conservative strength fell from 351 to 238, while the Liberals jumped from 250 to 353. Disraeli resigned on 21 April 1880.

<text>The 1874 United Kingdom general election was held between 31 January to 17 February 1874. The Conservatives under the leadership of Benjamin Disraeli won a decisive victory against the incumbent governing Liberals under William Ewart Gladstone, even though the Liberals achieved more votes than the Conservatives, largely caused by the number of uncontested Conservative-held seats.

The election saw the Irish of the Home Rule League become a significant third party in Parliament, with 60 of 101 of the seats for Ireland. This was the first UK election to use a secret ballot following the 1872 Secret Ballot Act. The Irish Nationalist gains could well be attributed to the effects of the Secret Ballot Act, as tenants faced less of a threat of eviction if they voted against the wishes of their landlords. Also in this election, the first two working-class MPs were elected: Alexander MacDonald and Thomas Burt, both members of the Miners&#x27; Union, were elected as Liberal-Labour (Lib–Lab) MPs in Stafford and Morpeth, respectively. The 1867 Reform Act eroded the legislative power of the rural gentry. The 1874 election, especially in Ireland, saw great landowners losing their county seats to tenant farmers.

This is the only time, since the introduction of the secret ballot, that a UK party has been defeated despite receiving an absolute majority of the popular vote. This was primarily because over 100 Conservative candidates were elected unopposed. This meant no votes were cast in those 100 places where the Conservative candidates were anticipated to be popular; in the seats where Liberal candidates did stand, they polled a high proportion of the vote on average.

The election saw 652 MPs elected, six fewer than at the previous election. Following allegations of corruption, the Conservative-held constituencies of Beverley and Sligo Borough, and the Liberal-held constituencies of Bridgwater and Cashel, had been abolished.

<text>Definitely Not the Opera (or simply DNTO) was a magazine-style radio program focusing on aspects of pop culture and storytelling, that aired on CBC Radio One on Saturday afternoons from 1994 until 2016. The show&#x27;s running time varied over the years, though it ran for a full hour in its final year. An abridged version of each program is available for download as a weekly podcast, with an abbreviated sister edition called Your DNTO, airing on Tuesday afternoons and featuring listener-submitted content.

&quot;DNTO&quot; is also syndicated to some public radio stations in the United States.

==History==
In 1993, the CBC launched Brand X as a Saturday afternoon replacement for &quot;Canada Live&quot;, which itself was a short-lived successor to Jack Farr&#x27;s &quot;The Radio Show&quot;. &quot;Brand X&quot; also took over the youth and pop culture mandate from the network&#x27;s recently cancelled &quot;Prime Time&quot;. Initially airing with a stable of regular contributors but no single host, &quot;Brand X&quot; premiered on June 26, 1993 and was co-created by André LaRivière and Bill Smith.

After a year under the &quot;Brand X&quot; title and format, the show was revamped by Bill Smith and became &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot; in September 1994. The new name was chosen because the program aired opposite &quot;Saturday Afternoon at the Opera&quot; on CBC Stereo. Nora Young, one of &quot;Brand X&quot;&#x27;s contributors, was named as the new show&#x27;s host, and held the position until September 2002, when musician and former MuchMusic VJ Sook-Yin Lee took over.

&quot;DNTO&quot; varied in length over the course of its run. Initially running four hours, it was reduced to two hours by the late 2000s, then one hour for its final season (2015–2016).

On May 2, 2016, CBC announced that &quot;DNTO&quot; would be discontinued after 22 seasons. The final episode, recorded before a live audience at CBC Radio&#x27;s Winnipeg studios and aired on May 14, 2016, included special guests and highlights from the show&#x27;s 22-year run. Lee continued with the CBC as host of the summer series &quot;Sleepover&quot;.

==Features==
When Young was its host, &quot;DNTO&quot; was a magazine-style show focusing on popular entertainment, containing features on pop-culture phenomena, movie, video and music reviews, as well as music and concert segments, comedy sketches by Elyse Friedman, and biographical features on entertainment and pop culture figures. Contributors during this era included Ross Porter (who sometimes filled in as host), Rex Murphy, Mary Walsh, Laurie Brown and Guy Maddin.

With Lee in the host chair, &quot;DNTO&quot; would gradually evolve in scope, transitioning by the second half of the 2000s from its former pop culture and entertainment focus to one that emphasized light documentary and storytelling. Each episode&#x27;s wide-ranging focus would also evolve so that the segments would pertain to a specific aspect of modern life. For example, an episode might have a thematic focus on etiquette, fear, listening, interpersonal conflict, food or small talk. On-location profiles would also be among the episode themes, including a post-Hurricane Katrina visit to New Orleans in 2006 and a 2015 visit to the northern Manitoba community of Pukatawagan. Celebrity and expert interviews would remain, as would the music segments, but they would also focus on the episode&#x27;s theme rather than being strictly promotional in nature. Remote segments and on-the-street interviews tying to the episode theme would also be included, along with first-person audio essays. A rotating stable of regular contributors – including comedian Candy Palmater, journalist Kaj Hasselriis and CBC Radio personalities Acey Rowe, Jane Farrow and Grant Lawrence – would also contribute their own themed segments.

In part to allow listeners to share their own related stories, a weekday offshoot of &quot;DNTO&quot; was established. Titled &quot;Your DNTO&quot;, the show aired on Tuesday afternoons. While the weekday show would sometimes include content repeated from the weekend show, the weekday show&#x27;s primary emphasis was dedicated to airing stories submitted by listeners, who could record and upload their own contributions for possible broadcast to the &quot;DNTO&quot; website.

<text>Bruno Nicolini(born 16 June 1969), better known by his stage name Bénabar, is a French songwriter and singer, who could be compared to Vincent Delerm and other singers from his generation. As many of them he was influenced by Georges Brassens, Renaud, Jacques Higelin and also Tom Waits. His songs describe day-to-day life events with humour and a tender cynicism. His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French &quot;fanfare&quot; (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern &quot;&quot;guinche&quot; (slang for &quot;guinguette&quot;&quot;) appreciated a lot by Bobos among others.

==Biography==

Bénabar began his career in the cinema, working as an assistant on &quot;Le Brasier&quot; (1991) before directing three short subjects: &quot;Nada Lezard&quot; (1991), &quot;José Jeannette&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sursum corda&quot; (1994). He then turned to music, working for some time with his friend Patchol who gave him his nickname (Bénabar being the &quot;verlan&quot; of Barnabé, the name he was using on stage). With &quot;Les associés&quot; he sang for several years in small places in France, Belgium, and Switzerland before the release of &quot;Bénabar&quot; (2001), which raised his profile sufficiently to make him the opening act for Henri Salvador. He was nominated as a Revelation for the &quot;Victoires de la musique 2003&quot; but did not win it. In 2004, after the successful release of &quot;Les risques du métier&quot;, he won the award for &quot;album &quot;chanson/variété&quot; of the year&quot;. His next album &quot;Reprise des négociations&quot; sold better than the previous ones: according to &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Bénabar reached number 4 for CD sales in France, with 2.18 million euros sales in 2006. In 2007 he won the awards for &quot;Male group or artist of the year&quot; and &quot;original song of the year&quot; (for &quot;Le dîner&quot;).

==Personal life==

He has two brothers named Patrick and Sébastien. He has a son born in 2004 named Manolo and a daughter born in 2009.

==Philanthropy==
Bénabar has been a member of the Les Enfoirés charity ensemble since 2007.

<doc id="443227" wikidata="Q373212" url="?curid=443227" title="Simon Snyder">
<text>Simon Snyder (November 5, 1759November 9, 1819) was the third governor of Pennsylvania, serving three terms from 1808 to 1817. He led the state through the War of 1812.

Born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Snyder established a gristmill in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. He was elected as a justice of the peace and served as a delegate to the 1790 Pennsylvania constitutional convention. He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1797 to 1807, and won election as Speaker of the House. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he ran for governor in 1805 but was defeated by Thomas McKean.

He won election as governor in 1808 and won re-election in 1811 and 1814. He was the first governor elected in Pennsylvania who was of German descent, and was also the first governor of Pennsylvania to issue a Thanksgiving Proclamation.

Snyder presided over the establishment of Harrisburg as the state capital. He strongly supported the War of 1812 and was a candidate for the Democratic-Republican vice presidential nomination in the 1816 presidential election. Following the conclusion of his third term, he was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 9th Senatorial District but died of typhoid fever in 1819 before he began to serve.

==Early life==
Snyder was born on November 5, 1759, in Lancaster in the Province of Pennsylvania. His parents were ethnic Germans. Anton Schneider and Agnesa Krämer (née Knippenberg) Schneider reared him in the Lutheran church. His father was a mechanic, and had immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1744 from Germany, part of a large wave of immigrants from there in the 18th century. The family was for many years associated with the Moravian Church in Lancaster, consistently listed in membership catalogs of the congregation during the 1760s and 1770s. After his father&#x27;s death in 1774, when Snyder was 15, the youth became apprenticed to a tanner in York, Pennsylvania, in order to learn a trade. He used his limited leisure time for study.

In 1784, Snyder moved to Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, where he opened a gristmill. He was elected as justice of the peace, serving for twelve years. His residence still stands at 121 North Market Street and is now known as the Gov. Simon Snyder Mansion; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Marriage and family==
In 1790, Snyder married Elizabeth Michael. They had two children. Elizabeth died in 1794 and her widowed husband was left to raise their young children.

Snyder quickly remarried, as was common in those days, to Catherine Antes on July 12, 1796. He and his second wife had another five children together. Catherine Antes Snyder died on March 15, 1810, in Selinsgrove and is buried at the First Reformed Church Memorial Garden in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In 1814, Snyder married Mary Slough Scott, a widow. They remained together until his death in 1819.

==Early political career==
Snyder began his political career as a justice of the peace. In 1789 he was elected as a delegate to revise Pennsylvania&#x27;s state constitution in 1790. Following this, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving from 1797 to 1807. During this time, he was elected three times as the speaker of the House: in 1804, in 1805, and in 1807.

While in the House, Snyder sought the governorship as a Jeffersonian Democrat in 1805, but he was defeated by the incumbent governor Thomas McKean, also a Jeffersonian Democrat. A lack of public recognition in comparison to the incumbent contributed to Snyder&#x27;s losing the election.

Snyder sponsored the &quot;Hundred-dollar Act,&quot; which embodied the arbitration principle. It provided for the trial of civil cases only when the amount in question was more than one hundred dollars.

==Governorship==
In 1808, the Jeffersonians united behind Snyder, and he won the election for governor. Snyder ran again in the succeeding elections of 1811 and 1814, easily winning reelection against the Federalist candidates William Tilghman, Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Isaac Wayne, respectively. In 1812, Snyder suggested relocating the capital city of the commonwealth from Lancaster to its present, more central location in Harrisburg. The General Assembly approved this proposal.

==War of 1812==
Snyder supported the War of 1812 wholeheartedly despite Federalist cries of dissent. With the United States emerging undefeated at the end of the war, this criticism subsided. After the war, John Binns supported elevating Snyder to consideration for the vice-presidential slot on President James Madison&#x27;s ticket, but later the governor was disregarded as a possible candidate.

==Post governorship==
Snyder was elected by the people of Union County, Pennsylvania, to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1818. He died from typhoid fever in Selinsgrove on November 9, 1819, before taking office. He is buried at the Old Lutheran Cemetery in Selinsgrove.

==Legacy and honors==
*His gravesite at Old Lutheran Cemetery of Sharon Lutheran Church in Selinsgrove is marked by a monument topped by his bust.
*His house at Selinsgrove, known as the Gov. Simon Snyder Mansion, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is now a brewery.
*&quot;Sy Snyder&quot; is a pseudonym for the publishers of PoliticsPA, a website dedicated to Pennsylvania politics.
*Snyder County, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.
*Snyder Avenue in South Philadelphia, is named in his honor.
*A residence hall at Penn State University is named in his honor.

<doc id="443228" wikidata="Q163261" url="?curid=443228" title="Acrosome reaction">
<text>For fertilization to happen between a sperm and egg cell, a sperm must first fuse with the plasma membrane and then penetrate the female egg cell to fertilize it. While the fusion of the sperm cell with the egg cell&#x27;s plasma membrane is relatively straightforward, penetrating the egg&#x27;s protective layers, such as the zona pellucida, presents a significant challenge. Therefore, sperm cells go through a process known as the acrosome reaction, which is the reaction that occurs in the acrosome of the sperm as it approaches the egg.

The acrosome is a membrane-bound organelle of Golgi apparatus origin, commonly located at the tip of the head of the mature spermatozoon, which contains a variety of enzymes and antigens required for fertilization. It was once called &quot;apical body&quot; because of its location, or &quot;perforatorium&quot; on the assumption that it might assist the spermatozoon boring into the egg.

As the sperm approaches the zona pellucida of the egg, which is necessary for initiating the acrosome reaction, the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm&#x27;s head, exposing the contents of the acrosome. The contents include surface antigens necessary for binding to the egg&#x27;s cell membrane, and numerous enzymes which are responsible for breaking through the egg&#x27;s tough coating and allowing fertilization to occur.

== Variations among species ==
There are considerable species variations in the morphology and consequences of the acrosome reaction. In several species, the trigger for the acrosome reaction has been identified in a layer that surrounds the egg.

=== Echinoderms ===
In some lower animal species, a protuberance (the acrosomal process) forms at the apex of the sperm head, supported by a core of actin microfilaments. The membrane at the tip of the acrosomal process fuses with the egg&#x27;s plasma membrane.

In some echinoderms, including starfish and sea urchins, a significant portion of the exposed acrosomal content contains a protein that temporarily holds the sperm on the egg&#x27;s surface.

=== Mammals ===
In mammals, the acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase and acrosin; their role in fertilization is not yet clear. The acrosomal reaction is initiated when sperm comes into contact with the oocyte&#x27;s zona pellucida. Upon coming into contact with the zona pellucida, the acrosomal enzymes begin to dissolve, and the actin filament comes into contact with the zona pellucida. Once the two meet, a calcium influx occurs, causing a signaling cascade. The cortical granules inside the oocyte then fuse to the outer membrane, and a quick fast block reaction occurs.

Furthermore, the cortical granules inside the oocyte fuse with the outer membrane, initiating a rapid block reaction. This reaction alters a patch of pre-existing sperm plasma membrane, facilitating fusion with the egg plasma membrane.

A sperm penetration assay includes an acrosome reaction test that assesses how well a sperm can perform during the fertilization process. Sperm that are unable to go through the acrosome reaction properly will not be able to fertilize an egg. However, this problem only occurs in about 5% of men that have the test done. This test is rather expensive and provides limited information on a man&#x27;s fertility.

In other cases, such as in the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, premature acrosome reactions have been found to cause increased motility in aggregates of spermatozoa promoting fertilization.

== The process ==
The acrosomal reaction typically occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube, the site of fertilization, when the sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte. Prior events prepare for the acrosome reaction. The sperm cell undergoes a series of changes, including acquiring a &quot;hyperactive motility pattern&quot; where its flagellum produces vigorous whip-like movements propelling the sperm through the cervical canal and uterine cavity until it reaches the isthmus of the fallopian tube. Various mechanisms, including chemotaxis, aid the sperm in approaching the ovum in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. Once in close proximity, glycoproteins on the outer surface of the sperm bind with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of the ovum.

Sperm that fail to initiate the acrosome reaction prior to reaching to the zona pellucida are unable to penetrate the zona pellucida. Since the acrosome reaction has already occurred, sperm are then able to penetrate the zona pellucida due to mechanical action of the tail, not because of the acrosome reaction itself.

The first stage is the penetration of corona radiata, by releasing hyaluronidase from the acrosome to digest cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte and exposing acrosin attached to the inner membrane of the sperm. The cumulus cells are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid, and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows. The acrosome reaction must occur before the sperm cell reaches the zona pellucida.

Acrosin, once exposed, digests the zona pellucida and membrane of the oocyte, allowing for penetration to happen. Part of the sperm&#x27;s cell membrane then fuses with the egg cell&#x27;s membrane, and the contents of the head sink into the egg. In the mouse, it has been demonstrated that ZP3, one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida, binds to a partner molecule (to the β1,4-galactosyl transferase receptors) on the sperm. This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing. The zona pellucida also releases Ca granules to prevent other sperm from binding. There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the acrosome to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. A similar mechanism likely occurs in other mammals, but the diversity of zona proteins across species means that the relevant protein and receptor may differ.

More recent scientific evidence demonstrates that the acrosomal reaction is necessary to expose a protein called IZUMO1 on the sperm: without the reaction, sperm can still penetrate through the zona pellucida to the egg membrane, but cannot fuse. As seen in mouse studies, IZUMO1 binds to the oocyte protein JUNO and once bound together, the sperm and the egg fuse together to form two pronuclei. These pronuclei supply the zygote with the genetic material necessary for the formation of an embryo. Additionally, once the fusion of the sperm and oocyte is complete, phospholipase C zeta is released from the sperm.

Following penetration and fusion, if all is normally occurring, the process of egg-activation occurs facilitated by proteins like phospholipase C zeta, and the oocyte is said to have become activated. This is thought to be induced by a specific protein phospholipase c zeta. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. To prevent polyspermy and minimize the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg&#x27;s cell membranes render them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg (such as the rapid loss of JUNO).

== Spontaneous acrosome reaction ==
Spermatozoa can initiate the acrosomal reaction well in advance of reaching the zona pellucida, as well as &quot;in vitro&quot; in an appropriate culture medium. This is referred to as spontaneous acrosome reaction (SAR).

It is now known that, in a certain sense, this phenomenon is physiologically normal across mammalian species. The acrosome reaction is induced by passage through the cumulus oophorus cells, mediated by the hormones they secrete (such as progesterone, LPA, LPC).

However, the physiological role of truly spontaneous acrosomal reaction, occurring well before this point in the female reproductive tract, or &quot;in vitro&quot;, is a separate phenomenon.

In mice, it has been well established as physiologically normal and common. Mouse sperm which have undergone fully spontaneous acrosome reaction are still able to fertilize eggs. Furthermore, the rate of spontaneous acrosome reaction is higher in more promiscuous species such as &quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot;, which face a high level of sperm competition.

In humans, on the other hand, it remains disputed where exactly the acrosome reaction is initiated in physiological fertilization, due to experimental constraints (for example, animal studies may make use of transgenic mice with fluorescent sperm, while human studies cannot).

Studies have been done with the intent of linking &quot;in vitro&quot; SAR rate in human sperm to sperm quality and fertilization rate, but as of 2018, the overall results have been mixed, and do not seem to be clinically informative.

== In &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization ==
When using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for IVF, the implantation rate is higher in oocytes injected with spermatozoa that have undergone acrosome reaction (~40%) vs. those injected with nonreacted spermatozoa (~10%). The implantation rate is ~25% in when injected with both reacted and nonreacted spermatozoa. The delivery rate per cycle follows the same trend.

The acrosome reaction can be stimulated in vitro by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally, such as progesterone or follicular fluid, as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187.

===Assessment===
Birefringence microscopy, flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy can be used for assessing the shedding of the acrosome or &quot;acrosome reaction&quot; of a sperm sample. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC-PNA, FITC-PSA, FITC-ConA, or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC-CD46. The antibodies/lectins have a high specificity for different parts of the acrosomal region, and will only bind to a specific site (acrosomal content/ inner/outer membrane). If bound to a fluorescent molecule, regions where these probes have bound can be visualised. Sperm cells with artificially induced acrosome reactions may serve as positive controls.

For fluorescence microscopy, a smear of washed sperm cells is made, air-dried, permeabilized, and then stained. Such a slide is then viewed under the light of a wavelength that will cause the probe to fluoresce if it is bound to the acrosomal region. At least 200 cells are considered arbitrarily and classified as either acrosome intact (fluorescing bright green), or acrosome reacted (no probe present, or only on the equatorial region). It is then expressed as a percentage of the counted cells.

For assessment with flow cytometry, the washed cells are incubated with the chosen probe, possibly passed again, then sampled in a flow cytometer. After gating the cell population according to forward- and side-scatter, the resulting data can be analyzed (E.g. mean fluorescences compared). With this technique, a probe for viability such as propidium iodide (PI) could also be included in order to exclude dead cells from the acrosome assessment, since many sperm cells will spontaneously lose their acrosome when they die.

<text>Y ( ) is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

Y bears the shortest place name in France, and one of the shortest in the world. The inhabitants call themselves &quot;&quot;, from the Greek letter Upsilon (Υ), which looks like the letter Y.

==Geography==
Y is situated east of Amiens, at the junction of the D15 and D615 roads, in the far eastern side of the department.

==History==
The district belonged to the Y family from Vermandois.

The village was caught up in the First World War. It was decorated by Croix de guerre 1914-1918 on 15 December 1920. The Church of Saint-Médard was rebuilt in 1921 after the destruction caused by the First World War.

Since 2002, the commune has been part of the community of communes of the Pays Hamois, which succeeded the district of Ham, created in 1960. Then on 1 Jan 2017, Pays Hamois and that of the Pays Neslois, merged.

== Politics and administration ==
The commune is located in the Arrondissement of Péronne in the Somme department of northern France. Since 1958, the commune has elected deputies from Somme&#x27;s 5th constituency.

Since 1801, the commune has been a part of the Canton of Ham. During the 2014 cantonal redistribution in France, the boundaries of the canton were expanded from 19 to 67 communes.

=== List of mayors ===

==Population==
At the French Revolution the commune had 160 inhabitants; as of 2017 its legal population was 92 inhabitants.

<text>Starogard County (, ) is a unit of territorial administration and local government (powiat) in Pomeranian Voivodeship, northern Poland. The name is a combination of two terms: stari which is Slavic for &quot;old&quot; and gard which is Pomeranian language stands for &quot;town&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;fortified settlement&quot;. In this meaning, the term gard (also spelled as gôrd) is still being used in the only surviving dialect of the Pomeranian, Kashubian language. The county came into being on January 1, 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms passed in 1998. Its administrative seat and largest town is Starogard Gdański, which lies south of the regional capital Gdańsk. The county contains three other towns: Skarszewy, north-west of Starogard Gdański, Skórcz, south of Starogard Gdański, and Czarna Woda, south-west of Starogard Gdański. Starogard County is part of the area traditionally inhabited by the Kociewiacy ethnic group.

The county covers an area of . As of 2019 its total population is 127,676, out of which the population of Starogard Gdański is 47,775, that of Skarszewy is 6,994, that of Skórcz is 3,625, that of Czarna Woda is 2,786, and the rural population is 66,496.

<text>William Findlay (June 20, 1768November 12, 1846) was an American farmer, lawyer, and politician. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he served as the fourth governor of Pennsylvania from 1817 to 1820, and as a United States senator from 1821 to 1827. He was one of three Findlay brothers born and raised in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, on their family farm.

All became politicians, serving at national, state and local levels in Pennsylvania and Ohio in the early federal years. He sold Findlay Farm in 1823; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Biography==
William Findlay was born in Mercersburg in the Province of Pennsylvania on June 20, 1768, to Samuel Findlay and Jane (née Smith). He was the second of three sons, with older brother John Findlay and younger brother James Findlay. All three men became active in politics, serving at national, state and local levels.

Their grandfather Samuel Findlay (1711–1739) was the immigrant ancestor: he was born in County Londonderry in Ulster in 1711, and immigrated to the Province of Pennsylvania as a young man in 1730. He married there and he and his wife settled in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. He died there in 1739.

After receiving a common-school education, William Findlay became a farmer. He became active in politics as a Jeffersonian Democrat. He served as brigade inspector in the state militia, and studied law with an established firm (reading the law as an apprentice.) He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Franklintown, Pennsylvania.

==Political career==
Findlay was elected and served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1797 and 1804–1807. He served as state treasurer from 1807 to 1817.

In 1817, Findlay was nominated for the post of governor in the state&#x27;s first open convention. He was elected governor and served until 1820. According to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, in 1817 he emancipated the one slave he held and stated, &quot;The principles of slavery are repugnant to those of justice.&quot; He also asked state legislators to pass laws to severely punish slave catchers who attempted to capture Africans in Pennsylvania and enslave them.

He was the first governor to lead the state from Harrisburg, newly designated as the capital. He directed many of the functions of state government from his private home while the new capitol building was under construction.

He was defeated for re-election in 1820 by Joseph Hiester.

In 1821, Findlay was elected by the state legislature as a Democratic Republican (later Jacksonian Democrat) to the United States Senate. He was filling the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1821, because the legislature had failed to select a candidate on time. He served from December 10, 1821, to March 3, 1827. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1826. In the U.S. Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture (19th Congress).

Later, he was appointed as the fifth treasurer of the U.S. Mint. He served for more than a decade, from 1827 to 1841. He resigned due to illness.

He had sold the Findlay Farm in 1823 to Benjamin Jordan and Edward Crouch. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, significant in part because of the political careers of the three brothers.

He died in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and his remains were interred at Harrisburg Cemetery.

==Family==
He was the brother of United States Congressman John and United States Congressman and Cincinnati mayor James Findlay.

William Findlay married Nancy Irwin (1763–1824), who became Pennsylvania&#x27;s First Lady from 1817 to 1820. They had two children, Jane Findlay Shunk (1792–1878) and John King Findlay. Nancy Irwin Findlay died on July 27, 1824, and is buried in Harrisburg Cemetery.

William Findlay&#x27;s son, John King Findlay (born near Mercersburg, May 12, 1803; died in Spring Lake, New Jersey, September 13, 1885), was a noted jurist. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1824 and was assigned to the 1st Artillery of the U.S. Army. He was the assistant professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology at West Point from August 29 until November 4, 1824, of geography, history, and ethics until April 17, 1825, and was on topographical duty until May 13, 1828, when he resigned. In 1831, he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar. He was recorder of Lancaster in 1841–1845, judge of the Philadelphia District Court 1845–1851, and president of the 3rd Judicial District of Pennsylvania in 1857–1862. After this he practiced law in Philadelphia. John King Findlay was a captain of militia 1840–1845 and 1852–1856. He published an enlarged edition of Archbold&#x27;s &quot;Law of Nisi Prius&quot; (2 vols., Philadelphia, 1852).

William Findlay&#x27;s daughter, Jane Findlay, married Francis R. Shunk, the 10th Governor of Pennsylvania. She held the position of First Lady of Pennsylvania from 1845 to 1848.

==Legacy==
Findlay Township in Western Pennsylvania and Findlay Commons on the campus of Penn State University are both named for Governor Findlay.

<text>In physics, a covariant transformation is a rule that specifies how certain entities, such as vectors or tensors, change under a change of basis. The transformation that describes the new basis vectors as a linear combination of the old basis vectors is &quot;defined&quot; as a covariant transformation. Conventionally, indices identifying the basis vectors are placed as lower indices and so are all entities that transform in the same way. The inverse of a covariant transformation is a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] transformation. Whenever a vector should be &quot;invariant&quot; under a change of basis, that is to say it should represent the same geometrical or physical object having the same magnitude and direction as before, its &quot;components&quot; must transform according to the contravariant rule. Conventionally, indices identifying the components of a vector are placed as upper indices and so are all indices of entities that transform in the same way. The sum over pairwise matching indices of a product with the same lower and upper indices is invariant under a transformation.

A vector itself is a geometrical quantity, in principle, independent (invariant) of the chosen basis. A vector v is given, say, in components &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; on a chosen basis e&quot;i&quot;. On another basis, say e′&quot;j&quot;, the same vector v has different components &quot;v&quot;′&quot;j&quot; and
formula_1
As a vector, v should be invariant to the chosen coordinate system and independent of any chosen basis, i.e. its &quot;real world&quot; direction and magnitude should appear the same regardless of the basis vectors. If we perform a change of basis by transforming the vectors e&quot;i&quot; into the basis vectors e′&quot;j&quot;, we must also ensure that the components &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; transform into the new components &quot;v&quot;′&quot;j&quot; to compensate.

The needed transformation of v is called the contravariant transformation rule.


In the shown example, a vector formula_2 is described by two different coordinate systems: a rectangular coordinate system (the black grid), and a radial coordinate system (the red grid). Basis vectors have been chosen for both coordinate systems: ex and ey for the rectangular coordinate system, and er and eφ for the radial coordinate system. The radial basis vectors er and eφ appear rotated anticlockwise with respect to the rectangular basis vectors ex and ey. The covariant transformation, performed to the basis vectors, is thus an anticlockwise rotation, rotating from the first basis vectors to the second basis vectors.

The coordinates of v must be transformed into the new coordinate system, but the vector v itself, as a mathematical object, remains independent of the basis chosen, appearing to point in the same direction and with the same magnitude, invariant to the change of coordinates. The contravariant transformation ensures this, by compensating for the rotation between the different bases. If we view v from the context of the radial coordinate system, it appears to be rotated more clockwise from the basis vectors er and eφ. compared to how it appeared relative to the rectangular basis vectors ex and ey. Thus, the needed contravariant transformation to v in this example is a clockwise rotation.

==Examples of covariant transformation==
===The derivative of a function transforms covariantly===
The explicit form of a covariant transformation is best introduced with the transformation properties of the derivative of a function. Consider a scalar function &quot;f&quot; (like the temperature at a location in a space) defined on a set of points &quot;p&quot;, identifiable in a given coordinate system formula_3 (such a collection is called a manifold). If we adopt a new coordinates system formula_4 then for each &quot;i&quot;, the original coordinate formula_5 can be expressed as a function of the new coordinates, so formula_6 One can express the derivative of &quot;f&quot; in old coordinates in terms of the new coordinates, using the chain rule of the derivative, as
:formula_7

This is the explicit form of the covariant transformation rule. The notation of a normal derivative with respect to the coordinates sometimes uses a comma, as follows
:formula_8
where the index &quot;i&quot; is placed as a lower index, because of the covariant transformation.

===Basis vectors transform covariantly===
A vector can be expressed in terms of basis vectors. For a certain coordinate system, we can choose the vectors tangent to the coordinate grid. This basis is called the coordinate basis.

To illustrate the transformation properties, consider again the set of points &quot;p&quot;, identifiable in a given coordinate system formula_9 where formula_10 (manifold). A scalar function &quot;f&quot;, that assigns a real number to every point &quot;p&quot; in this space, is a function of the coordinates formula_11. A curve is a one-parameter collection of points &quot;c&quot;, say with curve parameter λ, &quot;c&quot;(λ). A tangent vector v to the curve is the derivative formula_12 along the curve with the derivative taken at the point &quot;p&quot; under consideration. Note that we can see the tangent vector v as an operator (the directional derivative) which can be applied to a function
:formula_13

The parallel between the tangent vector and the operator can also be worked out in coordinates
:formula_14

or in terms of operators formula_15 
:formula_16
where we have written formula_17, the tangent vectors to the curves which are simply the coordinate grid itself.

If we adopt a new coordinates system formula_18 then for each &quot;i&quot;, the old coordinate formula_19 can be expressed as function of the new system, so formula_20
Let formula_21 be the basis, tangent vectors in this new coordinates system. We can express formula_22 in the new system by applying the chain rule on &quot;x&quot;. As a function of coordinates we find the following transformation
:formula_23
which indeed is the same as the covariant transformation for the derivative of a function.

==Contravariant transformation==

The &quot;components&quot; of a (tangent) vector transform in a different way, called contravariant transformation. Consider a tangent vector v and call its components formula_24 on a basis formula_22. On another basis formula_26 we call the components formula_27, so
:formula_28
in which 
:formula_29

If we express the new components in terms of the old ones, then
:formula_30
This is the explicit form of a transformation called the contravariant transformation and we note that it is different and just the inverse of the covariant rule. In order to distinguish them from the covariant (tangent) vectors, the index is placed on top.

===Basis differential forms transform contravariantly===

An example of a contravariant transformation is given by a differential form &quot;df&quot;. For &quot;f&quot; as a function of coordinates formula_9, &quot;df&quot; can be expressed in terms of the basis formula_32. The differentials &quot;dx&quot; transform according to the contravariant rule since
:formula_33

==Dual properties==

Entities that transform covariantly (like basis vectors) and the ones that transform contravariantly (like components of a vector and differential forms) are &quot;almost the same&quot; and yet they are different. They have &quot;dual&quot; properties.
What is behind this, is mathematically known as the dual space that always goes together with a given linear vector space.

Take any vector space T. A function &quot;f&quot; on T is called linear if, for any vectors v, w and scalar α:
:formula_34

A simple example is the function which assigns a vector the value of one of its components (called a &quot;projection function&quot;). It has a vector as argument and assigns a real number, the value of a component.

All such &quot;scalar-valued&quot; linear functions together form a vector space, called the dual space of T. The sum &quot;f+g&quot; is again a linear function for linear &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, and the same holds for scalar multiplication α&quot;f&quot;.

Given a basis formula_22 for T, we can define a basis, called the dual basis for the dual space in a natural way by taking the set of linear functions mentioned above: the projection functions. Each projection function (indexed by ω) produces the number 1 when applied to one of the basis vectors formula_22. For example, formula_37 gives a 1 on formula_38 and zero elsewhere. Applying this linear function formula_39 to a vector formula_40, gives (using its linearity)
:formula_41
so just the value of the first coordinate. For this reason it is called the projection function.

There are as many dual basis vectors formula_42 as there are basis vectors formula_22, so the dual space has the same dimension as the linear space itself. It is &quot;almost the same space&quot;, except that the elements of the dual space (called dual vectors) transform covariantly and the elements of the tangent vector space transform contravariantly.

Sometimes an extra notation is introduced where the real value of a linear function σ on a tangent vector u is given as
:formula_44
where formula_45 is a real number. This notation emphasizes the bilinear character of the form. It is linear in σ since that is a linear function and it is linear in u since that is an element of a vector space.

==Co- and contravariant tensor components==
===Without coordinates===
A tensor of type (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) may be defined as a real-valued multilinear function of &quot;r&quot; dual vectors and &quot;s&quot; vectors. Since vectors and dual vectors may be defined without dependence on a coordinate system, a tensor defined in this way is independent of the choice of a coordinate system.

The notation of a tensor is
:formula_46
for dual vectors (differential forms) &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot; and tangent vectors formula_47. In the second notation the distinction between vectors and differential forms is more obvious.

===With coordinates===

Because a tensor depends linearly on its arguments, it is completely determined if one knows the values on a basis formula_48 and formula_49
:formula_50
The numbers formula_51 are called the components of the tensor on the chosen basis.

If we choose another basis (which are a linear combination of the original basis), we can use the linear properties of the tensor and we will find that the tensor components in the upper indices transform as dual vectors (so contravariant), whereas the lower indices will transform as the basis of tangent vectors and are thus covariant. For a tensor of rank 2, we can verify that
:formula_52 covariant tensor
:formula_53 contravariant tensor

For a mixed co- and contravariant tensor of rank 2
:formula_54 mixed co- and contravariant tensor

<text>Ozric Tentacles are an English instrumental rock band, whose music incorporates elements from a diverse range of genres, including psychedelic rock, progressive rock, space rock, jazz fusion, electronic music, dub music, world music, and ambient music. Formed in Somerset in 1983, the band has released over 30 albums selling over a million copies worldwide despite never having signed to a major recording label. Throughout many line-up changes over the years, co-founder and guitarist Ed Wynne has remained the only original member of the band. The band is now credited as one of the major influences of the UK festival scene&#x27;s re-emergence, becoming particularly associated with the Glastonbury Festival and their handmade series of cassette releases, mostly sold at gigs and through a fan club.

==History==
=== The Cassette Years: 1983–1989 ===
Ozric Tentacles formed at the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1983, where the brothers Ed and Roly Wynne, along with drummer Nick &quot;Tig&quot; Van Gelder, bassist Eddie Myer and keyboardist Joie Hinton, performed as a group originally known as Bolshem People. After playing a six-hour jam session, the group was asked the name of their band, to which Ed Wynne replied, &quot;Ozric Tentacles&quot;. This name was one of the ideas, alongside &quot;Malcolm Segments,&quot; that had come up in a humorous conversation the band had about possible names for weird or alien breakfast cereals, hence the references to breakfast cereal in several album titles and covers. According to Wynne, &quot;&#x27;Ozric&#x27; is an old Viking name meaning &#x27;divine energy&#x27;, and &#x27;tentacles&#x27; is a silly word to put on the end&quot; (though in fact the name &quot;Osric&quot; comes from Old English; its elements mean &#x27;god&#x27; and &#x27;ruler&#x27;). The music scene in early-mid 1980s England allowed the band to make use of the re-emergence of free festivals to spread their music. Underground attention for their style of psychedelic rock – which makes prominent use of synthesizers, guitars, and samplers – allowed the band to surge. Notoriety spread mostly through the circulation of bootleg cassettes in the early years, which were welcomed by the band.

Gigs were often spontaneous during this period, for the lineup of the Ozrics was fluid. Shows often consisted of whoever was available to perform that night, due to the large number of people within the band. Granted there was power available, the band would often perform for a long time, sometimes until sunrise. It was not uncommon for members of the Ozrics to contribute to other musical collaborations. This practice has stayed with the band since its origination, and has allowed many members to come and go. In 1984, the first major lineup change occurred when second guitarist, Gavin Griffiths, left the band to form The Ulluators with fellow member Joie on keyboards.

The following year saw the first official cassette release of &quot;Erpsongs&quot;, which originally did not have track titles. This was possibly due to the album being a collection of songs recorded over three years. The next release, &quot;Tantric Obstacles&quot;, was released the same year and was intended to be more of an album. These early recordings were sometimes consisting solely of Ed Wynne playing the guitars, bass, and synths. All were recorded on a TEAC 4-track reel-to-reel at their attic studio in Rushmere, a converted farmhouse on Wimbledon Common in London. Some tracks on the cassette albums are performed with a drum machine, due to the studio lacking the necessary soundproofing. As a result of two official releases, the band&#x27;s popularity began to rise. This led to fans sending in blank cassettes with the intent of them being filled with live or unreleased music. The Ozrics obliged. Eventually, the demand became too much for an independent band to manage. This resulted in the third release, &quot;Live Ethereal Cereal&quot;, being a live compilation album of concerts between 1985 and 1986.

The band&#x27;s sound began to adopt a wider repertoire of music towards the end of 1986. This is especially illustrated on the fourth cassette release, &quot;There is Nothing&quot;. Songs now began to highlight a space rock vibe, with flavours of reggae. This, Wynne says, was not intended, but was the result of seeing the band Here &amp; Now perform live. The addition of more world music (through sampling and performing) was the result of Joie Hinton travelling to India and Ed to Thailand. There is also a noticeable rise in quality on the 1986 release of &quot;There is Nothing&quot;, due to the purchase of a new 8-track tape machine. This allowed for more synth overdubbing and real drum tracks.

More lineup changes than ever before occurred around this time, most notably the addition of the front-man, &quot;Jumping&quot; John Egan and the departure of keyboardist Tom Brooks in 1987. This created a sonic gap for Ed Wynne to fill. Coincidentally, earlier in the year, Ed was busy writing &quot;chill-out music&quot; with his side-project Nodens Ictus, so the idea of improving his own synth skills inspired him. Despite more changes and collaborations, they managed to release &quot;Sliding Gliding Worlds&quot; in 1988, shortly before drummer Tig Velder departed from the band and was replaced with 21-year-old Merv Pepler. 1989 saw the last cassette release by the band with &quot;The Bits Between the Bits&quot;, which was a collection of unreleased recordings between 1985 and 1989. This was a filler album while the band was preparing for its first vinyl release the same year.

=== Dovetail Records: 1989–present ===
In 1989, the band started their own label, Dovetail Records, with its first release, &quot;Pungent Effulgent&quot;. The album was originally released on vinyl, but saw a CD release the following year. The band also began to receive commercial recognition around this time, exemplified by their performance with the singer-songwriter Donovan at the Glastonbury Festival on 18 June 1989. This was followed by &quot;Erpland&quot; in 1990, a double album. Next year the band reached their first No. 1 recognition in the UK Indie Chart with their single &quot;Sploosh!&quot; from &quot;Strangeitude&quot;. In approximately 1992, the band decided to create their own recording studio to cut down on the costs of recording an album. The studio, coined &quot;The Mill&quot;, was refurbished from an old water mill.

By 1993, &quot;Jurassic Shift&quot; album reached the Top 20 of the UK Albums Chart and No. 1 in the UK Indie Chart, spending a total of three months in the charts.

The band has gone through myriad line-up changes, with Ed Wynne being the only constant presence since the beginning. In early years, many members left to pursue similar musical projects. Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the band has released albums with a prolific rate, continues to tour extensively and has maintained its identity and trademark sound. The band is famous for their live performances, in which they have long taken an audiovisual approach with elaborate lighting and projections.

In June 2012, the Wynnes&#x27; house in Colorado was destroyed by wild fires that had ravaged the area for over a week. The band was on tour at the time. Archived material was destroyed, as was their studio and some instruments. After the fire, the band sought help from fans to help rebuild the archive.

The band toured in 2021–22, as Ozric Electronic, across venues in the UK, with members Ed Wynne and Silas Neptune.

The band (Ed Wynne, Silas Neptune, Brandi Wynne, Tim Wallander, along with Saskia Maxwell) toured with Gong in November-December 2022.

==Musical style==

The music of Ozric Tentacles is a combination of driving basslines, keyboards and intricate guitar work, with a sound strongly influenced by Steve Hillage and Gong. Many of the songs incorporate unusual time signatures and Eastern-influenced modes. Furthermore, the band often uses complex arrangements, which include changes in time signature, key and tempo over the course of the track. The arrangements also take influence from funk, jazz fusion, dub, reggae and ambient music. These features are frequently mixed with electronic elements, including densely layered arpeggiated synthesizers, pads, synth basslines, effects and programmed drumbeats. Ozric Tentacles also use a wide range of instruments in their performances. In addition to regular rock band instruments, woodwinds, ethnic percussion, koto, saz and sitar have appeared throughout their music.

According to a number of interviews over the years, the band does not listen to music as much as they write and record music.

The vast majority of their songs are instrumentals. In Ed Wynne&#x27;s words, this is because, &quot;I&#x27;ve never really liked vocals. Words always get in the way, make everything too specific. Our music is more about creating moods and giving the listener the chance to get whatever they want out of it. Music is better than singing.&quot; Minor exceptions to this would be &quot;Dissolution&quot; off of &quot;Pungent Effulgent&quot; and &quot;Iscense&quot; from the album &quot;Erpland&quot;. The band&#x27;s spare use of vocals came primarily when Jumping John Egan was a member. Occasionally during live gigs, he would write poetry and shout it during the song.

<text>Joseph Hiester (November 18, 1752June 10, 1832) was an American politician, who served as the fifth governor of Pennsylvania from 1820 to 1823. He was a member of the Hiester family political dynasty, and was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.

==Biography==
Hiester was the son of John Hiester and Maria Barbara Epler. He received a common-school education when he was not working on the farm, and became a clerk in a store in Reading run by Adam Whitman. He became a partner in the store in 1771 when he married Elizabeth, Whitman&#x27;s daughter. He owned slaves.

At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, he raised and equipped in that town a company with which he took part in the battles of Long Island and Germantown. He was then promoted to colonel. He was captured and briefly confined in the prison ship &quot;Jersey,&quot; where he did much to alleviate the sufferings of his fellow prisoners. Later he was transferred to New York City where he was exchanged.

He was a member of the convention of 1776 that drafted the Articles of Confederation, of the Pennsylvania state constitutional convention which ratified the United States Constitution, and of the state constitutional convention of 1790. He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1787 to 1790 and the Pennsylvania Senate for the 17th district from 1790 to 1794. In 1807, he was appointed one of the two major generals to command the quota of Pennsylvania militia that was called for by the president. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1797 until 1805, and again from 1815 until 1820, 14 years altogether. After Peter Muhlenberg resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1801, Hiester was one of two major candidates to replace him, but was overwhelmingly defeated by George Logan. In 1817, he ran for governor and was defeated by William Findlay. Hiester faced Findlay again in 1820 and narrowly won a single term in office. Refusing on principle to stand for reelection in 1823, he served until 1824 when he retired from public life. During his term, he presided over the dedication of the first state capitol building in the new capital of Harrisburg. He surprised partisans and opponents by making appointments strictly on merit rather than party affiliation.

He was known by the nickname of &quot;Old German Grey&quot; and spoke with a Pennsylvania Dutch German accent.

Initially buried at Reading&#x27;s Reformed Church cemetery after his death in 1832, his remains were exhumed and reinterred at the Charles Evans Cemetery during the mid-19th century.

==Legacy==
A residence hall on the Penn State University Park campus was named after him.

<text>Delémont (; ; , ) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Jura. The city has approximately 12,000 inhabitants .

==History==

The area of the municipality was already settled in the middle Bronze Age. Fifteen urn burials have been discovered in the municipality. There were late Bronze Age settlements south and west of the modern city. Several Iron Age buildings have been discovered south of town. There is also evidence of a Roman settlement, including a Gallo-Roman mausoleum and a small cache of coins. One or possibly several villas in the area may indicate the existence of a vicus near the town.

The first historic mention of the name dates from 736 to 37 as &quot;Delemonte&quot;. In 1131, the first mention of the German name &quot;Telsperg&quot; was recorded. It is also mentioned as Laimunt (1181) and Deleymunt (1225). The name is a combination of the Germanic &quot;Tello&quot; or &quot;Dagili&quot; with the Latin word &quot;mons&quot; for &quot;mountain&quot;.

Since the 7th century, the region belonged to the lands of the counts of Alsace. In 1271, it was sold to the Bishop of Basel. At this time it consisted of a fortified village and two castles, which were probably the homes of the Telsberg family. The city was declared to have municipal rights by Bishop Peter Reich von Reichenstein on 6 January 1289. This charter allowed the city some self-governance and allowed it to distribute land, which created favorable conditions for the growth of the town. In 1338 they received the right to collect a tax on wine and food and in 1461 they were allowed to sell and tax salt in the valleys of Delémont and Moutier. From this income, as well as the money from a brick factory, two mills and eight farms, which were in use between the 15th and 17th centuries the city was able to meet all of its financial obligations. From 1289 to 1793, it was the capital of the estate of Delémont.

The old town was nearly square, with two large longitudinal streets that are intersected by three cross streets. The city was surrounded by city walls, which were strengthened in the southwest, near the Bishop&#x27;s Castle, during the 14th century. In the north-east corner a large round tower was built in the 13th century. There were four gates into the city: Porte Monsieur (or de Porrentruy), the Porte au Loup, the Porte des Moulins and the Porte des Près (or de Bâle). The latter was bricked up in 1487, when a fire destroyed a large part of the city. One characteristic of Delémont are the monumental fountains in the late Renaissance style. The most important public buildings were rebuilt in the 18th century. The Bishop&#x27;s Castle, which served as a summer residence, was rebuilt in 1716-21 by Pierre Racine from Tramelan. The Châtelain&#x27;s building was rebuilt in 1717, followed in 1742-45 the town hall by Johann Caspar Bagnato and in 1753 the private residence of the family of Rinck Baldenstein, the county&#x27;s administrator. The church of Saint-Marcel was built 1762-67 from plans by Pierre-Francois Paris, and replaced a Gothic style building which stood on the same location. The steeple was completed in 1850–51.

The town&#x27;s parish was first mentioned in 1255. The parish was administered by either a priest or a rector and seven or four (after 1760) chaplains. The rector of the Church of Saint-Marcel was also the dean of the rural diaconate of Salignon in the diocese of Basel. Between 1534 and 1792 the parish church served as the collegiate church for the collegiate chapter of Moutier-Grandval, who had fled to Delémont during the Protestant Reformation.

During the Counter-Reformation a monastery of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and an Ursuline convent were established, which remained until 1793. The Ursulines were established in 1698 to provide an education for young girls, which they did for almost a century.

The chapel of Saint-Imier, the former chapel of Telsberg castle, was rebuilt in 1586 and dedicated to Mary. During the increase in popularity of the Marian cult in the 17th century, the chapel was expanded and rebuilt several times. After the coronation of the statue of Notre-Dame in 1869 the chapel became the most popular pilgrimage place in the Catholic Jura.

In 1793, Delémont was conquered by French Revolutionary troops and became the seat of one of the districts of the Département du Mont Terrible. In 1800, this was incorporated into the Département du Haut-Rhin. After the fall of Napoleon, the region was given to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Under the French, the old power structure in the city was suppressed. The &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot; (an association of all full citizens) no longer had authority over most of the city lands and the town council became an advisory only organization. After the city came under Bernese authority, the old power structure rushed back into power. The Bürgergemeinde, which owned all the common lands, accepted only a few dozen new members, until 1820 when it closed itself to new members. This unequal power structure remained in place until the liberal revolution in 1831, known as the Regeneration, granted full citizenship rights to all residents of the town. The distribution of the Bürgergemeinde lands dragged on until 1866, when the Canton of Bern finally pushed through an agreement.

During the 19th century industrialization, the German-speaking population increased greatly, and in 1880 reached nearly 40%. The city was briefly bilingual, but since 1920, the German-speaking minority has continuously decreased.

Since 1947, the city became a center for agitation for separation from the Canton of Bern. In the referendums in 1959 and 1974, a large majority voted for the creation of the Canton of Jura. From 1976 to 1978, Delémont was the meeting place for the drafting of the cantonal constitution for the new canton, which was created 1 January 1979, with Delémont as its capital.

<text>Pungent Effulgent is the debut studio album by British rock band Ozric Tentacles. Released in 1989 to wide acclaim, it followed the many cassette-only albums they released in the 1980s.

==Track listing==

==Credits==
*Ed Wynne – guitar, synthesizer, production
*Mervin Pepler – drums
*Roly Wynne – bass
*Joie Hinton – synthesizer, sampling
*John Egan – flute, voice
*Paul Hankin – percussion
*Nick Van Gelder – drums on &quot;The Domes of G&#x27;Bal&quot;
*Generator John – drums on &quot;Wreltch&quot;
*Marcus C. Diess – percussion on &quot;Agog in the Ether&quot;

==Notes==
The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Dissolution&quot;, is one of very few songs by Ozric Tentacles to make use of noticeable vocals.

The seventh track, &quot;Kick Muck&quot;, is a reference to the dust in the fields at free festivals typical in the &#x27;80&#x27;s. Popular with fans at such open air venues, its name refers to the dance style at front of stage. The song oscillates between periods of intense, high tempo guitar and slower electronic psychedelia, enabling the crowd to recover before the next bout of &quot;kicking muck&quot;.

<text>Magnus III Olafsson (Old Norse: &quot;Magnús Óláfsson&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Magnus Olavsson&quot;; 1073 – 24 August 1103), better known as Magnus Barefoot (Old Norse: &quot;Magnús berfœttr&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Magnus Berrføtt&quot;), was the King of Norway from 1093 until his death in 1103. His reign was marked by aggressive military campaigns and conquest, particularly in the Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles, where he extended his rule to the Kingdom of the Isles and Dublin.

As the only son of King Olaf Kyrre, Magnus was proclaimed king in southeastern Norway shortly after his father&#x27;s death in 1093. In the north his claim was contested by his cousin, Haakon Magnusson (son of King Magnus Haraldsson), and the two co-ruled uneasily until Haakon&#x27;s death in 1095. Disgruntled members of the nobility refused to recognise Magnus after his cousin&#x27;s death, but the insurrection was short-lived. After securing his position domestically, Magnus campaigned around the Irish Sea from 1098 to 1099. He raided through Orkney, the Hebrides and Mann (the Northern and Southern Isles), and ensured Norwegian control by a treaty with the Scottish king. Based on Mann during his time in the west, Magnus had a number of forts and houses built on the island and probably also obtained suzerainty of Galloway. He sailed to Wales later in his expedition, gaining the support of Anglesey (and the Gwynedd) after aiding against the invading Norman forces from the island.

Following his return to Norway, Magnus led campaigns into Dalsland and Västergötland in Sweden, claiming an ancient border with the country. After two unsuccessful invasions and a number of skirmishes Danish king Eric Evergood initiated peace talks among the three Scandinavian monarchs, fearing that the conflict would get out of hand. Magnus concluded peace with the Swedes in 1101 by agreeing to marry Margaret, daughter of the Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson. In return, Magnus gained Dalsland as part of her dowry. He set out on his final western campaign in 1102, and may have sought to conquer Ireland. Magnus entered into an alliance with Irish king Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, who recognised Magnus&#x27;s control of Dublin. Under unclear circumstances, while obtaining food supplies for his return to Norway, Magnus was killed in an ambush by the Ulaid the next year; territorial advances characterising his reign ended with his death.

Into modern times, his legacy has remained more pronounced in Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and moved closer to the European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.

==Background==

Most information about Magnus is gleaned from Norse sagas and chronicles, which began appearing during the 12th century. The most important sources still available are the Norwegian chronicles &quot;Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium&quot; by Theodoric the Monk and the anonymous &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; (or simply &quot;Ágrip&quot;) from the 1180s and the Icelandic sagas &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (by Snorri Sturluson), &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, which date to about the 1220s. While the later sagas are the most detailed accounts, they are also generally considered the least reliable. Additional information about Magnus, in particular his campaigns, is found in sources from the British Isles, which included contemporary accounts.

Magnus was born around the end of 1073 as the only son of King Olaf Kyrre. His mother&#x27;s identity is uncertain; she is identified as Tora Arnesdatter (daughter of otherwise-unknown Arne Låge) in &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, as Tora Joansdatter in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Hrokkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Hryggjarstykki&quot; and an unnamed daughter of &quot;Ragnvald jarl&quot; from Godøy, Sunnmøre in the genealogical text &quot;Af en gl. ætleg&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Sunnmørsættleggen&quot;). The historical consensus (including P. A. Munch and Claus Krag) has favoured Tora Arnesdatter, but the other claims have also gained support. Anders Stølen has argued that she was a daughter of Ragnvald jarl (who has been identified as Rognvald Brusason, Earl of Orkney by Ola Kvalsund), while historian Randi Helene Førsund has considered Tora Joansdatter more likely.

Magnus grew up among the &quot;hird&quot; (royal retinue) of his father in Nidaros (modern Trondheim), &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Norway at the time. His father&#x27;s cousin, the chieftain Tore Ingeridsson, was foster-father to Magnus. In his youth, he was apparently more similar to his warlike grandfather, King Harald Hardrada, than to his father (who bore the byname &quot;Kyrre&quot;: &quot;the Peaceful&quot;). According to Snorri Sturluson, Magnus was considered handsome and gifted in learning; although he was shorter in stature than his grandfather Harald, he was reportedly known as &quot;Magnus the Tall&quot;. Magnus&#x27;s more-common byname, &quot;Barefoot&quot; or &quot;Barelegs&quot;, was—according to Snorri—due to his adopting the Gaelic dress of the Irish and Scots: a short tunic, which left the lower legs bare. Another version (by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus) maintains that he acquired the nickname because he was forced to flee from a Swedish attack in his bare feet, while a third explains that he rode barefoot (like the Irish). Due to Magnus&#x27;s aggressive nature and his campaigns abroad, he also had the nickname &quot;styrjaldar-Magnús&quot; (&quot;Warrior Magnus&quot; or &quot;Magnus the Strife-lover&quot;).

==Reign==

===Establishing authority===
Norway had experienced a long period of peace during the reign of Magnus&#x27;s father, Olaf. Magnus may have been present when Olaf died in Rånrike, Båhuslen (southeastern Norway) in September 1093 and was probably proclaimed king at the Borgarting, the thing (assembly) of the adjacent region of Viken later that month. When Magnus became king, he already had a network of support among the Norwegian aristocracy. Although sources are unclear about the first year of his reign, it is apparent that Magnus&#x27;s focus was on the west (towards the British Isles). Since conditions were chaotic in Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles since the death of Thorfinn the Mighty, this provided Magnus an opportunity to intervene in local power struggles. According to some accounts, he made his first expedition west in 1093–94 (or 1091–92), helping Scottish king Donald Bane to conquer Edinburgh and the Scottish throne and possibly gaining control of the Southern Isles (&quot;Suðreyjar&quot;) in return. It is unclear if this early expedition took place, since it is not directly referenced in early reliable sources or the sagas.

Magnus was opposed by his cousin Haakon Magnusson, son of King Olaf&#x27;s brother and short-lived co-ruler King Magnus Haraldsson, who claimed half the kingdom. Haakon was proclaimed king in the Uplands and at the Øyrating, the thing of Trøndelag (in central Norway). According to Førsund, Haakon took control of the entire portion of the kingdom once held by his father (also including the Frostating—the thing of Hålogaland in northern Norway—and the Gulating—the thing of western Norway). Haakon secured support by relieving farmers of taxes and duties (including taxes dating back to the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson during the early 1030s), while Magnus pursued costly policies and demanded lengthy military service. After Magnus settled at the new royal estate in Nidaros for the winter of 1094–95, Haakon also travelled to the city and took up residence at the old royal estate. Their relationship became increasingly tense, culminating when Haakon saw Magnus&#x27;s longships fully rigged at sea. Haakon summoned the Øyrating in response, leading Magnus to sail southwards. Haakon attempted to intercept Magnus by travelling south to Viken by land (over the mountains of Dovrefjell), but he died unexpectedly while hunting in February 1095.
The strongman behind Haakon&#x27;s monarchy had been his foster-father Tore Tordsson (&quot;Steigar-Tore&quot;), who refused to recognise Magnus as king after Haakon&#x27;s death. With Egil Aslaksson and other noblemen, he had the otherwise-unknown Sweyn Haraldsson set up as a pretender. Although later sagas maintain that Sweyn was Danish, some modern historians have speculated that he may have been a son of Harald Hardrada. The revolt was based in the Uplands, but also gained support from noblemen elsewhere in the country. After several weeks of fighting, Magnus captured Tore and his supporters and had them hanged on the island of Vambarholm (outside Hamnøy, Lofoten, in northern Norway). Magnus was reportedly furious because he could not pardon Egil, a potentially useful, young and resourceful nobleman. As king, his honour would only allow a pardon if other noblemen pleaded for Egil&#x27;s life; this did not happen.

Magnus&#x27;s final domestic dispute was with the noble Sveinke Steinarsson, who refused to recognise him as king. Although Sveinke reduced piracy in Viken, he was forced into exile for three years after negotiating with Magnus&#x27;s men. Since piracy increased soon after Sveinke&#x27;s departure (possibly encouraged by Sveinke himself), Magnus met him in the Danish province of Halland to request his return to Norway. They reconciled; Sveinke became a loyal supporter of Magnus, now the undisputed king of Norway.

===Other developments===

Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses which were the sagas&#x27; main sources) chiefly describe war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus&#x27;s peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf&#x27;s reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus&#x27;s). Modern historians have noted that this probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus&#x27;s case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).

Magnus&#x27;s rule was generally marked by Norway&#x27;s increasing similarity to other European kingdoms. Royal rule became established, and he consolidated power through a network of powerful noblemen (some of whom were relatives); church organisation also developed. The Nordic bishops belonged to the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen until a year after Magnus&#x27;s death (when the Archdiocese of Lund was formed); priests and bishops were largely foreigners from England and Germany. In reality, however, Magnus ruled the church in Norway.

Through numismatics, it is known that minting reform began during Magnus&#x27;s reign. The reform restored silver content in coins to around 90 percent, the level at Harald Hardrada&#x27;s 1055 reform (&quot;Haraldsslåtten&quot;) which reduced silver content to about 30 percent (the remainder of the coin was copper). Coin size in Magnus&#x27;s reform was reduced to .45 gram, half the previous weight. Although the silver value of a coin remained about the same, copper was not needed in coins.

===First Irish Sea campaign===
Magnus sought to re-establish Norwegian influence around the Irish Sea. He attempted to install vassal king Ingemund in the Southern Isles in 1097, but the latter was killed in a revolt. It is unclear what Magnus&#x27;s ultimate ambitions were, and the significance of his campaign has been downplayed by modern English historians. English chronicler William of Malmesbury believed that Magnus sought to capture the throne from William II of England (in common with the ambitions of his grandfather, Harald Hardrada). Historians have speculated that he wanted to establish an empire which included Scotland and Ireland, although most modern Norwegian and Scottish historians believe his chief aim was simply to control the Norse communities around the Irish Sea. While he may have been influenced by Ingemund&#x27;s murder, the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; claims that Magnus was persuaded by a son of an Orkney earl, Haakon Paulsson, who wanted an earldom for himself. It is also possible that Magnus wished to provide a realm outside Norway for his eight-year-old son Sigurd, who accompanied him. Magnus sailed into the Western Sea in 1098, arriving in Orkney with a large fleet. The &quot;Chronicles of the Kings of Mann and the Isles&quot; claim that he had 160 ships, but English chronicler Orderic Vitalis states that his fleet consisted of 60 ships. Based on this, P. A. Munch suggests an initial fleet of 160 ships, of which 100 were from the &quot;leidang&quot; (public levy) and returned shortly after arrival; the fleet accompanying Magnus southward in the campaigns consisted of 60 royal and baronial ships. According to Førsund, the low estimate of 120 men per ship means 8,000 men in the royal and baronial ships and 12,000 from the &quot;leidang&quot; ships. However, many historians believe that ship numbers in old naval campaign accounts are exaggerated.
After his arrival, Magnus began negotiations with Scottish and Irish kings about the &quot;hird&quot; and control of land in Scotland, Ireland and the surrounding islands. Upon arriving in Orkney, he sent the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson away to Norway as prisoners on a &quot;leidang&quot; ship, took their sons Haakon Paulsson, Magnus Erlendsson and Erling Erlendsson as hostages and installed his own son Sigurd as earl. Magnus then raided Scotland, the Southern Isles and Lewis. Meeting no significant opposition, he continued pillaging the Hebridean islands of Uist, Skye, Tiree, Mull and Islay, and the peninsula of Kintyre; Iona was visited, but not pillaged. Magnus is also recorded as warring in Sanday, although the exact location is unclear (there are three islands with that name in the region). On entering the Irish Sea, he lost three &quot;leidang&quot; ships and 120 men in Ulster. Magnus then continued to Mann, where the earl Óttar fell in a violent battle; he also chased (or captured) Lagman Godredsson, King of the Isles. Mann came under Norwegian control, and Magnus and his men stayed on the island for a time. During his time there, he organised Norwegian immigration to the island and had several forts and houses built (or rebuilt) using timber from Galloway on the Scottish mainland. This implied he had subdued part of that region too, reducing its chieftains to tributaries.

Magnus may have intended to invade Ireland next, only to find he had overextended himself. He may have been approached by Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, who had been driven to Ireland by the Norman earls Hugh of Montgomery and Hugh d&#x27;Avranches. With six ships (according to Orderic Vitalis), Magnus steered towards Anglesey in Gwynedd, Wales. Appearing off the coast at Puffin Island, he interrupted a Norman victory celebration after their defeat of the Gwynedd king—for the Welsh, &quot;so opportunely it was ascribed to divine providence&quot; according to historian Rosemary Power (although Magnus had not necessarily intended to side with them). In the ensuing battle (known as the Battle of Anglesey Sound, according to Power &quot;the most widely reported event in the history of Magnus&quot;), Magnus shot Hugh of Montgomery dead with an arrow through his eye and defeated the Norman forces. The sources indicate that Magnus regretted killing Montgomery, suggesting that he may have been interested in an alliance with the Normans. He abruptly returned to Mann with his men, leaving the Norman army weak and demoralized. After this battle, Anglesey was considered the southern border of Norway. Gruffudd ap Cynan soon returned to the island, awarding Magnus gifts and honour (which may indicate that Gwynedd had capitulated). The extension of Magnus&#x27;s kingdom probably began to concern the English, who remembered the invasion of Magnus&#x27;s grandfather Harald Hardrada in 1066, war with Danish king Sweyn II Estridson in 1069–70 and the threat of invasion by Cnut IV in 1085.
In Scotland internal fighting continued between rival kings, although King Edgar had gained a slight advantage. Perhaps fearing to meet Magnus in battle after the internecine strife, according to the sagas Edgar—mistakenly called Malcolm—told Magnus he would renounce all Scottish claims to islands west of Scotland in exchange for peace. Magnus accepted the offer, which reportedly gave him every island a ship could reach with its rudder set. He gained recognition of his rule in the Southern Isles, including Kintyre after demonstrating that it should be included by sitting at the rudder of his ship as it was dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert. Historian Richard Oram has claimed that references to a formal agreement with the Scottish king is a &quot;post-Norwegian civil war confection&quot; designed to legitimise the agenda of Haakon IV Haakonsson. Rosemary Power agrees with the Norse sources that a formal agreement with the Scots was probably concluded, and Seán Duffy notes that Edgar &quot;happily ceded&quot; the isles to Magnus since he had &quot;little or no authority there in any case&quot;. Magnus spent the winter in the Hebrides (continuing to fortify the islands), while many of his men returned to Norway. There may have been talks at this time of Magnus marrying Matilda, daughter of late Scottish king Malcolm III Canmore, but no marriage took place. Magnus returned to Norway a year later during the summer of 1099, although many of the islands he had conquered (such as Anglesey) were only nominally under Norwegian control.

===Campaign in Sweden===
After returning to Norway, Magnus turned east. By claiming an ancient border between Norway and Sweden, he set his course for the Swedish provinces of Dalsland and Västergötland in late 1099. In Magnus&#x27;s view, the border with Sweden should be set further east: at the Göta älv river, through the Vänern lake and north to the province of Värmland. He claimed all land west of Vänern (chiefly Dalsland). Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson refuted the claim, and Magnus began a campaign in response. He raided his way through the forest villages, and Inge began amassing an army. When advised by his men to retreat, Magnus became more aggressive; he believed that once begun, a campaign should never be aborted. In a surprise nighttime attack, Magnus assaulted Swedish forces east of Göta älv at Fuxerna (near Lilla Edet). After defeating the Swedes at Fuxerna, he conquered part of Västergötland. According to a skald, Magnus conquered &quot;fifteen hundreds from the Geats&quot;. He had a wooden fort, surrounded by a moat, built on the island of Kållandsö in the southern portion of Vänern. Before returning to Norway, Magnus left 300 men on the island for the winter (led by Finn Skofteson and Sigurd Ullstreng).
According to Randi Helene Førsund, the Norwegians in Kållandsö appear to have been characterized by arrogance (perhaps due to their successes under Magnus) and taunted the Swedish king for taking so long to arrive. After newly formed ice connected the island to the mainland, Inge arrived with about 3,000 men. Although he offered several times to allow the Norwegians to return home in peace (with their plunder and possessions), Inge&#x27;s offers were rejected. The Swedes finally attacked, burning the fort. The Norwegians were spared and allowed to return home, after being beaten with sticks and surrendering all their possessions. Angry at the humiliating defeat, Magnus planned revenge. He entered Sweden the following year, reconquering the same areas. During the hasty campaign Magnus and his men were ambushed by Swedish forces and forced to flee back to their ships, suffering heavy losses. The war continued until 1100 or 1101.

Danish king Eric Evergood, concerned that the conflict would escalate, began peace talks between the two kings. Relations had been strained between Denmark and Norway after Magnus&#x27;s 1096 raids into Halland, and Eric feared that the conflict might spill over into his own country. The three Scandinavian kings eventually agreed to negotiate peace in the border area near Göta älv. After a constructive meeting, they agreed to preserve ancestral borders; by marrying Inge&#x27;s daughter Margaret (who acquired the byname &quot;Fredkulla&quot;: &quot;Maiden of Peace&quot;), Magnus acquired the lands he claimed on behalf of his ancestors. Since the marriage was childless, Dalsland never became established as a Norwegian province and was returned to Sweden after his death.

===Second Irish Sea campaign and death===
Magnus again set his course for Ireland in 1101 or 1102, this time probably with a greater army than he had in his previous campaign. One of his biggest challenges was the number of petty kings and alliances on the island. Irish sources maintain that Magnus came to &quot;take Ireland&quot;, &quot;invade Ireland&quot; or &quot;besiege Ireland&quot;. He received reinforcements from Orkney on his way to Mann, where he set up a base to survey conditions. Tensions ran high between Magnus and the king of Munster and High King of Ireland, Muirchertach Ua Briain (&quot;Mýrjartak&quot;), who was struggling with his rival Domnall Ua Lochlainn. Magnus may have tested the situation in 1101, when unnamed sailors are said to have raided Scattery Island (near Muirchertach&#x27;s base). After his arrival at Mann, Irish sources describe Magnus as agreeing to &quot;a year&#x27;s peace&quot; with the Irish (suggesting enmity; such agreements were diplomatic devices, usually negotiated between two sides in war). The marriage agreement described in other sources was part of the treaty; Magnus&#x27;s son, Sigurd, married Muirchertach&#x27;s daughter Bjaðmunjo. On their wedding day, Magnus named Sigurd his co-king and put him in charge of the western lands. Muirchertach also recognised Magnus&#x27;s control over Dublin and Fingal.

Around the same time Muirchertach married a daughter of Arnulf of Montgomery, brother of Hugh (who was killed by Magnus in 1098). The account in &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; concerning a &quot;foreign knight&quot; named &quot;Giffarðr&quot;, who appeared at the court of Magnus before his Swedish campaign, is suggested by Rosemary Power as evidence that Magnus may have conspired with the Norman Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham (or a family member) in the revolt against Henry I of England. According to Orderic Vitalis, Magnus left treasure with a wealthy citizen in Lincoln which was confiscated by King Henry after Magnus&#x27;s death. This treasure could have been paid by Norman earls for Magnus&#x27;s support, and possibly arranged by the Giffarðr who is said to have visited Magnus&#x27;s court in the sagas. This could have provided Magnus with a lucrative return for his costly western campaigns, which were unpopular in Norway at the time.

Muirchertach was skilled in diplomacy, and negotiation with the dowries of his daughters may have been part of a political game. While he may not have intended to honour his agreements with Magnus (or others), he needed the latter&#x27;s assistance to crush Domnall. Magnus and Muirchertach went on joint raiding expeditions after the peace agreement, only interrupted by the winter of 1102–03. The sagas claim that Magnus wintered in Connacht, but since Connacht is incorrectly claimed to be Muirchertach&#x27;s kingdom the location was corrected to Kincora, Munster by modern historians. Rosemary Power considered it more likely that Magnus would have kept his fleet near Dublin. Magnus was probably allied with Muirchertach during his campaigns against Domnall and the Cenél nEógain in 1103, but (in contrast to the Norse sources) Irish sources (the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; and &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;) do not describe their campaigns as successful. On 5 August 1103, Muirchertach unsuccessfully tried to subdue Domnall in the Battle of Mag Coba. Magnus did not take part, but his Dublin subjects fought with Muirchertach. Since Magnus was closing in on the Irish throne, Muirchertach may have wanted him out of the way. According to &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, the two agreed that Muirchertach was to bring Magnus and his men cattle provisions for their return to Norway; as this dragged on past the agreed time, Magnus became suspicious that the Irish planned an attack. He gathered his men on St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day (or the day before, according to &quot;Ágrip&quot;), 24 August 1103, and ventured into the country. It is possible that Magnus and his men made an incautious landing to raid cattle, or the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle-raiding Hebrideans. Alternatively, Muirchertach may have ordered the Ulaid to bring provisions to Magnus, inciting the Ulaid to ambush the Norwegians.
Norse sources describe a large force emerging from hiding places in an ambush. The Norwegian forces were taken by surprise, and were not in battle order. Magnus attempted to assert control over his disordered army, ordering part of his force to seize secure ground and use archery fire to slow the Irish. In the melee Magnus was pierced by a spear through both thighs above the knees but he fought on, attempting to get his men back to the level campsite. An axe-wielding Irishman charged him, striking a lethal blow to his neck. When his men said that he proceeded incautiously in his campaigns, Magnus is reported to have responded &quot;Kings are made for honour, not for long life&quot;; he was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad.

Perhaps betrayed by Muirchertach, Magnus may also have been betrayed by his own men (in particular the contingent of nobleman Torgrim Skinnluve from the Uplands, who fled to the ships during the battle). It is possible that Torgrim and his men may have been directed by powerful men in Norway, who wanted Magnus removed from the Norwegian throne. More Irishmen than Norwegians fell in the battle, according to Snorri Sturluson, and Magnus&#x27;s reign could have been different if Torgrim and his men had fought as directed. Magnus&#x27;s son Sigurd returned to Norway without his child bride after his father&#x27;s defeat, and direct Norwegian control in the region came to an end. Although Norwegian influence remained, no Norwegian king returned for more than 150 years.

==Descendants==
Magnus married Margaret Fredkulla, daughter of Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson, as part of the peace agreement of 1101. Their marriage did not produce any children. His three sons (who succeeded him as king) were born to different women, and he had two known daughters by unidentified women:
* Eystein: Born 1089 to a mother &quot;of low birth&quot;.
* Sigurd: Born 1090; his mother&#x27;s name was Tora.
* Olaf: Born ; his mother was Sigrid Saxesdatter from Vik in Strinda, Trøndelag.
* Ragnild: Married Harald Kesja, Danish pretender and son of Danish king Eric Evergood.
* Tora: Married Icelandic chieftain Loftur Sæmundsson.

Years after Magnus&#x27;s death, other men came forward claiming to be his sons; however, it is impossible to ascertain the veracity of these claims:
* Harald Gille: Born 1103 in Ireland, his claim was recognised by Magnus&#x27;s son Sigurd.
* Sigurd Slembe: His mother was Tora Saxesdatter from Vik; his claim was not recognised (by Harald Gille).
* Magnus Raude: Mentioned only in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;.

==Aftermath==

===Burial===
Magnus probably died in the vicinity of the River Quoile. According to the &quot;Chronicles of the Kings of Mann and the Isles&quot;, Magnus was &quot;buried near the Church of St Patrick, in Down&quot;. About two miles (1.2 km) south of the cathedral on Horse Island is a mound which became known as Magnus&#x27;s Grave after its identification on an 1859 map attributed to Danish archaeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae. Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s description of the marshy and difficult terrain where Magnus and his men were attacked fits the conditions in and around Horse Island, making it a strong candidate for the burial site. According to Finbar McCormick, the people who ambushed Magnus may not have wanted a Christian burial for him and his men, instead burying them near where they had been slain. The Downpatrick runestone monument marking the site was erected in March 2003 to mark the 900th anniversary of his death. The burial site is largely only accessible via the heritage railway in Downpatrick; a halt overlooking the barrow and runestone has been carved by James Higgins and erected by Philip Campbell, local viking history enthusiast, chairman and founder of the Magnus Viking Association and the Ballydugan Medieval Settlement which is located a short distance from the Runestone on the Drumcullan Road.

===Succession===

Magnus was succeeded peacefully by his three sons: Sigurd, Eystein and Olaf. Near the end of Sigurd&#x27;s reign (he having outlived his brothers) during the late 1120s, the previously unknown Harald Gille came to Norway from the west claiming to be a son of Magnus Barefoot and legitimate successor to the kingdom. Sigurd recognised Harald as his brother (and successor) after Harald walked uninjured over nine burning ploughshares in a trial by ordeal, and he was proclaimed king after Sigurd&#x27;s death in 1130 with Sigurd&#x27;s son Magnus Sigurdsson. Since Harald was accompanied by his mother to Norway, Sigurd may have recognised a former lover of his father.

Relations between Harald and Magnus Sigurdsson soured, and several years later Harald had Magnus mutilated and deposed (hence his byname &quot;the Blind&quot;). Soon afterwards, Harald was murdered by another pretender: Sigurd Slembe, who also claimed to be a son of Magnus Barefoot and had been outlawed by Harald. After Harald&#x27;s death Slembe allied himself with Magnus the Blind, but they were defeated by chieftains loyal to Harald Gille&#x27;s family in the Battle of Holmengrå. Magnus was killed during the battle; Sigurd was captured, tortured and executed. This began what would become the century-long Norwegian civil-war era.

===Legacy===
The earliest-known native Irishman to have been named Magnus may have been the son of Muirchertach&#x27;s greatest rival, Domnall Ua Lochlainn; Magnus became a name among the Ulaid during the 12th century. According to &quot;Morkinskinna&quot;, tribute from Ireland was received in Norway as late as about twelve years after Magnus&#x27;s death.

Magnus became the subject of at least two Gaelic ballads as the character Manus Mór. In the best-known version, he returns to Norway after an expedition to the west; he is killed in the second version. The different versions are probably derived from Magnus&#x27;s two expeditions. There are also traditions concerning Magnus in Scotland in legends, poems and local history.

In modern times, a &quot;Magnus Barelegs festival&quot; has been held near Downpatrick at Delamont Country park bi-annually. Traditionally held on the last weekend of August every second year (27 and 28 August 2022) it is organised, funded and carried out by the Magnus Viking Association. There is a beer named after his sword, Legbiter. In Norway, according to Førsund, Magnus has &quot;been reduced to a sigh&quot; in history books; little remains to commemorate him. When King Magnus was killed in an ambush by the Men of Ulster, his sword was retrieved and sent home.

<text>Les Éditions de Minuit (, &quot;Midnight Press&quot;) is a French publishing house. It was founded in 1941, during the French Resistance of World War II, and is still publishing books today.

==History==

Les Éditions de Minuit was founded by writer and illustrator Jean Bruller and writer Pierre de Lescure (1891–1963) in 1941 in Paris, during the German occupation of northern France (by November 1942, German forces occupied all of France). At the time, the media and all forms of publishing were controlled and censored by the Nazi occupiers. &quot;Les Éditions de Minuit&quot; was started to circumvent the censorship. It was an underground publisher until the liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944.

&quot;Le Silence de la mer&quot; &quot;(The Silence of the Sea)&quot; (1942) by co-founder Bruller (who wrote under the pseudonym Vercors) was the first book published. Distribution, as with other Resistance texts, was based on being passed from person to person.

&quot;Le Silence de la mer&quot; was followed in 1943 by &quot;Chroniques interdites&quot; (banned newspaper columns, various authors), &quot;L&#x27;Honneur des poètes&quot; &quot;(The Honour of poets)&quot; poetry collected by Paul Éluard, &quot;Le cahier noir&quot; &quot;(The Black Notebook)&quot; by François Mauriac, and &quot;Le musée Grévin&quot; &quot;(The Grévin Museum)&quot; by Louis Aragon.

A small group of printers joined Bruller and de Lescure, and together they risked imprisonment and death to publish works by some of France&#x27;s greatest authors (who wrote under pseudonyms). The authors included Paul Éluard, Louis Aragon, Jacques Maritain, François Mauriac, Jean Paulhan, André Chamson, André Gide, and the first unabridged French translation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; (&quot;Nuits noires&quot;).

After the war, when &quot;Les Éditions de Minuit&quot; was able to operate openly, it continued to publish books but struggled in the early postwar years to become financially stable. The publishing house was directed by Jérôme Lindon from 1947 until his death in 2001. His daughter, Irène Lindon, succeeded him.

In the 1950s, the company began to be more successful. Lindon was the first to publish several novels by Samuel Beckett, who wrote in French as well as English, and was resident in France at the time. Other authors published include Monique Wittig, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Marguerite Duras and Robert Pinget, who constituted the backbone of the Nouveau roman literary movement. It also published Henri Alleg&#x27;s &quot;La Question&quot; (1958) on the use of torture by the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–62). The book was censored.

From the late 1970s to the mid-80s, Lindon and the Éditions de Minuit promoted several young French authors such as Jean Echenoz, soon joined by Jean-Philippe Toussaint (from Belgium), Jean Rouaud, Marie NDiaye, Patrick Deville, Éric Chevillard, and lately by Laurent Mauvignier and Julia Deck. These have been classified under the tag of &quot;Style Minuit&quot;, characterized by a certain writing renewal (partially influenced by the Nouveau Roman), based on minimalist formalism mixed with an elaborated style.

From its foundation to 2015, the Éditions de Minuit have, through their authors, won two Nobel Prize in Literature (Samuel Beckett and Claude Simon), three Prix Goncourt (&quot;The Lover&quot; by Marguerite Duras, &quot;I&#x27;m Off&quot; by Jean Echenoz and &quot;Fields of Glory&quot; by Jean Rouaud), seven Prix Médicis, one Prix Renaudot and three Prix Femina.

==21st century==

The style of the front covers of Les Éditions de Minuit books is nearly as spare as the wartime edition of &quot;Le Silence de la mer&quot;. The only decoration is a blue border and the symbol of Les Éditions de Minuit: a star and the letter &quot;m&quot;.

<doc id="443259" wikidata="Q35076" url="?curid=443259" title="Moray eel">
<text>Moray eels, or Muraenidae (), are a family of eels whose members are found worldwide. There are approximately 200 species in 15 genera which are almost exclusively marine, but several species are regularly seen in brackish water, and a few are found in fresh water.

The English name, &quot;moray&quot;, dates back to the early 17th century, and is believed to be a derivative from Portuguese , which itself derives from Latin , in turn from Greek , ; these are the Latin and Greek names of the Mediterranean moray.

==Anatomy==
The dorsal fin extends from just behind the head along the back and joins seamlessly with the caudal and anal fins. Most species lack pectoral and pelvic fins, adding to their serpentine appearance. Their eyes are rather small; morays rely mostly on their highly developed sense of smell, lying in wait to ambush prey.

The body is generally patterned. In some species, the inside of the mouth is also patterned. Their jaws are wide, framing a protruding snout. Most possess large teeth used to tear flesh or grasp slippery prey. A relatively small number of species, for example the snowflake moray (&quot;Echidna nebulosa&quot;) and zebra moray (&quot;Gymnomuraena zebra&quot;), primarily feed on crustaceans and other hard-shelled animals, and they have blunt, molar-like teeth suitable for crushing.

Morays secrete a protective mucus over their smooth, scaleless skin, which in some species contains a toxin. They have much thicker skin and high densities of goblet cells in the epidermis that allows mucus to be produced at a higher rate than in other eel species. This allows sand granules to adhere to the sides of their burrows in sand-dwelling morays, thus making the walls of the burrow more permanent due to the glycosylation of mucins in mucus. Placement of their small, circular gills on their flanks, far behind the mouth, requires the moray to maintain a gape / gulping motion to facilitate respiration.

=== Jaw ===
The pharyngeal jaws of morays are located farther back in the head and closely resemble the oral jaws (complete with tiny &quot;teeth&quot;). When feeding, morays launch these jaws into the mouth cavity, where they grasp prey and transport it into the throat. Moray eels are the only known animals that use pharyngeal jaws to actively capture and restrain prey in this way. In addition to the presence of pharyngeal jaws, morays&#x27; mouth openings extend far back into the head, compared to fish which feed using suction. In the action of lunging at prey and biting down, water flows out the posterior side of the mouth opening, reducing waves in front of the eel which would otherwise displace prey. Thus, aggressive predation is still possible even with reduced bite times. In at least one species, the California moray (&quot;Gymnothorax mordax&quot;), teeth in the roof of the mouth are able to fold down as prey slides backwards, thus preventing the teeth from breaking and maintaining a hold on prey as it is transported to the throat.

Differing shapes of the jaw and teeth reflect the respective diets of different species of moray eel. Evolving separately multiple times within the Muraenidae family, short, rounded jaws and molar-like teeth allow durophagous eels (e.g. zebra moray and genus &quot;Echidna&quot;) to consume crustaceans, while other piscivorous genera of Muraenidae have pointed jaws and longer teeth. These morphological patterns carry over to teeth positioned on the pharyngeal jaw. 
==Feeding-behavior==
Morays are opportunistic, carnivorous predators and feed primarily on smaller fish, crabs, and octopuses. A spotted moray eel has been observed eating a red lionfish without harm. Groupers, barracudas and sea snakes are among their few known predators, making many morays (especially the larger species) apex predators in their ecosystems.

===Cooperative hunting===
Reef-associated roving coral groupers (&quot;Plectropomus pessuliferus&quot;) have been observed recruiting giant morays to help them hunt. The invitation to hunt is initiated by head-shaking. This style of hunting may allow morays to flush prey from niches not accessible to groupers.

==Habitat==

The moray eel can be found in both fresh and saltwater habitats. The vast majority of species are strictly marine, never entering freshwater. Of the few species known to live in freshwater, the most well-known is &quot;Gymnothorax polyuranodon&quot;.

Within the marine realm, morays are found in shallow water nearshore areas, continental slopes, continental shelves, deep benthic habitats, and mesopelagic zones of the ocean, and in both tropical and temperate environments. Most species are found in tropical or subtropical environments, with only a few species (yellow moray) found in temperate ocean environments.

Although the moray eel can occupy both tropical oceans and temperate oceans, as well as both freshwater and saltwater, the majority of moray eels occupy warm saltwater environments, which contain reefs. Within the tropical oceans and temperate oceans, the moray eel occupies shelters, such as dead patch reefs and coral rubble rocks, and less frequently occupies live coral reefs.

==Taxonomy==

=== Genera ===

There are about 202 known species of moray eels, in 16 genera. These genera are in two sub-families, Muraeninae and Uropterygiinae, which are distinguished by the location of their fins. In Muraeninae the dorsal fin is near the gill slits and runs down the back of the eel, and the anal fin is behind the anus. In the Uropterygiinnae, both the dorsal and the anal fin are at the end of the tail. Though this distinction can be seen between the two sub-families, there are still many varieties of genera within Muraeninae and Uropterygiinae. Of these, the genus &quot;Gymnothorax&quot; is by far the broadest, including more than half of the total number of species.

The family Muraenidae comprises the following subfamiles and genera:
* Subfamily Muraeninae 
** &quot;Diaphenchelys&quot; 
** &quot;Echidna&quot; 
**&quot;Enchelycore&quot; 
** &quot;Enchelynassa&quot; 
** &quot;Gymnomuraena&quot; 
** &quot;Gymnothorax 
** &quot;Monopenchelys&quot; 
** &quot;Muraena&quot; 
** &quot;Pseudechidna&quot; 
** &quot;Rhinomuraena&quot; 
** &quot;Strophidon&quot; 
* Subfamily Uropterygiinae 
** &quot;Anarchias&quot; 
** &quot;Channomuraena&quot; 
** &quot;Cirrimaxilla&quot; 
** &quot;Scuticaria&quot; 
** &quot;Uropterygius&quot; 

== Evolution ==
The moray eel&#x27;s elongation is due to an increase in the number of vertebrae, rather than a lengthening of each individual vertebra or a substantial decrease in body depth. Vertebrae have been added asynchronously between the pre-tail (&quot;precaudal&quot;) and tail (&quot;caudal&quot;) regions, unlike other groups of eels such as Ophicthids and Congrids.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Aquarium trade ===
Several moray species are popular among aquarium hobbyists for their hardiness, flexible diets, and disease resistance. The most commonly traded species are the snowflake, zebra and goldentail moray (&quot;Gymnothorax miliaris&quot;). Several other species are occasionally seen, but are more difficult to obtain and can command a steep price on the market.

=== Food poisoning ===

Moray eels, particularly the giant moray (&quot;Gymnothorax javanicus&quot;) and yellow-edged moray (&quot;G. flavimarginatus&quot;), are known to accumulate high levels of ciguatoxins, unlike other reef fish; if consumed by humans, ciguatera fish poisoning may result. Ciguatera is characterised by neurological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular problems that may persist for days after eating tainted fish. In morays, the toxins are most concentrated in the liver. In an especially remarkable instance, 57 people in the Northern Mariana Islands were poisoned after eating just the head and half of a cooked yellow-edged moray. Thus, morays are not recommended for human consumption.

<doc id="443261" wikidata="Q373221" url="?curid=443261" title="George Wolf">
<text>George Wolf (August 12, 1777March 11, 1840) was the seventh governor of Pennsylvania from 1829 to 1835. On June 29, 1888, he was recognized as the &quot;father of the public-school system&quot; in Pennsylvania by the erection of a memorial gateway at Easton.

==Early life and education==
Wolf was born in Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania, in present-day Northampton County, Pennsylvania, to George and Mary Wolf, who immigrated to the United States from Alsace, then part of France, in 1751. Wolf was educated at a classical school, taught for some time, and then studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1799 and commenced practice in Easton, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
===Pennsylvania state politics===
Wolf became a member of the Democratic Republican Party at the beginning of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s administration, and was appointed postmaster of Easton, where he served n 1802 and 1803. He was a clerk of the orphans&#x27; court of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, from 1803 to 1809, and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1814.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Wolf was elected without opposition to the United States House of Representatives in 1824 to the Eighteenth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Thomas J. Rogers. He was reelected to the Nineteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first Congresses. He took the protectionist side in debates on the tariff. during his second term he chaired the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.

===Governor of Pennsylvania===
As member of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, Wolf defeated Joseph Ritner in both 1829 and 1832 to become the Governor of Pennsylvania. A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on December 15, 1829. Wolf was in office during the 1834 Philadelphia race riot.

He lost the governor&#x27;s seat to the Anti-Mason candidate Ritner in 1835, owing to the defection of a part of the Democrats, who voted for Henry A. Muhlenberg.

As governor, Wolf persuaded the legislature to construct canals and impose new taxes for the liquidation of debts that had already been incurred on account of internal improvements. Wolf advocated the establishment of a general system of common schools, and by strenuous efforts accomplished this reform where former governors had failed. In the wake of the hanging of Charles Getter in Easton, which was viewed by up to 20,000 people, Wolf signed a law on April 10, 1834, banning public executions.

===Lafayette College===
From 1827 to 1840, Wolf was a trustee of Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

===Final years===
In 1836, Andrew Jackson appointed him as First Comptroller of the Treasury. Two years later, President Martin Van Buren appointed him as Collector of Customs for the District of Philadelphia in a job swap with James Nelson Barker. He held this office until his death.

==Personal life==
Wolf married Mary Erb (1781–1833) of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on June 5, 1798. The couple had eight sons and one daughter.

==Legacy==

<doc id="443265" wikidata="Q453723" url="?curid=443265" title="Jean-Louis Pons">
<text>Jean-Louis Pons (24 December 176114 October 1831) was a French astronomer. Despite humble beginnings and being self-taught, he went on to become the greatest visual comet discoverer of all time: between 1801 and 1827 Pons discovered thirty-seven comets, more than any other person in history.

Pons worked at three observatories in his career, Marseille Observatory, where he was also trained, a short-lived observatory at Royal Park La Marlia in Tuscany, and finally at an observatory in Florence.

Pons&#x27;s work supported some famous comet recoveries of the 19th century, including Encke&#x27;s Comet and Crommelin&#x27;s Comet. However, most of the comets he discovered had near-parabolic orbits and would not return for a time as long as several millennia.

== Early life ==

Pons was born in Peyre, Hautes-Alpes, to a poor family; he received little formal education. In 1789, he began working for the Marseille Observatory as a caretaker, and gradually gained some experience in assisting the astronomers with observations. He learned to make observations himself, showing a remarkable ability to remember star fields and note changes in them.

In his early astronomical career, the unassuming and trusting Pons was often the target of jokes perpetrated by more experienced astronomers. Franz Xaver von Zach once advised him to look for comets when sunspots were visible, though in doing so Zach may have inadvertently given Pons very good advice.

== Career as an astronomer ==
Pons made his first comet discovery, jointly attributed to Charles Messier, on 11 July 1801. He appears to have used telescopes and lenses of his own design; his &quot;Grand Chercheur&quot; (&quot;Great Seeker&quot;) seems to have been an instrument with large aperture and short focal length, similar to a &quot;comet seeker&quot;. However, he was not an especially diligent recorder of his observations, and his notes were often extremely vague. However, he found approximately 75% of all comets in this period.

In 1813 he gained the position of Assistant Astronomer at Marseille Observatory.

In 1819, Pons became the director of the new observatory at Marlia near Lucca, which he left in 1825 to teach astronomy at La Specola, in Florence. Around that time he accepted the opportunity to become Director of the Florence Observatory at the request of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

He discovered five periodic comets, three of which, 7P/Pons–Winnecke, 12P/Pons–Brooks and 273P/Pons–Gambart, bear his name. One observed on 26 November 1818 was named Comet Encke (now 2P/Enke) after Johann Franz Encke, who calculated its orbit and its remarkably short (3.3 y) period (Encke, however, continued to refer to the comet as &quot;Pons&#x27;s Comet&quot; or &quot;Comet of Pons&quot;). Pons also co-discovered the comet formerly known as &quot;Pons–Coggia–Winnecke–Forbes&quot; and today known as 27P/Crommelin after Andrew Crommelin, who calculated its orbit.

Pons received the French Academy of Sciences&#x27;s Lalande Prize in 1818 for his discovery of three comets in that year. He won it again in 1820 (jointly with Joseph Nicollet) for further comet discoveries at Marlia and for an unmatched third time in 1827 (jointly with Jean-Félix Adolphe Gambart) for discovering another seven comets at the Florence observatory.

By 1827, Pons&#x27;s eyesight had begun to fail, and he retired from observing altogether shortly before his death, on 14 October 1831. In his honour, a Moon crater was named after him.

==Record and legacy==
Pons is noted for discovering 37 comets in the early 1800s. As of 1960 this was recognized as the greatest number of comets discovered by a single person.

Of the 37, 28 were determined to have parabolic orbits, and three did not have enough observation to determine an orbit. However, many of his discoveries fueled the discovery or recovery of what were later recognized as periodic comets, including Comet Pons-Brook and Comet Pons-Winnecke.

The comet 273P/Pons–Gambart, which Pons had observed in 1827, was recovered in 2012.

<doc id="443267" wikidata="Q4731177" url="?curid=443267" title="Allatostatin">
<text>Allatostatins are neuropeptide hormones in insects and crustacea. They have a twofold function: they both inhibit the generation of juvenile hormone and reduce their food intake. They are therefore putative targets for insecticide research.

==Types==

There are three distinct Allatostatin types: A, B, and C. Allatostatin C&#x27;s have 3 subtypes as a result of gene multiplication: C, CC, and CCC. Each Allatostatin type has a unique evolutionary history resulting in distinct conservation and functions across the animal kingdom. Although originally identified in different insects, all three type are found in &quot;Drosophila (needs source)&quot;. 

=== Allatostatin A ===
Allatostatin A (AstA) peptides are found in all arthropods and contain a C-terminus Y/FXFGLamide. In Drosophila, there are 4 AstA peptides (AstA-1, AstA-2, AstA-3, AstA-4) and 2 AstA receptors (AstA-R1 and AstA-R2). The AstA receptor is a GIRK1 channel and is homologous to the mammalian galanin receptor

==Control of food intake==

Allatostatin is found in the cells in a small neuronal cluster, the frontal ganglion. It is also present in the axons which leave the frontal ganglion and run across the surface of the gut. Application of low concentrations of Allatostatin inhibit the spontaneous contractions of the gut. All three forms of Allatostatin appear to inhibit gut motility in all the insects which have been tested.

==Interaction with juvenile hormone==

Juvenile hormone is synthesised in the corpora allata. In every insect tested, at least one of the three types of Allatostatin inhibits the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone. This is achieved by paracrine release of Allatostatin from neurons in the brain which terminate in the corpora allata. The signal is transduced by GPCR receptors, but the intracellular pathway is not yet known. Other amine and neuropeptide neurotransmitters may also inhibit juvenile hormone biosynthesis.

<text>The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) was the parliamentary party of the British Labour Party in the European Parliament. The EPLP was part of the pan-European Group of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), (with MEPs from sister parties such as the French Socialist Party, the German SPD, the Swedish Social Democrats and Dutch Labour Party), and which is the parliamentary wing of the Party of European Socialists (PES), to which Labour was (and remains) affiliated. 

Like other national delegations, the EPLP had its own leadership and spokespeople representing Labour in Brussels and Strasbourg (and the EPLP in the UK).

Several Labour MEPs went on to careers in Westminster, including John Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister, Geoff Hoon as Minister for Europe and subsequently Defence Secretary, Ann Clwyd as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Joyce Quin and Glenys Kinnock, both as Ministers for Europe, and Richard Caborn as Minister for Sport.

The EPLP ceased to exist after the UK left the European Union in January 2020. At the time of dissolution, Labour had 10 Members of the European Parliament.

==Leader==
The leader of the EPLP had a seat on the Labour Party National Executive Committee and attended shadow cabinet meetings.

===List of Leaders of the European Parliamentary Labour Party===
==Positions in the European Parliament and related bodies==
Labour figures held, over the years of UK membership, a number of key positions in the EU, including many held by Labour MEPs in the European Parliament. These included:

*1 leader of the S&amp;D Group Pauline Green
*4 Vice-presidents of the Parliament, including the longest serving one ever, David Martin
*12 Chairs of Parliamentary committees, including the longest serving Ken Collins
*The European Parliament&#x27;s rapporteurs on the Maastricht Treaty, the Amsterdam Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty David Martin and Richard Corbett
*The draftsman of the revised Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament Richard Corbett
*2 Secretaries General of the Group Julian Priestley and David Harley
*1 Secretary General of the Parliament Julian Priestley 
*1 President of the PES Robin Cook
*1 President of the Commission Roy Jenkins
*1 EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Cathy Ashton
EPLP members were frequently elected as the S&amp;D Group&#x27;s Committee Co-ordinators, acting as spokespeople for the Group in their respective parliamentary committees and on the subjects they covered.</text><links>

<text>Tourist Season is a 1986 novel by Carl Hiaasen. It was his first solo novel, after co-writing several mystery/thriller novels with William Montalbano.

==Plot==
&quot;Las Noches de Diciembre&quot; (Spanish, &quot;The Nights of December&quot;) is a small terrorist cell led by rogue newspaper columnist Skip Wiley, calling himself &quot;El Fuego&quot;. Skip believes that the only way to save Florida&#x27;s natural beauty from destruction is to violently dissuade tourists from visiting and/or settling in the state. Recruiting three comrades with similar vendettas against the Florida establishment, they begin a spree of flashy kidnappings, murders and bombings to frighten off new arrivals. Their first victim is B.D. &quot;Sparky&quot; Harper, the head of Miami&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce. Sparky&#x27;s body is found stuffed into an oversized suitcase, dressed in a garish tourist outfit, smeared with sunscreen and with his legs amputated. Next, the group starts kidnapping and killing random tourists and Florida residents, many of whom are fed to a giant crocodile nicknamed &quot;Pavlov&quot;.

Brian Keyes, a private investigator and former reporter for the Miami &quot;Sun&quot;, is hired to help defend petty burglar Ernesto Cabal, who was caught driving Sparky&#x27;s stolen car. Brian does not believe that Ernesto killed Sparky, but Miami police dismiss him. Ernesto commits suicide when told by his own lawyer that the case is a lost cause. Brian is then hired by Nell Bellamy to find her missing husband (the first tourist victim) and by &quot;Sun&quot; editor Cab Mulcahy to locate the missing Skip. After an encounter with his ex-girlfriend Jenna (who is now dating Skip), Brian tracks Skip to the Everglades and is captured by &quot;Las Noches&quot;. Revealing himself, Skip tells Brian to return to Miami and spread the word of the group&#x27;s demands. He then has Brian watch as their latest victim is fed to Pavlov. Brian tries to stop the murder and is stabbed in the back by one of Skip&#x27;s followers, a Cuban named Jesús Bernal. He is returned to Miami and treated in the hospital.

Since it is the start of tourist season, the police&#x27;s initial reaction to Brian&#x27;s warnings is to engage in a cover-up, dismissing the &quot;Las Noches&quot; communiques as a hoax. &quot;Sun&quot; reporter Ricky Bloodworth uncovers the letters and writes an article but misspells the name of the group as &quot;Las &quot;Nachos&quot;&quot;. The terrorists retaliate with several bombings, forcing the authorities to take them seriously. Brian&#x27;s old friend, Detective Al Garcia, is appointed head of a task force to catch the terrorists. Based on Skip&#x27;s hints, Brian, Cab and Al deduce that the terrorists plan to kidnap Miami&#x27;s much-touted Orange Bowl Queen. Since civic leaders refuse to cancel the Orange Bowl Parade or to provide the beauty queen with visible police protection, Al suggests hiring Brian as her undercover bodyguard. Brian finds the beauty queen, Kara Lynn Shivers, to be an intelligent and sensible girl who is only in the beauty queen &quot;racket&quot; to indulge her father. Brian and Kara Lynn grow closer, eventually developing a relationship.

While escorting Kara Lynn home from a tennis game, Brian catches Jesús loitering in the parking lot and beats him into submission with a racket. Furious that Jesús has foiled the group&#x27;s element of surprise, Skip devises a new plan. Jesús, aching for reinstatement with the anti-Castro terrorist group he was expelled from, abandons &quot;Las Noches&quot; and sends a mail bomb to Al. Farcically, the bomb is instead opened by an over-eager Ricky, illegally sifting Garcia&#x27;s mail for clues about the terrorists. Because of Jesús&#x27; poor construction, the bomb only injures Ricky. Al never learns that the bomb was addressed to him, and the bombing is attributed to &quot;Las Noches&quot;. The next evening, Skip uses a helicopter to bombard the deck of a cruise ship with shopping bags containing live snakes. As the panicked passengers dive off the ship and the Coast Guard is summoned, the helicopter unexpectedly crashes at sea before it reaches land. No bodies are recovered. Miami&#x27;s civic leaders assume the terrorists are dead, but Brian and Al insist that their security precautions remain in place until after the parade.

In a last-ditch effort, Jesús kidnaps Al at gunpoint and drives him to Key Largo to be executed. Al is wounded in the shoulder by Jesús&#x27; shotgun, but Brian manages to track them down and kills Jesús. To Brian&#x27;s surprise, the parade proceeds without any sign of &quot;Las Noches&quot;. The following evening, during the Orange Bowl, he belatedly realizes that Kara Lynn is supposed to make a brief appearance during the game&#x27;s halftime show and figures out that &quot;Las Noches&quot; has chosen that moment to strike. Kara Lynn is kidnapped and carried out of the stadium on an airboat, though one of the terrorists, ex-football player &quot;Viceroy&quot; Wilson, is shot to death by her unofficial escort. Brian deduces from Skip&#x27;s old press clippings that he has taken Kara Lynn to Osprey Island, a small nature preserve in the middle of Biscayne Bay. There, Skip reveals to Kara Lynn that the island has been mined with dynamite, to be exploded at dawn, to allow for the construction of a new condominium. He plans to leave her there, with the island&#x27;s other remaining wildlife, so that her death will send a message to Florida&#x27;s greedy developers.

Before Skip can depart, Brian arrives and disables him with a bullet to the leg. Skip initially refuses to tell Brian where he has anchored his boat, prepared to let the dynamite claim the three of them all at once. However, upon realizing that Brian has brought Jenna along, he surrenders the boat&#x27;s location. To Brian&#x27;s surprise, he refuses to go along with them. As they speed away from the island, Keyes, Kara Lynn and Jenna look back and see Skip is climbing a tree, trying to scare a bald eagle nesting there into taking flight before the dynamite explodes. The novel ends just as the &quot;all clear&quot; signal for the detonation is sounded, with the three of them whispering the same prayer: &quot;Please fly away.&quot;

*Jesús Bernal (Cuban, late 20s): formerly a member of an anti-Castro group (the &quot;First Weekend in July Movement&quot;) in Florida seeking to drive Castro from power and let Cuban exiles return home. Jesús was expelled from the movement after one mistake too many. Overflowing with &quot;machismo&quot;, he thinks of himself as the most experienced and well-trained of &quot;Las Noches&quot; at committing terrorist acts, but in fact is completely inept at anything except writing snappy press releases (a number of farcical situations in the novel arise from his attempts to plant homemade bombs). His militant politics are also something of a pose, since he was born and raised in New Jersey, graduated from Dartmouth College, and has never been to Cuba in his life.
*Tommy Tigertail (Seminole, mid-20s): A member of the Seminole Nation, and the source of &quot;Las Noches&quot; funding. Tommy is an innovator, largely responsible for turning white people&#x27;s fetish for bingo into a multi-million dollar business for his tribe, and is also deeply aggrieved by the white men&#x27;s actions against his ancestors, and their destruction of Florida&#x27;s natural beauty.
*Pavlov: a giant American crocodile.
*Jenna: Skip&#x27;s girlfriend, Brian&#x27;s ex-girlfriend.

==Themes==
The book is not only an example of the crime fiction genre, but a satire as well, of many subjects from tourism to sports to race relations to the newsroom. It also contains examples of the literary device of the red herring; for example, deep background is given to characters who appear briefly only to die off, which keeps the reader guessing as to who will make it to the end of the book.

Hiaasen is a newspaper columnist from the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. In an interview, he said that he took much of his inspiration from his work on the &quot;Herald&quot;. Readers may believe that Skip Wiley is a slightly more crazed version of the author; both are newspaper columnists, and both are very passionate and entertaining writers. One theme that persists in the book is moral ambiguity; while Brian Keyes understands the value of Skip Wiley&#x27;s ends, Keyes would have preferred a less violent means. Their conflict arises as a matter of where they place their allegiance: Brian Keyes to humankind, and Skip Wiley to the wild.

Hiaasen&#x27;s novels typically deal with distinctly Floridian themes such as environmental destruction of unique ecosystems, the inability to sustain rapid growth, and crooked politicians, among others.

==Cultural references==
*Jimmy Buffett, a friend of Hiaasen&#x27;s, based a song on the novel, &quot;The Ballad of Skip Wiley&quot;. The song also incorporates Hiaasen&#x27;s character of former Governor Clinton &quot;Skink&quot; Tyree, a later creation of Hiaasen.
*Garcia comments that &quot;Las Noches&quot; crimes are making Richard Speck, a serial killer, look tame by comparison; likewise, when Jenna claims that Skip is a better man than Brian because he &quot;makes things happen,&quot; Brian retorts, &quot;so did Juan Corona[.]&quot; Corona was a Mexican-American serial killer with at least 25 known victims.
*The terrorist group that Jesus Bernal belongs to, &quot;The First Weekend in July Movement,&quot; is fictional, but Bernal refers to several real-life anti-Castro terrorist groups operating in South Florida, including Omega 7 and Alpha 66.
*When Reed Shivers, Kara Lynn&#x27;s father, dismisses the risk to his daughter&#x27;s safety from &quot;a bunch of losers,&quot; Keyes reminds him that &quot;one nut can shoot the damn President in Dealey Plaza,&quot; referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald.
*There are multiple references to the early history of Florida that most of the novel&#x27;s characters remain willfully ignorant of, including the Second Seminole War, Miami&#x27;s initial founding as Fort Dallas, and the actions of early land barons such as Henry Flagler and Carl Fisher.
*Sparky Harper inaugurated the Orange Bowl Friendship Cruise in 1980, but attendance was low during the first year as a result of the Liberty City riots and the Mariel boatlift.

==Continuity with Hiaasen&#x27;s other works==
* Though Clinton Tyree, one of Hiaasen&#x27;s few recurring characters, makes his debut in the subsequent novel &quot;Double Whammy&quot;, Tyree shares much of Skip Wiley&#x27;s passionate environmentalism and anger at corruption, though not his indiscriminate murderousness.
* Al Garcia makes his first appearance as one of Hiaasen&#x27;s recurring characters.
* During the civic meeting to discuss &quot;Las Noches&quot;, a city leader laments half-jokingly that he wishes they had targeted Disney World instead of Miami. In Hiaasen&#x27;s subsequent novel &quot;Native Tongue&quot;, the fictional &quot;Amazing Kingdom&quot; theme park carries heavy influence with South Florida politicians, largely because they blame Disney World for siphoning tourists&#x27; custom from South Florida to Orlando.
* Several of Hiaasen&#x27;s novels feature a recurring joke that radiology is a &quot;soft&quot; medical discipline and those that practice it are not &quot;real&quot; doctors. This novel features the first such joke: aboard the Orange Bowl cruise, a tourist couple introduce themselves as a doctor and his wife; a few minutes later when his wife is bitten by a snake the &quot;doctor&quot; does nothing, explaining that &quot;I&#x27;m just a radiologist!&quot;
* Tommy Tigertail, the only surviving member of &quot;Las Noches&quot;, reappears peripherally in Hiaasen&#x27;s novel &quot;Nature Girl&quot;. He is a prominent and influential elder of the Seminole tribe and has recanted his more radical sentiments. He also tells his nephew Sammy about Wiley, whom Tommy believes was reincarnated as a bald eagle. In an ironic scene, just such an eagle perches briefly over the nature-hating antagonist of that novel Boyd Shreave, and defecates on his head.
* Tommy dwells several times on the topic of the Second Seminole War in &quot;Tourist Season&quot;. His &quot;Nature Girl&quot; is the first novel to return to the topic.

==Other media==
An audiobook version of &quot;Tourist Season&quot; was released in 1998 by Recorded Books. The audiobook, read by George Wilson, is unabridged and runs 13 hours 48 minutes over 12 CDs.

<text>David Rittenhouse Porter (October 31, 1788 – August 6, 1867) was the ninth governor of Pennsylvania. Voted into office during the controversial 1838 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, which was characterized by intense anti-Masonic and anti-abolitionist rhetoric during and after the contest that sparked the post-election Buckshot War, he served as the state&#x27;s chief executive officer from 1839 to 1845.

His son, Horace Porter, who was the aide-de-camp of Union General Ulysses S. Grant during the American Civil War, served as the United States Ambassador to France from 1897 to 1905.

==Early life and education==
Porter, the first governor under the State Constitution of 1838, was born October 31, 1788, near Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, spending his boyhood at Selma Mansion, a home built by his father in 1794. The son of Elizabeth (née Parker) and Andrew Porter, the Revolutionary War officer, he was also the brother of George Bryan Porter who became the Territorial Governor of Michigan from 1831 to 1834 and James Madison Porter who became the Secretary of War from 1843 to 1844.

Porter received a classical education at Norristown Academy. In 1813, he moved to Huntingdon where he studied law with Edward Shippen and eventually purchased an iron works.

Porter also became a member of the Huntingdon Lodge of the Freemasons, rising to the levels of Grand Master of his lodge and Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic district in which his lodge was located.

Due to the recession that followed the War of 1812 and his resulting business failure, his life changed markedly. Turning to politics in 1819, he also became a family man, marrying Josephine McDermott in 1820.

==Career==
In 1819, Porter became a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing Huntingdon County in 1819 and 1820. He then served in row offices in Huntingdon County and as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 8th district from 1835 to 1838.

A resident of Huntingdon County in 1838, Porter was nominated for governor by the Jacksonian Democrats in order to mend the split between former Governor George Wolf and the Rev. Henry A. P. Muhlenberg, as well as defeat incumbent Governor Joseph Ritner&#x27;s bid for a second term. His list of supporters included U.S. Senator James Buchanan, who would later become the 15th president of the United States.

A member of the Huntingdon Lodge of the Freemasons, who had risen to the levels of Grand Master of his lodge and Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic district in which his lodge was located, his candidacy received intense scrutiny from his opponents, many of whom were members of the Anti-Masonic Party.

After years of Anti-Masonic &quot;witch hunts,&quot; however, many prospective voters had tired of the vitriol, giving Porter an opening to effect change. He won the election with a slim 5,500-voter margin. The election result was bitterly contested by Ritner&#x27;s supporters to the point of violence. Known as the &quot;Buckshot War&quot;, Governor Ritner began making plans in Harrisburg to order military intervention to ensure the peaceful transition of government, but members of the legislature worked together to reach consensus and certified the election results before the situation could escalate further, bringing the conflict to an end a few days before Porter&#x27;s inauguration. A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on January 15, 1839.

When he assumed office, Porter faced the difficulties of a statewide recession that had begun in 1837 and a state bureaucracy that had spent heavily during the previous years. He pushed for, and then obtained, a tax on persons in professions and the trades similar to the state&#x27;s income tax, and also secured Pennsylvania&#x27;s first capital stock share tax while reducing state spending and hiring. Despite these financial changes, his administration was able to continue the state&#x27;s expansion of its canal and railroad systems, including efforts to connect those systems to the Mississippi River and St. Louis, Missouri, as well as state capitals in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.

In 1840, Porter called a special session of the legislature &quot;for consideration of certain financial matters of the Commonwealth.&quot;

Porter then easily won re-election in 1841, defeating John Banks, the first Whig gubernatorial candidate to run without having to form a coalition with the Anti-Masonic Party. During his Inaugural Address on January 18, 1842, Porter recalled the state&#x27;s financial difficulties and presented an overview of his plan for his second term:

&quot;The public debt is substantially the same,—the public burdens only increased to meet obligations then incurred—the public improvements are more productive, and the public revenues essentially augmented. Our banking system, then tottering to its fall, has been examined with searching scrutiny by the public eye—its faults have been detected, its unsoundness exposed, and its dangers guarded against by the dissemination of correct information. The wild and headlong spirit of speculation has been checked. The undue multiplication of the public debt has been restrained, and improvident and wasteful expenditures of the public funds arrested. Experience has painfully demonstrated to the conviction of all, what the sagacious foresight of some apprehended—that nations, like individuals, when they make &#x27;too great haste to get rich&#x27; are in danger of bankruptcy and ruin.

We had not yet fortunately, reached the fatal point, from which there was no prospect of escape; but we were verging so near, as to render our rescue alike timely and perilous. Cases of individual hardship no doubt exist; patience, industry and enterprise will effect a cure in most of them; and for those that are remediless, we can but express our sympathy and sorrow... The Commonwealth, herself, after a short struggle borne with fortitude characteristic of her citizens, and the integrity that they would scorn to tarnish, will overcome all her pecuniary difficulties—will faithfully fulfill her engagements and proudly maintain her honesty and her fame.&quot;

By the time Porter had begun that address in 1842, Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature had already begun what would become one of the longest sessions in state history, during which it took up the review and debate of a one-mill real estate and personal property tax increase that was pushed by Porter. Lasting two hundred and four calendar days, that session ran from January 4 to July 26. After it was over, Porter signed the new tax increase into effect.

Porter&#x27;s second term also saw legislative action which abolished the practice of imprisoning people for not paying their debts, as well as the Philadelphia nativist riots of 1844, during which Porter sent in state military troops to quell anti-Catholic violence.

During Porter&#x27;s two terms of executive leadership, Pennsylvania&#x27;s total debt rose twenty-five percent, but the state was able to pay off the interest on that debt by using revenues that had been generated during his tenure. In addition, he was able to curtail efforts by some General Assembly members to redefine constitutional separations between the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the state&#x27;s government.

As his second term wound down, Porter decided to retire from politics because Pennsylvania&#x27;s revised state constitution prohibited him from seeking a third term and because he had developed increasingly difficult relations with both his own party, which opposed his support of protective tariffs, and members of the assembly who had tried to impeach him.

Returning to the private sector, where he resumed his iron manufacturing business in 1844, he oversaw construction of the first anthracite coal furnace for iron in south central Pennsylvania and operated his own railroad, which linked his furnace to Pennsylvania&#x27;s larger railroad and canal lines. He then endorsed James Buchanan during his 1856 run for president of the United States.

Porter also subsequently helped to promote the extension of the transcontinental railroad through Texas, becoming an associate in the incorporation of the New Mexican Railway Company in 1860.

A vocal opponent of the secession of southern states from the Union, Porter&#x27;s views were shared by his son, Horace Porter, who distinguished himself in battle during the American Civil War, first as a lieutenant colonel and then as a general. As aide-de-camp to General Grant, the younger Porter was present to witness the surrender of General Lee, and later wrote a book that has been described as the definitive account of the events at Appomattox Court House.

==Illness, death and interment==
Falling ill after attending a church meeting in Harrisburg during the winter of 1866-1867, Porter&#x27;s health continued to decline over a period of several months. He died on August 6, 1867, at the age of 78, and was buried in the Harrisburg Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Porter Street in Philadelphia is named in his honor. His grandson William Wagener Porter was a prominent Philadelphia attorney and legal author.

<text>BBC Radio Oxford is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Oxfordshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios in the Summertown area of Oxford.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 87,000 listeners and a 3.5% share as of December 2023.

==History==
*Early 1970 – Oxford was chosen as a location for BBC local radio and premises in Summertown were found at 242–254 Banbury Road. The site is known as Barclay House and was previously a Rolls-Royce showroom.
*Mid 1970 – Staff were recruited, a small number with BBC experience but mostly local people, and the studios at Summertown are built.
*September 1970 – On air staff trained at the Langham Hotel in London.
*Early October 1970 – Three weeks of test transmissions begin.
*29 October 1970 – BBC Radio Oxford officially begins transmission at 5 pm on 95.0 MHz VHF.
*31 December 1970 – &quot;Radio Times&quot; lists BBC Radio Oxford programmes for the first time.
*5 October 1972 – Due to high demand by residents who did not have FM on their radios, BBC Radio Oxford begins broadcasting on 202 metres medium wave (1484 kHz). The station would also be available on the local cable network on &#x27;Rediffusion Channel A&#x27;.
*26 June 1973 – BBC Radio Oxford moves its VHF frequency to 95.2 MHz to avoid interference with BBC Radio London on 94.9 MHz.
*22 May 1976 – The station opens its studios to the public for an open weekend.
*October 1980 – BBC Radio Oxford celebrates 10 years on air by publishing a magazine.
*April / May 1989 – BBC Radio Oxford moves to purpose built studios at 269 Banbury Road, Summertown.
*9 April 1996 – Radio Oxford merges with BBC Radio Berkshire to form the short-lived BBC Thames Valley FM. Local programming is restricted to separate news bulletins for the two counties.
*14 February 2000 – Radio Oxford is revived, although most output continues to be shared with Radio Berkshire.
*2004 – BBC Radio Oxford relaunches with a new line-up of presenters. By now, the station has regained a full line-up of local programming.
*April 2008 – The station is rebranded as &quot;BBC Oxford 95.2FM&quot; as part of a relaunch involving the regional TV news programme &quot;BBC Oxford News&quot; (previously &quot;BBC South Today Oxford&quot;).
*October 2010 – The station celebrates its 40th anniversary and reverts to the Radio Oxford branding.
*21 December 2012 – BBC Radio Oxford&#x27;s DAB service is launched.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Oxford studios from 6am to 10pm on weekdays, from 6am to 6pm and 8pm to 9pm on Saturdays, and from 6am to 6pm and 10pm to 1am on Sundays.

Off-peak programming, including the late show from 10pm to 1am, originates from BBC Radio Solent in Southampton and BBC Radio Berkshire in Reading.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Oxford simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London.

<doc id="443293" wikidata="Q107685" url="?curid=443293" title="Australopithecus afarensis">
<text>Australopithecus afarensis is an extinct species of australopithecine which lived from about 3.9–2.9 million years ago (mya) in the Pliocene of East Africa. The first fossils were discovered in the 1930s, but major fossil finds would not take place until the 1970s. From 1972 to 1977, the International Afar Research Expedition—led by anthropologists Maurice Taieb, Donald Johanson and Yves Coppens—unearthed several hundreds of hominin specimens in Hadar, Ethiopia, the most significant being the exceedingly well-preserved skeleton AL 288-1 (&quot;Lucy&quot;) and the site AL 333 (&quot;the First Family&quot;). Beginning in 1974, Mary Leakey led an expedition into Laetoli, Tanzania, and notably recovered fossil trackways. In 1978, the species was first described, but this was followed by arguments for splitting the wealth of specimens into different species given the wide range of variation which had been attributed to sexual dimorphism (normal differences between males and females). &quot;A. afarensis&quot; probably descended from &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and is hypothesised to have given rise to &quot;Homo&quot;, though the latter is debated.

&quot;A. afarensis&quot; had a tall face, a delicate brow ridge, and prognathism (the jaw jutted outwards). The jawbone was quite robust, similar to that of gorillas. The living size of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is debated, with arguments for and against marked size differences between males and females. Lucy measured perhaps in height and , but she was rather small for her species. In contrast, a presumed male was estimated at and . A perceived difference in male and female size may simply be sampling bias. The leg bones as well as the Laetoli fossil trackways suggest &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was a competent biped, though somewhat less efficient at walking and slower at running than humans. The arm and shoulder bones have some similar aspects to those of orangutans and gorillas, which has variously been interpreted as either evidence of partial tree-dwelling (arboreality), or basal traits inherited from the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor with no adaptive functionality.

&quot;A. afarensis&quot; was probably a generalist omnivore of both C3 forest plants and C4 CAM savanna plants—and perhaps creatures which ate such plants—and was able to exploit a variety of different food sources. Similarly, &quot;A. afarensis&quot; appears to have inhabited a wide range of habitats with no real preference, inhabiting open grasslands or woodlands, shrublands, and lake- or riverside forests. Potential evidence of stone tool use would indicate meat was also a dietary component. Marked sexual dimorphism in primates typically corresponds to a polygynous society and low dimorphism to monogamy, but the group dynamics of early hominins is difficult to predict with accuracy. Early hominins may have fallen prey to the large carnivores of the time, such as big cats and hyenas.
==Taxonomy==
===Research history===
Beginning in the 1930s, some of the most ancient hominin remains of the time dating to 3.8–2.9 million years ago were recovered from East Africa. Because &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; fossils were commonly being discovered throughout the 1920s and &#x27;40s in South Africa, these remains were often provisionally classified as &quot;Australopithecus&quot; aff. &quot;africanus&quot;. The first to identify a human fossil was German explorer Ludwig Kohl-Larsen in 1939 by the headwaters of the Gerusi River (near Laetoli, Tanzania), who encountered a maxilla. In 1948, German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig proposed classifying it into a new genus, &quot;Praeanthropus&quot;, but he failed to give a species name. In 1950, German anthropologist Hans Weinert proposed classifying it as &quot;Meganthropus africanus&quot;, but this was largely ignored. In 1955, M.S. Şenyürek proposed the combination &quot;Praeanthropus africanus&quot;. Major collections were made in Laetoli, Tanzania, on an expedition beginning in 1974 directed by British palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey, and in Hadar, Ethiopia, from 1972 to 1977 by the International Afar Research Expedition (IARE) formed by French geologist Maurice Taieb, American palaeoanthropologist Donald Johanson and Breton anthropologist Yves Coppens. These fossils were remarkably well preserved and many had associated skeletal aspects. In 1973, the IARE team unearthed the first knee joint, AL 129-1, and showed the earliest example at the time of bipedalism. On 24 November 1974, Johanson and graduate student Tom Gray discovered the extremely well-preserved skeleton AL 288–1, commonly referred to as &quot;Lucy&quot; (named after the 1967 Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; which was playing on their tape recorder that evening). In 1975, the IARE recovered 216 specimens belonging to 13 individuals, AL 333 &quot;the First Family&quot; (though the individuals were not necessarily related). In 1976, Leakey and colleagues discovered fossil trackways, and preliminarily classified Laetoli remains into &quot;Homo&quot; spp., attributing &quot;Australopithecus&quot;-like traits as evidence of them being transitional fossils.
In 1978, Johanson, Tim D. White and Coppens classified the hundreds of specimens collected thus far from both Hadar and Laetoli into a single new species, &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, and considered the apparently wide range of variation a result of sexual dimorphism. The species name honours the Afar Region of Ethiopia where the majority of the specimens had been recovered from. They later selected the jawbone LH 4 as the holotype specimen because of its preservation quality and because White had already fully described and illustrated it the year before.
&quot;A. afarensis&quot; is known only from East Africa. Beyond Laetoli and the Afar Region, the species has been recorded in Kenya at Koobi Fora and possibly Lothagam; and elsewhere in Ethiopia at Woranso-Mille, Maka, Belohdelie, Ledi-Geraru and Fejej. The frontal bone fragment BEL-VP-1/1 from the Middle Awash, Afar Region, Ethiopia, dating to 3.9 million years ago has typically been assigned to &quot;A. anamensis&quot; based on age, but may be assignable to &quot;A. afarensis&quot; because it exhibits a derived form of postorbital constriction. This would mean &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and &quot;A. anamensis&quot; coexisted for at least 100,000 years. In 2005, a second adult specimen preserving both skull and body elements, AL 438–1, was discovered in Hadar. In 2006, an infant partial skeleton, DIK-1-1, was unearthed at Dikika, Afar Region. In 2015, an adult partial skeleton, KSD-VP-1/1, was recovered from Woranso-Mille.

For a long time, &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was the oldest known African great ape until the 1994 description of the 4.4-million-year-old &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;, and a few earlier or contemporary taxa have been described since, including the 4-million-year-old &quot;A. anamensis&quot; in 1995, the 3.5-million-year-old &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; in 2001, the 6-million-year-old &quot;Orrorin tugenensis&quot; in 2001, and the 7- to 6-million-year-old &quot;Sahelanthropus tchadensis&quot; in 2002. Bipedalism was once thought to have evolved in australopithecines, but it is now thought to have begun evolving much earlier in habitually arboreal primates. The earliest claimed date for the beginnings of an upright spine and a primarily vertical body plan is 21.6 million years ago in the Early Miocene with &quot;Morotopithecus bishopi&quot;.
===Classification===
&quot;A. afarensis&quot; is now a widely accepted species, and it is now generally thought that &quot;Homo&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot; are sister taxa deriving from &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, but the classification of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species is in disarray. &quot;Australopithecus&quot; is considered a grade taxon whose members are united by their similar physiology rather than close relations with each other over other hominin genera. It is unclear how any &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species relate to each other, but it is generally thought that a population of &quot;A. anamensis&quot; evolved into &quot;A. afarensis&quot;.

In 1979, Johanson and White proposed that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was the last common ancestor between &quot;Homo&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, supplanting &quot;A. africanus&quot; in this role. Considerable debate of the validity of this species followed, with proposals for synonymising them with &quot;A. africanus&quot; or recognising multiple species from the Laetoli and Hadar remains. In 1980, South African palaeoanthropologist Phillip V. Tobias proposed reclassifying the Laetoli specimens as &quot;A. africanus afarensis&quot; and the Hadar specimens as &quot;A. afr. aethiopicus&quot;. The skull KNM-ER 1470 (now &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;) was at first dated to 2.9 million years ago, which cast doubt on the ancestral position of both &quot;A. afarensis&quot; or &quot;A. africanus&quot;, but it has been re-dated to about 2 million years ago. Several &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species have since been postulated to represent the ancestor to &quot;Homo&quot;, but the 2013 discovery of the earliest &quot;Homo&quot; specimen, LD 350-1, 2.8 million years old (older than almost all other &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species) from the Afar Region could potentially affirm &quot;A. afarensis&quot;″ ancestral position. However, &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is also argued to have been too derived (too specialised), due to resemblance in jaw anatomy to the robust australopithecines, to have been a human ancestor.

Palaeoartist Walter Ferguson has proposed splitting &quot;A. afarensis&quot; into &quot;&quot;H. antiquus&quot;, a relict dryopithecine &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; (now &quot;Kenyapithecus&quot;) and a subspecies of &quot;A. africanus&quot;. His recommendations have largely been ignored. In 2003, Spanish writer Camilo José Cela Conde and evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala proposed reinstating &quot;Praeanthropus&quot;&quot; including &quot;A. afarensis&quot; alongside &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot;, &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot; and &quot;A. garhi&quot;. In 2004, Danish biologist Bjarne Westergaard and geologist Niels Bonde proposed splitting off &quot;&quot;Homo hadar&quot; with the 3.2-million-year-old partial skull AL 333–45 as the holotype, because a foot from the First Family was apparently more humanlike than that of Lucy. In 2011, Bonde agreed with Ferguson that Lucy should be split into a new species, though erected a new genus as &quot;Afaranthropus antiquus&quot;&quot;.

In 1996, a 3.6-million-year-old jaw from Koro Toro, Chad, originally classified as &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was split off into a new species as &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot;. In 2015, some 3.5- to 3.3-million-year-old jaw specimens from the Afar Region (the same time and place as &quot;A. afarensis&quot;) were classified as a new species as &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot;, and the recognition of this species would call into question the species designation of fossils currently assigned to &quot;A. afarensis&quot;. However, the validity of &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot; and &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot; is debated. Wood and Boyle (2016) stated there was &quot;low confidence&quot; that &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot; and &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot; are distinct species, with &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; perhaps being indistinct from the latter two.

==Anatomy==
===Skull===
&quot;A. afarensis&quot; had a tall face, a delicate brow ridge, and prognathism (the jaw jutted outwards). One of the biggest skulls, AL 444–2, is about the size of a female gorilla skull. The first relatively complete jawbone was discovered in 2002, AL 822–1. This specimen strongly resembles the deep and robust gorilla jawbone. However, unlike gorillas, the strength of the sagittal and nuchal crests (which support the temporalis muscle used in biting) do not vary between sexes. The crests are similar to those of chimpanzees and female gorillas. Compared to earlier hominins, the incisors of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; are reduced in breadth, the canines reduced in size and lost the honing mechanism which continually sharpens them, the premolars are molar-shaped, and the molars are taller. The molars of australopiths are generally large and flat with thick enamel, which is ideal for crushing hard and brittle foods.

The brain volume of Lucy was estimated to have been 365–417 cc, specimen AL 822-1 about 374–392 cc, AL 333-45 about 486–492 cc, and AL 444-2 about 519–526 cc. This would make for an average of about 445 cc. The brain volumes of the infant (about 2.5 years of age) specimens DIK-1-1 and AL 333-105 are 273–277 and 310–315 cc, respectively. Using these measurements, the brain growth rate of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was closer to the growth rate of modern humans than to the faster rate in chimpanzees. Though brain growth was prolonged, the duration was nonetheless much shorter than modern humans, which is why the adult &quot;A. afarensis&quot; brain was so much smaller. The &quot;A. afarensis&quot; brain was likely organised like non-human ape brains, with no evidence for humanlike brain configuration.

===Size===

&quot;A. afarensis&quot; specimens apparently exhibit a wide range of variation, which is generally explained as marked sexual dimorphism with males much bigger than females. In 1991, American anthropologist Henry McHenry estimated body size by measuring the joint sizes of the leg bones and scaling down a human to meet that size. This yielded for a presumed male (AL 333–3), whereas Lucy was . In 1992, he estimated that males typically weighed about and females assuming body proportions were more humanlike than apelike. This gives a male to female body mass ratio of 1.52, compared to 1.22 in modern humans, 1.37 in chimpanzees, and about 2 for gorillas and orangutans. However, this commonly cited weight figure used only three presumed-female specimens, of which two were among the smallest specimens recorded for the species. It is also contested if australopiths even exhibited heightened sexual dimorphism at all, which if correct would mean the range of variation is normal body size disparity between different individuals regardless of sex. It has also been argued that the femoral head could be used for more accurate size modeling, and the femoral head size variation was the same for both sexes.

Lucy is one of the most complete Pliocene hominin skeletons, with over 40% preserved, but she was one of the smaller specimens of her species. Nonetheless, she has been the subject of several body mass estimates since her discovery, ranging from for absolute lower and upper bounds. Most studies report ranges within .

For the five makers of the Laetoli fossil trackways (S1, S2, G1, G2 and G3), based on the relationship between footprint length and bodily dimensions in modern humans, S1 was estimated to have been considerably large at about tall and in weight, S2 and , G1 and , G2 and , and G3 and . Based on these, S1 is interpreted to have been a male, and the rest females (G1 and G3 possibly juveniles), with &quot;A. afarensis&quot; being a highly dimorphic species.

===Torso===

DIK-1-1 preserves an oval hyoid bone (which supports the tongue) more similar to those of chimpanzees and gorillas than the bar-shaped hyoid of humans and orangutans. This would suggest the presence of laryngeal air sacs characteristic of non-human African apes (and large gibbons). Air sacs may lower the risk of hyperventilating when producing faster extended call sequences by rebreathing exhaled air from the air sacs. The loss of these in humans could have been a result of speech and resulting low risk of hyperventilating from normal vocalisation patterns.

It was previously thought that the australopithecines&#x27; spine was more like that of non-human apes than humans, with weak neck vertebrae. However, the thickness of the neck vertebrae of KSD-VP-1/1 is similar to that of modern humans. Like humans, the series has a bulge and achieves maximum girth at C5 and 6, which in humans is associated with the brachial plexus, responsible for nerves and muscle innervation in the arms and hands. This could perhaps speak to advanced motor functions in the hands of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and competency at precision tasks compared to non-human apes, possibly implicated in stone tool use or production. However, this could have been involved in head stability or posture rather than dexterity. A.L. 333-101 and A.L. 333-106 lack evidence of this feature. The neck vertebrae of KDS-VP-1/1 indicate that the nuchal ligament, which stabilises the head while distance running in humans and other cursorial creatures, was either not well developed or absent. KSD-VP-1/1, preserving (among other skeletal elements) six rib fragments, indicates that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; had a bell-shaped ribcage instead of the barrel shaped ribcage exhibited in modern humans. Nonetheless, the constriction at the upper ribcage was not so marked as exhibited in non-human great apes and was quite similar to humans. Originally, the vertebral centra preserved in Lucy were interpreted as being the T6, T8, T10, T11 and L3, but a 2015 study instead interpreted them as being T6, T7, T9, T10 and L3. DIK-1-1 shows that australopithecines had twelve thoracic vertebrae like modern humans instead of thirteen like non-human apes. Like humans, australopiths likely had five lumbar vertebrae, and this series was likely long and flexible in contrast to the short and inflexible non-human great ape lumbar series.

===Upper limbs===

Like other australopiths, the &quot;A. afarensis&quot; skeleton exhibits a mosaic anatomy with some aspects similar to modern humans and others to non-human great apes. The pelvis and leg bones clearly indicate weight-bearing ability, equating to habitual bipedalism, but the upper limbs are reminiscent of orangutans, which would indicate arboreal locomotion. However, this is much debated, as tree-climbing adaptations could simply be basal traits inherited from the great ape last common ancestor in the absence of major selective pressures at this stage to adopt a more humanlike arm anatomy.

The shoulder joint is somewhat in a shrugging position, closer to the head, like in non-human apes. Juvenile modern humans have a somewhat similar configuration, but this changes to the normal human condition with age; such a change does not appear to have occurred in &quot;A. afarensis&quot; development. It was once argued that this was simply a byproduct of being a small-bodied species, but the discovery of the similarly sized &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; with a more or less human shoulder configuration and larger &quot;A. afarensis&quot; specimens retaining the shrugging shoulders show this to not have been the case. The scapular spine (reflecting the strength of the back muscles) is closer to the range of gorillas.

The forearm of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is incompletely known, yielding various brachial indexes (radial length divided by humeral length) comparable to non-human great apes at the upper estimate and to modern humans at the lower estimate. The most complete ulna specimen, AL 438–1, is within the range of modern humans and other African apes. However, the L40-19 ulna is much longer, though well below that exhibited in orangutans and gibbons. The AL 438-1 metacarpals are proportionally similar to those of modern humans and orangutans. The &quot;A. afarensis&quot; hand is quite humanlike, though there are some aspects similar to orangutan hands which would have allowed stronger flexion of the fingers, and it probably could not handle large spherical or cylindrical objects very efficiently. Nonetheless, the hand seems to have been able to have produced a precision grip necessary in using stone tools. However, it is unclear if the hand was capable of producing stone tools.

===Lower limbs===
The australopith pelvis is platypelloid and maintains a relatively wider distance between the hip sockets and a more oval shape. Despite being much smaller, Lucy&#x27;s pelvic inlet is wide, about the same breadth as that of a modern human woman. These were likely adaptations to minimise how far the centre of mass drops while walking upright in order to compensate for the short legs (rotating the hips may have been more important for &quot;A. afarensis&quot;). Likewise, later &quot;Homo&quot; could reduce relative pelvic inlet size probably due to the elongation of the legs. Pelvic inlet size may not have been due to fetal head size (which would have increased birth canal and thus pelvic inlet width) as an &quot;A. afarensis&quot; newborn would have had a similar or smaller head size compared to that of a newborn chimpanzee. It is debated if the platypelloid pelvis provided poorer leverage for the hamstrings or not.
The heel bone of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; adults and modern humans have the same adaptations for bipedality, indicating a developed grade of walking. The big toe is not dextrous as is in non-human apes (it is adducted), which would make walking more energy efficient at the expense of arboreal locomotion, no longer able to grasp onto tree branches with the feet. However, the foot of the infantile specimen DIK-1-1 indicates some mobility of the big toe, though not to the degree in non-human primates. This would have reduced walking efficiency, but a partially dextrous foot in the juvenile stage may have been important in climbing activities for food or safety, or made it easier for the infant to cling onto and be carried by an adult.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet and technology===
&quot;A. afarensis&quot; was likely a generalist omnivore. Carbon isotope analysis on teeth from Hadar and Dikika 3.4–2.9 million years ago suggests a widely ranging diet between different specimens, with forest-dwelling specimens showing a preference for C3 forest plants, and bush- or grassland-dwelling specimens a preference for C4 CAM savanna plants. C4 CAM sources include grass, seeds, roots, underground storage organs, succulents and perhaps creatures which ate those, such as termites. Thus, &quot;A. afarensis&quot; appears to have been capable of exploiting a variety of food resources in a wide range of habitats. In contrast, the earlier &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and &quot;Ar. ramidus&quot;, as well as modern savanna chimpanzees, target the same types of food as forest-dwelling counterparts despite living in an environment where these plants are much less abundant. Few modern primate species consume C4 CAM plants. The dental anatomy of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is ideal for consuming hard, brittle foods, but microwearing patterns on the molars suggest that such foods were infrequently consumed, probably as fallback items in leaner times.

In 2009 at Dikika, Ethiopia, a rib fragment belonging to a cow-sized hoofed animal and a partial femur of a goat-sized juvenile bovid was found to exhibit cut marks, and the former some crushing, which were initially interpreted as the oldest evidence of butchering with stone tools. If correct, this would make it the oldest evidence of sharp-edged stone tool use at 3.4 million years old, and would be attributable to &quot;A. afarensis&quot; as it is the only species known within the time and place. However, because the fossils were found in a sandstone unit (and were modified by abrasive sand and gravel particles during the fossilisation process), the attribution to hominin activity is weak.

===Society===
It is highly difficult to speculate with accuracy the group dynamics of early hominins. &quot;A. afarensis&quot; is typically reconstructed with high levels of sexual dimorphism, with males much larger than females. Using general trends in modern primates, high sexual dimorphism usually equates to a polygynous society due to intense male–male competition over females, like in the harem society of gorillas. However, it has also been argued that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; had much lower levels of dimorphism, and so had a multi-male kin-based society like chimpanzees. Low dimorphism could also be interpreted as having had a monogamous society with strong male–male competition. Contrarily, the canine teeth are much smaller in &quot;A. afarensis&quot; than in non-human primates, which should indicate lower aggression because canine size is generally positively correlated with male–male aggression.

===Birth===

The platypelloid pelvis may have caused a different birthing mechanism from modern humans, with the neonate entering the inlet facing laterally (the head was transversally orientated) until it exited through the pelvic outlet. This would be a non-rotational birth, as opposed to a fully rotational birth in humans. However, it has been suggested that the shoulders of the neonate may have been obstructed, and the neonate could have instead entered the inlet transversely and then rotated so that it exited through the outlet oblique to the main axis of the pelvis, which would be a semi-rotational birth. By this argument, there may not have been much space for the neonate to pass through the birth canal, causing a difficult childbirth for the mother.

===Gait===

The Laetoli fossil trackway, generally attributed to &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, indicates a rather developed grade of bipedal locomotion, more efficient than the bent-hip–bent-knee (BHBK) gait used by non-human great apes (though earlier interpretations of the gait include a BHBK posture or a shuffling movement). Trail A consists of short, broad prints resembling those of a two-and-a-half-year-old child, though it has been suggested this trail was made by the extinct bear &quot;Agriotherium africanus&quot;. G1 is a trail consisting of four cycles likely made by a child. G2 and G3 are thought to have been made by two adults. In 2015, two more trackways were discovered made by one individual, named S1, extending for a total of . In 2015, a single footprint from a different individual, S2, was discovered.

The shallowness of the toe prints would indicate a more flexed limb posture when the foot hit the ground and perhaps a less arched foot, meaning &quot;A. afarensis&quot; was less efficient at bipedal locomotion than humans. Some tracks feature a long drag mark probably left by the heel, which may indicate the foot was lifted at a low angle to the ground. For push-off, it appears weight shifted from the heel to the side of the foot and then the toes. Some footprints of S1 either indicate asymmetrical walking where weight was sometimes placed on the anterolateral part (the side of the front half of the foot) before toe-off, or sometimes the upper body was rotated mid-step. The angle of gait (the angle between the direction the foot is pointing in on touchdown and median line drawn through the entire trackway) ranges from 2–11° for both right and left sides. G1 generally shows wide and asymmetrical angles, whereas the others typically show low angles.

The speed of the track makers has been variously estimated depending on the method used, with G1 reported at 0.47, 0.56, 0.64, 0.7 and 1 m/s (1.69, 2, 2.3, 2.5 and 3.6 km/h; 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6 and 2.2 mph); G2/3 reported at 0.37, 0.84 and 1 m/s (1.3, 2.9 and 3.6 km/h; 0.8, 1.8 and 2.2 mph); and S1 at . For comparison, modern humans typically walk at .

The average step distance is , and stride distance . S1 appears to have had the highest average step and stride length of, respectively, and whereas G1–G3 averaged, respectively, 416, 453 and 433 mm (1.4, 1.5 and 1.4 ft) for step and 829, 880 and 876 mm (2.7, 2.9 and 2.9 ft) for stride.

&quot;A. afarensis&quot; was also capable of bipedal running with absolute speeds of , slower than modern humans with maximum running speeds up to , and its running energetics was similar to those of mammals and birds of similar body size. It has been suggested that the bipedal gait evolved specifically to improve running rather than to just enhance walking.

===Pathology===
Australopithecines, in general, seem to have had a high incidence rate of vertebral pathologies, possibly because their vertebrae were better adapted to withstand suspension loads in climbing than compressive loads while walking upright. Lucy presents marked thoracic kyphosis (hunchback) and was diagnosed with Scheuermann&#x27;s disease, probably caused by overstraining her back, which can lead to a hunched posture in modern humans due to irregular curving of the spine. Because her condition presented quite similarly to that seen in modern human patients, this would indicate a basically human range of locomotor function in walking for &quot;A. afarensis&quot;. The original straining may have occurred while climbing or swinging in the trees, though, even if correct, this does not indicate that her species was maladapted for arboreal behaviour, much like how humans are not maladapted for bipedal posture despite developing arthritis. KSD-VP-1/1 seemingly exhibits compensatory action by the neck and lumbar vertebrae (gooseneck) consistent with thoracic kyphosis and Scheuermann&#x27;s disease, but thoracic vertebrae are not preserved in this specimen.

In 2010, KSD-VP-1/1 presented evidence of a valgus deformity of the left ankle involving the fibula, with a bony ring developing on the fibula&#x27;s joint surface extending the bone an additional . This was probably caused by a fibular fracture during childhood which improperly healed in a nonunion.

In 2016, palaeoanthropologist John Kappelman argued that the fracturing exhibited by Lucy was consistent with a proximal humerus fracture, which is most often caused by falling in humans. He then concluded she died from falling out of a tree, and that &quot;A. afarensis&quot; slept in trees or climbed trees to escape predators. However, similar fracturing is exhibited in many other creatures in the area, including the bones of antelope, elephants, giraffes and rhinos, and may well simply be taphonomic bias (fracturing was caused by fossilisation). Lucy may also have been killed in an animal attack or a mudslide.

The 13 AL 333 individuals are thought to have been deposited at about the same time as one another, bear little evidence of carnivore activity, and were buried on a stretch of a hill. In 1981, anthropologists James Louis Aronson and Taieb suggested they were killed in a flash flood. British archaeologist Paul Pettitt considered natural causes unlikely and, in 2013, speculated that these individuals were purposefully hidden in tall grass by other hominins (funerary caching). This behaviour has been documented in modern primates, and may be done so that the recently deceased do not attract predators to living grounds.

==Palaeoecology==
&quot;A. afarensis&quot; was extremely adaptable in its environmental preferences. It does not appear to have had a preferred environment and it inhabited a wide range of habitats such as open grasslands or woodlands, shrublands, and lake- or riverside forests. Likewise, the animal assemblage varied widely from site to site. The Pliocene of East Africa was warm and wet compared to the preceding Miocene, with the dry season lasting about four months based on floral, faunal, and geological evidence. The extended rainy season would have made more desirable foods available to hominins for most of the year. During the Late Pliocene around 4–3 million years ago, Africa featured a greater diversity of large carnivores than today, and australopithecines likely fell prey to these dangerous creatures, including hyenas, &quot;Panthera&quot;, cheetahs, and the saber-toothed cats: &quot;Megantereon&quot;, &quot;Dinofelis&quot;, &quot;Homotherium&quot; and &quot;Machairodus&quot;.

Australopithecines and early &quot;Homo&quot; likely preferred cooler conditions than later &quot;Homo&quot;, as there are no australopithecine sites that were below in elevation at the time of deposition. This would mean that, like chimpanzees, they often inhabited areas with an average diurnal temperature of , dropping to at night. At Hadar, the average temperature from 3.4 to 2.95 million years ago was about .

<text>In biology, a sequence motif is a nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern that is widespread and usually assumed to be related to biological function of the macromolecule. For example, an &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation site motif can be defined as &quot;Asn, followed by anything but Pro, followed by either Ser or Thr, followed by anything but Pro residue&quot;.

==Overview==

When a sequence motif appears in the exon of a gene, it may encode the &quot;structural motif&quot; of a protein; that is a stereotypical element of the overall structure of the protein. Nevertheless, motifs need not be associated with a distinctive secondary structure. &quot;Noncoding&quot; sequences are not translated into proteins, and nucleic acids with such motifs need not deviate from the typical shape (e.g. the &quot;B-form&quot; DNA double helix).

Outside of gene exons, there exist regulatory sequence motifs and motifs within the &quot;junk&quot;, such as satellite DNA. Some of these are believed to affect the shape of nucleic acids (see for example RNA self-splicing), but this is only sometimes the case. For example, many DNA binding proteins that have affinity for specific DNA binding sites bind DNA in only its double-helical form. They are able to recognize motifs through contact with the double helix&#x27;s major or minor groove.

Short coding motifs, which appear to lack secondary structure, include those that label proteins for delivery to particular parts of a cell, or mark them for phosphorylation.

Within a sequence or database of sequences, researchers search and find motifs using computer-based techniques of sequence analysis, such as BLAST. Such techniques belong to the discipline of bioinformatics. See also consensus sequence.

==Motif Representation==
Consider the &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation site motif mentioned above:

: &quot;Asn, followed by anything but Pro, followed by either Ser or Thr, followed by anything but Pro&quot;

This pattern may be written as codice_1 where codice_2 = Asn, codice_3 = Pro, codice_4 = Ser, codice_5 = Thr; codice_6 means any amino acid except codice_7; and codice_8 means either codice_7 or codice_10.

The notation codice_8 does not give any indication of the probability of codice_7 or codice_10 occurring in the pattern. Observed probabilities can be graphically represented using sequence logos. Sometimes patterns are defined in terms of a probabilistic model such as a hidden Markov model.

===Motifs and consensus sequences===

The notation codice_14 means codice_7 or codice_10 or codice_17, but does not indicate the likelihood of any particular match. For this reason, two or more patterns are often associated with a single motif: the defining pattern, and various typical patterns.

For example, the defining sequence for the IQ motif may be taken to be:

: codice_18

where codice_19 signifies any amino acid, and the square brackets indicate an alternative (see below for further details about notation).

Usually, however, the first letter is codice_20, and both codice_21 choices resolve to codice_22. Since the last choice is so wide, the pattern codice_23 is sometimes equated with the IQ motif itself, but a more accurate description would be a &quot;consensus sequence for the IQ motif&quot;.

===Pattern description notations===

Several notations for describing motifs are in use but most of them are variants of standard notations for regular expressions and use these conventions:

* there is an alphabet of single characters, each denoting a specific amino acid or a set of amino acids;
* a string of characters drawn from the alphabet denotes a sequence of the corresponding amino acids;
* any string of characters drawn from the alphabet enclosed in square brackets matches any one of the corresponding amino acids; e.g. codice_24 matches any of the amino acids represented by codice_25 or codice_26 or codice_27.

The fundamental idea behind all these notations is the matching principle, which assigns a meaning to a sequence of elements of the pattern notation:

: &quot;a sequence of elements of the pattern notation matches a sequence of amino acids if and only if the latter sequence can be partitioned into subsequences in such a way that each pattern element matches the corresponding subsequence in turn.&quot;

Thus the pattern codice_28 matches the six amino acid sequences corresponding to codice_29, codice_30, codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, and codice_34.

Different pattern description notations have other ways of forming pattern elements. One of these notations is the PROSITE notation, described in the following subsection.

====PROSITE pattern notation====

The PROSITE notation uses the IUPAC one-letter codes and conforms to the above description with the exception that a concatenation symbol, &#x27;codice_35&#x27;, is used between pattern elements, but it is often dropped between letters of the pattern alphabet.

PROSITE allows the following pattern elements in addition to those described previously:
* The lower case letter &#x27;codice_19&#x27; can be used as a pattern element to denote any amino acid.
* A string of characters drawn from the alphabet and enclosed in braces (curly brackets) denotes any amino acid except for those in the string. For example, codice_37 denotes any amino acid other than codice_4 or codice_5.
* If a pattern is restricted to the N-terminal of a sequence, the pattern is prefixed with &#x27;codice_40&#x27;.
* If a pattern is restricted to the C-terminal of a sequence, the pattern is suffixed with &#x27;codice_41&#x27;.
* The character &#x27;codice_41&#x27; can also occur inside a terminating square bracket pattern, so that codice_43 matches both &quot;codice_44&quot; and &quot;codice_45&quot;.
* If codice_46 is a pattern element, and codice_47 and codice_48 are two decimal integers with codice_47 &lt;= codice_48, then:
** codice_51 is equivalent to the repetition of codice_46 exactly codice_47 times;
** codice_54 is equivalent to the repetition of codice_46 exactly codice_56 times for any integer codice_56 satisfying: codice_47 &lt;= codice_56 &lt;= codice_48.

Some examples:
* codice_61 is equivalent to codice_62.
* codice_63 matches any sequence that matches codice_64 or codice_62 or codice_66.

The signature of the C2H2-type &quot;zinc finger&quot; domain is:
* codice_67

====Matrices====
A matrix of numbers containing scores for each residue or nucleotide at each position of a fixed-length motif. There are two types of weight matrices.
* A position frequency matrix (PFM) records the position-dependent frequency of each residue or nucleotide. PFMs can be experimentally determined from SELEX experiments or computationally discovered by tools such as MEME using hidden Markov models.
* A position weight matrix (PWM) contains log odds weights for computing a match score. A cutoff is needed to specify whether an input sequence matches the motif or not. PWMs are calculated from PFMs. PWMs are also known as PSSMs.

An example of a PFM from the TRANSFAC database for the transcription factor AP-1:

The first column specifies the position, the second column contains the number of occurrences of A at that position, the third column contains the number of occurrences of C at that position, the fourth column contains the number of occurrences of G at that position, the fifth column contains the number of occurrences of T at that position, and the last column contains the IUPAC notation for that position.
Note that the sums of occurrences for A, C, G, and T for each row should be equal because the PFM is derived from aggregating several consensus sequences.

==Motif Discovery==
===Overview===
The sequence motif discovery process has been well-developed since the 1990s. In particular, most of the existing motif discovery research focuses on DNA motifs. With the advances in high-throughput sequencing, such motif discovery problems are challenged by both the sequence pattern degeneracy issues and the data-intensive computational scalability issues.

Process of discovery

Motif discovery happens in three major phases. A pre-processing stage where sequences are meticulously prepared in assembly and cleaning steps. Assembly involves selecting sequences that contain the desired motif in large quantities, and extraction of unwanted sequences using clustering. Cleaning then ensures the removal of any confounding elements. Next there is the discovery stage. In this phase sequences are represented using consensus strings or Position-specific Weight Matrices (PWM). After motif representation, an objective function is chosen and a suitable search algorithm is applied to uncover the motifs. Finally the post-processing stage involves evaluating the discovered motifs.

====&quot;De novo&quot; motif discovery====
There are software programs which, given multiple input sequences, attempt to identify one or more candidate motifs. One example is the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) algorithm, which generates statistical information for each candidate. There are more than 100 publications detailing motif discovery algorithms; Weirauch &quot;et al&quot;. evaluated many related algorithms in a 2013 benchmark. The planted motif search is another motif discovery method that is based on combinatorial approach.

====Phylogenetic motif discovery====
Motifs have also been discovered by taking a phylogenetic approach and studying similar genes in different species. For example, by aligning the amino acid sequences specified by the GCM (&quot;glial cells missing&quot;) gene in man, mouse and &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;, Akiyama and others discovered a pattern which they called the GCM motif in 1996. It spans about 150 amino acid residues, and begins as follows:

: codice_68

Here each codice_69 signifies a single amino acid or a gap, and each codice_70 indicates one member of a closely related family of amino acids. The authors were able to show that the motif has DNA binding activity.

A similar approach is commonly used by modern protein domain databases such as Pfam: human curators would select a pool of sequences known to be related and use computer programs to align them and produce the motif profile (Pfam uses HMMs, which can be used to identify other related proteins. A phylogenic approach can also be used to enhance the &quot;de novo&quot; MEME algorithm, with PhyloGibbs being an example.

====&quot;De novo&quot; motif pair discovery====

In 2017, MotifHyades has been developed as a motif discovery tool that can be directly applied to paired sequences.

====&quot;De novo&quot; motif recognition from protein====

In 2018, a Markov random field approach has been proposed to infer DNA motifs from DNA-binding domains of proteins.

Motif Discovery Algorithms

Motif discovery algorithms use diverse strategies to uncover patterns in DNA sequences. Integrating enumerative, probabilistic, and nature-inspired approaches, demonstrate their adaptability, with the use of multiple methods proving effective in enhancing identification accuracy.

Enumerative Approach:

Initiating the motif discovery journey, the enumerative approach witnesses algorithms meticulously generating and evaluating potential motifs. Pioneering this domain are Simple Word Enumeration techniques, such as YMF and DREME, which systematically go through the sequence in search of short motifs. Complementing these, Clustering-Based Methods such as CisFinder employ nucleotide substitution matrices for motif clustering, effectively mitigating redundancy. Concurrently, Tree-Based Methods like Weeder and FMotif exploit tree structures, and Graph Theoretic-Based Methods (e.g., WINNOWER) employ graph representations, demonstrating the richness of enumeration strategies.

Probabilistic Approach:

Diverging into the probabilistic realm, this approach capitalizes on probability models to discern motifs within sequences. MEME, a deterministic exemplar, employs Expectation-Maximization for optimizing Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) and unraveling conserved regions in unaligned DNA sequences. Contrasting this, stochastic methodologies like Gibbs Sampling initiate motif discovery with random motif position assignments, iteratively refining the predictions. This probabilistic framework adeptly captures the inherent uncertainty associated with motif discovery.

Advanced Approach:

Evolving further, advanced motif discovery embraces sophisticated techniques, with Bayesian modeling taking center stage. LOGOS and BaMM, exemplifying this cohort, intricately weave Bayesian approaches and Markov models into their fabric for motif identification. The incorporation of Bayesian clustering methods enhances the probabilistic foundation, providing a holistic framework for pattern recognition in DNA sequences.

Nature-Inspired and Heuristic Algorithms:

A distinct category unfolds, wherein algorithms draw inspiration from the biological realm. Genetic Algorithms (GA), epitomized by FMGA and MDGA, navigate motif search through genetic operators and specialized strategies. Harnessing swarm intelligence principles, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms, and Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithms, featured in GAEM, GARP, and MACS, venture into pheromone-based exploration. These algorithms, mirroring nature&#x27;s adaptability and cooperative dynamics, serve as avant-garde strategies for motif identification. The synthesis of heuristic techniques in hybrid approaches underscores the adaptability of these algorithms in the intricate domain of motif discovery.
==Motif Cases==

===Three-dimensional chain codes===
The &quot;E. coli&quot; lactose operon repressor LacI ( chain A) and &quot;E. coli&quot; catabolite gene activator ( chain A) both have a &quot;helix-turn-helix&quot; motif, but their amino acid sequences do not show much similarity, as shown in the table below. In 1997, Matsuda, &quot;et al.&quot; devised a code they called the &quot;three-dimensional chain code&quot; for representing the protein structure as a string of letters. This encoding scheme reveals the similarity between the proteins much more clearly than the amino acid sequence (example from article): The code encodes the torsion angles between alpha-carbons of the protein backbone. &quot;W&quot; always corresponds to an alpha helix.

<text>Fur farming is the practice of breeding or raising certain types of animals for their fur.

Most of the world&#x27;s farmed fur was produced by European farmers. In 2018, there were 5,000 fur farms in the EU, located across 22 countries; these areas of production collectively accounted for 50% of the global production of farmed fur. However, by 2023 only 11 countries in the EU still farmed animals for fur, and three of these countries had issued a legal ban on the activity effective within several years.

The EU accounted for 63% of global mink production and 70% of fox production. Globally, the top fur producers were China and Finland. Denmark was also leading, accounting for approximately 28% of world mink fur production, until its government culled all of the farmers&#x27; stocks without legal authority in 2020. Finland is the largest United States supplier of fox pelts.

The United States is a major exporter of fur skins. Major export markets include China, Russia, Canada, and the EU. Exports to Asia as a share of total exports grew from 22% in 1998 to 47% in 2002. As of 2012, Russia was reported to be the world&#x27;s biggest sales market for fur. China has been the world&#x27;s largest importer of fur pelts and the largest exporter of finished fur products.

Fur farming has been banned in the United Kingdom (since 2000), Austria (since 2005), Slovenia (effective 2015), Croatia (effective 2017), Luxembourg (effective 2018), the Czech Republic (effective 2019), the Netherlands (effective 2021), Ireland (effective 2022), Italy (effective June 2022), Malta (effective 2022), Belgium (effective across the country 2023), Slovakia (effective 2025), Norway (effective February 2025), Estonia (effective 2025), Lithuania (effective 2027), Romania (effective 2027) and Latvia (effective 2028). In Switzerland and Germany, the regulations for fur farming are very strict, with the result that there are no fur farms. Denmark (2009), France (2020) and Hungary (2021) introduced a ban on fur farming of certain species, while Spain announced a plan in 2022 to close down all fur farms by 2030. Fur farming was not present as of 2023 in Portugal and Cyprus. The last fur farm in Japan was closed in 2016. 

Demand fell in the late 1980s and 1990s as a result of a number of factors, including the efforts of animal rights campaigners and the failure of designers to come up with exciting new lines. Since the turn of the millennium, however, sales worldwide have soared to record highs, fueled by radically new techniques for working with fur, and a sharp rise in disposable income in China and Russia. This growing demand has led to the development of extensive fur farming operations in China and Poland.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mink turned out to be very susceptible to human–mink infection, sparking fears of widespread outbreaks and mutations in the mink farm populations of many countries that could in turn infect humans with different strains of the coronavirus, making it potentially immune for a COVID-19 vaccine. Several mink farms in the Netherlands have been entirely culled since June 2020, and in August 2020 the phaseout of fur farming was accelerated from 1 January 2024 to 1 March 2021. In July 2020, Spain culled 100,000 mink. On 6 November 2020, Denmark announced it would cull its entire 17 million mink population as an emergency to prevent the spread of a mutated strain of COVID-19, of which at least five cases were found. On 11 November, the Netherlands again moved the phase-out forward, now putting 1 January 2021 as the target date to limit the risk of mutation. Kopenhagen Fur (accounting for 40% of mink production worldwide) announced mid-November it would gradually cease operations in 2–3 years because the circumstances had critically undermined the future of the global fur trade.

==History==

While wearing fur clothing in cold weather as protection goes back to the Stone Age, the source for this material came from the wild. As human populations grew, furs, leathers, and hides for use in clothing came from farm stock, such as sheep (sheepskin), rabbits, cattle, pigs, and goats. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of red fox breeding in the late Iron Age on Orkney, off the northern coast of Scotland. After the attack of the Vikings in Scotland around 800 CE, the breeding is said to have stopped. The earliest records of breeding mink for fur in North America were in the 1860s. Foxes were first raised on farms for fur in Prince Edward Island in Canada in 1895.

Historically, the fur trade played an important economic role in the United States. Fur trappers explored and opened up large parts of North America, and the fashion for beaver hats led to intense competition for the raw materials. Starting in the latter half of the 20th century, producers and wearers of fur have been criticized by animal rights activists because of the cruelty involved in animal trapping, and because of the widespread availability of inexpensive substitutes including natural fibers (such as cotton, hemp) as well as synthetic fibers. In 1991, &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist John F. Burns described the American fur industry as &quot;shrinking with no end in sight.&quot;

Today, 85 percent of the fur clothing industry&#x27;s pelts come from animals raised on farms. The rest is from animals caught in the wild. The most farmed fur-bearing animal is the mink (50 million annually), followed by the fox (about 4 million annually). Asiatic and Finnish raccoon and chinchilla are also farmed for their fur. As of 2008, 64 percent of fur farms were in Northern Europe, 11 percent in North America, and the rest were dispersed throughout the world, in countries such as Argentina and Russia.

==Species==

===Mink===
Mink have been farmed for fur in the United States for 130 years, though domestic demand for fur started to decline rapidly by the late 1980s. In 2010, the U.S. ranked fifth in production behind Denmark, China, the Netherlands, and Poland. Mink typically breed in March and give birth to their litters in May. Farmers vaccinate the young kits for botulism, distemper, enteritis, and, if needed, pneumonia. They are slaughtered in November and December. Methods for euthanizing animals on fur farms, as on all farms, are detailed in the American Veterinary Medical Association&#x27;s Report on Euthanasia which is used as a guideline for state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over all farms raising domesticated livestock, including mink.

The white mink, a northern European breed, was introduced into Canada in 1968. Most mink production in Canada occurs in Nova Scotia which, with 116 licensed farms in 2016, generated revenues of nearly $54 million by contributing approximately 1.4 million pelts to global markets. That accounted for an average of half of all Canada&#x27;s mink pelts. Production of black mink in particular has grown significantly since 2000, with emerging markets in Russia, China, and South Korea accounting for most of the new demand. Black mink was first bred in Nova Scotia in the late 1950s and has proven popular as a versatile colour. Most Nova Scotia fur product is sold in China where it is manufactured into luxury garments.

===Chinchilla===
The international trade in chinchilla fur goes back to the 16th century and the animal (whose name literally means &quot;Little Chincha&quot;) is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who wore its soft, dense fur. By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare. In 1923, Mathias F. Chapman brought the eleven wild chinchillas he had captured to the U.S. for breeding. Only three of these were female. Empress Chinchilla is the breeders association for the chinchilla farmers, many of whom are based in the United States, including California. Empress Chinchilla runs a certification program for farmers..

===Fox===
Finland is the world&#x27;s leading producer of fox pelts. In the United States, fox production is about 10,000 pelts, produced in about 10 states. Canada produces ten to fifteen times as many fox furs as the USA.

===Dog and cat===
The United States banned the import, export, and sale of products made from dog and cat fur in 2000.
Italy, France, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, and Australia ban the import of domestic cat and dog fur but the sale is still quasi-legal. 
In most countries, novelty items made from farmed cat and dog fur is available in the form of animal toys or as trim on garments like boots, jackets and handbags. The European Union banned imports in 2009.

===Rabbit===
 The main breed in the rabbit fur farming industry is the Rex (Castor Rex and Chinchilla Rex). Breeding animals are kept for up to three years, and usually give birth twice a year. The kits are taken from their mothers at 4 weeks old and put in a nursery with other kits. After this, the mothers are kept separated from their kits, and they get put together only for feeding. When the kits are 7 to 8 weeks old, they are put in solitary cages, where they are kept for about 6–7 months, and are slaughtered after they have shed their winter fur. The rabbits are kept in bare wire mesh cages. A cage for one rabbit has the floor space of about two shoe boxes. The mortality rate for caged Rex is 10–15%, mostly from respiratory disease.

==Farmed mink production cycle==
===Conditioning and breeding (December – March)===
During this time of year, ranchers are primarily focused on bringing their selected mink into a good condition that is suitable for breeding. Mink are a monoestrous species that undergo delayed implantation when bred successfully, this means that the breeding season can be the most strenuous time of year both in terms of animal nutrition and human labor. It is essential that management practices employ a feeding program that maintains a nutritional diet that is adequate for both male and female mink. A feeding program that encourages the removal of excess weight and an environment that facilitates an increase in exercise is important for good production and a successful whelp. Mink are usually fed once or twice a day during the growing season; on most farms they are fed the same quantity of food on all cages and close to an &quot;ad libitum&quot; amount so that 50% of all cages have feed left over the next day. In addition to fur quality and production traits, breeder selection should concentrate on health and 
temperament (21) to improve the welfare of the herd.

Breeding records are kept for each individual mink, this includes information on the dates of mating, genetics involving family lineage, reproductive success, health status, and fur characteristics.

===Whelping and weaning (April – June)===
In preparation for whelping, comfortable conditions are prepared for the female by providing ample aspen bedding in which she can create a nest. It is well known that female mink are highly motivated to perform maternal-related nest building during the majority of their gestation period, this is why providing an abundance of substrate to prepare a nest is crucial to maintain the animals welfare. Unnecessary stress and noises should be avoided so due to the sensitivity of female mink during late gestation. Gestation varies from 40 to 70 days, this time is often shortened by extending the daylight period by use of artificial lighting.

Females give birth to 5–6 kits on average. Since kits are born altricial, the female spends most of her time in the nest boxes caring for them. Mink kits are fully dependent on the dam&#x27;s milk and will nurse for the first four weeks of their life. Maternal care is essential to promote offspring survival and growth, particularly in American mink who give birth to altricial young. Ranchers should check them regularly to ensure all the kits are warm, receiving enough milk, and are growing well. Females can lose significant body condition during lactation so their health is monitored by visual observations of behavior, appearance, and feed consumption.
Weaning takes place when the kits reach approximately 6–8 weeks old. The changes that take place during weaning can be stressful for both dam and kits therefore is done at a time that is most beneficial for the mother and litter. Ranchers should ensure the kits are able to consume solid feed and drink water independently before they are ready for weaning.

===Growth and furring (July – October)===
Very rapid growth takes place during the growth phase of the production cycle. For about 10–11 weeks, it is critical that the juvenile kits have access to adequate amounts of feed that is formulated to meet their nutritional needs. Maintaining a feeding routine that allows for multiple distributions of feed a day will help keep feed fresh and encourage appetite. In July, all mink (including kits and adult breeders) are vaccinated to prevent diseases and promote health and welfare of the herd. Once August arrives, the skeletal growth of kits is complete and the subsequent growth of primarily fat begins. The growth of fur predominantly takes place during the fall where it begins at the tail and continues up the back and to the head. Ranchers maintain a clean, healthy environment during this time by performing daily husbandry practices, this includes; cleaning nest boxes, removal of surrounding debris and manure from the barn, bedding the cages, and up-keeping the cleanliness of the facility and farming equipment. Ranchers are diligent toward creating an environment that prioritizes the welfare of each animal and allows them to live and function comfortably within their environment.

===Grading and slaughter (November – December)===
Mink are carefully evaluated in November or early December in order to physically assess their coat color, characteristics, and quality. Fur quality, along with skin size are two of the most important traits that are under intense selection in most mink breeding programs. Each mink will be given a grade dictated by the attributes of their coat; this is valuable in determining which mink will be kept as breeding stock for next season. Fur quality, color, and body size are judged by the farmer or a professional grader. Fur grades are often used alongside size, weight, health history, parent reproductive success, litter size, and temperament to assess the quality and potential of each animal.

The methods used to slaughter mink include neck breaking, electricity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, and lethal injection. The most common method of slaughter is by subjecting the animal to a chamber that contains carbon monoxide. Pelting takes place either on site or upon shipping the mink to an offsite operation.

==By-products==
After pelting, mink bodies are typically sent for either incineration or rendering where they can be converted into bone and meat meal. The meat from most fur-bearers is not usually eaten by humans, therefore the carcasses will go on to become various products such as pet food, animal feed, organic compost, fertilizer, paint, and even tires. Carcasses sometimes go to animal sanctuaries, zoos, and aquariums to feed animals, and some end up as crab bait. Some biological supply companies offer preserved skinned carcasses of ranched mink for classroom dissection specimens as an alternative to cats or other domesticated mammals. Mink feces are used as organic crop fertiliser, and mink fat is turned into oil to manufacture soap, face oils, cosmetics, and leather treatments.

== Controversy ==

Methods used on fur farms to maximize profits are employed at the expense of the welfare of fur producing animals, though the exact scope of cruelty in the industry is hotly debated.

As with other types of animal farming, living conditions of animals vary, and extreme cases are of much contention. According to PETA, the majority of fur farmers pack animals into small cages, preventing them from taking more than a few steps back and forth. PETA claims foxes and other animals suffer as a result of the confined environment, and may even cannibalize each other as a reaction to their confinement.
In other cases, as with passing of animal welfare legislation in Italy, animals are required to be given enriched living environments in which they can climb on branches, dig holes, use a nest of 50 × 50 cm and also have a water basin of at least 2 × 2 metres and 50 cm deep in which to swim. Farmers argue that 50 years ago, the animals were kept in large outdoor holding areas, with pools of water. However, such farms resulted in high disease rates for the animals and were not practical.
Farmers claim that today&#x27;s farmed animals only know farm life as they have been domesticated through over 100 of years of selective breeding.
The methods used for slaughtering the animals on farms and in the wild vary depending on the animal. For farmed mink, the American Veterinary Medical Association researches the best methods and publishes a report on the subject every 7 to 10 years. This report is used to guide state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over farm animals, including farm-raised mink. For those harvesting wild furs, biologists and wildlife managers dictate seasons, method of slaughter, and numbers of animals to be harvested.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, six of the nine federal states have banned fur farming, and the remaining three enforce such strict welfare regulations, in relation to the availability of swimming water, that fur farming is no longer economically viable.

=== Canada ===

==== Quebec ====
In 2014, for the first time in Canadian history, a Quebec fur farmer by the name of Jean-Luc Rodier was charged with animal cruelty following an investigation by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (S.P.C.A.). Fox and mink at the fur farm were seized by animal welfare organizations and some were in such poor condition that they had to be euthanized. Following the S.P.C.A. investigation, this Quebec fur farm was raided by anonymous activists who set free thousands of animals.

==== British Columbia ====
Video footage taken at fur farms in 2014 in British Columbia by the A.P.F.A. was described by the S.P.C.A. as &quot;inherently inhumane&quot;. Animal rights activists in the city of Vancouver have been using legal and illegal actions to protest selling fur such as vandalism, home demonstrations of fur shop owners, and organizing public protests.

==== Ontario ====
Canadian fur farms in the Province of Ontario have been repeatedly targeted by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Thousands of mink were freed from farms across the province during 2013 and 2015. The mink breeders association of Ontario responded by offering a hundred thousand dollar bounty leading to a conviction of the persons responsible. Undercover footage was also released by the ALF in 2015 of several Ontario area mink farms, showcasing injured animals and mink cages covered in feces and maggots. Animal rights organizations across the province have taken a wide array of actions to stop the fur trade, such as public protests and disruptions of fur fashion shows.

=== China ===

In 2005, animals rights group The Swiss Animal Protection produced a video alleging that fur-bearing animals – including the &quot;Asiatic raccoon&quot; (raccoon dog) – were being skinned while still alive in Shangcun Market. The China Fur Commission and China Leather Industry Association challenged the authenticity of the video, stating: &quot;Pictures showing animals being skinned alive are obviously plotted. All those with common sense would not choose this slaughter method to attain fur.&quot; The government of Suning County, Hebei Province also issued a statement, outlining welfare practices it claimed to practice on its fur farms and calling the alleged practice of skinning animals alive &quot;unimaginable.&quot; Swiss Animal Protection then published a 2009 video showing the skinning of raccoon dogs and other canids. The video showed them being beaten with sticks and thrown to the ground in an attempt to kill them before being hung from their rear legs and skinned alive. One investigator filmed a raccoon dog being skinned alive before being thrown onto a heap of carcasses. After the skinning it still had enough strength to lift its bloodied head and stare into the camera. A 2013 investigation by a Dalian-based Chinese animal welfare group reported similarly cruel practices at various fur farms in Liaoning province. The found two fur workers who had appeared in the 2009 video and through interviews as well as affidavits, alleged they were approached by two others to stage the cruelty. A 2018 Shanghaiist article noted that although it was more than likely some animals had been skinned alive in China, to extrapolate that all or most of the farms did this was wrong.

In 2006, the State Forestry Administration (SFA) announced it was planning to offer training courses for fur farmers to improve the living conditions of fur animals.
Legislation was drafted in September 2009 to address any cruelty to animals in China. If passed, the legislation would regulate how farm animals are raised, transported, and slaughtered.

=== Estonia ===
Estonian citizens have a partial right to submit initiatives with at least 1000 signatures to the parliament since 2014. They do not directly go to the parliamentary hall but go through a process of review in a subject commission. On 21 November 2014, the Estonian animal advocacy organization Loomus submitted a petition to ban fur farming in the country with a 10-year transition period with 10 000 signatures to the parliament. This was preceded by secretly filmed anonymous documentary footage being aired both online via YouTube and on Estonian National Television depicting the conditions of the animals in 2012 (aired 2013) and 2014. The Estonian animal advocacy organization Loomus issued a comment after the airings of Estonian Public Broadcasting outlining the documented disregard animal welfare regulations and pointing out the numerous injuries of animals that were documented.

The petition has since been under review in the commission of agricultural affairs. The commission procured a study on the economic significance of the industry from the Estonian University of Life Sciences published in 2016, which did not state the exact number of farms in existence but did outline that the mink and fox farms employed 74 full-time workers in 2014, with the majority concentrated in the largest factory in the Baltic States, in Karjaküla, near Tallinn. It also reported the chinchilla farms employed 20.5 full-time workers in 2014. The activists have voiced their concern about the bias inherent in the study, which according to them by and large ignored ethical and environmental arguments, as a number of the experts in the study panel were found to have direct links to and vested interests in the fur industry. The commission is expected to formulate their opinion and vote whether the petition would move on to a law drafting phase and public discussion in the full quorum of the parliament in the fall of 2016.

On 22 August 2016, activists launched an additional international petition inviting the Estonian Parliament to ban fur farming in the country at change.org.

Estonian parliament banned fur farms on 2 June 2021. There is a transitional period that permits keeping mink and raccoon dogs in farms until the end of 2025 if the permit was issued before 1 July 2021.

===Finland===

Finnish citizens have had a right to instigate parliamentarian law initiatives since 2012. The first citizens&#x27; initiative to gain enough signatures was that instituting a ban on fur farming. Some 70,000 citizens signed the initiative within the required time period in 2013. In a march to Parliament House, Helsinki on 18 June., four to five hundred people appealed to members of parliament to approve the citizens&#x27; initiative to ban fur farming. According to animal expert MSc Sesse Koivisto (wife of Ilkka Koivisto ex-director of the Korkeasaari Zoo) in Helsingin Sanomat in 2010, fur farming did not provide acceptable conditions for the animals. In order to stop the suffering of animals, she demanded a ban on fur farming in Helsingin Sanomat, as in some other countries. On 19 June 2013, the Finnish Parliament rejected the first citizens&#x27; initiative to ban fur farming. A positive development in the politics of Finland was that the initiative was taken in the Parliament for public voting.

In Finland in August 2016, there were about 950 active fur farms. The breeding of fur-animals has had a long tradition in Finland, having been professionally conducted since the 1920s. Up to 90% of the fur-farming community is situated in the rural areas of Ostrobothnia and employs four to six thousand people. Today, fur farming is strictly regulated by law. The Finnish Furbreeders Association has developed its own national program of certification and animal health welfare that is tied to the ISO 9001 standard and monitored by the Det Norske Veritas. The fur animals are housed in shelter buildings or halls, where each animal has a specific place marked with a kit card. The Humane Society of the United States published videos in 2019 and 2021 showing minks with untreated wounds along with foxes with allegedly deformed feet, missing ears, or diseased eyes on the farms.

=== France ===
On 29 September 2020, Environment Minister Barbara Pompili announced that France&#x27;s four remaining mink farms would be closed within the next 5 years.

=== Lithuania ===
On 21 September 2023, Lithuanian parliament Seimas adopted a law banning fur farming by 2027. Owners of fur farms will be compensated, but the size of the compensations has been the subject of complaints from the business community. They will be paid 3 euros per animal in the first year, 2 euros per animal in the second year and one euro in the final year. The government will also compensate redundancy payments for farm workers and cover costs related to the demolition of buildings, the destruction of equipment and waste management.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland there were three fur farms in operation as of August 2014. These farms focused mainly on the trade of mink fur (some farms which previously used fox fur were winding down operation as such trade is no longer economically viable). In 2006, approximately 170,000 mink and 300 foxes were harvested in Ireland. Furs were exported from Ireland to other EU member states or to countries in Asia and North America. In Ireland, fur farms were monitored by the Department of Agriculture, and welfare standards of Ireland and the European Union were required to be adhered to at all times. 

In October 2009, there were discussions within the political sphere on the banning of fur farms in Ireland. Animal welfare groups welcomed such proposals, though concern was highlighted, in terms of its impact on rural communities where alternative industries are scarce. Fur farming Ireland contributed about €15 million per year to the economy as of 2014. A ban was subsequently passed before being overturned by Minister for Agriculture at the time Simon Coveney of Fine Gael after the party formed a new government following the 2011 election. 

A renewed campaign and efforts to push the Irish government or current Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed to re-implement a phase-out ban took place from 2018 to 2019. Following the introduction of the Solidarity party&#x27;s &#x27;Prohibition of Fur Farming Bill 2018&#x27;, the government gave in to political and public pressure and agreed conclusively through Minister Creed to implement a phase-out ban on fur farming in Ireland with the finer details to be announced afterwards.

Legislation banning fur farming in Ireland was brought into force on 4 April 2022, resulting in the closure of Ireland&#x27;s three remaining fur farms.

=== Netherlands ===
Fur farming of chinchillas and foxes is banned. Legislation to phase out mink fur farming (and thereby effectively all fur farming) by 2024 was approved by the end of 2012.

=== Russia ===
PETA published a video in 2019 alleging that animals were &quot;still suffering terribly&quot; in Russian fur farms, with slaughter methods involving beating, decapitation while conscious, and prolonged electrocution.

=== Spain ===
In July 2020, Spain culled 100,000 mink after a farm in the Aragon province was infected with COVID-19.

=== Sweden ===
As of November 2020, there were about 35 to 40 mink farms in Sweden, 10 of which had been infected with COVID-19. The government was not planning any culling as of 9 November 2020, but animal rights group Djurens Rätt was advocating for one in order to minimise the risk of a mutation that could compromise a COVID-19 vaccine.

=== United Kingdom ===
After a long campaign of daily protests, an act of parliament was introduced to ban the farming of animals for their fur. Fur farmers were given compensation in England and Wales in 2000. At second reading, the ban in England and Wales was justified principally on grounds of public morality. Prior to the ban, there had been 11 fur farms in the UK producing about 100,000 pelts annually. Respect for Animals Campaign director Mark Glover said at the time: 
&quot;To keep animals in such conditions in the name of fashion is totally unacceptable in a civilised society.&quot;

&quot;We&#x27;re the first country to introduce a national ban. It is a massive victory for us.&quot;

The Bill honoured Labour&#x27;s pre-election pledge to end fur factory farming. Although the last fur farm in Scotland had closed in 1993, the Scottish Parliament nevertheless banned fur farming in 2002. Fur farming was also banned in Northern Ireland in 2002 under the Fur Farming (Prohibition) (Northern Ireland) Order 2002.

According to Corporate Watch in 2019 the UK was importing more than £55m worth of fur, including £5.3m from China. 

In August 2022 an animal rights campaign group &quot;Shut Down T&amp;S Rabbits&quot; succeeded in closing down a network of rabbit meat and fur farms across the East Midlands region.

== Pandemic risk==
In a 2023 editorial for &quot;PNAS&quot;, scholars in the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London argued that &quot;mink, more so than any other farmed species, pose a risk for the emergence of future disease outbreaks and the evolution of future pandemics.&quot;

=== Denmark ===

On 6 November 2020, Denmark announced it would cull its entire 17 million mink population, divided over more than 1,000 Danish mink farms, as an emergency measure to prevent the spread of a mutated strain of COVID-19, of which at least five cases were found. By 9 November, more than 200 people have been infected with mink-related coronavirus, while 7 out of the 11 municipalities of the North Jutland Region were put under a strict lockdown from 6 November until at least 3 December to contain the spread. On 10 November, the process was put on hold due to political opposition, which argued that there was not enough scientific evidence yet whether the new virus variant was dangerous and thus whether the culling was necessary, given the loss of livelihood for fur farmers it would result in. By then, 2.5 million of its estimated 15 to 17 million mink population had already been culled. A Danish fur farmer interests association agreed that the culling should take place eventually, but that an agreement on proper compensation of the farmers should be reached beforehand. Meanwhile, it had been discovered that the North Jutland Region lockdown had been insufficient, as the mutated coronavirus had already spread to hundreds of mink farms elsewhere in Denmark. Although the Danish government halted the mandatory culling in mid-November, it still recommended culling, which continued on a voluntary basis. Industry group Kopenhagen Fur (accounting for 40% of mink production worldwide) announced it would gradually cease operations in 2–3 years because the circumstances had critically undermined the future of the global fur trade. An ECDC risk report warned that the Danish mink-mutated coronavirus, called Cluster 5, was a danger that had to be controlled, although the gravity was not yet fully understood. Leading American virologist Anthony Fauci downplayed the risk posed by Cluster 5.

=== Netherlands ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, by 25 May 2020 there were two cases where minks had infected humans with an apparently mutated form of the virus. There was high political pressure on the Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten to immediately cull all minks to prevent spreading this new version to humans. On 26 May, Schouten decided to wait for the veterinary epidemiological research report of 29 May, and said culling was only to be employed as a &#x27;last resort&#x27;. Demands to execute all minks immediately, to prevent a fur farm from restarting operations after having been culled due to COVID-19 infections, and to phase out fur farming earlier than the agreed date of 1 January 2024, were all rejected by the minister as legally impossible. After the testing report was completed, Minister Schouten in early June that 10 mink farms in Brabant and Limburg had to be culled to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. An objection from two animal activist groups was overruled by the court. On 6 June 2020 the culling of around 1,500 mother minks with about 4 to 5 pups each at a farm in Deurne was commenced, later 9 others would follow in Milheeze (two), De Mortel, Elsendorp, Beek en Donk, Deurne, Landhorst and Venray. On 27 August 2020, the government decided to move the definitive prohibition on fur farming forward to 1 March 2021. This decision was taken on the advice of the Outbreak Management Team (OMT) when more and more of the around 130 remaining mink farms were infected by COVID-19, necessitating containment of the spread and a clear perspective for a sector that, by then, had lost its economic viability and political support.

On 11 November, the Dutch government, on the advice of the OMT, decided to bring forward the phase-out again in order to limit the risk of mutation, with 1 January 2021 as the new target date. At that time, more than half of all mink farms had already been infected and culled, while preventive culling of not yet infected farms was in full swing to minimise the danger.

=== United States ===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated on 4 November 2020 that there were 11 mink farms in the United States that had been infected with COVID-19, including in the states of Utah, Wisconsin and Michigan. At least 8,000 mink had died due to the coronavirus at multiple farms in Utah and almost 3,400 at a Wisconsin farm. The Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association advocated culling the mink to prevent infections and especially mutations.

<text>William Randolph Heine (9 January 1945 – 2 April 2019) was an American-born British radio broadcaster and writer based in Oxford, England.

Heine started working for BBC Radio Oxford in 1983, and was considered by many to be very opinionated and perhaps somewhat controversial in the field of radio presenting. He was not afraid to speak his mind and allowed his listeners to do the same during his former afternoon phone-in show. Heine&#x27;s last regular broadcast was on 24 April 2016.

Born in Batavia, Illinois, Heine lived in Oxford since studying for a postgraduate degree at Balliol College in the late 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, he ran both the Penultimate Picture Palace cinema in East Oxford and the Moulin Rouge Cinema (which he later renamed Not The Moulin Rouge) in Headington. Bill and his friend, the sculptor John Buckley, designed a giant pair of hands to adorn the former, and a giant pair of legs for the latter.

Together Heine and Buckley, again, in 1986 came up with the fibreglass sculpture of a shark that appears to be crashing through the roof of the house he lived within, in the Headington area of Oxford, creating a somewhat controversial local landmark.

Heine&#x27;s book about his radio career, &quot;Heinstein of the Airwaves&quot;, was published by Chris Andrews Publications on 31 October 2008, and his book about his infamous sculpture, &quot;The Hunting of the Shark&quot;, was published by Oxfordfolio on 9 August 2011.

In November 2017, Heine revealed that he had been diagnosed with terminal acute myeloid leukaemia. He died at home on 2 April 2019.

<doc id="443301" wikidata="Q1190478" url="?curid=443301" title="Cromwell Current">
<text>The Cromwell Current (also called Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent or just Equatorial Undercurrent) is an eastward-flowing subsurface current that extends the length of the equator in the Pacific Ocean.

The Cromwell Current was discovered in 1952 by Townsend Cromwell, a researcher with the Honolulu Laboratory of the Fish and Wildlife Service (later the United States Fish and Wildlife Service). It is wide and flows to the east. It is hidden under the surface of the Pacific Ocean at the equator and is relatively shallow compared to other ocean currents being only from top to base. It is a powerful current with top velocities of up to 1.5 m/s (2.9 knots; 3.4 mph). The current&#x27;s core coincides with the thermocline and its distance from the parallel Equatorial Counter Current is approximately . It has 1,000 times the volume of the Mississippi River and its length is .
==Discovery==
In 1951 researchers on board a Fish and Fish and Wildlife Service fisheries research vessel were engaged in exploratory longline fishing when they noticed that the gear deep under water drifted eastwards. This was considered unusual because the surface currents of the Pacific Ocean flow westwards at the equator, following the direction of the winds. In 1952 Townsend Cromwell led a research party to investigate how the currents of the ocean varied as a function of depth. They discovered a fast-flowing current that flowed eastwards in the deep surface layers.

==Mechanism==
It is difficult to explain the Cromwell Current easily. At least two different mechanisms are at work in order to guarantee the constant eastward current: (a) Because the Cromwell Current is located on the equator, the Coriolis force is equal to zero and does not act upon a water parcel. This means that the east–west pressure gradient functions without being diverted from the high-pressure area in the west toward the low-pressure area in the east, simply following the gradient. The cause of the pressure gradient is at least partially the trade winds blowing from the east westward. (b) Any water parcel flowing eastward from the west that would somehow be perturbed from its path would be diverted northward if north of the equator and southward if south of the equator. In such a case the local Coriolis force would force the parcel immediately back into the main current that flows from west to east.

==Detailed data==
*Depth: The surface currents flow west. There is reversal point about down, where the water starts to flow east. The current goes down to about .
*Flow rate:The total flow is up to around per second. The top speed is around 1.5 m/s (2.9 knots; 3.4 mph), which is about twice as fast as the westerly surface current.

*Length:

==Interaction with El Niño==
El Niño is a reversal of the normal situation in the Pacific Ocean. Surface water is blown westwards by the prevailing winds and deeper water is forced upwards to replace it. Every now and then, the surface water sloshes back across the ocean, bringing warm water temperatures along the eastern coasts of the Pacific. In non-El Niño years, the Cromwell Current is forced to the surface by underwater seamounts near the Galapagos islands (this is called upwelling.) However, during El Nino years the current does not upwell in this way. The waters around the islands are therefore considerably warmer during El Niño years than during normal years.

==Effect on wildlife==
The Cromwell Current is both oxygen- and nutrient-rich. A large number of fish are concentrated in it. Upwelling occurs near the Galapagos Islands. This brings food supplies to the surface for Galápagos penguin. Upwelling, however, is a sporadic phenomenon; it fails to occur on a regular basis, and so the food supply comes and goes. The penguins have several adaptations to cope with this, including versatility in their breeding habits.

==Possible effect on climate==
The effect of this current on world climate is not well understood.

<text>Francis Rawn Shunk (August 7, 1788 – July 20, 1848) was the tenth governor of Pennsylvania from 1845 to 1848.

==Early career==
Shunk was born on August 7, 1788, in Trappe, Pennsylvania, to a poor farming family of German descent. His great-grandfather Simon Schunck was born in Saarland and settled in the Province of Pennsylvania. Francis R. Shunk began working on his father&#x27;s farm at age 10. He continued to attend school, and by age 16 had received his qualification as a teacher and started working in the schools.

Originally a Democratic-Republican in politics, and later a Democrat, in 1812 Shunk was appointed Clerk to state Surveyor General Andrew Porter, the father of Governor David R. Porter. Shunk served in the Pennsylvania militia during the War of 1812, and took part in the 1814 defense of Baltimore.

After the war, Shunk was appointed Principal Clerk of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In 1820, he married Jane Findlay, daughter of Pennsylvania Governor and Senator, William Findlay, and Pennsylvania First Lady Nancy Irwin Findlay.

From 1829 to 1839, Shunk served as Secretary of the state Canal Commission, a critical position in the government during a period when major canal, railroad and other public works projects were planned and constructed.

In 1839, Shunk was appointed Secretary of the Commonwealth, and he served until 1842.

==Governor of Pennsylvania==
When Democratic gubernatorial candidate Henry A. P. Muhlenberg unexpectedly died in August 1844, Shunk was selected as the party&#x27;s replacement nominee. He narrowly defeated Whig candidate Joseph Markle. A large crowd attended Shunk&#x27;s inaugural ceremonies, which were held during a snowstorm on January 21, 1845.

Reelected during the 1847 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, he was compelled to retire before his second term was complete due to failing health caused by tuberculosis. He resigned on July 9, 1848, and died in Harrisburg on July 20, 1848, just eleven days after tendering his resignation. Shunk was buried at the Augustus Lutheran Church Cemetery in Trappe, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
*Shunk Hall on the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University is named in his honor.

*Shunk Street in Philadelphia is also named for him, as is Governor F.R. Shunk Avenue in Carlisle.

*The village of Shunk in Fox Township, Sullivan County, home to the Endless Winds Volunteer Fire Department is also named for him.

<doc id="443312" wikidata="Q369904" url="?curid=443312" title="William F. Johnston">
<text>William Freame Johnston (November 29, 1808October 25, 1872) was the 11th governor of Pennsylvania, from 1848 to 1852. A lawyer by training, Johnston became district attorney of Westmoreland County at the age of 21 in 1829. He was elected to the Pennsylvania state legislature and switched from the Democratic Party to the Whig Party in 1847 to run for the Pennsylvania Senate.

William F. Johnston was born on November 29, 1808, in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. His parents were Alexander Johnston, an Ulster Scots immigrant from County Tyrone and Elizabeth (Freame) Johnston, whose father was born in Belfast. In 1832, Johnston married Mary Ann Montieth (1814–1898). The couple had five sons and two daughters.

He was named Senate Speaker in 1848 and, upon the resignation of Governor Francis Shunk, assumed the position of governor. Although, because of the transition, Johnston could have delayed the scheduled October elections, he chose to let them proceed and was narrowly elected to the position as a Whig, defeating Democratic candidate Morris Longstreth by only 297 votes. Johnston fought the federal Fugitive Slave Act and its enforcement in Pennsylvania. He lost re-election to Democrat William Bigler in 1851.

In 1856 he was nominated by the northern, anti-slavery faction of the American Party for the office of Vice President, but was later induced to withdraw in favor of William L. Dayton, the Republican nominee.

In 1864, in the midst of the American Civil War, Johnston refused to support the renomination of incumbent president Abraham Lincoln by the Republican Party, instead backing the splinter Radical Democracy Party and their campaign in favor of John C. Frémont, the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential nominee in 1856 who was now campaigning on a platform calling for a more radical reconstruction than Lincoln endorsed. Johnston would serve as the temporary convention president at the convention where Frémont would be nominated.

Johnston Commons on Penn State University is named for the former governor. His father built and operated the Kingston House in Unity Township, Pennsylvania. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

<text>Warrenpoint () is a small port town and civil parish in County Down, Northern Ireland. It sits at the head of Carlingford Lough, south of Newry, and is separated from the Republic of Ireland by a narrow strait. The town is beside the village of Rostrevor and is overlooked by the Mournes and Cooley Mountains. Warrenpoint sprang up within the townland of Ringmackilroy (), and is locally nicknamed &quot;The Point&quot;, which also represents the town&#x27;s full name in Irish, &quot;An Pointe&quot;.

Warrenpoint is known for its scenic location, the &quot;Maiden of Mourne&quot; festival, the &quot;Blues on the Bay&quot; music festival, the passenger ferry service between Warrenpoint and Omeath and the nearby Narrow Water Castle. Warrenpoint Port is second in terms of tonnage handled by ports in Northern Ireland. It had a population of 9,091 at the 2021 Census.

== History ==

The area of Warrenpoint was formerly known as &quot;Rinn Mhic Giolla Ruaidh&quot; (&quot;McIlroy&#x27;s point&quot;), anglicised Ringmackilroy, which is still the name of the townland in which it sits. Earlier, it was also known as Portyneil, which may come from &quot;Port Uí Néill&quot; (&quot;O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s port&quot;) or &quot;Port an Aoil&quot; (&quot;port of the lime&quot;).

The earliest reference to the settlement of Warrenpoint is in 1744. It is believed to come from the English surname Waring. It is reported that By 1750 there were only two houses in the village, &quot;with a few huts for the occasional residence of the fishermen during the oyster season&quot;. In the following fifty years, however, its scenic setting and coastal location seem to have hastened its swift growth and by 1837 it had 462 houses.

Fairs were held once a month and a market every Friday. In the mid-19th century, Newry merchants obtained a government grant to create a tidal dock at the village, as prior to 1850 ships of above 150 tonnes could not get further up the lough than Narrow Water.

A railway connection opened on 9 May 1849, increasing Warrenpoint&#x27;s popularity as a holiday destination. and Warrenpoint became popular as a resort town. Thousands flocked to the resort every year, where most took the passenger ferry to Omeath in County Louth. The Warrenpoint railway station closed in January 1965, while the ferry continued on a seasonal basis until 2015.

A bandstand in the town park provided concerts and a saltwater swimming pool was built in 1908. The baths were opened by Captain Roger Hall on Whit Monday, 8 June in that year, but they are now closed to the public.

On 6 February 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army ambushed an Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) patrol in Warrenpoint. The ambush took place on Seaview Road and one USC constable was killed.

During World War II, on 15 July 1944 two Royal Air Force aircraft (an Airspeed Oxford (LX 598) and a Miles Martinet (MS626) from No. 290 Squadron RAF) were taking part in a civil defence demonstration at Warrenpoint. In misty conditions the planes collided, the pilots only having seen each other at the last minute. The resultant explosion killed all on board, and pieces of the planes fell onto Church Street, Duke Street and Queen Street and into Carlingford Lough. The bodies of the airmen were recovered and taken to the mortuary in Newry.

On 27 August 1979, during &quot;the Troubles&quot;, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambushed a British Army convoy at nearby Narrow Water Castle. Eighteen soldiers were killed in what became known as the Warrenpoint ambush – the British Army&#x27;s greatest loss-of-life in a single incident during the conflict.

On 12 April 1989, Joanne Reilly was killed by the IRA in a van bomb attack on Warrenpoint Royal Ulster Constabulary base. Inadequate warning was given.

== Places of interest ==
Two small inland lakes, the &quot;Mill Dam&quot; and the &quot;Waterworks&quot; offer a variety of fishing opportunities. A permit is needed to fish these lakes, which are located about 1 mile from the town centre.

Warrenpoint Promenade was used as a backdrop for Bundoran in the film &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;, especially the exterior of the Star of the Sea Convent and the Edwardian swimming baths.

The Bridal Loanan is one of the biggest cul-de-sac&#x27;s in the world and the largest in Europe. It also has the Magennis Investiture Stone at its peak.

== Education ==
St Dallan&#x27;s Primary School, a Catholic primary school of about 700 pupils, was opened in September 2000 by the then Education Minister Martin McGuinness. Formed from the merger of the Star of the Sea and St. Peters Primary Schools, it was built on the site of the former St. Peters Primary School.

Other schools in the area include Dromore Road Primary School and St Mark&#x27;s High School.

==Transport==
The A2 road connects Warrenpoint to Newry, by way of Narrow Water Castle. A bus service links Newry, Warrenpoint and Rostrevor along the A2. The long-planned Narrow Water Bridge to Omeath was expected to begin construction during 2023.

The Newry, Warrenpoint and Rostrevor Railway opened in 1849 and was taken over by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) in 1889, operating with the Newry and Armagh Railway as part of the branch to before it closed to passengers in 1933. The line to Warrenpoint eventually closed down in 1965, with the railway trackbed used to build the A2 dual carriageway. Warrenpoint railway station was located next to the docks. Railway service was never extended to Rostrevor, but from 1877 until 1915 the Warrenpoint and Rostrevor Tramway ran horse-drawn trams on the route.

Warrenpoint port has regular freight ferries to Heysham, operated by Seatruck. Local ferry services between Warrenpoint and Omeath operated for many years, but ceased in 2015 with the retirement of the last ferry captain.

The Newry Ship Canal was closed to commercial shipping in 1974, but remains intact as far as Newry city centre, and can be sailed by leisure boats.

<doc id="443314" wikidata="Q4837661" url="?curid=443314" title="Babe Parilli">
<text>Vito&quot;Babe&quot;Parilli (May 7, 1930 – July 15, 2017) was an American football quarterback and coach who played professionally for 18 seasons. Parilli spent five seasons in the National Football League (NFL), three in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and 10 in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football at the University of Kentucky, where he twice received consensus All-American honors and won two consecutive bowl games.

Parilli achieved his greatest professional success in the AFL as the starting quarterback of the Boston Patriots from 1961 to 1967. He earned three All-Star Game selections, while leading the Patriots to their only AFL postseason and championship game appearance in 1963. Present for the entirety of the AFL&#x27;s existence, Parilli played his final seasons for the New York Jets and was part of the team that won a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl III. After retiring as a player, he served as a coach in the NFL, World Football League (WFL), and Arena Football League (AFL) from 1973 to 1997. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982.

==Early life==
Parilli was born and raised in Rochester, Pennsylvania, an industrial town northwest of Pittsburgh, Parilli graduated from Rochester High School in 1948.

==College career==
Parilli played college football at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, and was a quarterback for the Wildcats under head coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant. He was a consensus All-American in 1950 and 1951 and was fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1950 and third in 1951. He led the Wildcats to victories in consecutive New Year&#x27;s Day bowl games in the 1951 Sugar Bowl and 1952 Cotton Bowl.

===Statistics===
==Football career==
===Early years===
Parilli was the fourth overall selection of the 1952 NFL draft, taken by the Green Bay Packers. 
He played two seasons with the Packers and was then drafted into the United States Air Force and to the Cleveland Browns. Fulfilling his ROTC commitment, he became a lieutenant in the Air Force and, like a lot of other pros, played service football. When his service was over he played a season with the Cleveland Browns in 1956, two more with the Packers, and another with Ottawa in 1959.

===AFL===
At age 30, Parilli was picked up by the Oakland Raiders of the fledgling American Football League on August 17, 1960, and threw for just over 1,000 yards that season.

On April 4, 1961, he was part of a five-player trade that sent him to the Boston Patriots, and he went on to become one of the AFL&#x27;s most productive and colorful players. Playing for the Patriots from 1961 through 1967, Parilli finished his career with over 25,000 total yards and 200 touchdowns, ending among the top five quarterbacks in 23 categories such as passing yards, passing touchdowns and rushing yards. Parilli was selected for three All-Star Games. In 1964, throwing primarily to Gino Cappelletti, Parilli amassed nearly 3,500 yards passing with 31 touchdowns; the latter was a Patriots record until Tom Brady broke it in 2007. During that season&#x27;s contest against the Oakland Raiders on October 16, he threw for 422 yards and four touchdown passes in a 43–43 tie. Parilli is a member of the Patriots All-1960s (AFL) Team.

Parilli completed his career with the New York Jets, where he earned a ring as Joe Namath&#x27;s backup in Super Bowl III, when the Jets stunned the Baltimore Colts by a 16–7 score. Coincidentally, this gave the Jets two quarterbacks from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Beaver County, with Parilli being from Rochester and Namath being from nearby Beaver Falls. In addition, both played for &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant in college, as Namath played at Alabama. In 1967, it was discovered by &quot;Life&quot; magazine that Parilli and several other professional athletes were regular patrons of Patriarca crime family mobster Arthur Ventola&#x27;s major fencing operation called Arthur&#x27;s Farm in Revere, Massachusetts. Despite the organized crime connection, journalist Howie Carr stated that there was never any inside information passed between Parilli and Ventola. Arthur was the uncle of mob associate Richard Castucci.

Besides his considerable skills as a quarterback, he was one of the best holders in the history of football and was nicknamed &quot;gold-finger&quot; as a result of kicker Jim Turner&#x27;s then-record 145 points kicked in 1968 (plus another 19 points in the play-offs and in Super Bowl III). He is one of only 20 players who were in the American Football League for its entire ten-year existence, and is a member of the University of Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1982, Parilli was named to the College Football Hall of Fame.

Because of their Italian surnames, the Patriots&#x27; wide receiver-quarterback duo of Cappelletti and Parilli was nicknamed &quot;Grand Opera.&quot;

Parilli retired as a player at the age of 40 in August 1970.

==Career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Coaching career==
In 1974, Parilli became the head coach of the New York Stars of the World Football League; after going bankrupt, the franchise moved to Charlotte mid-season. The next year, he was tabbed as coach of the WFL&#x27;s Chicago Winds, and briefly seemed to have a chance to coach his old teammate, Joe Namath. But Namath turned Chicago down, and Parilli was replaced in late July after only two pre-season games. (The Winds would play only five regular-season contests before folding, and the rest of the WFL would collapse a few months later.) Parilli would later coach in the Arena Football League, helming the New England Steamrollers, Denver Dynamite, Charlotte Rage, Las Vegas Sting, Anaheim Piranhas and Florida Bobcats.

==Death==
Parilli died on July 15, 2017, in Parker, Colorado of multiple myeloma at the age of 87.

==Honors==
Parilli was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. On November 15, 2014, he was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="443315" wikidata="Q58134" url="?curid=443315" title="Rostrevor">
<text>Rostrevor () is a village and townland in County Down, Northern Ireland. It lies at the foot of Slieve Martin on the coast of Carlingford Lough, near Warrenpoint. The Kilbroney River flows through the village and Rostrevor Forest is nearby. south-east of Newry, the village is within the Newry, Mourne and Down local government district.

Rostrevor had a population of 2,800 in the 2011 Census.

==Name==
The first part of the name &quot;Rostrevor&quot; comes from the Irish word &quot;ros&quot;, meaning a wood or wooded headland. The second part of the name comes from Sir Edward Trevor from Denbighshire in Wales, who settled in the area in the early 17th century and was succeeded by his son Marcus Trevor, who later became Viscount Dungannon. Walter Harris, writing in 1744, mistakenly believed that the first part of the name came from Sir Edward Trevor&#x27;s wife Rose, a daughter of Henry Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh. His etymology was later repeated by some other writers. Before Sir Edward Trevor&#x27;s renaming of the area it was known as &quot;Caisleán Ruaidhrí&quot; (), anglicised &quot;Castle Rory&quot; or &quot;Castle Roe&quot;, after one of the Magennis lords of Iveagh.

Today the spelling &quot;Rostrevor&quot; is used for the village, while the spelling &quot;Rosstrevor&quot; is used for the townland.

==Places of interest==
Nearby Cloughmore is a 50-ton granite boulder perched on the slopes of Slieve Martin, 1,000 ft above the village of Rostrevor, and known locally as &#x27;the big stone&#x27;. It was deposited there by retreating glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum. Local legend states that the stone was thrown by Irish mythological hero and frequent giant Finn McCool from the Cooley Mountains, on the other side of Carlingford Lough, to settle a fight with a local frost-giant named Ruiscairre, burying him underneath the boulder. Walking around the stone seven times will allegedly bring good luck.

The old church, supposedly built on an original site established by St Brónach, stands in the graveyard on the Kilbroney road. It became a listed building in 1983.

In the village&#x27;s Catholic church is the bell of Brónach, dating from around 900 A.D. There are many stories of how the bell used to scare locals walking past St Bronach&#x27;s church on stormy nights. All they could hear was a mighty sound and did not know the source; many believed it to be a calling from God. It was said that the ringing of the bell warned of rough water on the lough. In 1885, the bell was found in the fork of an old oak tree, where it had been hidden many years before, probably at the time of the Reformation.

The village has two rivers, the Ghan and the Fairy Glen, so named because many fairies are suspected of living along the banks of the river.

<text>Portaferry () is a small town in County Down, Northern Ireland, at the southern end of the Ards Peninsula, near the Narrows at the entrance to Strangford Lough. It is home to the Exploris aquarium and is well known for the annual Gala Week Float Parade. It hosts its own small Marina, the Portaferry Marina. The Portaferry – Strangford Ferry service operates daily at 30-minute intervals (7.45 am to 10.45 pm) between the villages of Portaferry and Strangford, less than 1500 metres apart, conveying about 500,000 passengers per annum. It had a population of 2,514 people in the 2011 Census. The town is located within the Barony of Ards Upper.

Pot fishing, mainly for prawns and crabs and licensed shellfish farming takes place within Strangford Lough. Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast have a Marine Research Laboratory on the shorefront. The town is also home to a research centre for Swedish tidal-kite developer Minesto. The lough is one of the world&#x27;s most important marine sites with over 2,000 marine species.

There are fine Georgian buildings in the town square, including a Market House, now used as a community centre.

Portaferry Lifeboat is an essential lifeline for local fishermen and yachtsmen. The Atlantic 75 is the fastest seagoing lifeboat in the RNLI&#x27;s fleet and is capable of speeds up to 34 knots.

==History==
==Wildlife==
Algae. Records of algae such as &quot;Polysiphonia fibrata&quot;, &quot;Haraldiophyllum bonnemaisonii&quot; have been recorded from Portaferry.

==Demography==
===2011 Census===
Portaferry is classified as an intermediate settlement by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 2,250 and 4,500 people). On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 2,511 people living in Portaferry. Of these:
* 20.23% were aged under 16 years and 16.65% were aged 65 and over
* 50.98% of the usually resident population were male and 49.02% were female
*99.44% were from the white (including Irish Traveller) ethnic group
*84.15% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic religion and 12.31% belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; religion
*32.02% indicated that they had a British national identity, 35.68% had an Irish national identity and 37.00% had a Northern Irish national identity

==People==
* Bishop Robert Echlin, Bishop of Down and Connor (1612–1635) is buried in the ancient ruins of Templecraney, Portaferry off Church St.
* Australian pastoralist Hugh Glass was born in Portaferry in 1817.
* Actor and playwright Joseph Tomelty, born in Portaferry in 1911. 
* Priest, philosopher and poet Father Vincent McNabb was born in Portaferry.
* Middle-distance runner Ciara Mageean was born in Portaferry in 1992.
* Singer/songwriter Ryan McMullan is from Portaferry.

==Environment==
The Portaferry area is popular with local and foreign tourists for its beauty, history, wildlife and other visitor attractions. Strangford Lough is the largest sea inlet in the British Isles.

It is Northern Ireland&#x27;s first Marine Nature Reserve and is renowned as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Special Scientific Interest, with six National Nature Reserves within its reaches. Over 2000 species of marine animals have been found in the lough and internationally important flocks of wildfowl and wading birds converge there in winter. The lough is also the most important site in Ireland for breeding common seals.

===Climate===
==Sport==
GAA sports, particularly hurling are popular in the area and Portaferry GAC were Ulster Club Hurling Champions in 2014. There are two other GAA clubs nearby, Ballygalget and Ballycran, and there is intense rivalry between the three.

Other pursuits are sailing, coastal rowing, angling, wildfowling, and birdwatching. The town has the lough&#x27;s longest established sailing club.

==Industry==
Portaferry industrial activities include agriculture, fishing, tourism. &#x27;Suki Tea&#x27; announced as of 2014 that experimental tea growing will commence in the area, utilising the relatively warm and dry climate, with frost protection from Strangford Lough. 

The lough is a centre for experimental marine current turbine technology development. Tidal energy, unlike wind or wave, is a renewable energy resource which can be predicted. In 2008 a twin-rotor 1.2 MW SeaGen was installed and successfully demonstrated this technology until its decommissioning which began in 2017. Swedish company Minesto have tested various versions of their tidal-kite technology in the lough since 2011, and have a workshop and offices in Portaferry.

Portaferry played a part in the linen industry. Many of the women in the town were employed to embroider handkerchiefs for Thomas Somerset and Co. one of the major linen companies in Ireland. The company realised that the women were more productive in the summer due to the light, so installed the first electric light outside of Belfast in Ulster. Each house with a working woman was given one light fitting and bulb. There was also a bus service introduced to bring more women from the Ards Peninsula to Portaferry to work in the factory that Somerset built.

<doc id="443318" wikidata="Q3273544" url="?curid=443318" title="Structural motif">
<text>In a chain-like biological molecule, such as a protein or nucleic acid, a structural motif is a common three-dimensional structure that appears in a variety of different, evolutionarily unrelated molecules. A structural motif does not have to be associated with a sequence motif; it can be represented by different and completely unrelated sequences in different proteins or RNA.

==In nucleic acids==


Depending upon the sequence and other conditions, nucleic acids can form a variety of structural motifs which is thought to have biological significance.

;Stem-loop: Stem-loop intramolecular base pairing is a pattern that can occur in single-stranded DNA or, more commonly, in RNA. The structure is also known as a hairpin or hairpin loop. It occurs when two regions of the same strand, usually complementary in nucleotide sequence when read in opposite directions, base-pair to form a double helix that ends in an unpaired loop. The resulting structure is a key building block of many RNA secondary structures.

;Cruciform DNA: Cruciform DNA is a form of non-B DNA that requires at least a 6 nucleotide sequence of inverted repeats to form a structure consisting of a stem, branch point and loop in the shape of a cruciform, stabilized by negative DNA supercoiling. Two classes of cruciform DNA have been described; folded and unfolded. 
;G-quadruplex: &quot;G-quadruplex&quot; secondary structures (G4) are formed in nucleic acids by sequences that are rich in guanine. They are helical in shape and contain guanine tetrads that can form from one, two or four strands.

;D-loop: A displacement loop or D-loop is a DNA structure where the two strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule are separated for a stretch and held apart by a third strand of DNA. An R-loop is similar to a D-loop, but in this case the third strand is RNA rather than DNA. The third strand has a base sequence which is complementary to one of the main strands and pairs with it, thus displacing the other complementary main strand in the region. Within that region the structure is thus a form of triple-stranded DNA. A diagram in the paper introducing the term illustrated the D-loop with a shape resembling a capital &quot;D&quot;, where the displaced strand formed the loop of the &quot;D&quot;.

==In proteins==

In proteins, a structural motif describes the connectivity between secondary structural elements. An individual motif usually consists of only a few elements, e.g., the &#x27;helix-turn-helix&#x27; motif which has just three. Note that, while the &quot;spatial sequence&quot; of elements may be identical in all instances of a motif, they may be encoded in any order within the underlying gene. In addition to secondary structural elements, protein structural motifs often include loops of variable length and unspecified structure. Structural motifs may also appear as tandem repeats.

; Beta hairpin: Extremely common. Two antiparallel beta strands connected by a tight turn of a few amino acids between them.
; Greek key: Four beta strands, three connected by hairpins, the fourth folded over the top.
; Omega loop: A loop in which the residues that make up the beginning and end of the loop are very close together.
; Helix-loop-helix: Consists of alpha helices bound by a looping stretch of amino acids. This motif is seen in transcription factors.
; Zinc finger: Two beta strands with an alpha helix end folded over to bind a zinc ion. Important in DNA binding proteins.
; Helix-turn-helix: Two α helices joined by a short strand of amino acids and found in many proteins that regulate gene expression.
; Nest: Extremely common. Three consecutive amino acid residues form an anion-binding concavity.
; Niche: Extremely common. Three or four consecutive amino acid residues form a cation-binding feature.

<text>Moneymore () is a village and townland in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It had a population of 1,897 in the 2011 census. It is situated within Mid-Ulster District. It is an example of a plantation village in Mid-Ulster built by the Drapers&#x27; Company of London.

==Geography==
Moneymore lies in a glen. The Ballymully River flows through the southern part of the village. The river rises on a large hill, Slieve Gallion (one of the Sperrins), which has a radio tower on top. The village is about 35 miles (56.3 km) from the sea to the north.

==History==

There was an important battle fought near Moneymore called the battle of Móin Daire Lothair in the year 563 between the Northern Uí Néill and the Cruithin tribe which the Northern Uí Néill won. This battle is recorded in the Annals of Ulster and would have been a major event at the time. Much of Great Britain and Ireland would have descent from these two groups as there was notable mixing with Scotland over the years and the Uí Néill split to form the Southern Uí Néill in the Irish midlands around this time.

During The Troubles, seven people were killed in or near Moneymore in violence related to the conflict, six of them by the Provisional IRA and one by the UDA.

==People==
* Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – 22 April 1842), Roman Catholic bishop in the United States

* John Harris, surgeon, early settler of Australia, born Moneymore 1754

==Places of interest==
The most notable building in the town is the 17th century Plantation house, Springhill, built and owned by the Conyngham, later Lenox-Conyngham family but since 1957 in the ownership of the National Trust.

<doc id="443324" wikidata="Q1058376" url="?curid=443324" title="Department of Justice (Canada)">
<text>The Department of Justice () is a department of the Government of Canada that represents the Canadian government in legal matters. The Department of Justice works to ensure that Canada&#x27;s justice system is as fair, accessible and efficient as possible. The department helps the federal government to develop policy and to draft and reform laws as needed. At the same time, it acts as the government&#x27;s legal adviser, providing legal counsel and support, and representing the Government of Canada in court.

The department&#x27;s responsibilities reflect the double role of the Minister of Justice, who is also by law the Attorney General of Canada: in general terms, the Minister is concerned with the administration of justice, including policy in such areas as criminal law, family law, human rights law, and Aboriginal justice; the Attorney General is the chief law officer of the Crown, responsible for conducting all litigation for the federal government.

While the role of the Minister of Justice has existed since 1867, the department was not created until 1868. The headquarters of the Department of Justice is located in Ottawa at St. Andrew&#x27;s Tower (284 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H8), a modern low rise office tower built in 1987.

The 53rd and current Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada is Arif Virani.

==History ==

At the time of Confederation in 1867, the Province of Canada had two Crown Law Departments, one for Canada West (now Ontario) and one for Canada East (now Quebec). At Confederation, the Crown Law Department, Canada West began to act as the new Department of Justice, reporting to John A. Macdonald, who was Minister of Justice, Attorney General, and the new prime minister. The Crown Law Department, Canada East became the new Department of the Militia, following its former Attorney General, George-Étienne Cartier.

The Department of Justice came into being in May 1868, when the &quot;Department of Justice Act&quot; was passed by Parliament. The Act formally recognized the informal structure that was already in place. The Act also laid out the distinct roles of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General: the Minister was a partisan political adviser to the Crown, while the Attorney General provided legal services.

The new Department of Justice had only seven staff: two barristers-at-law (including the Deputy Minister, Hewitt Bernard), a clerk and shorthand writer (Macdonald&#x27;s personal secretary), a copy clerk, a clerk articling under Macdonald, and two messengers.

The legal branch of the department remained relatively small for many years. As late as 1939, the department employed only seven lawyers. The department&#x27;s first woman lawyer, Henrietta Bourque, was hired in 1939, but the department remained heavily male-dominated. In the 25 years between 1939 and 1964, only five female lawyers were hired by the department.

Although the &quot;Department of Justice Act&quot; had given the department responsibility for all litigation for or against the government, many government departments hired their own lawyers to provide them with legal advice. In 1962, however, these departmental lawyers were brought together in a common legal service. Although many lawyers still work closely with other government departments in departmental legal services units, they are now considered to be employees of the Department of Justice.

Regional offices were opened in Montreal (1965), Toronto (1966), Vancouver (1967), Winnipeg (1969), Halifax, Edmonton, Saskatoon, the Northwest Territories, and Iqaluit (Nunavut). The Department of Justice co-chaired the Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development from 1999 until 2012.

The department employs 5,000 people, nearly half of whom are lawyers, in offices across the country mostly under the Public Prosecution Service of Canada.

<text>Kilkeel () is a small town and civil parish on the Irish Sea coast of County Down, Northern Ireland. It is the main fishing port on the Down coast, and its harbour is home to the largest fishing fleet in Northern Ireland. It had a population of 6,633 people at the 2021 census. The town contains the ruins of a 14th-century church and fort, winding streets and terraced shops. It lies just south of the Mourne Mountains, in the historic barony of Mourne, and is the southernmost town in Northern Ireland.

==Geography==
Kilkeel town sits on a plain south of the Mourne Mountains, west of where the Kilkeel River flows south into the North Channel. The town is centred in the townland of Magheramurphy (), and extends into the neighbouring townlands of:
*Derryoge ()
*Drumcro ()
*Dunnaman
*Kilkeel ()

Altogether there are 69 townlands in the civil parish and barony.

==History==

Kilkeel takes its name from the old church overlooking the town, it being the anglicised version of the Irish &quot;Cill Chaoil&quot; meaning &quot;church of the narrow&quot;. The name may refer to the church itself or perhaps the church&#x27;s location on a narrow site between the Aughrim and Kilkeel rivers. The church was built in 1388 and dedicated to Saint Colman of Mourne. It was thought to be the principal church in a group which included Kilmegan and Kilcoo despite the fact that Kilkeel was very sparsely populated in the Middle Ages. There are references to Kilkeel as a Christian settlement as far back as the 11th century. The church was rebuilt in the 1600s, and was later used as a school in the 19th century, before being abandoned.

The cemetery attached to the church was used for burials until 1916. The last burials at the cemetery were victims of a collision between two steamers, the &quot;Retriever&quot; and the &quot;SS Connemara&quot;, in Carlingford Lough.

The town is split by the Aughrim river. The northern part falls into the Kilkeel townland, while the southern part falls into Magheramurphy.
Kilkeel grew slowly from a small village to a town by the late 1700s. The earliest recorded dates are a kerbstone inscribed 1772, and a second story arch window in Newry St inscribed 1790, while the map alongside from 1777 shows that Kilkeel&#x27;s current layout of 5 main streets was already established.

The population of Kilkeel peaked at about 15,000 at the time of the great famine, after which it fell to about 11,000, with about 1,000 people in Kilkeel town.

==Economy==
Fishing is a major industry in Kilkeel, with Kilkeel Harbour the home port for the largest fishing fleet in Northern Ireland. There are fish-processing factories around the port, pleasure angling off the piers and lobster farming along the coastline. 

As of the early 21st century, Collins Aerospace (previously known as BE Aerospace and Rockwell Collins) had become the largest employer in the area. As of 2014, its Kilkeel facility, which manufactures aircraft seats for a worldwide customer base, employed over 800 people.

== Music ==
The Kilkeel area is home to thirteen marching bands:

* Pride of Ballinran Flute Band
* Mourne Young Defenders Flute Band
* Rising Sons of the Valley Flute Band
* Ballyvea Flute Band
* Derryogue Flute Band
* Orangefield Flute Band
* Glenloughan Flute Band
* Kilkeel Silver Band
* Aughnahoory Pipe Band
* Ballymartin Pipe Band
* Cranfield Accordion Band
* Ballymageough Accordion Band
* Roden Accordion Band

==People==
The town is also known as the location where the 19th-century serial killer William Hare died.

Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, grandson of the late Queen Elizabeth II and son of King Charles III of the United Kingdom was granted the title &quot;Baron Kilkeel&quot; along with that of &quot;Duke of Sussex&quot; and &quot;Earl of Dumbarton&quot;.

<text>Coalisland () is a small town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, with a population of 5,682 in the 2011 Census. Four miles from Lough Neagh, it was formerly a centre for coal mining.

Coalisland was established around the Coalisland Canal in the 17th century due to the discovery of coal deposits in the region. In the 20th century, the town was known as an IRA stronghold during the Troubles, with 20 people shot in or near Coalisland from 1969 to 2001. The first civil rights march in Northern Ireland took place in Coalisland in 1968, organized by the CSJ and NICRA. The Coalisland Canal, now derelict, is the focus of a restoration campaign. Coalisland railway station operated from 1897 to 1965, but only remnants of the railway exist today. Daily bus services run through the town, and the Craic Theatre and Arts Centre serves as a performing arts venue and youth theatre programme.

==History==
===Origins===
In the late 17th century, coal deposits were discovered in East Tyrone. While it was possible to exploit these resources, the difficulty was in getting the coal to market in Dublin. In 1744 work began on the Coalisland Canal linking the coalfields to Lough Neagh. The town grew up around the canal workings.

===Twentieth century===
On 24 August 1968, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ), the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), among others, held the first civil rights march in Northern Ireland. The march went from Coalisland to Dungannon.

=== The Troubles ===

The town has traditionally been viewed as an IRA stronghold throughout the twentieth century, with deep and enduring links to republicanism in the vicinity. From 1969 to 2001, a total of 20 people were shot in or near Coalisland during the Troubles. The British Army killed a total of eight people, seven of whom were Provisional Irish Republican Army members and one a Catholic civilian; the IRA killed five British soldiers, three Royal Ulster Constabulary policemen, one ex-Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, and two Catholic civilians, all in separate incidents. The Ulster Volunteer Force was responsible for the murder of a Catholic civilian in the nearby town of Aughamullan.

==Transport==
The town was served by a canal (the Coalisland Canal or Tyrone Navigation), although this is now derelict. A campaign for its restoration is underway.

Coalisland railway station was opened on 28 July 1897, closed for passenger traffic on 16 January 1956 and for goods traffic on 5 October 1959, finally closing altogether on 1 April 1965. There are no remains of the railway other than the bridge on the Derry Road, an old goods shed, and grown-over platforms.

Daily bus services operated by Ulsterbus go through the town.

==Arts and culture==
The Craic Theatre and Arts Centre is a performing arts venue built on the site of an old weaving factory. Each year it provides opportunities and entertainment for people of the area, through its in-house company Craic Players. It has a youth theatre programme for children and young people aged 4–18. It also offers professional touring companies the opportunity to stage shows, concerts and workshops.

==Education==
Primary schools in the area include Gaelscoil Uí Néill, Primate Dixon Primary School and St John&#x27;s Primary School.

St Joseph&#x27;s College is a Catholic secondary school in the town.

==Sport==
Coalisland Na Fianna, the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, was founded in 1903.

<text>Comber ( , , locally ) is a town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It lies south of Newtownards, at the northern end of Strangford Lough. It is situated in the townland of Town Parks, the civil parish of Comber and the historic barony of Castlereagh Lower. Comber is part of the Ards and North Down Borough. It is also known for Comber Whiskey which was last distilled in 1953. A notable native was Thomas Andrews, the designer of the and was among the many who went down with her. Comber had a population of 9,071 people in the 2011 Census.

== History ==
The confluence of two rivers, which gave the town its name, is that of the Glen River and the Enler River which meet here.
During the influx of Scots in the early 1600s (see Plantation of Ulster), a settlement grew up at Comber, although it was focused about further south than at present, in the townland of Cattogs, and there is evidence that the settlement was a port used by traders and fishermen. By the 1700s, however, the focus of the town had moved to the area of the present main Square and Comber became established as an industrial centre with several mills.

The Andrews family made Comber a centre of both linen production and grain processing by the second half of the 1700s. Whiskey distilling was a prominent industry by the mid-1800s, the most prominent of the distillers being John Miller, uncle of William James (Lord) Pirrie and Eliza (wife of Thomas Andrews Snr.). One member of the Andrews family, Thomas Andrews, was the designer of the and lost his life when the ship sank in 1912. By 1841 the town had 1,400 inhabitants. The 20th century saw Comber lose much of its industry but re-establish itself as a commuter town for the Belfast urban area, swelling in population from 4,000 in 1961 to 8,933 according to the 2001 census.
In Comber&#x27;s square stands the statue of Major General Rollo Gillespie. Gillespie was a local war hero from the 19th century, famous for his heroic exploits in India. It was constructed under the oversight of John Fraser, the first county surveyor of Down, and was unveiled on 24 June 1845 (St. John&#x27;s Day). Fifty lodges of the Masonic Order were present, in what is believed to be the biggest Masonic gathering in Irish history. It was calculated that 25,000 to 30,000 people crowded into the town to witness the ceremony. The column is 55 feet high. At the foot of the column are many Masonic symbols and his famous last words &quot;One shot more for the honour of Down&quot;. The Square also has a memorial to those who died on the Titanic, which has strong links to the town. The town has its own &quot;Comber Titanic Audio Trail which guides you to special places of interest throughout Comber that relate to the Titanic story.&quot;

In 1978, the Provisional Irish Republican Army bombed La Mon restaurant, killing 12 people.

The Enler River in Comber has flooded many times. As a result, the Comber flood wall was built along the river through the town which has held the water back since.

== The town ==
Comber grew as a market town with many family-run and independent businesses, throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.
The town still remains home to a number of independent and artisan stores. The town holds a farmers market on the first Thursday of every month. The market sells fresh, seasonal food and plant products.

After achieving EU Protected Geographical Indication status in 2012, the Comber potato (Comber Earlies) became a global brand. The potatoes are now celebrated annually at the Comber Earlies Food Festival in June, together with the Comber Earlies Growers.

The town has also benefitted from a £2.4 million public realm scheme. The scheme encompassing High Street, The Square, Bridge Street, Bridge Street Link, Killinchy Street and Castle Street has reinvigorated Comber, creating a unique and uniform identity for the town centre. The design concepts were developed in partnership with Ards Borough Council, and, community and business representatives. Making the announcement, Minister McCausland said: &quot;This represents a significant investment by the Northern Ireland Executive and Ards Borough Council. The scheme has been designed to bring the maximum benefit to all of Comber&#x27;s residents and to make the town centre much more attractive to visitors. This scheme is a fundamental part of the strategy &#x27;Envisaging the future of Comber&#x27;.
&quot;I know from the success of public realm schemes in other towns, that this investment will make a significant contribution to improving the fortunes of the town centre. This funding demonstrates my ongoing commitment to the regeneration of Comber.&quot;
Mayor of Ards, Councillor Stephen McIlveen, welcomed the confirmation of funding. He said: &quot;This investment by DSD and the Council will transform the visual appearance of the town centres, enhancing their appeal as places to visit and shop, with the associated positive economic impact. I look forward now to seeing the designs developed and finalised and to work beginning.&quot;

Like the rest of Ireland, the Comber area has long been divided into townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. Over time, more rural townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates. The following is a list of townlands within Comber&#x27;s urban area, alongside their likely etymologies:

*Ballyaltikilligan (from &quot;Baile Ailt Uí Ghiollagáin&quot; meaning &quot;townland of O&#x27;Gilligan&#x27;s glen&quot; or &quot;Baile Ailt Cille Aodháin&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the glen of Aodan&#x27;s church&quot;)
*Ballyhenry Minor (from &quot;Baile Héinrí&quot; or &quot;Baile Éinrí&quot; meaning &quot;Henry&#x27;s townland&quot;)
*Ballymagaughey (from &quot;Baile Mhig Eacháin&quot; meaning &quot;MacGaughey&#x27;s townland&quot;)
*Carnasure or Carnesure (from &quot;Ceathrú na Siúr&quot; meaning &quot;quarterland of the sisters&quot;)
*Glass Moss formerly Ballynaganemye (from &quot;Baile na Gainimhe&quot; meaning &quot;townland of the sand&quot;)

The Comber Greenway is a traffic-free section of the National Cycle Network, along the old Belfast-Comber railway line. The cycle path starts on Dee Street in Belfast and finishes at Comber. Now completed the Greenway provides an eco-friendly cycle path with views of Stormont and Scrabo Tower. This attracts many cyclists into the town boosting the local economy.
The current route of the Greenway was originally used as the route for the Belfast and County Down Railway. The railway was in use from the 1850s to 1950 when it was permanently retired. Throughout the 1950s the track was lifted in stages and infrastructure, including bridges, removed. Local activists and politicians have proposed plans to extend the Greenway into the town centre directly which they say would benefit the local businesses even more.

Castle Espie is a wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) on the banks of Strangford Lough, south of Comber, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is part of the Strangford Lough Ramsar Site. It provides an early wintering site for almost the entire Nearctic population of Pale-bellied Brent Geese. The Castle which gave the reserve its name no longer exists. Castle Espie was officially opened as a Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust centre by Lady Scott on 4 May 1990. The site had previously been a limestone quarry, and also had a brickworks, pottery and lime kilns for producing lime from limestone, as well as part of a farm.

In September 2007, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of £2.96 million towards a major wetland restoration project at Castle Espie, the largest investment in biodiversity in Northern Ireland. At the heart of the project, costing £4m in all, will be the restoration and improvement of intertidal and freshwater habitats along the shores of Strangford Lough to encourage more species and greater numbers of waterbirds to feed, roost or breed at Castle Espie, as well as restoring important habitats. A new ecologically sustainable visitor centre would also be constructed, and other improvements would be carried out to hides and observatories.

==Transport==
Comber railway station on the Belfast and County Down Railway, opened on 6 May 1850, but finally closed on 24 April 1950. Comber also has a good public transport network with buses travelling to Belfast and Newtownards everyday on a frequent basis.

In 2003 &#x27;phase two&#x27; of the Comber bypass was officially opened for traffic. This new section starts at the end of the dual carriage way from Newtownards and links up with the existing section via a roundabout on Killinchy street. 
Comber is also connected by a direct cycle route to Belfast. Known as the Comber Greenway, this traffic free cycle path runs for along the old railway track bed.

==Education==
One of the three local primary schools is Comber Primary School. There are 15 teachers at the school. Notable alumni include Northern Ireland footballer Stephen Craigan.

The other local primary school is Andrews Memorial Primary School, operating under the headmaster, Ralph Magee, which is of a similar size and as part of the school buildings includes the Andrews Memorial Hall, which was built by the citizens of Comber in memory of Thomas Andrews, the shipbuilder of the .

The third primary school is St. Mary&#x27;s Primary School, which is much smaller in size.

Many pupils from these schools go to Nendrum College, Comber, next door to Comber Primary, and Regent House Grammar School, Newtownards.

The Ballydrain Harrier and Athletic Club was founded in 1932 and originally trained from The Old Schoolhouse, Ballydrain. For many years it was one of the most successful clubs in Northern Ireland, but went into decline, and by 2010 had only a few members left. A move to training at the North Down Cricket Club brought about a resurgence in membership, continuing to grow quickly with members training and racing weekly.

===Motorsport=== 

The Ards Circuit through Comber was a motorsport street circuit used for RAC Tourist Trophy sports car races from 1928 until 1936. At the time it was Northern Ireland&#x27;s premier sporting event, regularly attracting crowds in excess of a quarter of a million people. 
===Football===
One of Comber&#x27;s finest sporting moments came on Christmas morning 1991 when local amateur football team Comber Rec., managed by Mervyn Boyce, overcame favourites Brantwood to lift the Steel and Sons Cup for the first time.

<doc id="443335" wikidata="Q2533408" url="?curid=443335" title="Irvinestown">
<text>Irvinestown is a town in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. At the 2021 census it had a population of 2,325 people. The most notable buildings are Necarne Castle, formerly known as Castle Irvine, and Castle Archdale. Irvinestown is situated within Fermanagh and Omagh district.

==History==
Before the Plantation of Ulster, the area was known as Necarne or Nakerny; in Irish &quot;Na Caorthann&quot; (the rowans). The village was founded during the Plantation in 1618 by Sir Gerald Lowther and named Lowtherstown. Ownership later passed to the Irvines of Dumfries and the name changed accordingly.

==Places of interest==

* The village boasts the annual Lady of The Lake Festival, a large 10-day summer festival and carnival which begins on the first Friday following 12 July.
* Nearby is Necarne Castle, formerly known as Castle Irvine, which is now an equestrian school – Necarne Castle Equestrian School.
* The nearby Castle Archdale Country Park on the shores of Lower Lough Erne was used as an RAF base for Sunderland flying boats in WWII, with Catalina flying boats at RAF Killadeas, and today provides lakeshore &amp; woodland walking/cycling paths, gardens, caravan park, campsite, tea rooms and boating marina. Other features within the park include a red deer enclosure, wildfowl ponds, nature trail, butterfly garden and wildflower meadow.

==Transport==
Irvinestown railway station on the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway was opened on 13 June 1866 and closed on 1 October 1957.
Ulsterbus routes 194 (Enniskillen to Pettigo), 83 (Irvinestown to Omagh) and 94A (Enniskillen to Omagh) stop in Irvinestown.

===Annual truck festival===
The Irvinestown Truck Festival was launched in 2000 and celebrated 10 years in 2010. This is a drive around the Fermanagh lakes where the spectacle of trucks raises funds for Marie Curie Cancer Care. The 2010 event took place on the weekend of 23–25 July; the convoy taking place on the 25th. As many as 700 lorries have taken part in this event in the past (unofficially breaking the world record by quite a margin).

==People==
*Sinéad Quinn, a singer/songwriter who came second in the first series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, and has since recorded an album entitled &quot;Ready To Run&quot;.

* Andrew Graham, Northern Irish astronomer, orbit computer, and discoverer of the asteroid 9 Metis.

==Sport==
The village also has a number of sporting organisations such as Irvinestown Wanderers Football Club, St. Molaise&#x27;s GAA, Irvinestown Tennis Club and more. The Bawnacre leisure centre provides many sporting facilities including squash courts, tennis courts, indoor &amp; outdoor football, indoor gymnasium and sauna / steam room. The area is a rich haven of sport and recreation, a fact recognised when the long-serving manager George Beacom was appointed an O.B.E. for services to sport in the local community.

===GAA football===
St. Molaise&#x27;s GAA Gaelic football team can trace its roots to 1918 when the team was represented at the county convention of that year by C. Browne, P. Rafferty and J. Maguire. Previously hurling was played with teams fielded by Tummery and Glassmullagh.

As the national spirit of the time penetrated local areas, Irvinestown gaels wanted to express their nationality by playing Gaelic Football. The first recorded match was played at a sports day on 15 August against Fintona Pearses at Loughterash, Kilskeery and Fintona won by a 0–5 to 0–3 scoreline. The game was played in Kilskeery because of a ban on G.A.A. activities at the time meant that St. Molaise&#x27;s home pitch, a field belonging to John Maguire at Drumharvey, was under the watchful eye of three hundred soldiers and R.I.C. who had cycled into the village from early morning suitably equipped for any ensuing trouble.

The troubles of the 1920s disrupted the playing of league games and it was not until 1924 that Tommy Maguire, Jimmy Thompson and Father Lappin made efforts to get the game going again. A hall committee was set up to organise building a hall as a focal point for meetings, fund raising, etc. and St.Molaise Hall was officially opened on 13 September 1925.

In 1924 the old football field at Drumharvey was no longer available so the club moved to a field on the Dromore Road for which they paid £10 a year rent. The cost of admission was 6d but nobody wanted to pay and spectators were content to stand on the road to view the game. Not to be out done the club made a large screen of meal bags sewn together forcing the spectators to come inside. St Molaise Park was officially opened on 11 May 1947. Eighteen months previously a group of men had travelled to see a game in Clones and were impressed with their new field and decided that Irvinestown should have one similar. They selected a site in Bridge Street costing £500 and after tender awarded the contract of preparing the field and surround to J.J. Scallon and Sons. Special trains and buses from all over the North ran into Irvinestown, for the opening which was performed by Mr Daniel O&#x27;Rourke T.D., President of the G.A.A. Tummery and Coa pipe bands were there to entertain the 10,000 crowd. The opening match was Lisnaskea &quot;vs.&quot; West Ulster selection, refereed by Johnny Monaghan, Ederney, followed by Roscommon (All-Ireland finalists 1946) and Antrim (All-Ireland semi finalists 1946) refereed by Jim Vallely, Armagh.

<text>The Iron Mountains are a subrange of the Blue Ridge Mountains. These mountains are located around the common meeting point of Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina.

A portion of the Appalachian Trail runs the crest of the Iron Mountains above Watauga Lake and the Watauga River near Elizabethton, Tennessee, and then runs northeasterly by Shady Valley, Tennessee, finally ascending Holston Mountain and into Virginia. In addition, the historic Virginia Creeper Trail traverses the Iron Mountains between Damascus and Whitetop, Virginia.

<doc id="443338" wikidata="Q880876" url="?curid=443338" title="William Bigler">
<text>William Bigler (January 1, 1814August 9, 1880) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Democrat as the 12th governor of Pennsylvania from 1852 to 1855 and as a member of the United States Senate for Pennsylvania from 1856 to 1861. His older brother, John Bigler, was elected governor of California during the same period. As of 2023, he is the last Democratic incumbent to lose reelection as Governor of Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Bigler was born in Sherman Valley, Pennsylvania, to Jacob and Susan Dock Bigler. He attended public schools and worked as a printer&#x27;s apprentice, a journalist and as a member of the staff of the &quot;Centre County Democrat&quot; newspaper under his elder brother John Bigler who later became the governor of California.

==Career==
In 1833, at the urging of his friends, including future Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin, Bigler founded his own political newspaper, the &quot;Clearfield Democrat&quot; which supported Jacksonian democracy. In 1836, he married Maria Jane Reed and together they had five children. He sold the newspaper and joined his father-in-law&#x27;s lumber business as co-partner. Between 1845 and 1850, his lumber business became the largest producer of building supplies on the West branch of the Susquehanna River, earning him the nickname &quot;The Clearfield Raftsman&quot;.

He served as a Jackson Democrat member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 20th district from 1841 to 1846, including as Speaker from 1845 to 1846. He played a key role in the abolition of imprisonment for debt in Pennsylvania and the development of two insane asylums in Philadelphia and Harrisburg. He was a proponent of a central railroad from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh as competition to the B&amp;O Railroad. His efforts resulted in a cross-state line in 1847 which was eventually sold and became the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1849, he served as Pennsylvania revenue commissioner.

He was elected the 12th Governor of Pennsylvania in 1851, defeating incumbent governor William F. Johnston. He and his brother John were the first brothers to serve as governors of two states simultaneously. He fought vigorously against wildcat banking and vetoed multiple bank charters and bank bills in his time as governor. He lost popularity through his support of the Walker Tariff, the right of southern states to retain slavery, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and his enforcement of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.

In 1855, he was defeated for re-election in a landslide by James Pollock, the candidate of the newly formed Republican Party.

After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, he became president of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. He was elected to the United States Senate for Pennsylvania in 1856 (the legislature having failed to elect anyone in 1855), and served until 1861.

As a senator, he supported pro-slavery measures to appease the South. He visited Kansas Territory in 1857, and thereafter advocated Kansas statehood under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention and opposed the nomination of Stephen A. Douglas.

During the secession crisis in 1861, he supported the compromise proposed by Kentucky Senator John J. Crittenden as a last ditch effort to avoid secession.

He remained active in Pennsylvania politics and served as a delegate to the Pennsylvania constitutional convention in 1873 and as a key organizer of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.

He died on August 9, 1880, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, and was interred in Hillcrest Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Biglerville, Pennsylvania, in Adams County, Pennsylvania, is named after him. Bigler Hall on the University Park campus of Penn State is named after Bigler, as are Bigler Street in Philadelphia, Bigler Township in Clearfield County, and Bigler Avenues in both Clearfield and Northern Cambria, Pennsylvania.

<text>Portchester Castle is a medieval fortress that was developed within the walls of the Roman Saxon Shore fort of Portus Adurni at Portchester, to the east of Fareham in Hampshire.

The keep was probably built in the late 11th century as a baronial castle and Portchester was taken under royal control in 1154. The monarchy controlled the castle for several centuries and it was a favoured hunting lodge of King John. It was besieged and captured by the French in 1216 before permanently returning to English control shortly thereafter.

Occupying a commanding position at the head of Portsmouth Harbour, in the medieval period Portchester was an important port. The castle saw the embarkation for several campaigns to France led by England&#x27;s kings. In anticipation of a French invasion during the first quarter of the 14th century, Edward II spent £1,100 repairing and reinforcing Portchester Castle. A plot to overthrow Henry V was discovered and the culprits apprehended at Portchester; this event features in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Henry V&quot;. Later in its history, the castle was used as a prison.

Today Portchester Castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a Grade I listed building. The castle has been in the ownership of the Southwick Estate since the 17th century but is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors throughout the year. The Norman church, St. Mary&#x27;s, which stands in the south-east corner of the grounds, falls within the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth.

==Background==
The strategic importance of Portchester has been recognised since at least the 3rd century when a Roman fort was established on the site. Though it is uncertain exactly when the fort was constructed, it is thought that it was built by Marcus Aurelius Carausius on the instructions of emperor Diocletian between 285 and 290. It was one of several forts built along the British coast in the period to combat raids by pirates. Portchester was probably a base from which the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, the Roman fleet defending Britain, operated. It is the best preserved Roman fort north of the Alps.

Although the Roman army retreated from Britain in the early 5th century, it is unlikely that the fort was ever completely abandoned, although its use continued on a much smaller scale. A 10th-century hall and tower were discovered within the fort, suggesting it was a high-status residence during the Saxon period. In 904, Portchester came into the possession of King Edward the Elder and the fort became a burh to help defend the country against Vikings, as listed in the Burghal Hidage.

==Medieval castle and palace==

It is uncertain when the castle was built, although it was probably in the late 11th century. In the aftermath of the Norman Conquest, the manor of Portchester was granted to William Maudit, an associate of William the Conqueror and a powerful magnate and it was probably he who built Portchester Castle.

The form of this early castle is uncertain, although Maudit was probably responsible for creating the inner ward in the north-west corner of the fort. At this point it would probably have been defended by a wooden palisade and a moat, with the original Roman stone walls of the fort acting as the defence of the outer bailey. Maudit died in about 1100, and his property passed onto his son, Robert Maudit. He died in 1120, and a few years later the family estates came into the hands of William Pont de l&#x27;Arche through marriage to Robert Maudit&#x27;s daughter.

Although the castle was still unrecorded in this period, it was probably at this point that it was rebuilt in stone. The evidence for this is that the stonework of the castle is similar to that of St Mary&#x27;s parish church, which was built in the 1130s in the outer bailey. The church was built for an Augustinian priory which Pont de l&#x27;Arche established within the castle in 1128. Other buildings would have been planned for the priory, although almost no trace of them survives. As the community moved to a new site at Southwick between 1147 and 1150, the buildings may never have been completed.

William Pont de l&#x27;Arche probably retained possession of Portchester Castle until his death in 1148, although who inherited it is uncertain. It may have passed to William Maudit, a descendant of the Maudit who most likely founded the castle, or Henry Maudit, William de l&#x27;Arche&#x27;s son. The earliest extant reference to the castle is in a grant from 1153 in which Henry Plantagenet, later King Henry II granted the castle to Henry Maudit. Regardless, when Henry ascended to the throne in 1154 he took over possession of Portchester Castle. It would remain in royal control for several centuries. More records survive from the castle&#x27;s period as a royal fortress than the previous period; the royal accounts provide details of the castle&#x27;s condition and structure. For instance, as only small sums were spent on the keep during the royal tenure, it is assumed that it was largely complete, and in 1183 the Rolls record that there were royal apartments separate from the keep. Henry II regularly visited Portchester, and it featured in his dispute with Thomas Becket.

It was here that Henry met with the Bishop of Évreux who spoke on Becket&#x27;s behalf. The castle was also used as a prison for important people, such as the Earl of Leicester. When Henry II&#x27;s sons rebelled against him with the support of some leading barons in the Revolt of 1173–1174, Portchester was made ready for war. In preparation to defend the castle, catapults were made and it was garrisoned with ten knights, later increased to 20.
King John often stayed at Portchester Castle and was there when he heard of the Loss of Normandy in 1204. The Forest of Bere was nearby, making Portchester a popular place for the king to stay recreationally. Portchester was also the departure point of missions to France in 1205 and 1213 as John tried to recover Normandy from Philip Augustus, the King of France. John&#x27;s trips to France ended in defeat.

After sealing Magna Carta in 1215, John appealed to the pope to annul it. As a result, his opponents were excommunicated in September. At this point, he laid siege to Rochester Castle and the rebels turned to France for help. The barons offered the throne to Prince Louis, the oldest son of the French king. Louis&#x27; campaign was initially successful and he captured London and Winchester before Portchester Castle surrendered to his forces in June 1216. John died on 19 October 1216, and nine days later his eldest son was crowned King Henry. Louis&#x27; fortunes took a turn for the worse, and Portchester Castle was recaptured in the spring of 1217.

There was a stalemate between Henry III and Louis until the English victory at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May. After his supply lines with France were cut in August, Louis was bribed to leave England. Henry tried to recapture Normandy, which was lost by his predecessor, until conditions in England forced him to abandon them in 1259, and Portchester was a frequent departure point for troops on campaign.

For most of the century little attention was paid to the castle&#x27;s defences, however towards the end of the century a wooden tower was built to reinforce the eastern Roman wall. During the reign of Edward II (1307–1327), a French invasion was anticipated and Portchester garrisoned. The Crown spent more than £1,100 repairing and reinforcing Portchester Castle between 1320 and 1326. The buildings of the inner ward were remodelled and the outer gatehouses extended.

Despite the expensive work undertaken by Edward II, a survey of 1335 recorded that many of the castle&#x27;s buildings were in a ruinous state, and the south wall of the Roman fort had been damaged by the sea. Although he infrequently stayed at Portchester, in June 1346 Edward III assembled his 15,000 strong army there before leaving for France on the campaign that ended in victory at the Battle of Crécy.

Further work was carried out in the 1350s and 1360s when the domestic buildings within the castle were reordered and the sea wall repaired. Between 1396 and 1399 the royal apartments that stand today, albeit in a ruined state, were built for Richard II under master mason Walter Walton.
In 1415, King Henry V was making preparations at Portchester Castle for a campaign in France, part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between the two countries. While at Portchester in July a conspiracy, known as the Southampton Plot, to overthrow Henry was uncovered.

It was at the castle that he arrested the conspirators: Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey. The three men were executed in early August.

In the 15th century the nearby town of Portsmouth some away grew to become a significant economic centre and an important port. It took over from Portchester as a place of military importance, and the castle entered a period of decline. A survey from 1441 noted the castle was &quot;right ruinous and feeble&quot;. Despite its state, when Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI, landed in England in 1445, Portchester Castle was selected as her port of arrival. The castle was allowed to continue to languish until the last decade of the century attempts were made to repair the castle&#x27;s buildings. When Henry VIII visited with Queen Anne Boleyn in 1535 October, it was the first time in over a century that the reigning monarch had been to the castle.
Between October 1562 and June 1563, the English occupied the port of Le Havre on France&#x27;s northern coast. During this period the castle acted as a military hospital for those involved in the conflict with France. With relations with Spain worsening, Elizabeth I made Portchester Castle ready for war, anticipating a Spanish invasion. At that time Henry Radcliffe future Earl of Sussex, was Constable.

On 30 August 1591 Elizabeth came to the castle, but the floors of the state chambers were rotten, and she had dinner in the bedchamber of the keeper. Instead of her usual sweet perfumes the chamber was freshened with rue and hyssop. By 1603 the castle was in a fit state for Elizabeth to hold court there. Sir Thomas Cornwallis was made constable and remodelled the buildings along the eastern side of the inner bailey. A royal survey from 1609 documents the castle&#x27;s improved condition, noting that the buildings built by Cornwallis contained &quot;four fair lodging chambers above and as many rooms for office below&quot;.

==Use as a prison==

The castle passed out of royal control in 1632 when Charles I sold it to Sir William Uvedale. Since then, Portchester Castle has passed through his successors, the Thistlethwaite family. The castle did not witness fighting during the English Civil War, though for a short time in 1644 it was garrisoned by Parliamentarian dragoons.

One of the roles castles commonly filled was that of a prison. From the late 17th century onwards this became Portchester&#x27;s most important function. In 1665, 500 prisoners from the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667) were held at the castle. Some were housed in the church in the outer bailey. They damaged the building by setting it on fire. The church was not repaired until some 40 years later. Between 1702 and 1712 the Crown leased Portchester Castle from the Uvedales to incarcerate prisoners from the War of the Spanish Succession. The first detailed accounts of the prisoners&#x27; conditions come from the middle of the century.
It was last used in the 19th century as a gaol for over 7,000 French prisoners of the Napoleonic Wars. Hospital Lane (formerly Seagates Lane), which flanks the western side of the castle, was the location of the prison hospital which survives today as Portchester House, a private residence. Those that died in captivity were often buried in what are now tidal mudflats to the south of the castle, their remains occasionally disturbed by storms.

==Today==
Today Portchester Castle is open to visitors and is also used for recreation: the inner section of the castle accommodates displays and exhibits. The castle is a popular venue for school outings, while the sea wall is frequented at high tide by anglers in pursuit of flounder and bass. The castle buildings are in the care of English Heritage.

==Local legends==
Local legend states that late in his life Pontius Pilate was brought here by galley as a final refuge.

<doc id="443342" wikidata="Q2110870" url="?curid=443342" title="Darius Gaiden">
<text>is a 1994 horizontal-scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Taito. The fifth entry in its &quot;Darius&quot; series, players control a starship named the Silver Hawk in its mission to destroy the Belsar empire before it wipes out the population of planet Darius. &quot;Gaiden&quot; adds several new features to the core concepts of its predecessors, including screen-clearing black hole bombs and the ability to capture mid-level bosses. The game has been ported to several consoles, including the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

Created by producer Hidehiro Fujiwara, &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was designed to show off the technological capabilities of Taito&#x27;s then-new F3 System, an arcade board that utilized interchangeable cartridges. Though he had little exposure to the series, Fujiwara wanted to design a new &quot;Darius&quot; game that improved on its established concepts. The development team worked to retain many of the franchise&#x27;s core elements while also focusing on creating a new and engaging experience. Originally titled &quot;Darius III&quot;, its name was changed to &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; as its plot took place between the first two games; gaiden is the Japanese term for &quot;side story&quot;.

&quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was critically acclaimed in arcades, and received several awards. The home console conversions were also well received, with critics applauding its gameplay, attractive visuals, and responsive controls. Some felt its music was bizarre and unfitting, while some enjoyed its outlandish nature. Retrospectively, it has been ranked among the greatest side-scrolling shooters of all time. It was followed by &quot;G-Darius&quot; in 1997.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; is a horizontal-scrolling shooter video game. The player controls a starship named the Silver Hawk in its mission to obliterate the Belsar empire, which is plotting to destroy what is left of the human race and their new home of planet Darius. A second player can join in at any time. The game uses a non-linear level progression system where players can select whichever level they choose after completing the previous one. There are twenty-seven stages total, with the player only being able to play seven of them at a time. In these levels, the Silver Hawk must destroy constantly moving formations of enemies while avoiding their projectiles, as well as dodging obstacles. Enemies are made to resemble fish, crabs, seahorses, and other aquatic creatures. Levels conclude with a boss that must be defeated by destroying its weak spot, such as its head or mouth.

The Silver Hawk begins the game with a forward-moving shot. Collecting colored emblems dropped by correspondingly colored enemies allows the player to power-up the Silver Hawk&#x27;s abilities. Green emblems grant the player missiles, red emblems increase the length and power of shots, and blue emblems give the player a protective shield. Collecting additional emblems upgrades the player&#x27;s weapons, such as a stronger shield or missiles that move forwards and backwards. The Silver Hawk also begins the game with three black hole bombs. Firing them creates a large swirling vortex that sucks in all enemies and projectiles, followed by lightning strikes that inflict massive damage on enemies. The Silver Hawk also has the ability to capture minibosses, which appear in the middle of most levels. This is accomplished by destroying the energy orb on its head and collecting it when it flies off. Captured minibosses ally with the player and fire their own weapons at enemies for a brief period of time, before they self-destruct.

==Development==
&quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was published by Taito as the third arcade installment in its &quot;Darius&quot; series, and the fifth entry overall. Its development was headed by producer Hidehiro Fujiwara, who was alongside designer and artist Hirokazu Kato, and programmer Akira Kurabayashi. Fujiwara had little exposure to the series aside from assisting in production of the original &quot;Darius&quot;. Nonetheless, he was a fan of the first game, and was ready to work on a sequel that could improve on concepts established by its predecessors. When Fujiawara was conceiving the idea for &quot;Gaiden&quot;, Taito released its F3 System, an arcade system board that allowed arcade operators to swap out games through interchangeable ROM cartridges, similar to the Neo Geo. Taito wanted big-name franchises to appear on its new board to increase awareness and attract attention, so Fujiwara proposed the idea of a &quot;Darius&quot; game as the series was well known in Japan. Taito approved the request and allowed development of &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; to begin.

The original &quot;Darius&quot; and its sequel &quot;Darius II&quot; both used three individual monitors made to appear seamless via mirror effects. Kato insisted that &quot;Gaiden&quot; scrap this concept and use a single-screen display, as he felt the concept had grown old by that point. During production, the development team focused on making the game fun to play and unlike any other shooter before it to make it stand out. Fujiwara and the others also wanted the game to show off the technical capabilities of the F3 System, such as its sprite rotation and 3D effects. The game was originally titled &quot;Darius III&quot;, which was used in overseas marketing material. Due to the story taking place between &quot;Darius II&quot; and the first &quot;Darius&quot;, Kato decided to name the game &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot;, with &quot;gaiden&quot; being a Japanese term for &quot;side story&quot;.

Though the team worked to make &quot;Gaiden&quot; feel fresh and new, they also focused on implementing many of the franchise&#x27;s core concepts to make it feel like a proper sequel. Returning ideas include a similar stage structure, formidable opponents such as King Fossil and Vermilion Coronatus, and a proper storyline. The game&#x27;s presentation was also a focal point; the programmers worked to add a number of flashy effects that showed off the F3 System&#x27;s technological capabilities, though this also complicated the process of making sprites. Some characters, including the first stage boss Golden Ogre, were 3D models pre-rendered as 2D sprites. The midboss capture mechanic, a concept borrowed from an older Taito game, was thought to have made the game more complicated or unbalanced and was almost excluded from the final version.

===Music===

The soundtrack for &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was composed by Zuntata, the house band of Taito. The band&#x27;s leader, Hisayoshi Ogura, was the director of the music. Ogura based its music on Jungian archetypes, presenting them in an operatic fashion. He describes the music for the first level, &quot;Visionnerz&quot;, as being &quot;the collapse of the ego given musical form&quot;. It uses lyrics pulled from other sources, which are based on the idea of &quot;truth isn&#x27;t what lies in front of you&quot;. Ogura intended the music to represent the game&#x27;s dream-like stages and atmosphere. In an interview, he said: &quot;If you were looking at something and it changed in front of your eyes, and you suddenly realized that everything you thought was an indisputable truth a second ago wasn&#x27;t true at all, that would be a considerable shock to you. People in such situations would be unable to maintain their composure. They&#x27;d start to break down mentally. That&#x27;s the kind of concept I wanted to convey through &quot;Visionnerz&quot; and the music of &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot;&quot;. The band&#x27;s sound engineer, Katsuhisa Ishikawa, designed the game&#x27;s sound effects.

The entire soundtrack was completed in order, with &quot;Visionnerz&quot; being the source of inspiration for most of the music. Unlike Taito&#x27;s other game soundtracks, the one for &quot;Gaiden&quot; is synchronized to the gameplay and sound effects, which was possible through constant communication between programmers and sound designers. For the final stages, the music was made to change in tone when the boss shows up, creating an intense and ominous atmosphere. Ogura has claimed that &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; is his favorite soundtrack in terms of direction.

==Release==
&quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was released in Japan in September 1994, and in North America in November. In promotional material, Taito advertised the game&#x27;s new mechanics and more serious tone in promotional flyers. In the months after its debut, an updated version named &quot;Darius Gaiden Extra Edition&quot; was released. &quot;Extra Edition&quot; changes the level progression system slightly by swapping out easier levels with those that are much harder. It also provides minor alterations to the gameplay, such as increasing the rate of fire and removing the cap on the number of black hole bombs that can be carried. &quot;Extra Edition&quot; also has a gameplay mode that converts the branching stage paths into one long, singular run through every level.

The game has been ported to several consoles. It was first released on the Sega Saturn on December 15, 1995, in Japan. This version was released a year later in North America, where it was published by Acclaim Entertainment as part of its publishing deal with Taito. The Saturn version is a near-perfect port, with slight alterations to the soundtrack to accommodate for system limitations. A PlayStation version was released exclusively in Japan on December 13, 1996, which adds a new opening cutscene with 3D pre-rendered models. This version was developed by BEC, a subsidiary of Bandai. &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; was released for Windows in 1997, which was subsequently re-released in North America in 2004. The 2005 PlayStation 2 and Xbox compilation &quot;Taito Legends 2&quot; includes &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; and 43 other Taito-published arcade games. &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; is also included in &quot;Darius Cozmic Collection&quot;, released in 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.

==Reception==

Upon its debut in arcades, &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; received critical acclaim, and was a commercial success. The Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; handed the game several awards, including the 2nd &quot;Best Graphic&quot;, 3rd &quot;Best Shooting&quot;, and 7th &quot;Grand Prize&quot; awards. Readers also voted it as being the fourth best arcade game of the year. &quot;Gamest&quot; commended Taito for not focusing on gimmicks like the panoramic screen, but instead on the gameplay by making it fresh and interesting. Staff praised the mechanics, soundtrack, graphical style, and overall presentation.

Home releases of &quot;Darius Gaiden&quot;, specifically the Sega Saturn version, also received positive reviews. The Saturn version sold over 70,000 copies in Japan alone. &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded it the &quot;Gold Hall of Fame&quot; award, the magazine&#x27;s second highest award for a game. Publications specifically focused on the gameplay and graphical style. The four reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; were impressed by the visuals for their 3D effect and detail, as were &quot;Famitsu&quot; staff and &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Air Hendrix. Staff at &quot;GameFan&quot; compared its quality to SNK&#x27;s &quot;Pulstar&quot;. Rad Automatic of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised &quot;Gaiden&quot; for its graphics and action-packed gameplay, specifically the level of challenge and usage of branching level paths.

Critics felt indifferent about the soundtrack, some of whom liked its strangeness while others found it to be unfitting. The music was Automatic&#x27;s sole complaint with the game, describing it as being &quot;some fat bint warbling away like an Old Spice advert&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; disagreed, claiming that the music gave the game some charm. &quot;GameFan&quot; said that Zuntata&#x27;s compositions were surprisingly good and fit its atmosphere. Critics were also mixed towards the difficulty. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated that it was their only gripe towards &quot;Gaiden&quot;, feeling it was too high and made the game unnecessarily difficult to play. Automatic thought otherwise, saying that the difficulty was just right. &quot;GameFan&quot; staff argued that the Sega Saturn version was better than its arcade counterpart for its lack of slowdown and impressive graphical effects. &quot;Famitsu&quot; was less enthusiastic about the PlayStation conversion due to its slowdown problems, jerky scrolling, and unimpressive opening cutscenes. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; Daniel Erickson, who reviewed the Windows version argued that the game wasn&#x27;t as impressive as it used to be, but that the gameplay and responsive controls made it a worthy pickup for fans of the genre.

===Retrospective feedback===
&quot;Darius Gaiden&quot; has been listed as being among the greatest side-scrolling shooters of all time. In 2014, &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Rupert Higham stated that &quot;Gaiden&quot; is &quot;one of the most confident and accomplished sprite-based games ever imagined&quot;. He said that the game represented Taito&#x27;s talent at designing unique stages that were fun to traverse through, and commented on the game&#x27;s colorful, detailed visuals. Higham believes that &quot;Gaiden&quot; helped take the &quot;Darius&quot; franchise into a different direction, away from its focus on gimmicks such as the three-screen design and towards innovation and presentation. Higham also believes that Zuntata&#x27;s soundtrack was one of the game&#x27;s best and most memorable features. In 2016, Kurt Kalata of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; said that the game allowed the series to &quot;[grow] its figurative beard&quot; and become one of the most-respected shooter franchises. He praised the game for its visuals and level design; he especially praised the game&#x27;s presentation for being one of the best for a shooter, and the &quot;hauntingly beautiful&quot; soundtrack for its strangeness, saying that it &quot;[makes] for a game that is not only a great shoot-em-up, but also one of the finest audiovisual experiences in any 2D arcade game&quot;.

<doc id="443343" wikidata="Q881708" url="?curid=443343" title="Blantyre, South Lanarkshire">
<text>Blantyre ( or ; ) is a town and civil parish in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, with a population of 16,900. It is bounded by the River Clyde to the north, the Rotten Calder to the west, the Park Burn to the east (denoting the boundary with the larger adjoining town of Hamilton) and the Rotten Burn to the south.

Blantyre was the birthplace of David Livingstone, the 19th-century explorer and missionary, and because of Livingstone&#x27;s work, the second-largest city in Malawi is named after it.

==History==

The name has a number of probable origins: originally Cumbric &quot;blaen tir&quot; &quot;top of the land&quot; which has been Gaelicised; an association with Saint Blane, whose associates have a number of local place-names named after them, such as Dalmarnock, and further afield, and personally, Dunblane.

The town consists of a number of small hamlets which have largely become connected into a single urban area, with housing in a variety of styles and ages reflecting the changing use and availability of land over the decades.

&quot;High Blantyre&quot; is the area to the east and south of Burnbrae Road which continues to High Blantyre Cross at the north. It is thought to be the area of earliest settlement, with a Bronze Age village near Auchintibber south of Blantyre Parish Church (High Blantyre). Also in this area is Greenhall Park, where the Calder (Cawther) flows north through a valley to eventually join the Clyde near Newton. A new residential development, Greenhall Village, was built at the western side of High Blantyre in the 2010s. There was previously a large mining community in this area clustered around several pits including Auchinraith and Larkfield which still exist as distinct communities within the town; weaving was another local occupation. A railway station (on the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway) was in use from the 1860s to the 1950s, located to the west of the church. High Blantyre Primary School was established in 1875, continuing through various reconstructions to its current buildings dating from 2005.
At the western end of the main thoroughfare, Glasgow Road (A724) which runs east–west, is the &quot;Priory Bridge&quot; neighbourhood (named after the original bridge over the Calder towards Cambuslang, which itself was named after the now-ruined Blantyre Priory to the north of the town which was home to monks from around 1235). It borders the older and larger &quot;Coatshill&quot; housing estate which has its own schools and community facilities. On the other side of the main road from Coatshill is the similar neighbourhood of &quot;Wheatlands&quot; (parts of which were built by the Scottish Special Housing Association), while further east is the modern centre of the town, built up from the 19th-century mining communities at &quot;Stonefield&quot; and &quot;Low Blantyre&quot; featuring the local secondary school Calderside Academy, Stonefield public park, Blantyre Leisure Centre, several churches and the &quot;Clydeview Shopping Centre&quot; (which has featured a large Asda supermarket since its opening in 1980). Glasgow Road continues south-east via the A725 elevated bypass, the &quot;Springwells&quot; neighbourhood and the town boundary, leading on to Burnbank (specifically the area once known as &quot;Greenfield&quot;).

Further north of the town centre is &quot;The Village&quot;, the oldest industrially developed part of Blantyre which was previously a mill settlement on the River Clyde. Near to the town&#x27;s train station, it is the only part which is north of the railway lines. Next to the David Livingstone Centre, at the end of Station Road, is an iron suspension footbridge which crosses the Clyde giving pedestrian access to Bothwell.

==Mine disaster==

On 22 October 1877, Blantyre was the site of the Blantyre mining disaster, where 207 miners (men and boys) were killed when a coal mine exploded due to methane gas. A monument to the disaster, of which the youngest victim was a boy of 11, is at High Blantyre cross. The site of the mine now lies under the East Kilbride expressway.

==Sport==

===Football===
Blantyre presently has a football club competing in Scottish Junior Football Association competitions, Blantyre Victoria, known as the Vics. They won the Scottish Junior Cup (the highest achievement in junior football) in 1950, 1970 and 1982. Their home ground is called Castle Park.

There is another football club in the town, Blantyre Celtic. The original club went out of existence in the early 1990s; however, in 2010 they reformed as an amateur team.

===Speedway===
The town of Blantyre has long had links with speedway racing. In the pioneer days a group of riders who appeared at White City in Glasgow were known as &quot;The Blantyre Crowd&quot;. They operated their own track at Airbles Road in Motherwell in 1930 and this was known as Paragon Speedway. The Blantyre Crowd also operated a more professional version on the same site in 1932. Speedway was staged at the Blantyre Greyhound Stadium as the home of the Glasgow Tigers from 1977 to 1981, before the new road forced a move to Craighead Park, which closed down at the end of the 1986 season.

===Skateboarding===
Recently, Blantyre Skate Park has received a lot of business as the youth company Radworx has been operating within it as well as some other skate parks. The skate park contains a spine section as well as an halfpipe, alongside a counterpart. There is a mini-bowl and a credible street section which contains two fun boxes as well as a 5-set.

===Redlees Park===
During World War II, an Anti-aircraft battery and associated camp for military personnel known as the &#x27;Whins&#x27; or &#x27;Blantyreferme&#x27; was set up on open land off the Blantyre Farm Road between Newton and Blantyre. The camp was used as emergency accommodation after the conflict, but the huts were later demolished. However, some of the AA battery buildings survived into the 21st century (albeit heavily vandalised in some cases) and were incorporated – along with a former clay quarry nearby – into the landscape of &quot;Redlees Urban Park&quot; developed by the local council.

==Youth==
In August 1983, a pressure group was formed in Blantyre called Blantyre Youth Council, which set up a youth enquiry service for young people and a Claimants Union. The Youth Enquiry Service Base was in the Elizabeth Scott Centre (now Terminal One). In 1984, Strathclyde Regional Council created Blantyre Youth Development Team (BYC agreed to disband and support this provided it was youth-led); the BYDT gained charity status in 1997 and created the &quot;Terminal One&quot; youth centre. It provides many services to the local young people, and is funded by South Lanarkshire Council, the Scottish Arts Council and the Blantyre/North Hamilton Social Inclusion Partnership.

==David Livingstone==

Blantyre&#x27;s most famous son is the 19th-century missionary and explorer David Livingstone. He is acknowledged as the first European to see the &quot;Mosi-oa-Tunya&quot; (Tokaleya and Tonga: &quot;the Smoke that Thunders&quot;) which he named in English Victoria Falls after then British sovereign Queen Victoria.

His birthplace and childhood home is now a museum at the end of Station Road, Low Blantyre on the banks of the River Clyde. The Centre includes a museum dating from 1929 (now run by the National Trust for Scotland), a playpark, a cafe, a shop, an African Garden and several workshop studios. An adventure assault course also existed there before a young man died in 1995. A pedestrian footbridge over the River Clyde adjacent to the museum (its third incarnation) links the area to the town of Bothwell.

Mandala (the largest city and commercial centre of Malawi, one of the territories Livingstone explored) is more commonly named Blantyre in recognition of the link created by Livingstone during the colonial era.

<text>The hymenium is the tissue layer on the hymenophore of a fungal fruiting body where the cells develop into basidia or asci, which produce spores. In some species all of the cells of the hymenium develop into basidia or asci, while in others some cells develop into sterile cells called [[cystidia]] (basidiomycetes) or paraphyses (ascomycetes). Cystidia are often important for microscopic identification. The subhymenium consists of the supportive hyphae from which the cells of the hymenium grow, beneath which is the hymenophoral [[Trama (mycology)|trama]], the hyphae that make up the mass of the hymenophore.

The position of the hymenium is traditionally the first characteristic used in the classification and identification of mushrooms. Below are some examples of the diverse types which exist among the macroscopic Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.

* In agarics, the hymenium is on the vertical faces of the gills.
* In boletes and polypores, it is in a spongy mass of downward-pointing tubes.
* In puffballs, it is internal.
* In stinkhorns, it develops internally and then is exposed in the form of a foul-smelling gel.
* In cup fungi, it is on the concave surface of the cup.
* In teeth fungi, it grows on the outside of tooth-like spines.

<text>Blairgowrie and Rattray () is a twin burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Locals refer to the town as &quot;Blair&quot;. Blairgowrie is the larger of the two former burghs which were united by an Act of Parliament in 1928 and lies on the southwest side of the River Ericht while Rattray is on the northeast side. Rattray claims to be the older and certainly Old Rattray, the area round Rattray Kirk, dates back to the 12th century. New Rattray, the area along the Boat Brae and Balmoral Road dates from 1777 when the River was spanned by the Brig o&#x27; Blair. The town lies on the north side of Strathmore at the foot of the Grampian Mountains. The west boundary is formed by the Knockie, a round grassy hill, and Craighall Gorge on the Ericht. Blairgowrie and Rattray developed over the centuries at the crossroads of several historic routes with links from the town to Perth, Coupar Angus, Alyth and Braemar. The roads to Coupar Angus and Braemar form part of General Wade&#x27;s military road from Perth to Ayrshire then over the tiny bridge to the hill Fort George. The town&#x27;s centrepiece is the Wellmeadow, a grassy triangle in the middle of town which hosts regular markets and outdoor entertainment.

==The name==
The name Blairgowrie means &quot;Plain of Gowrie&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, in which language it is spelt &quot;Blàr Ghobharaidh&quot; or &quot;Blàr Ghobhraidh&quot;. The name Rattray is &quot;Raitear&quot; in Gaelic, and may derive from an English language cognate of Gaelic &quot;ràth&quot; meaning &quot;fortress&quot; plus a Pictish term cognate with Welsh &quot;tref&quot; meaning &quot;settlement&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The area around Blairgowrie has been occupied continuously since the Neolithic, as evidenced from the Cleaven Dyke, a cursus monument south-southwest of the town, as well as a Neolithic long mortuary enclosure west-southwest at Inchtuthil. Several stone circles of this age can also be found in the area, notably the circle bisected by the road at Leys of Marlee, west of Blairgowrie.

Numerous Neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts have been found in the immediate area, including a number of flint arrowheads, spearheads, knives and scrapers found at Carsie, south of Blairgowrie, and which are now displayed at Perth Museum, and bronze axes, and a bronze sword now in Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow.

The remains of a Roman legionary fort can be found west-southwest of Blairgowrie at Inchtuthil, dating from the decade 80-90. Unencumbered by subsequent development, this is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Britain.

Pictish remains are in abundance in this part of Scotland and one of the largest collections of Pictish sculptured stones is housed east of the town at the Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum. The size of the collection, all of which were found in Meigle, suggests this was an ecclesiastical centre of some importance in the 8th to 10th centuries.

===Modern history===
From around 1600 to the beginning of the 19th century, Blairgowrie had a fairly stable population, recorded at 425 inhabitants in the first Statistical Account in 1792. The second Statistical Account of 1853 notes a disproportionate increase due to an influx of families attracted by the expanding textiles industry. Gaelic was declining but still partially spoken in the upper part of the parish at that time, with all speaking English.

Blairgowrie was made a barony in favour of George Drummond of Blair in 1634 by a royal charter of Charles I, and became a free burgh in 1809. In 1724 the military road from Coupar Angus to Fort George which passes through the town on the line of the A923 and A93 was completed.

The town expanded hugely in the 19th century thanks to the employment provided by the many textile mills which were built along the River Ericht, all now closed. By 1870 there were 12 mills along the river employing nearly 2,000 men and women and the population had increased from 400 in the 1700s to 4,000. The disused mill buildings can be seen from the riverside walk west from the bridge and from Haugh Road to the east . Keithbank Mill has been converted to apartments.

Soft fruit growing, mainly raspberries and strawberries developed in the 20th century and became a very important part of the town&#x27;s economy with Smedleys opening a cannery in Haugh Road, Adamsons a jam factory in Croft Lane and huge quantities of table berries and pulp being despatched to markets and jam factories throughout Britain. Berry pickers were brought in by bus from Perth and Dundee, and large encampments were set up on farms for pickers from further afield, mainly from the Glasgow area, who made this their annual holiday. They were joined by the travelling community who congregated here for the berry season. One of the best examples was the Tin City at Essendy, which housed workers in a complex of tin huts with its own chapel, post office, shop, kitchens, etc. The Tin City has gone but now every fruit farm has a caravan site to house the hundreds of Eastern European students who arrive every summer to pick the fruit.

The coming of the railway revolutionised the textile and soft fruit trade. Blairgowrie railway station was the terminus of a branch from Coupar Angus on the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, later part of the Caledonian Railway. The last train ran in the 1960s, and the extensive railway yards are now the site of the Tesco supermarket and Welton Road industrial estate.

Blairgowrie had a busy livestock market at the bottom of the Boat Brae but this closed in the 1960s and is now the site of the Ashgrove Court sheltered housing complex.

Blairgowrie and Rattray Districts Cottage Hospital opened in May 1901, but its foundation can be traced back to 1882 when the idea for such a hospital was put forward by Mrs Clerk-Rattray. On her death she bequeathed £25 which was to be given to such an institution if it was ever founded. However attempts over the next few years to raise subscriptions to found the hospital failed. Eventually land for a hospital was gifted by Mrs Macpherson of Newton Castle and subscriptions were raised to found the hospital. As well as these monetary donations, furnishings for the hospital were provided while the architect Lake Falconer took no fee for his work on the hospital. At the time of opening it had two large wards. It is now known as Blairgowrie Community Hospital. In 2014 a £2.36 million refurbishment project saw the development of a purpose built in-patient GP unit and other new units added to the site.

A short distance upstream from the bridge on the riverside path is Cargill&#x27;s Leap where Donald Cargill, a minister and covenanter, escaped Government troops by jumping over a narrow part of the River Ericht.

North of Rattray, occupying a dominating position on the edge of Craighall Gorge above the river Ericht, is Craighall Castle, the ancestral home of the chieftain of Clan Rattray. The castle is no longer occupied by a Rattray, having been sold in 2010.

On the west side of Blairgowrie are Newton Castle, home to the chieftain of Clan Macpherson, and Ardblair Castle, home to the Blair Oliphant family.

==Climate==
Blairgowrie has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).
==Economy==
The surrounding area is still the soft fruit centre of Scotland, and the local population increases greatly in summer when the Eastern European students arrive to harvest the fruit which traditionally consisted of raspberries and strawberries but now includes a wider range with cherries, blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries etc. The extensive use of poly tunnels and raised beds has greatly extended the growing season with fruit available from May until October.

Other major industries include Castle Water, Proctor Insulation, Tayside Contracts, Graham Environmental, Davidsons chemist headquarters and various fruit processing and freezing plants. The industrial estate on Welton Road houses many small businesses.

The town has two main motor dealerships and several independent garages.

The local weekly newspaper is the &quot;Blairgowrie Advertiser&quot;, locally known as &quot;the Blairie&quot;, which is now produced and printed in Perth by Trinity Mirror Group. The Blairie has a long history and was originally produced and printed in the old printworks in Reform Street where the original print machines are still mothballed.

There are regular Saturday outdoor markets in the Wellmeadow with stalls offering local produce and crafts.

Blairgowrie&#x27;s town centre has a range of independent shops, craft workshops, restaurants and pubs. National retailers include Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Co-op and Boots. The Angus Hotel and Royal Hotel cater for local customers, tourists and a large number of bus parties who use the town as a touring base.

==Education==
The new Blairgowrie Campus opened in Elm Drive in 2009 incorporating Newhill Primary and St Stephens RC Primary. Newhill primary holds about 360 children while St Stephens RC primary is a smaller unit holding about 70 pupils. Rattray Primary serves children on that side of the river. Blairgowrie High School in Beeches Road provides secondary education for all round the area. The adjacent Recreation Centre has a pool and leisure facilities and is scheduled for replacement in the near future. The disused former Hill Primary School was the subject of a controversial but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by The Ericht Trust to provide a community centre but it has now been sold for conversion to housing as has the former St Stephen&#x27;s RC primary school in John Street.

==Public transport==
Stagecoach provide all the bus services to and from Blairgowrie with routes to Perth, Dundee, Alyth, Coupar Angus, Dunkeld, Aberfeldy, Kirkmichael and Glenshee as well as a circular town service. The nearest railway stations are Perth and Dunkeld &amp; Birnam and the nearest airport is Dundee. Services to Perth and Dundee are frequent.
The bus station is located in the Wellmeadow.

==Churches==
Churches represented are Church of Scotland (Blairgowrie and Rattray Parish Churches), St Stephen&#x27;s RC, St Catherine&#x27;s Episcopalian, Evangelical Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Church on the Way, Lifeplus Church, Methodist Church and Plymouth Brethren.

==Culture==
In 1996, Blairgowrie hosted the Royal National Mòd, a festival of the Scottish Gaelic language. Since then the town has featured bilingual street signs, in English and Gaelic.

==Sport==
Football

Blairgowrie and Rattray is home to the Scottish Junior Football East Region Premier League side Blairgowrie F.C. as well as the Scottish Amateur Football Association sides Rattray A.F.C. and Balmoral United A.F.C. which play in the Perthshire Amateur League.

Rugby

Blairgowrie Rugby Club was founded in 1980 (originally as Blairgowrie High School FP RFC) and as of 2019, plays in the Caledonia Regional League Caledonia League 1. The team is based within the John Johnston Coupar Recreational Park on Coupar Angus Road, which formed part of an old berry farm which was bequeathed to the town in the 1970s for use as a sports and recreational facility.

Golf

Blairgowrie Golf Club was founded in 1889. There are now two 18-hole courses, Rosemount and Lansdowne, and a 9-hole course.

Skiing

The Glenshee Ski Centre in Glenshee (, &quot;Glen of the Fairies&quot;), is some north at the Cairnwell Pass on the A93 Braemar road, which is the highest public road in the UK.

Hillwalking

Blairgowrie is normally considered the start and finish of the marked Cateran Trail long-distance walk which follows a circular route through Glenericht and Strathardle to Bridge of Cally, Kirkmichael and Enochdhu, over Ben Earb to Spittal of Glenshee, through Glenshee and Glenisla to Kirkton of Glenisla and Alyth and finally back to Blairgowrie. The trail is divided into five stages and can easily be walked in five days or less, although winning teams in the annual &quot;Cateran Yomp&quot; regularly complete it in under eleven hours.

Rattray

The traditional ball game of Rattray no longer takes place, but the Rattray silver ball, the trophy retained by the winners, is still in existence. It is believed to have been donated by Sylvester Rattray of Nether Persie who became minister of Rattray in 1591 and continued there until his death in 1623.
The Rattray silver ball is now kept at Perth Museum and Art Gallery.

Highland Games

Blairgowrie Highland Games are held annually on the first Sunday of September in Bogles Field on Essendy Road. It is noted for its Hill Race and its mass tug o&#x27;war where as many contestants as possible from Blairgowrie and Rattray compete against each other.

The evening before is known as Braemar Night with entertainment in the Wellmeadow and fireworks along the river. This tradition started in the 1960s to encourage travellers returning from the Braemar Highland Games (then held on a Thursday), which attracted huge numbers of visitors due to the attendance of the Royal Family, to stop in the town and quickly grew into a huge programme of entertainments, pipe bands, fireworks, funfairs etc., drawing tens of thousands not only returning south from Braemar but on special excursions from Perth and Dundee.

When Blairgowrie Games restarted in the 1980s, the Braemar Games had moved to the first Saturday in September, and the following day seemed an appropriate date for Blair Games. Braemar Night has evolved into a more refined smaller all-day event aimed at locals but is still extremely popular. The main feature and finale is a spectacular firework display along the River Ericht which draws large crowds onto the bridge, which is temporarily closed, and along the riverside areas.

&quot;Snow Road&quot;
Blairgowrie is the southern point of the Cairngorm National Park Snow Road tourist route which runs through Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Tomintoul to its northern end at Grantown-on-Spey.
The route includes the highest point on the UK road system at the Cairnwell Pass and the Cockbridge to Tomintoul road over the Lecht Pass which is well known on winter road reports as one of the first to be closed by snow.

==Twin cities==
*Pleasanton, California, United States
*Cowansville, Quebec, Canada
*Fergus, Ontario, Canada
*Brebières, Pas-de-Calais, Hauts-de-France, France

==Namesakes==
Blairgowrie, a seaside town south of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and Blairgowrie, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, were named after the town.

<doc id="443355" wikidata="Q5354160" url="?curid=443355" title="Zuntata">
<text>is the &quot;house band&quot; of Japanese video game developer and publisher Taito. The band consists of sound director Katsuhisa Ishikawa, bassists Yu Shimoda and Shohei Tsuchiya, and drummer Masaki Mori. Zuntata is Taito&#x27;s core sound department, and has become the collective name for the company&#x27;s other sound production teams. The band has contributed to many of the company&#x27;s franchises, including &quot;Darius&quot;, &quot;Groove Coaster&quot;, &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

Zuntata&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1983, the year Taito established its sound division. The Zuntata name was employed in 1988, first used for the soundtrack for &quot;The Ninja Warriors&quot;. Zuntata&#x27;s music was originally published by Pony Canyon, before these operations were moved in-house. Zuntata worked on several Taito arcade games, namely shoot &#x27;em ups and rhythm games. The band also assisted in production of the X2000, a Taito-developed karaoke machine. After Taito was acquired by Square Enix in 2005, many of the band&#x27;s members departed due to creative differences between them and executives, as Taito was shrinking its operations into becoming more of a game publisher and owner of video arcades.

Zuntata continues to produce music for Taito video games, working primarily on the &quot;Groove Coaster&quot; series. The band&#x27;s music, a combination of abstract and synth-pop, has gotten attention from video game publications for its bizarre nature and strangeness. Both the band and its members have received awards, and its music has been published many times through albums and digital music storefronts such as iTunes and Spotify.
