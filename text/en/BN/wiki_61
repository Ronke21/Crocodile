<text>Audio-Animatronics (sometimes shortened to AAs) are a form of mechatronic puppetry trademarked by the Walt Disney Company, and the source of the term animatronics. 

Audio-Animatronics are created by Walt Disney Imagineering for use in shows and attractions at Disney theme parks. They move and often synchronize with audio from an external sound system (generally a recorded speech or song), and are usually fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand but cannot produce any form of locomotion. 

An Audio-Animatronic differs from an android or robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. 

==History==

Audio-Animatronics were originally a creation of Disney employee Lee Adams, who worked as an electrician. Walt Disney got a mechanical toy bird in New Orleans and found out how it worked, which served as the inspiration for Audio-Animatronics. An early robotic figure was the Dancing Man, created by Roger Broggie and Wathel Rogers, and modeled after a tap dancing routine by actor Buddy Ebsen. 

Development of the first audio animatronic technology began in 1949 with the work of the giant squid for &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954).

The term &quot;Audio-Animatronics&quot; was first used commercially by Disney in 1961, was filed as a trademark in 1964, and was registered in 1967.
The Audio-Animatronic show The Enchanted Tiki Room opened in 1963 at Disneyland. It is a room full of tropical creatures with eye and facial actions synchronized to a musical score entirely by electromechanical means. The Audio-Animatronic cast of the musical revue uses tones recorded on tape to vibrate a metal reed that closes a circuit to trigger a relay, which sends a pulse of electricity to a mechanism that causes a pneumatic valve to move part of the figure.

The movements of the attraction&#x27;s birds, flowers, and tiki idols are triggered by sound. Figures&#x27; movements have a neutral &quot;natural resting position&quot; that the limb or part returns to when there is no electric pulse present. Other than this, the animation is a binary system, with only on/off moves, such as an open or closed eye. The same kind of technology was used for the head of Mary Poppins’ cane in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964). 

Other early Audio-Animatronics were at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. They were used in the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln exhibit at the State of Illinois Pavilion, Pepsi/UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; exhibit, General Electric&#x27;s Carousel of Progress, and Ford Motor Company&#x27;s &quot;Magic Skyway.&quot;

An Audio-Animatronic robin sang a duet with Julie Andrews in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

In 2009, Disney debuted an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics, and in 2018, announced aerial stunt figures called Stuntronics.

==Technology==

The system of the animatronics relies on a combination of electric motors, solenoids, hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, and cables to produce repeatable puppet movements that syncs to sound.

Pneumatic actuators are powerful enough to move heavier objects like simulated limbs, while hydraulics are used more for large figures. On/off type movement would cause an arm to be lifted (for example) either up over an animatronic’s head or down next to its body, but with no halting or change of speed in between. To create more realistic movement in large figures, an analog system was used. This gave the figures&#x27; body parts a fully fluid range of motion, rather than only two positions.

To permit a high degree of freedom, the control cylinders resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a ball joint and threaded rod. This ball joint permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes.

The oil-filled cylinders occasionally drip or leak, so it is sometimes necessary to do makeup touch-up work, or to strip the clothing off a figure due to leaking fluids inside. The Enchanted Tiki Room remains a pneumatic theatrical set, primarily due to the leakage concerns, as the Audio-Animatronic figures are above the audience&#x27;s heads.

Because each individual cylinder requires its own control channel, the original Audio-Animatronic figures were relatively simple in design, to reduce the number of channels required. For example, the first human designs (referred to internally by Disney as series A-1) included all four fingers of the hand as one actuator. It could wave its hand but it could not grasp or point at something. With modern digital computers controlling the device, the number of channels is virtually unlimited, allowing more complex, realistic motion. The current versions (series A-100) now have individual actuators for each finger. Disney also introduced a brand new figure that is used in &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge and is referred to as the A1000.

===Compliance===
Compliance is a new technology that allows faster, more realistic movements without sacrificing control. In the older figures, a fast limb movement would cause the entire figure to shake in an unnatural way. The Imagineers thus had to program slower movements, sacrificing speed in order to gain control. This was frustrating for the animators, who, in many cases, wanted faster movements. Compliance improves this situation by allowing limbs to continue past the points where they are programmed to stop; they then return quickly to the &quot;intended&quot; position, much as real organic body parts do. The various elements also slow to a stop at their various positions, instead of using the immediate stops that caused the unwanted shaking. This absorbs shock, much like the shock absorbers on a car or the natural shock absorption in a living body.

===Cosmetics===
The skin of an Audio-Animatronic is made from silicone rubber. Because the neck is so much narrower than the rest of the skull, the skull skin cover has a zipper up the back to permit easy removal. The facial appearance is painted onto the rubber, and standard cosmetic makeup is also used. Over time, the flexing causes the paint to loosen and fall off, so occasional makeup work and repainting are required.

Generally as the rubber skin flexes, the stress causes it to dry and begin to crack. Figures that do not have a high degree of motion flexibility, such as the older A-1 series for President Lincoln, may only need to have their skin replaced every ten years. The most recent A-100 series human AAs, like the figure for President Barack Obama, also include flexion actuators that move the cheeks and eyebrows to permit more realistic expressions; however, the skin wears out more quickly and needs replacement at least every five years.

The wig on each human is made from natural human hair for the highest degree of realism, although using real hair creates its own problems, since the changing humidity and constant rapid motions of the moving AA carriage hardware throughout the day cause the hair to slowly lose its styling, requiring touch-ups before each day&#x27;s showing.

===Autonomatronics===
Autonomatronics is a registered trademark for a more advanced Audio-Animatronic technology, also created by Walt Disney Imagineers.

The original Audio-Animatrons used hydraulics to operate robotic figures to present a pre-programmed show. This more sophisticated technology can include cameras and other sensors feeding signals to a computer, which processes the information and makes choices about what to say and do. In September 2009, Disney debuted &quot;Otto&quot;, the first interactive figure that can hear, see and sense actions in the room. Otto can hold conversations and react to the audience.

In December 2009, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln returned to Disneyland using the new Autonomatronics technology.

===Stuntronics===

In June 2018, it was revealed that Disney Imagineering had created autonomous, self-correcting aerial stunt robots called stuntronics. This new extension of animatronics utilizes onboard sensors for precision control of advanced robotics to create animatronic human stunt doubles that can perform advanced aerial movements, such as flips and twists.

==Variations==
The technology of the AA figures at Disney&#x27;s theme parks around the world vary in their sophistication. They range from the blinking and mouth movements from the figures at Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room to full body movement, from the mouth to the tip of the fingers from the figures at the former Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape! attraction at the Magic Kingdom.

Current technologies have paved the way for more elaborate AA figures, such as &quot;Ursula head&quot; inside the Mermaid Lagoon Theater at Tokyo DisneySea, the Indiana Jones figures inside the Indiana Jones attractions at both Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, the &quot;swordfighting&quot; pirates inside Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland Park (Paris), the &quot;lava/rock monster&quot; inside Journey to the Center of the Earth at Tokyo DisneySea, the &quot;Na&#x27;vi Shaman of Songs&quot; inside the Na&#x27;vi River Journey, the dinosaurs inside DINOSAUR, the &quot;Yeti&quot; inside Expedition Everest at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom (though the latter has been non-functional since 2008, using a strobe light to simulate movement of the still figure), or the Roz figure inside Monsters, Inc. Mike &amp; Sulley to the Rescue! at Disney California Adventure.

The Roz figure is able to &quot;interact&quot; with guests with help from an unseen ride operator who chooses pre-recorded messages for Roz to &quot;speak&quot;, thereby seeming to &quot;react&quot; to individual guests&#x27; unique appearances and clothing. Mr. Potato Head outside of the Toy Story Mania! attractions at the Disney California Adventure and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios parks does the same.

One of the newest figures comes with changes to the classic Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom, both now featuring characters from the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series. The Jack Sparrow figure is based on the actor that portrays him, Johnny Depp, and features his voice and facial mold. So far, the newest and most advanced Audio-Animatronic figure is Abraham Lincoln at Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln at Disneyland. Lincoln can move his lips to form words, can make dramatic movements, and can portray emotions to match the words he is saying.

The Audio-Animatronic anglerfish inside The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends in Epcot uses a robotic arm that is connected to a puppet to control realistic swimming movements of the animatronic to make the effect that the anglerfish is actually swimming. Robotic arms have also appeared in other attractions such as The Sum of All Thrills in the Innoventions area of Epcot. 

The Audio-Animatronic Indiana Jones figures inside Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull at Tokyo DisneySea resemble actor Harrison Ford, unlike the original figures found at the Disneyland version, Temple of the Forbidden Eye. In 2010, some of the Audio-Animatronic figures at the Disneyland version were replaced with more technically advanced figures that also look more like Ford.

The Audio-Animatronics formerly featured in the Great Movie Ride used the likeness of the actors that portrayed the characters. Audio-Animatronics found in Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Magic Kingdom use projections for their faces to make the dwarfs&#x27; mouths move and their eyes blink. The projected face technology is also used in Frozen Ever After at Epcot. These Audio-Animatronics were succeeded by the figures in use in the &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge lands at Disneyland and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in 2019, such as Hondo Ohnaka in the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; – Smugglers Run attraction. These new figures, known as A-1000 Animatronics, have a fully functional face, featuring a full range of motion in the eyes and mouth.

== Society ==
Society has a large effect on how Audio-Animatronics evolve over time in theme parks. At Disney Parks, Audio-Animatronics are constantly being taken out and put in based on current tastes and the changing of generations. Some attractions like The Hall of Presidents are affected when it comes to events in society as every time there is a new president they are added to the attraction.

==In popular culture==
* Less-sophisticated forms of audio-animatronics also gained popularity in the 1980s through use at family entertainment centers such as ShowBiz Pizza Place and Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s. At ShowBiz, &quot;The Rock-afire Explosion&quot; band was made by Aaron Fechter and Creative Engineering, who also made other animatronic characters and arcade redemption games. They are also used in film and television special effects.
* Several passengers and the crew of a Pioneer Zephyr are represented in a display of this historic train at Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry. Neatly dressed in the proper style of first class passengers of their era, one remarks upon the casual dress of the visitors.
* The George Washington Masonic National Memorial features an animatronic George Washington.
* John Wardley is often said to have brought animatronics to the United Kingdom, utilizing a concept called Ramped Movement, which allowed for smoother movements of the figures. John appeared on &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; in the 1970s showing a guitar playing animatronic programmed to music. His first project was the creation of the animated show &quot;50 Glorious Years&quot; for Tussaud&#x27;s &quot;Royalty and Empire Exhibition&quot; at Windsor.
* Scissor Sisters member Ana Matronic named herself after animatronics, as a homage to her love of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.
* The Pennsylvania Lottery uses an animatronic groundhog named Gus (who refers to himself as the &quot;second-most-famous groundhog in Pennsylvania&quot;, after Punxsutawney Phil) as the mascot for television commercials for their instant scratch-off games.
* The 2015 Disney film &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; uses the Audio-Animatronics word as a term for their sophisticated android characters.
* A dissociative animatronic Lincoln is one of the malfunctioning robots at the robot asylum in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Insane in the Mainframe&quot;.

<text>An animatronic is a mechatronic puppet controlled electronically by machine to move in a fluent way. They are a modern variant of the automaton and are often used for the portrayal of characters in films, video games and in theme park attractions.

Animatronics are a multidisciplinary field integrating puppetry, anatomy and mechatronics. Animatronic figures can be implemented with both computer and human control, including teleoperation. Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions. Figures are usually encased in body shells and flexible skins made of hard or soft plastic materials and finished with colors, hair, feathers and other components to make them more lifelike. Animatronics stem from a long tradition of mechanical automata powered by hydraulics, pneumatics and clockwork.

Before the term &quot;animatronics&quot; became common, they were usually referred to as &quot;Robots&quot;. Since then, robots have become known as more practical programmable machines that do not necessarily resemble living creatures. Robots (or other artificial beings) designed to convincingly resemble humans are known as &quot;androids&quot;. The term &quot;animatronics&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;animate&quot; and &quot;electronics&quot;. The term &quot;Audio-Animatronics&quot; was coined by Walt Disney in 1961 when he started developing professional animatronics for entertainment and film.
== History ==
Before electronics, Animatronics were simply puppets made to work with clockwork. These are known today as atomata. For most of human history, It has not been possible to create a moving figure resembling a person, That was not directly puppeted by another person.

In the renaissance era, the first clockwork automated humanoid figures were created. These were complex with many movements, However the figures were extremely large, As they contained large cam shaft mechanisms in the base with the introduction of electricity, the mechanisms to create a humanoid figure got smaller and smaller, however very few of the created figures looked human.

The first audio animatronic to convincingly imitate a human was Walt Disney&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln attraction at the Illinois State Pavilion of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. this marked a change in the industry, as computers where a pivotal part in creating the figure.

== Animatronics in films ==
The film industry has been a driving force revolutionizing the technology used to develop animatronics. Animatronics are used in situations where a creature does not exist, the action is too risky or costly to use real actors or animals, or the action could never be obtained with a living person or animal. Its main advantage over CGI and stop motion is that the simulated creature has a physical presence moving in front of the camera in real time. The technology behind animatronics has become more advanced and sophisticated over the years, making the puppets even more lifelike.

Animatronics were first introduced by Disney in the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; which featured an animatronic bird. Since then, animatronics have been used extensively in such movies as &quot;Jaws&quot;, and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, which relied heavily on animatronics.

Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson have been pioneers in using animatronics in the film industry; a film co-directed by the latter, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, showcased groundbreaking puppets designed by Brian Froud and created by Henson&#x27;s then recently established Creature Shop in London.

The 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, directed by Spielberg, used a combination of computer-generated imagery in conjunction with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston and his team. Winston&#x27;s animatronic &quot;T. rex&quot; stood almost ,
 in length and even the largest animatronics weighing were able to perfectly recreate the appearance and natural movement on screen of a full-sized &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;.

Jack Horner called it &quot;the closest I&#x27;ve ever been to a live dinosaur&quot;. Critics referred to Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;dinosaurs&quot; as &quot;breathtakingly — and terrifyingly — realistic&quot;.

The 1999 BBC miniseries &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was produced using a combination of about 80% CGI and 20% animatronic models. The quality of computer imagery of the day was good, but animatronics were still better at distance shots, as well as closeups of the dinosaurs. Animatronics for the series were designed by British animatronics firm Crawley Creatures. The show was followed up in 2007 with a live adaptation of the series, &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs: The Arena Spectacular&quot;.

Geoff Peterson is an animatronic human skeleton that serves as the sidekick on the late-night talk show &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. Often referred to as a &quot;robot skeleton&quot;, Peterson is a radio-controlled animatronic robot puppet designed and built by Grant Imahara of &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

=== Films focusing on animatronics ===
* &quot;The Banana Splits Movie&quot;, a 2019 American comedy horror film starring Dani Kind, Steve Lund, Sara Canning, and the voice of Eric Bauza, follows a young boy and his family who, as a birthday present, attend a live taping of a successful children&#x27;s television series featuring Fleegle, Bingo, Drooper, and Snorky, four goofy-like animatronic characters. However, their new software updates go haywire upon learning the upcoming cancellation of their show and the characters start a killing spree that the crew and audience must survive. It is a horror reimagining of the 1968-1970 Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s television series of the same name.
* &quot;Willy&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, a 2021 American action comedy horror film starring Nicolas Cage, Emily Tosta, David Sheftell and Beth Grant, follows a quiet drifter who is tricked into cleaning up a once-successful abandoned family entertainment center while battling the restaurant&#x27;s eight murderous animatronic characters (possessed by souls of cannibalistic serial killers) with the aid of a teenager and her friends.
* &quot;Five Nights at Freddy’s&quot;, a 2023 American supernatural horror film starring Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Matthew Lillard, follows a troubled young man caring for his 10-year-old sister who is suggested by his career counselor to take up a night shift job at a once-successful abandoned family entertainment center, while keeping an eye on the restaurant&#x27;s four murderous animatronic characters Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy (possessed by the spirits of five missing dead children) while trying to figure out unsolved disappearance of his younger brother more than a decade before. It is based on the &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; video game series created by Scott Cawthon.

=== Short films ===
* &quot;The Hug&quot;, a 2018 horror short film directed by Jack Bishop and Justin Nijm, and starring Nick Armstrong and Roman George, follows a bratty birthday boy at Pandory&#x27;s Pan Pizza Palace, a ShowBiz Pizza Place-like restaurant, who has an awkward situation with Pandory the Panda, the pizzeria&#x27;s giant panda animatronic mascot. It premiered at Hulu as part of its &quot;Huluween&quot; film competition.

=== Television ===
* The Capicola Gang, a trio of evil anthropomorphic animatronic animals from The Fun Fun Zone, consisting of Dominic (a robot bear, although listed in the credits as Main Bear), who is based on Vito Corleone from &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Louie (a robot beaver), and Amelia (a robot duck, although listed in the credits as Duck Lady), are the main antagonists in the &quot;Regular Show&quot; episodes &quot;Fuzzy Dice&quot; and &quot;Steak Me Amadeus&quot;. The Capicola Gang Leader had a cameo appearance as an incriminating witness in &quot;Can you Ear Me Now?&quot; where he testified in court against Mordecai and Rigby. They share a resemblance to the characters from the popular game series &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; and the popular kids entertainment center Chuck E. Cheese.
* Hoo-Ha&#x27;s Jamboree, an animatronic band at Hoo-Ha Owl&#x27;s Pizzamatronic Jamboree, and a parody of The Rock-afire Explosion of ShowBiz Pizza Place, which consist of Hoo-Ha the Owl (guitarist, and lead singer), Cheerleader (banjoist), Beaver (guitarist), Rat in a Barrel (two same animatronics sit on either side of the stage), Cowboy Frog (bongo player), and Will E. Badger (opening act) are the secondary antagonists in the &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; episodes &quot;Soos and the Real Girl&quot;, &quot;Weirdmageddon Part 1&quot;, and &quot;Weirdmageddon 2: Escape From Reality&quot;.

=== Advertising ===
The British advertisement campaign for Cadbury Schweppes titled &quot;Gorilla&quot; featured an actor inside a gorilla suit with an animatronically animated face.

The Slowskys was an advertising campaign for Comcast Cable&#x27;s Xfinity broadband Internet service. The ad features two animatronic turtles, and it won the gold Effie Award in 2007.

=== Toys ===
Some examples of animatronic toys include TJ Bearytails, Big Mouth Billy Bass, FurReal, Kota the triceratops, Pleo, WowWee Alive Chimpanzee, Microsoft Actimates, and Furby. Well-known brands include Cuddle Barn, PBC International, Telco, Sound N Light, Nika International, Gemmy Industries, Tickle Me Elmo, Chantilly Lane and Dan Dee.

== Design ==
There are quite a few ways to build an animatronic, however most follow this basic structure:

An animatronics character is typically designed to be as realistic as possible and thus, is built similarly to how it would be in real life. The framework of the figure is like the &quot;skeleton&quot;. Joints, motors, and actuators act as the &quot;muscles&quot;. Connecting all the electrical components together are wires, such as the &quot;nervous system&quot; of a real animal or person. Steel, aluminum, plastic, and wood are all commonly used in building animatronics but each has its best purpose. The relative strength, as well as the weight of the material itself, should be considered when determining the most appropriate material to use. The cost of the material may also be a concern. Several materials are commonly used in the fabrication of an animatronics figure&#x27;s exterior. Dependent on the particular circumstances, the best material will be used to produce the most lifelike form. For example, &quot;eyes&quot; and &quot;teeth&quot; are commonly made completely out of acrylic.

Some examples of different methods of building animatronics are Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s studio c animatronic, made of latex rubber, metal, and plastic supported by an internal skeleton and on the other end of the spectrum is the all metal bunyip animatronic in Australia, using water to actuate the characters mouth.

=== Materials ===
* Latex: White latex is commonly used as a general material because it has a high level of elasticity. It is also pre-vulcanized, making it easy and fast to apply. Latex is produced in several grades. Grade 74 is a popular form of latex that dries rapidly and can be applied very thick, making it ideal for developing molds. Foam latex is a lightweight, soft form of latex which is used in masks and facial prosthetics to change a person&#x27;s outward appearance, and in animatronics to create a realistic &quot;skin&quot;. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was one of the first films to make extensive use of foam latex prosthetics in the 1930s.
* Silicone: Disney has a research team devoted to improving and developing better methods of creating more lifelike animatronics exteriors with silicone. RTV silicone (room temperature vulcanization silicone) is used primarily as a molding material as it is very easy to use but is relatively expensive. Few other materials stick to it, making molds easy to separate. Bubbles are removed from silicone by pouring the liquid material in a thin stream or processing in a vacuum chamber prior to use. Fumed silica is used as a bulking agent for thicker coatings of the material.
* Polyurethane: Polyurethane rubber is a more cost effective material to use in place of silicone. Polyurethane comes in various levels of hardness which are measured on the Shore scale. Rigid polyurethane foam is used in prototyping because it can be milled and shaped in high density. Flexible polyurethane foam is often used in the actual building of the final animatronic figure because it is flexible and bonds well with latex.
* Plaster: As a commonplace construction and home decorating material, plaster is widely available. Its rigidity limits its use in molds, and plaster molds are unsuitable when undercuts are present. This may make plaster far more difficult to use than softer materials like latex or silicone.

=== Movement ===
Pneumatic actuators can be used for small animatronics but are not powerful enough for large designs and must be supplemented with hydraulics. To create more realistic movement in large figures, an analog system is generally used to give the figures a full range of fluid motion rather than simple two position movements.

Mimicking the often-subtle displays of humans and other living creatures, and the associated movement is a challenging task when developing animatronics. One of the most common emotional models is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) developed by Ekman and Friesen. FACS defines that through facial expression, humans can recognize six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. Another theory is that of Ortony, Clore, and Collins, or the OCC model which defines 22 different emotional categories.

In 2020 Disney revealed its new animatronics robot that can breathe, move its eyes very much like humans, and identify people around it in order to select &quot;an appropriate&quot; response, as opposed to previous Disney animatronics that were used in purely scripted, non-interactive situations, like theme park rides.

== Training and education ==
Animatronics has been developed as a career which combines the disciplines of mechanical engineering, casting/sculpting, control technologies, electrical/electronic systems, radio control and airbrushing.

Some colleges and universities do offer degree programs in animatronics. Individuals interested in animatronics typically earn a degree in robotics which closely relate to the specializations needed in animatronics engineering.

Students achieving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in robotics commonly complete courses in:

* Mechanical engineering
* Industrial robotics
* Mechatronics systems
* Modeling of robotics systems
* Robotics engineering
* Foundational theory of robotics
* Introduction to robotics.

== In popular culture ==
Animatronic characters appear in both films and games, most notably in horror genre and survival horror video games that generally features possessed animatronics as antagonists.

=== Games ===

* &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; (commonly known as &quot;FNaF&quot;), a horror video game series, features various animatronic entertainers as antagonists who try to kill the player character, who is typically a nighttime security guard or employee at one of the facilities (usually a pizzeria) where the animatronics reside. In the first game of the series &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot;, the animatronics&#x27; violent attitude towards humans at night is explained away as faulty programming, which causes them to mistake the protagonist for an endoskeleton without a character suit on—which goes against the establishment&#x27;s rules. As a result, the animatronics try to &quot;forcefully stuff&quot; the player character into a suit, resulting in their death. However, the games feature a deep lore (gradually revealed through various minigames and Easter eggs) which reveals that many of the animatronics are actually haunted by the spirits of children whose deaths are somehow connected to the fictional restaurant franchise &quot;Freddy Fazbear&#x27;s Pizza&quot;. At least six of these children were murdered by William Afton ( &quot;The Purple Guy&quot;), one of the co-founders of the original restaurant and the series&#x27; overarching villain, who would go on to possess an animatronic of his own after his death. Since the original game, &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; has evolved into a large media franchise comprising various sequels, prequels and spin-offs, fan games, a novel trilogy, and an anthology series of short stories. A film adaptation &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; was released on October 27, 2023.

<text>Hanham is in the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire, adjacent to, but not within the City of Bristol. It became a civil parish on 1 April 2003.

The post code area of Hanham is BS15. The population of this civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 6,128.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. The ward stretches south from &quot;Hanham&quot; to Hanham Abbots. The total population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 10,311

==History==

Tom Cribb, once world champion bare-knuckle boxer, was born in Hanham. Stephen Merchant was also born in Hanham.

Hanham is also the first place in the UK to trial Gordon Brown&#x27;s new eco-towns. Built on the former Hanham Hall Hospital site, the new village serves as a blueprint for Gordon Brown&#x27;s proposed five eco-towns that will provide up to 100,000 zero-carbon dwellings across the country.

The Blue Bowl has been claimed to be one of the oldest public houses in the country.

<text>Zelkova (from the Georgian &quot;dzelkva&quot;, &#x27;stone pillar&#x27;) is a genus of six species of deciduous trees in the elm family Ulmaceae, native to southern Europe, and southwest and eastern Asia. They vary in size from shrubs (&quot;Z. sicula&quot;) to large trees up to tall (&quot;Z. carpinifolia&quot;). The bark is smooth, dark brown. Unlike the elms, the branchlets are never corky or winged. The leaves are alternate, with serrated margins, and (unlike the related elms) a symmetrical base to the leaf blade. The leaves are in two distinct rows; they have pinnate venation and each vein extends to the leaf margin, where it terminates in a tooth. There are two stipules at each node, though these are caducous (shed early), leaving a pair of scars at the leaf base. &quot;Zelkova&quot; is polygamous. Staminate flowers are clustered in the lower leaf axils of young branchlets; the perianth is campanulate, with four to six (to seven) lobes, and the stamens are short. Pistillate and hermaphrodite flowers are solitary, or rarely in clusters of two to four, in the upper leaf axils of young branchlets. The fruit is a dry, nut-like drupe with a dorsal keel, produced singly in the leaf axils. The perianth and stigma are persistent. 

==Species and distribution==
*&quot;Zelkova abelicea&quot; – Cretan zelkova (Crete in Greece)
*&quot;Zelkova carpinifolia&quot; – Caucasian zelkova (Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran) 
*&quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; – Keyaki or Japanese zelkova (Japan, Korea,  Kuril Islands in Russia, Taiwan, China)
**&quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; var. &quot;serrata&quot;
**&quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; var. &quot;tarokoensis&quot;
*&quot;Zelkova sicula&quot; – Sicilian zelkova (Sicily, Italy in 2 locations: Bosco Pisano and Ciranna)
*&quot;Zelkova sinica&quot; – Chinese zelkova (China)
*&quot;Zelkova schneideriana&quot; – Schneider&#x27;s zelkova (China)
;Hybrids
*&quot;Zelkova × verschaffeltii&quot; – Cut-leaf zelkova (&quot;Z. carpinifolia&quot; × &quot;Z. serrata&quot;)

==Ecology==
The genus &quot;Zelkova&quot; was common throughout northern Europe and North America as late as the Pliocene. However, extensive Pleistocene glaciation has confined the genus to its present range to the eastern Mediterranean islands and the Caucasus, and in eastern Asia where only local glaciation occurred. Species of &quot;Zelkova&quot; were important elements of the vast forests that prevailed throughout the Northern Hemisphere during much of the Cenozoic Period. 
Today, the genus comprises six species with disjunct distribution patterns: three in eastern Asia [&quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; (Thunb.) Makino; &quot;Zelkova schneideriana&quot; Hand.-Mazz.; and &quot;Zelkova sinica&quot; C. K. Schneid.], one in southwestern Asia [&quot;Zelkova carpinifolia&quot; (Pall.) C. Koch] and two on the Mediterranean islands of Sicily (&quot;Zelkova sicula&quot; Di Pasq., Garfi &amp; Quézel) and Crete [Z&quot;elkova abelicea&quot; (Lam.) Boiss.]. The oldest fossils attributed to &quot;Zelkova&quot; date from the early Eocene (55 million years ago) in western North America, where the genus is extinct today. In Bulgaria, &quot;Zelkova&quot; fossils were found in Paleogene and Neogene layers in the following locations: &quot;Zelkova ungeri&quot; (Ett.) Kov. — Lozenets, Kurilo, Chukurovo in Sofia Region, Dospey in Samokov Region, Pernik, Pirin Mine in Blagoevgrad Region, Bobov Dol in Kyustendil Region; &quot;Zelkova praelonga&quot; Berger — Pirin Mine in Blagoevgrad Region. 

&quot;Zelkova abelicea&quot; is endemic to Crete (Greece); it has a fragmentary distribution in the four main mountain regions of Crete (Lefka Ori, Psiloritis, Dikti and Thrypti), between 900 and 1800 m above sea level, which corresponds to the upper timberline. It grows mainly on north-facing slopes or in and around rocky river-beds and gullies which remain moist during dry summers. The species is highly endangered through habitat fragmentation and destruction, overgrazing, fire and water stress.

The Sicilian Zelkova &quot;Z. sicula&quot;, only discovered in 1991, is listed as an endangered species. The two known populations close to Syracuse (Bosco Pisano and Ciranna) comprise a small number of low shrubs suffering from severe overgrazing; the natural mature size of undamaged specimens is unknown.

Whilst all the known &quot;Zelkova&quot; taxa are currently in cultivation and in botanic gardens or arboreta, relatively few collections are known to be from wild sourced material or known in the countries of their natural distribution. &quot;Z. sicula&quot; and &quot;Z. abelicea&quot; are the two taxa considered to be at most risk of extinction (Critically Endangered and Vulnerable). These two &quot;Zelkova&quot; species are the two with the most restricted natural distribution—both are small island endemics. The &quot;Zelkova&quot; with the widest natural distribution, &quot;Z. serrata&quot;, is also the most common &quot;Zelkova&quot; in botanic garden collections 

Phylogeography, using chloroplast and mitochondrial markers, has mostly focused on the Quaternary and the influence of the cycles of glaciation on species distribution and structure. 
 Phylogeography has, however, also been used to document more ancient patterns, with some of them presumably dating as far back as the early Miocene. The retrieval of ancient patterns may be specific to tree species, which are assumed to evolve more slowly than herbaceous plants and shrubs. &quot;Zelkova&quot; trees live for centuries, which is a good indication that ancient patterns might be recovered using molecular markers.

A few phylogenetic and biogeographical studies have been carried out on &quot;Zelkova&quot;, but these studies had small sample sizes or weak representation of wild populations. A more comprehensive phylogeographical analysis, based on &quot;trn&quot;H–&quot;psb&quot;A, &quot;trn&quot;L and internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2), was the first to use a wide sampling of natural populations from nearly all the disjunct regions where &quot;Z. abelicea&quot;, &quot;Z. carpinifolia&quot; and &quot;Z. sicula&quot; presently grow. It aimed to assess the diversity within and among species using DNA from two cellular compartments that have different modes of inheritance and trace different histories.

==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; and &quot;Z. carpinifolia&quot; are grown as ornamental trees. The wood is hard, used for making furniture. In Japan, the wood of the keyaki, or &quot;Z. serrata&quot; is used for making drums, called &quot;wadaiko&quot;. The most desired drums are hollowed out of a trunk of a zelkova tree, but in many cases, the drum is fashioned from staves of keyaki wood, using the same method as when constructing a barrel.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Zelkova&quot; derives from the native name of &quot;Z. carpinifolia&quot; in the Georgian language – one of the Kartvelian languages spoken in the Caucasus, as shown by the Georgian name, &quot;dzelkva&quot;, from the words &quot;dzeli,&quot; meaning &#x27;bar&#x27; or &#x27;pillar&#x27;, and &quot;kva&quot; meaning &#x27;rock&#x27; or &#x27;stone&#x27; The tree was often used for making rock-hard and durable bars for building and furniture.

<text>Eugene Levy (born December 17, 1946) is a Canadian actor and comedian. Known for portraying flustered and unconventional figures, Levy has won multiple accolades throughout his career including four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2011, and was made Companion of the Order of Canada in 2022.

Levy started his career writing and acting in the Canadian television sketch series &quot;SCTV&quot; (1976–1984), earning two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. He also appeared in the films &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), and &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (1996). He also became known for co-writing and appearances in a string of films with Christopher Guest, including &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (1996), &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000), &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), and &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006). He also appeared in the &quot;American Pie&quot; series of films.

From 2015 to 2020, he starred as Johnny Rose in the sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, a comedy series that he co-created with his son and co-star Dan Levy. In 2019 and 2020, he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, which he won in 2020. He also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. In 2023, he began hosting a travel documentary series &quot;The Reluctant Traveler&quot;.

==Early life==
Levy was born to a Jewish family in downtown Hamilton, Ontario. His mother, Rebecca (née Kudlatz; 1910-1988), was a homemaker, and his father, Joseph (1909-1985), was a foreman at an automobile plant. He has a brother, Fred, and sister, Barbara. His mother was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Polish Jewish parents, later moving to Canada. His father was Sephardi Jewish, with ancestors from Spain and Bulgaria.

Levy attended Westdale Secondary School, where he was student council president. He subsequently attended McMaster University. He was vice-president of the McMaster Film Board, a student film group, where he met filmmaker Ivan Reitman.

==Career==

The 1972–1973 Toronto production of the hit musical &quot;Godspell&quot; opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre and was intended to be a run of a few dozen performances for a subscription audience. The cast was drawn entirely from local performers, instead of a touring cast. The Toronto production launched the careers of many actors, including Levy, Victor Garber, Andrea Martin, Gilda Radner, Dave Thomas, and Martin Short, as well as the show&#x27;s musical director, Paul Shaffer. Howard Shore played saxophone for this production. After an enthusiastic response from the audience, the scheduled run at the Royal Alexandra ended and the show moved uptown to the Bayview Playhouse in Leaside. The Bayview Playhouse production ran until August 1973, with a then-record run of 488 performances.

An alumnus of both the Second City, Toronto and the sketch comedy series &quot;Second City Television&quot;, Levy often plays unusual supporting characters with nerdy streaks. Perhaps his best-known role on &quot;SCTV&quot; is the dimwitted Earl Camembert, a news anchor for the &quot;SCTV News&quot; and a parody of real-life Canadian newsman Earl Cameron. Celebrities impersonated by Levy on SCTV include Perry Como, Ricardo Montalbán, Alex Trebek, Gino Vannelli, Sean Connery, Howard Cosell, Henry Kissinger, Menachem Begin, Bud Abbott, Milton Berle, John Charles Daly, Gene Shalit, Judd Hirsch, Jack Carter, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Tony Dow, James Caan, Lorne Greene, Rex Reed, Ralph Young (of Sandler and Young), F. Lee Bailey, Ernest Borgnine, former Ontario chief coroner and talk show host Dr. Morton Shulman, Norman Mailer, Neil Sedaka and Howard McNear as Floyd the Barber.

Original Levy characterizations on &quot;SCTV&quot; are news reporter Earl Camembert, comic Bobby Bittman, scandal sheet entrepreneur Dr. Raoul Withers, &quot;report on business&quot; naïf Brian Johns, 3-D horror auteur Woody Tobias Jr., cheerful Leutonian accordionist Stan Schmenge, lecherous dream interpreter Raoul Wilson, hammer-voiced sports broadcaster Lou Jaffe, diminutive union patriarch Sid Dithers (&quot;San Francisckie! Did you drove or did you flew?&quot;), fey current-events commentator Joel Weiss, buttoned-down panel show moderator Dougal Currie, smarmy &quot;Just for Fun&quot; emcee Stan Kanter, energetic used car salesman Al Peck, guileless security guard Gus Gustofferson, Phil the Garment King (also of Phil&#x27;s Nails), and the inept teen dance show host Rockin&#x27; Mel Slirrup.

Though he has been the &quot;above the title&quot; star in only two films, &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Man&quot; (2005), he has featured prominently in many films. He is the co-writer and frequent cast member of Christopher Guest&#x27;s mockumentary features, particularly &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), where his sympathetic performance as emotionally unstable folksinger Mitch Cohen won kudos; his accolades included a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Musical or Comedy and the prestigious New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Other collaborations with Guest include &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (1996), &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000), and &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006). 

From the 1980s through the 2010s, Levy appeared in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986), &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991), &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot; (1995), &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; (1996), &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (1996), the &quot;American Pie&quot; film series (1999–2012), &quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001), &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; (2005), &quot;Madea&#x27;s Witness Protection&quot; (2012), and other comedies. He also voiced characters in films such as &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; (2006), &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; (2009), and &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016). Levy was the creator of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, a television sitcom based on the LucasArts video game of the same name. He was also seriously considered for the role of Toby Ziegler on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, a role that went to actor Richard Schiff.

Levy, along with his son Dan Levy, was co-creator of the CBC/Pop TV sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; which ran from 2015-2020. He also starred in the show alongside his son as head of the Rose family, Johnny Rose. His daughter, Sarah Levy, portrayed Twyla Sands, the waitress at the Schitt&#x27;s Creek diner. Eugene Levy&#x27;s brother Fred was also a producer on the show.

Levy hosted and executive produced an Apple Original eight-episode travel series titled &quot;The Reluctant Traveler&quot; (2023) on Apple TV+.

In 2024, Levy attended a ceremony honouring him with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
Levy married Deborah Divine in 1977. Divine&#x27;s career has been in TV production. The couple have two children whom they raised in Toronto: actors Dan and Sarah, both of whom starred alongside their father on &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

Levy is an advocate for autism awareness and treatment. He was a close friend of actor and fellow &quot;SCTV&quot; cast member John Candy. Levy is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

In 2021, he was named honorary mayor of Pacific Palisades. In 2025, his home in the neighbourhood was destroyed in the Palisades wildfire.

==Awards and nominations==
Levy, along with Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, was awarded the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for the title song from &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;. Levy received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts, in 2008.

In March 2006, it was announced that he would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In 2002, the entire cast of &quot;SCTV&quot; was given a group star, and although Levy is not mentioned on the actual star, he was still inducted as a part of the group. This makes him one of only four two-time honourees, alongside fellow &quot;SCTV&quot; alumni John Candy, Martin Short, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara. Levy is one of only a handful of people who have won at least five Canadian Comedy Awards, including two for Best Writing (&quot;Best in Show&quot; in 2001 and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; in 2004) and three for Best Male Performer (&quot;Best in Show&quot;, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; in 2002, and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;).

In 2008, the governor general of Canada presented Levy with the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards (GGPAA), a lifetime achievement award considered &quot;for their outstanding body of work and enduring contribution to the performing arts in Canada.&quot;. In 2010, Levy was awarded the ACTRA Award by the union representing Canada&#x27;s actors. In 2011, Levy was made a Member of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as a comic actor and writer, and for his dedication to charitable causes&quot; and promoted to the rank of Companion in 2022.

On May 22, 2012, Levy delivered a commencement address at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was awarded the degree Doctor of Laws (honoris causa). On June 11, 2012, Levy was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the lieutenant governor of Ontario.

On March 13, 2016, Levy took home the award for &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Comedic Role&quot; at the 4th Annual Canadian Screen Awards, for his performance as Johnny Rose in the CBC/Pop TV sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

<doc id="438293" wikidata="Q4997351" url="?curid=438293" title="Bumps race">
<text>A bumps race is a form of rowing race in which a number of boats chase each other in single file, each crew attempting to catch and &#x27;bump&#x27; the boat in front without being caught by the boat behind.

The form is mainly used in intercollegiate competitions at the University of Oxford since 1815, and at the University of Cambridge since 1827. 

Bumps racing in eights is also found in the United Hospitals Boat Club in London between the 5 London medical schools and Royal Veterinary College.

Bumps racing in fours is also the format of inter-house rowing at Eton College and Shrewsbury School. It is particularly suitable where the stretch of water available is long but narrow, precluding side-by-side racing. Bumps racing gives a sharper feel of immediate competition than a head race, where boats are simply timed over a fixed course. Few rowers worldwide use rivers as narrow as the Cam or the Isis, but bumps races are also contested elsewhere.

==Origins and history==

The first attested bumps race, and the first attested race between two clubs anywhere in the world, took place in Oxford in 1815. This was between two eights from Brasenose College and Jesus College. The fact the racing was conducted in eight-oared boats gave rise to the event being known as Eights.
The practice began with the two colleges racing upstream from Iffley Lock to a finishing line just short of Folly Bridge. The crews began one behind the other in the lock, with each having to push their way out of the lock before being able to commence racing. This created an inevitable gap between boats, with the one behind trying to bump the one in front to claim victory. The boat in front could claim to be &quot;Head of the River&quot; if they avoided being bumped. As the number of crews contesting races increased, races ceased to start in the lock, and instead were started from the bank upstream of the lock. This first occurred in 1825 or 1826.

Twelve years after bumps racing began in Oxford, Lent Bumps racing commenced at Cambridge University in 1827.

At Oxford, an additional bumping regatta, known as Torpids, was begun in 1838. This regatta was originally for men who had not rowed in Eights, nor in a university crew.

==Racing practice and procedures==
Bumps races are typically raced in a series over several days. The starting order of each day&#x27;s race is based on the previous day&#x27;s results; the first day&#x27;s starting order each year is determined by the results on the last day of the previous year. Each day the boats line up bow-to-stern, usually along the bank of the river, with a set distance between each boat and the next (usually about one and a half boat-lengths of clear water). The starting positions are usually marked by a rope or chain attached to the bank, the other end of which is held by each boat&#x27;s cox. 
Boats wait along the bank, and may be poled out just in time for the start, to avoid drifting. At the start signal the cox lets go of the rope and the crew starts to row, attempting to catch and &quot;bump&quot; the boat in front while simultaneously being chased by the one behind.
A bump is made when any form of contact is made with the boat in front; however, outright collisions are neither necessary nor encouraged. Alternatively, if possible, an overtaking-bump occurs when the stern of the chasing boat completely passes the bow of the boat in front. This is relatively rare simply because it is easier to make contact with a rival boat than it is to overtake it. A bump of this kind usually only occurs when a boat crashes. Under the current Cambridge rules, to overtake merely requires the pursuing boat to draw alongside the other boat&#x27;s bow ball; side by side is good enough, and in the early part of the course a bump is deemed to occur when the bowball of the chasing crew passes the cox of the crew being chased.

Generally, and at Oxford during Eights Week, once a bump has occurred both crews pull over to the river bank and take no further part in that race. At Oxford during Torpids a bumping crew pulls over but the bumped crew must continue racing over the entire course and can be bumped by more than one crew per day. As bumps racing usually takes place on narrow stretches of water, when contact occurs, two or more boats can become tangled up or not clear the river quickly enough, causing the racing line to be blocked. This can be very dangerous and the chance of boats getting damaged is high. To avoid this, the cox of the boat being bumped can concede as soon as slight physical contact occurs or even once it is inevitable. Nonetheless, collisions involving several boats are common. Crews in Torpids tend to concede bumps early to avoid being entangled with the crew that caught them: should they be unable to continue, other boats may row past, overtake and &#x27;bump&#x27; the stationary crew. Any crew that has been bumped starts the next race behind the boat or boats that caught it; they switch places. A boat which reaches the finish line without either bumping or being bumped is said to have &#x27;rowed over&#x27; and stays in the same position.

==Organisation==
As the length of the racing course is limited, large regattas are organised into &quot;divisions&quot; of 12 to 20 boats. Each division races separately, but they are ranked to achieve an overall order of crews: e.g. the top crew in the second division is considered to be one place behind the last crew in the first division. The first day&#x27;s starting position is based on the final positions from the previous year, though in the bottom divisions the boats may be placed according to qualifying &quot;getting/rowing on&quot; races held before the event. This allows boat clubs to introduce new crews. On each day of a bumps regatta the division races are rowed in reverse order, i.e. the lowest division first. A crew finishing at the top of a division race goes on to compete in the next-higher division later that day (starting last). Alternatively, a crew finishing last in a division must race in the next-lower division the following day (starting first). This is referred to as a &quot;sandwich boat&quot; and allows crews to move between divisions.

A crew (A) may find that the boat in front of them has caught the boat ahead of them. Since (except at Oxford during Torpids) these boats both then drop out, crew A must now try to catch the next boat ahead of them still racing (most often the one which started three places ahead). If they succeed, this is called an &quot;overbump&quot; and, in exchanging places with the boat they bumped, they move three places up the start order. Further still, it is possible, though very rare, to &quot;double-overbump&quot; (move up five places) or &quot;triple-overbump&quot; (seven places). Only two occasions of a &quot;quadruple-overbump&quot; (9 places at once) have been recorded at the Cambridge May Bumps, by W1 in 1986 and by M4 in 2018. A &quot;quintuple-overbump&quot; occurred in the 1984 Cambridge May Bumps in Men&#x27;s Division 6 when Downing V caught Corpus IV after the 10 sandwich boats originally between them had all bumped out. Overbumps, and variants thereof, are most common in the lower divisions where the quality of the crews varies greatly year-on-year.

The ultimate achievement in such a competition is to finish first in the overall order; that crew is said to be &#x27;Head of the River&#x27;. This is only realistically possible for crews starting a bump race in the top 5 places. A more attainable goal for most crews, apart from moving up towards the headship, is to bump up a place (or more) on each of the four days. The crew is said to have &quot;won its blades&quot;, or achieved &quot;blades&quot;. Traditionally, members of such a crew can purchase a rowing oar in the crew colours and inscribed with the crews&#x27; names and the boats they bumped to hang on their wall. Conversely, crews that go down four places win a wooden spoon, achieving &quot;spoons&quot;. The bottom crew at the bottom of the last division is known as the &#x27;Tail of the River&#x27;. A &quot;bumps chart&quot; is a graphical representation of the week&#x27;s results; each boat&#x27;s fortunes can be traced as its line on the chart rises and falls.

At Cambridge, the most successful college boat club over the four days of the May Bumps is awarded the Pegasus Cup, sponsored by Milton Brewery.

==Races==
Both Oxford and Cambridge Universities host two sets of university bumps races per year, one in early spring and one in early summer, each lasting four days. At Cambridge these are called &quot;Lent Bumps&quot; and &quot;May Bumps&quot; respectively, while at Oxford they are &quot;Torpids&quot; and &quot;Summer Eights&quot;. The races are for eights (i.e., eight rowers with a cox steering), each representing one of the university&#x27;s various colleges. Most colleges enter several crews.

In both Oxford and Cambridge, there are also separate Town Bumps races in which local clubs compete. Oxford&#x27;s races, run by the City of Oxford Rowing Club (CORC), are open to all comers and are raced in fours, all races taking place on the same day. Cambridge&#x27;s races are run under the auspices of the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association (CRA) and are run exclusively in eights and take place over 4 consecutive days in July. There are typically four men&#x27;s divisions with 17 boats (plus a sandwich boat; a sandwich boat being the top boat from each division) in each division, and three women&#x27;s divisions. The bumps are fiercely contested, and the ideal that the races are for local rowers can lead to disputes over whether crews are &#x27;legal&#x27;.

The United Hospitals boat club holds a bumps race over three days each May after exams on the River Thames, racing from upstream of Kew Bridge adjacent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew ending at the UL Boathouse at Chiswick. Traditionally involving only medical school crews, in recent years alumni and non-medical crews have been allowed to enter as invitational crews. Imperial College School of Medicine Boat Club (ICSMBC) are the current holders of headship.
At Eton and Shrewsbury, both schools still have an annual bumping race. At Eton, it takes place over four evenings, in early May. There is usually one boat entered per house (including one boat entered by College). Because of the dangerous nature of the sport, only fours are used, and only the second and third years may row. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and also a &#x27;Bumping Cup&#x27; for the boat who has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects called &quot;The Monarch&quot;. The crew training is mainly pupil driven. Previously races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e., until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago.

<text>U.S. Route 67 is a major north–south U.S. highway which extends for 1,560 miles (2,511 km) in the Central United States. The southern terminus of the route is at the United States-Mexico border in Presidio, Texas, where it continues south as Mexican Federal Highway 16 upon crossing the Rio Grande. The northern terminus is at U.S. Route 52 in Sabula, Iowa. US 67 crosses the Mississippi River twice along its routing. The first crossing is at West Alton, Missouri, where US 67 uses the Clark Bridge to reach Alton, Illinois. About to the north, US 67 crosses the river again at the Rock Island Centennial Bridge between Rock Island, Illinois, and Davenport, Iowa. Additionally, the route crosses the Missouri River via the Lewis Bridge a few miles southwest of the Clark Bridge.

=== Texas ===

Throughout Texas, US 67 runs in a primarily northeast–southwest manner, apparently violating the norms for numbering U.S. highways as odd-numbered routes are typically north–south in orientation, because prevailing north–south versus prevailing east–west designation is determined by the ultimate termini as the route traverses multiple states.

US 67 is part of the La Entrada al Pacifico international trade corridor from its southern terminus to an intersection with U.S. Route 385 in McCamey, where the corridor follows US 385 to Odessa.

Between Dallas and Weaver in eastern Hopkins County, the highway runs concurrently with Interstate 30, and is unsigned between Dallas and Royse City. From Weaver east to the Arkansas state line in Texarkana, US 67 runs parallel to I-30. East of the Interstate 35E/Interstate 30 &quot;mixmaster&quot; in Downtown Dallas, U.S. Route 67 follows Interstate 30. West of the &quot;mixmaster,&quot; U.S. 67 follows I-35E south through Oak Cliff. Along this portion, the Route 67 shield is also alongside the Interstate shield. Just north of Kiest Boulevard, U.S. Route 67 breaks off from Interstate 35E and maintains controlled-access (&quot;Interstate grade&quot;) status down to Midlothian, where it becomes a four-lane divided highway to the western edge of Cleburne. The route from Alpine to San Angelo was a previous route of SH 99.

Though it passes through the heart of the Ozarks, the highest elevation along US 67 is the last 150 miles between Fort Stockton and Presidio. Below Fort Stockton, US 67 passes the Sierra Del Norte range at 6810 ft. West of Alpine, US 67 passes near the Twin Sisters (6116 and 6134 ft), Ranger Peak (6256 ft), and Paisano Peak (6091 ft) before going through Paisano Pass (5,180 ft). East of Marfa are views of Twin Mountains (6681 and 6910 ft), Goat Mountain (6642 ft), Cathedral Peak (6867 ft), and Cienega Mountain (6565 ft). The Puertacitas Mountains (6350 ft) and the Davis Mountains (8371 ft) can be seen from the Marfa Ghost Lights observatory to the north. The Davis Mountains are the highest elevation near US 67. Thirty miles south of Marfa, US 67 reaches its highest point at 5428 ft, with Chinatti Peak (7732 ft) seen to the southwest.

=== Arkansas ===

In Arkansas, US 67 runs parallel with Interstate 30 from Texarkana to Benton, where it then runs concurrently with I-30 to North Little Rock. It then runs concurrent with Interstate 57 north to US 412 in Walnut Ridge, where I-57 and the freeway ends and the road becomes a five-lane undivided highway to Pocahontas. After Pocahontas, the road returns to a two-lane alignment north to the state line.

In 2009, a bill was introduced to rename the portion of US 67. The bill, by Rep. J.R. Rogers of Walnut Ridge, designates US 67 in Jackson, Lawrence, and Randolph Counties as &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Highway 67.&quot; Besides Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, the bill notes that Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino played at clubs along that stretch of highway.

=== Missouri ===

Going from south to north, US 67 enters Missouri at the Arkansas state line. About north of the state line, it intersects US 160. At the southwest corner of Poplar Bluff, Business Route 67 goes into Poplar Bluff while US 67 bypasses Poplar Bluff to the west on a freeway-grade highway. It then joins US 60 at the northwest corner of Poplar Bluff. Both 60 and 67 then follow a four-lane route to an interchange about northwest of Poplar Bluff, where US 60 heads west toward Springfield, while US 67 heads north to St. Louis.

Construction is complete to divide the highway through Wayne, Madison, and Butler Counties, including bypasses around Greenville and Cherokee Pass. The new divided highway opened on August 19, 2011, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Additionally, MoDOT has extended the divided highway south to US 160 south of Poplar Bluff.

From Fredericktown, US 67 passes through Farmington, where an existing interchange with Route 221 was converted to a diverging diamond interchange in September 2012. US 67 then proceeds through Park Hills, Desloge, and Bonne Terre. About north of Bonne Terre, US 67 crosses Interstate 55 and enters Festus and Crystal City and picks up US 61. This becomes known as Truman Boulevard in Festus and Crystal City, Highway 61-67 from Herculaneum to Imperial, and Jeffco Boulevard from Arnold until it exits Jefferson County and enters St. Louis County, over the Meramec River where it becomes Lemay Ferry Road.

When US 67/61 reaches St. Louis County, It travels Lemay Ferry Road (Route 267) until it reaches Lindbergh Boulevard. There, it overlaps Lindbergh Boulevard (known as Kirkwood Road in Kirkwood). US 61 then turns west onto I-64/US 40 West towards Wentzville. Lindbergh, named for aviator Charles Lindbergh, continues north through Frontenac, Ladue, Creve Coeur, Maryland Heights, Bridgeton, Hazelwood and Florissant until it reaches Lewis &amp; Clark Boulevard (Route 367). From there, it continues straight north to West Alton, Missouri and then crosses the Mississippi River on the Clark Bridge and enters Alton, Illinois.

The only vehicular tunnel in Missouri is located on US 67 at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, where the road tunnels under Runway 11/29.

=== Illinois ===

In the state of Illinois, US 67 runs north from the Clark Bridge in Alton, passing through Jerseyville, then through the Forgottonia region of western Illinois. It runs near the cities of Jacksonville, Beardstown, through Macomb, and near Monmouth before crossing into Iowa across the Rock Island Centennial Bridge.

=== Iowa ===
US 67 enters Iowa in Davenport. It follows an alignment through Bettendorf and Clinton which parallels the Mississippi River. Near Sabula, US 67 meets U.S. Route 52 and Iowa Highway 64 and ends.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eurotas (; Ancient Greek: Εὐρώτας) was a king of Laconia.
== Family ==

Eurotas was the son of King Myles of Laconia and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; gave a slight variant of the mythological generation of Eurotas, who was described as the son of Lelex, born from the ground, by his wife Cleocharia. In some accounts, his mother was called Taygete instead. Eurotas had no male heir but he did have two daughters Sparta and Tiasa by Clete.

== Mythology ==
Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Zeus and Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus was named, according to Pausanias. This Lacedaemon married his daughter Sparta and renamed the state after his wife.

Pausanias says: &quot;It was Eurotas who channelled away the marsh-water from the plains by cutting through to the sea, and when the land was drained he called the river which was left running there the Eurotas.&quot; The &quot;cutting through&quot; is seen by Pausanias’ translator and commentator, Peter Levy, S.J., as an explanation of Eurotas (or Vrodamas) Canyon, a ravine north of Skala where the river has cut through the foothills of Taygetus after changing direction to the west of the valley.


==Eurotas in art==
River gods are typically represented in Greek art, such as coin motifs, as figures with the bodies of bulls and the faces of humans. If only the face appears, they might wear horns and have wavy hair or be accompanied by fish. Claudius Aelianus states that the Eurotas and other rivers are like bulls.

<text>Gerhard Casper (born December 25, 1937) is a political scientist who is a former president of Stanford University from 1992 to 2000, a former Dean of the University of Chicago Law School from 1979 to 1987, and a former provost of the University of Chicago from 1989 to 1992. Casper was president of the American Academy in Berlin from July 2015 through July 2016; from August 2019 to January 24, 2020, he served as the institution&#x27;s trustee-in-residence.

Casper is also a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI) at Stanford, and served as the institute&#x27;s director between September 2012 and June 2013. Casper is also the Peter and Helen Bing Professor in Undergraduate Education, emeritus, and is a professor with emeritus status at Stanford Law School.

==Biography and academic career==
Born December 25, 1937, Gerhard Casper grew up in Hamburg, Germany. He earned his first law degree from the University of Hamburg in 1961. In 1962, he received his LL.M. from Yale University. He then attended the University of Freiburg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1964.

In the fall of 1964, Casper emigrated to the United States and spent two years as an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1966, he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School. Between 1979 and 1987, he served as dean of the law school. In 1989, Casper was appointed provost of the University of Chicago and served in that capacity until 1992. He served as president of Stanford University from 1992 to 2000.

Casper has written and taught primarily in the fields of constitutional law, constitutional history, comparative law, and legal theory. Among his books is &quot;Separating Power&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1997). From 1977 to 1990, he was an editor of &quot;The Supreme Court Review&quot;.

==Stanford University==
In 1992, Casper became the ninth president of Stanford University. His concerns as president ranged from resolution of the indirect cost dispute with the federal government to restoration of the campus after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to innovation in curriculum, programs, and physical plant.

Casper&#x27;s Commission on Undergraduate Education was the first comprehensive examination of undergraduate education at Stanford in 25 years. The commission and other faculty initiatives led to a new approach to the first two years of college, Stanford Introductory Studies (SIS), which provides small-group learning and research experiences. SIS includes the Freshman and Sophomore Introductory Seminars and Sophomore College.

Casper kept tuition increases to a minimum while increasing financial aid.

Casper also initiated the Stanford Graduate Fellowships and helped raise a substantial endowment for their support. The purpose of the Stanford Graduate Fellowships is to attract the best graduate students and give them full freedom to pursue their work at Stanford without worrying about the vagaries of sponsored research or other traditional sources of support.

Recruitment and retention of exceptional faculty members who excel in both research and teaching was emphasized during Casper&#x27;s presidency through Research Grants for Junior Faculty in the three schools that offer undergraduate degrees: Earth Sciences, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. The university&#x27;s bureaucracy was also streamlined through internal reorganizations and a reduction in the number of vice presidential positions.

The integration of the Stanford Alumni Association into the university in 1998 enhanced outreach to Stanford&#x27;s alumni worldwide. Donations to Stanford, especially from alumni, increased sharply under Casper&#x27;s leadership, with particular emphasis on fortifying Stanford&#x27;s endowment and increasing participation through the creation of the Stanford Fund for Undergraduate Education.

During Casper&#x27;s presidency, the physical infrastructure of the campus improved substantially. Restoration of buildings damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was completed, and the architectural value of new buildings was enhanced with competitions attracting some of the world&#x27;s most gifted architects. The 1893 Leland Stanford Junior Museum became part of an expanded complex, the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts. The reconstructed Bing Wing of Cecil H. Green Library opened in 1999, a decade after the severe damage inflicted by the Loma Prieta earthquake closed its doors. Other new constructions included the Science and Engineering Quad, the Center for Clinical Sciences Research, graduate residences, and the Arrillaga Alumni Center.

In 1993, Casper chose Condoleezza Rice as provost of the university. She was succeeded in 1999 by John L. Hennessy. In 2000, Hennessy became the tenth president of the university. About the Stanford presidency, Casper wrote &quot;Cares of the University&quot; (Stanford, CA, 1997), in which he addressed many issues facing the contemporary university. His most recent book about higher education is &quot;The Winds of Freedom: Addressing Challenges to the University&quot;, which was published by Yale University Press in 2014.

== American Academy in Berlin ==
In July 2015, Casper was appointed one-year interim president of the American Academy in Berlin, an institute for culture and research founded in 1994 by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. The independent, privately funded, nonpartisan American Academy in Berlin seeks to improve cultural and academic ties between Germany and the USA. Since August 2019, Casper serves as the American Academy&#x27;s trustee-in-residence. He returned to the Academy&#x27;s board in 2015, after having previously served as trustee from 2000 to 2009.

While acting as president, Casper arranged a visit by Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, in September 2015, who discussed &quot;The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain.&quot; Casper also helped to oversee the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum, which was created in memory of the Academy&#x27;s founder.

The intercultural and interdisciplinary setting and the creative program made the Academy a prestigious center according to the German magazine Der Spiegel.

== Honors, awards and leadership ==

Casper has been elected to membership in the American Law Institute, the International Academy of Comparative Law, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Orden Pour le mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste (Order Pour le mérite for the Sciences and Arts), and the American Philosophical Society. During the fall of 2006, he held the Kluge Chair in American Law and Governance at the Library of Congress. He has been awarded various honorary doctorates. On May 26, 2000 Casper received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden That spring, he also received an honorary doctorate from Yale.

In 1997, Casper received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Casper is the 2014 recipient of the American Law Institute&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award. He served on ALI&#x27;s Council from 1980 to 2010, and continues to participate as an emeritus member. From 2000 to 2008, he served as a successor trustee of Yale University. From 2010 to 2016, he was chairman of the Board of the Terra Foundation for American Art. Casper is a trustee of the Central European University in Budapest and a member of international advisory councils at the Israel Democracy Institute, the European University at St. Petersburg, and Koç University, Istanbul.

Casper also has the honor of having been the subject of the first Google search by someone not a part of the Google team. In 1998, the future founders of Google was demonstrating their search software for John Hennessy. He chose to search for &quot;Gerhard Casper&quot;.

<doc id="438343" wikidata="Q2139467" url="?curid=438343" title="U.S. Route 287">
<text>U.S. Route 287 (US 287) is a north–south (physically northwest–southeast) United States highway. At long, it is the second longest three-digit U.S. Route, behind US 281. It serves as the major truck route between Dallas-Fort Worth and Amarillo, Texas, and between Fort Collins, Colorado, and Laramie, Wyoming. The highway is broken into two segments by Yellowstone National Park, where unnumbered park roads serve as a connector.

The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Choteau, Montana, south of the Canadian border, at an intersection with US 89. Its southern terminus (as well as those of US 69 and US 96) is in Port Arthur, Texas at an intersection with State Highway 87 (SH 87), up the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico. It intersects its parent route US 87 twice, overlapping it from Amarillo to Dumas, Texas, and then crossing it in Denver, Colorado.

US 287 is the shortest route between Denver and Dallas-Fort Worth.

==Route description==

===Texas===

US 287 originates at its southern terminus in Port Arthur as a branch of SH 87. From Port Arthur, US 287 runs concurrently with US 69 and US 96 to Lumberton, where US 96 diverges to the northeast and the co-signed US 287/US 69 continues northwesterly until US 287 and US 69 diverge in Woodville. Continuing northwesterly, US 287 merges with Interstate 45 (I-45) in Corsicana and follows the Interstate to Ennis, where it branches off and continues through Waxahachie, crossing I-35E and continuing north through Tarrant County, where it encounters and briefly merges with three different Interstates (I-820, I-20, and I-35W). From Fort Worth, US 287 continues north to Wichita Falls and continues just south of the Oklahoma border before entering the Texas Panhandle. A section of US 287, between Midlothian and Waxahachie, was dedicated as the Chris Kyle Memorial Highway, in honor of fallen SEAL Chris Kyle, whose hometown was Midlothian.

The highway continues through Amarillo, where it intersects I-40, and then runs north to Kerrick and crosses into neighboring Oklahoma.

===Oklahoma===

In Oklahoma, US 287 remains within Cimarron County, located at the end of the Panhandle. After crossing the state line north of Kerrick, Texas, the highway intersects SH 171 at its southern terminus. US 287 continues northwesterly, crossing the Beaver River, toward Boise City, the county seat. On the east side of town, the highway formerly ran concurrently with US 56, US 64, US 412, and SH 3. These five highways then entered the traffic circle in downtown Boise City. US 287 emerged from the north side of the circle, as well as US 385 and SH 3. Now US 287 bypasses town to the east. These three highways (US 287, US 385, SH 3) head north to the Colorado state line. SH 3 ends there, while US 287 and US 385 continue onward into Colorado.

===Colorado===
From Oklahoma, US 287 and US 385 enter into a very rural part of Colorado. They continue in a north/northwest direction through the state. The two highways pass through the town of Campo, and make an interchange with US 160 on the outskirts of Springfield. In Lamar and Carlton, the highways make an interchange with US 50. Here US 385 heads east on US 50, and US 287/US 50 continue to the north. Just outside the town the highways make a sharp turn toward the west, and the road heading north is SH 196. South of Wiley, US 50 heads west, while US 287 turns north toward Wiley. East of Eads, US 287 turns toward the west again, briefly merging with SH 96. In Eads, SH 96 continues toward the west, while US 287 turns toward the north. Near Kit Carson, US 287 again turns toward the west and merges with US 40. Near Limon, the two highways make two interchanges with I-70 before passing through Limon. Then the two highways merge with I-70. Near the outskirts of Denver US 36 merges with the group of highways making the road, I-70/US 287/US 36/US 40.

Just past E-470, I-70 and US 36 split to follow a more northerly course, while US 287 and US 40 continue west into Downtown Denver on Colfax Avenue. The I-25, US 6, US 87, and US 85 interchange marks US 287&#x27;s second junction with its parent route, US 87; the other is in Texas. Shortly thereafter, at a cloverleaf interchange with Federal Boulevard, SH 88 runs south, US 40 continues west on Colfax, and US 287 turns toward the north on Federal Boulevard. After crossing US 36 (Denver–Boulder Turnpike), US 287 turns west onto 120th Avenue where it overlaps SH 128. Just before meeting US 36 again in Broomfield, US 287 bends back to the north, leaving SH 128 which continues west through an interchange with SH 121 and US 36. At Baseline Road in Lafayette, SH 7 joins US 287 for about a mile, before SH 7 splits to the west on Arapahoe Avenue towards Boulder. It intersects SH 119 as it enters Longmont on Main Street, and then it intersects SH 66 at the north edge of town. In 2021 the Colorado State Senate Joint Resolution 21-018 designated the section of U.S. 287 between SH 66 in Longmont and SH 402 in Loveland as the SPC Gabriel David Conde Memorial highway. Gabriel Conde was a Berthoud High School graduate and a student at the Colorado School of Mines who joined the U.S. Army in 2015. He was killed in action in Afghanistan in April 2018. The road bypasses Berthoud en route to Loveland, where US 287 splits into the pair of one-way streets Lincoln Avenue (northbound) and Cleveland Avenue (southbound). It then divides the Loveland cemetery. This is the only cemetery in the US with a US Highway dividing it. Continuing north, US 287 passes through Fort Collins on College Avenue, merging with SH 14 at Jefferson Street. On the edge of the mountains at Ted&#x27;s Place, SH 14 splits and heads west into Poudre Canyon, while US 287 continues north into Wyoming.

The section of US 287 between Fort Collins and Laramie, Wyoming, carries very heavy truck traffic and is regarded as quite dangerous. A 2023 Colorado Department of Transportation report found the highway has above-average crash rates, making the highway a good candidate for more safety improvements. The 30-mile section from north of Fort Collins to the Wyoming line has had 570 crashes, including 15 fatal wrecks since 2019, and at least 15 students from the University of Wyoming in Laramie have died on the road since 2000.

===Wyoming===

US 287 enters Wyoming through a pass between the Laramie Mountains to the east and the Medicine Bow Mountains to the west. In Laramie, US 287 crosses I-80 and merges with US 30 and the two highways continue to head north. After passing Medicine Bow, these highways turn west-southwest and return to I-80 near Walcott, where they merge with the interstate west until Rawlins. US 287 branches off from I-80 and US 30 and heads into the town. US 287 merges with Wyoming Highway 76 (WYO 76), WYO 82, and WYO 30 for a short distance just outside Rawlins, though WYO 76 ends when US 287 branches to the northwest as a stand-alone highway. It is also possible to take Business US 287 (WYO 80, WYO 30) into Rawlins. In Downtown Rawlins, WYO 80 and WYO 30 head toward the west while Business US 287 heads to the north, merging with WYO 789 where WYO 30 and WYO 80 split off the highway. A short while later Business US 287 and WYO 789 merge with mainline US 287, which made a detour around the city. US 287 and WYO 789 stay merged all the way to Lander, where WYO 789 heads toward the northeast and US 287 heads toward the northwest. US 287 merges with US 26 in the very mountainous terrain of West Central Wyoming, and the two highways head west. The highways enter Grand Teton National Park. In Moran, US 287 and US 26 meet US 191 and US 89. US 26 heads south merging with US 191 and US 89. US 287 heads north merging with US 191 and US 89, passing through the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway before ending at the South Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. While US 287 and other U.S. Routes are officially discontinuous through the park, some commercially produced maps show these highways running inside Yellowstone National Park itself along its unnumbered roads and across the Wyoming–Montana state line.

===Montana===
US 287 in Montana begins at the West Entrance of Yellowstone National Park in West Yellowstone, terminating a concurrency with US 20. US 287 and US 191 split north of the town. US 287 heads toward the northwest, merging with Montana Highway 2 (MT 2) north of Sappington, and running northeast. At I-90, MT 2 ends and US 287 continues to head north. In Townsend, US 287 merges with US 12 and the two highways continue north. At I-15 (near Helena), US 287 continues north on I-15 and US 12 heads west through downtown Helena. Northeast of Wolf Creek, US 287 and I-15 split with US 287 heading northwest and I-15 heading northeast. US 287 ends at US 89 in Choteau.

==History==
When US 287 was first commissioned in 1939, it extended only from the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park to Denver, Colorado. The route was extended southward to the Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas in 1940, and northward into Montana to US 89 at Choteau, Montana in 1965. US 89 continues north of Choteau into Alberta as Highway 2 through the major cities of Calgary and Edmonton, connecting with a Canadian link to the Alaska Highway in the latter.

Included in the route of US 287 is former US 370, which was commissioned in 1926 and connected Amarillo to Bowie, traveling concurrently with US 70 between Vernon and Wichita Falls, Texas.

The Canada to Gulf Highway Association, which later became the U.S. Highway 287 Association, was active from the 1910s until the 1970s to promote US 287 as a popular tourist route, and was composed of members from businesses and organizations in cities along the route.

The Wyoming state transportation department started widening US 287 in 2009.

==Future==
In 2017, House Bill 2026 (HB 2026) was filed in the Texas Legislature to provide funding for a study on upgrading US 287 in Texas to an Interstate highway, with the eventual goal of designating US 287 as an Interstate from Beaumont, Texas, to the Canadian border in Montana. HB 2026 later died in committee.

On April 22, 2021, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed a Bill that would rename the part of the Highway in the State after the 45th U.S. President Donald Trump. As of April, 2021 it was in discussion in the State Senate.

<doc id="438349" wikidata="Q285105" url="?curid=438349" title="It's a Small World">
<text>It&#x27;s a Small World (stylized in all lowercase and in quotations or with exclamation mark) is an Old Mill boat ride located in the Fantasyland area at various Disney theme parks around the world. Versions of the ride are installed at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California; Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida; Tokyo Disneyland; Disneyland Paris; and Hong Kong Disneyland. The inaugural version of the ride premiered at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair before permanently moving to Disneyland in 1966.

The ride features over 300 audio-animatronic dolls in traditional costumes from cultures around the world, frolicking in a spirit of international unity, and singing the attraction&#x27;s title song, which has a theme of global peace. According to &quot;TIME.com&quot;, the Sherman Brothers&#x27; song &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; is the most publicly performed song of all time. In recent years, the Small World attractions at the various Disney parks have been updated to include depictions of Disney characters—in a design compatible with the original 1960s design of Mary Blair—alongside the original characters.

==Background==

=== Ride ===
The ride was fabricated at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank as &quot;Children of the World&quot;, and created by WED Enterprises. It was shipped to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, where it was housed at the UNICEF pavilion (sponsored by Pepsi), which featured at its entrance a kinetic sculpture, &quot;The Tower of the Four Winds&quot;, a 120-foot perpetually spinning mobile created by WED designer Rolly Crump. The ride joined three other World&#x27;s Fair attractions—&quot;Magic Skyway&quot; (Ford pavilion), &quot;Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln&quot; (Illinois pavilion), and &quot;The Carousel of Progress&quot; (General Electric pavilion)—that Disney was already involved with. All were intended to be dismantled and rebuilt at Disneyland after the World&#x27;s Fair had closed in 1966.

Mary Blair was responsible for the attraction&#x27;s whimsical design and color styling. The scenes and characters were designed by animator Marc Davis, who also choreographed the audio-animatronic figures&#x27; dances. His wife Alice Davis designed the dolls&#x27; costumes. The costumes were heavily influenced by other countries&#x27; clothing, as Walt Disney had directed Alice Davis to &quot;do whatever it takes to make these look like dolls every woman in the world would want to have&quot;. Crump designed the toys and other supplemental figures on display, as well as the original attraction&#x27;s facade. The animated dolls were designed and sculpted by Blaine Gibson.

Arrow Development was heavily involved in the design of the passenger-carrying boats and propulsion system of the attraction. Two patents that were filed by Arrow Development staff and assigned to The Walt Disney Company illustrate passenger boats and vehicle guidance systems with features very similar to those later utilized on the Disneyland installation of the attraction. The firm is credited with manufacturing the Disneyland installation.

===Song===
&quot;Children of the World&quot; was the working title of the attraction. Its soundtrack, composed by the Sherman Brothers, was originally supposed to feature the national anthems of every country represented throughout the ride; they were all played at once, resulting in cacophony. Walt conducted a walk-through of the attraction scale model with his staff songwriters Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman, saying, &quot;I need &quot;one&quot; song that can be easily translated into many languages and be played as a round.&quot; The Sherman brothers then wrote &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; in the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which influenced the song&#x27;s message of peace and brotherhood. When they first presented it to Walt, they played it as a slow ballad. Walt requested something more cheerful, so they increased the tempo and sang in counterpoint. Walt was so delighted with the final result that he renamed the attraction &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; after the Sherman Brothers&#x27; song. Recordings of the song were first sold in October 1964.

The Sherman Brothers originally wanted to donate all profits from &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; to UNICEF, but Walt Disney dissuaded them from doing so, telling the brothers that the song would become popular. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote of the song in 1967: &quot;Visitors go away humming it as though they had made it up themselves.&quot; Robert B. Sherman&#x27;s youngest son, Robert J. Sherman, has said that this song is the single most-performed and most-translated piece of music ever produced. In 2014, it was estimated that the song had played nearly 50 million times worldwide on the attractions alone, beating the radio and TV estimates for &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot;, which were believed to have been played at least eight and seven million times, respectively. On average, the song is played 1,200 times during a 16-hour operating day.

A third verse celebrating the attraction&#x27;s 45th anniversary was written and popularized, but not incorporated into the ride. In 2022, a 1964 recording of &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; performed by the Disneyland Boys Choir was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Shortly before his death, Richard Sherman composed a new verse to It&#x27;s a Small World. On November 27, 2024, Disney premiered it in a short film on ABC. On February 12, 2025, it was announced that the new verse would be added to the Disneyland version of the attraction starting on July 17, 2025, as part of Disneyland&#x27;s 70th anniversary celebration.

==World&#x27;s Fair==
The first incarnation of It&#x27;s a Small World—which debuted at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York, U.S.—was a last-minute addition. It was only announced in August 1963, eight months before the fair was to open. The Ford Motor Company and General Electric had engaged Disney early on to create their pavilions for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. WED Enterprises had already been at work developing a crude audio-animatronic fashioned as Abraham Lincoln when the state of Illinois approached Disney to create the Illinois Pavilion. Afterward, Pepsi approached Disney with a plan for a tribute to UNICEF, the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund. Walt Disney Productions agreed to construct, maintain, and operate a boat ride for Pepsi-Cola, which was called &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World – A Tribute to UNICEF&quot;. Pepsi also gave UNICEF $100,000 for the construction of an exhibit next to the ride, as well as $200,000 in bonds. 
Disney seemed to be the showman to give us the package we want ... He&#x27;s terrific. He&#x27;s got his hands in more bowls than anyone I&#x27;ve ever seen, but he accomplishes what he sets out to do. — J. G. Mullaly, Ford&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair program manager

=== Operations ===
The World&#x27;s Fair opened on April 22, 1964, and UN Secretary General U Thant dedicated It&#x27;s a Small World three days later, on April 25. Tickets cost 60 cents for children and 95 cents for adults, and proceeds from ticket sales were donated to UNICEF. Despite the admission fee, it was still one of the fair&#x27;s most popular exhibits, with 35,000 to 40,000 daily riders on average. The attraction saw nearly five million visitors during the first year alone. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;wondrous boat ride&quot; was worth riding multiple times, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; called the attraction &quot;one of the greatest contributions to world peace ever shown anywhere&quot;. The World&#x27;s Fair version of the ride was also featured in the TV show &quot;Disney Goes to the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

The fair did not operate between October 18, 1964, and April 21, 1965. Between the fair&#x27;s two seasons, the figures were refurbished at Disney&#x27;s studios in Hollywood. The ride remained otherwise unchanged, although the queue line was modified to increase visitor flow. To accommodate the high ridership, the ride was operating 15 hours a day by mid-1965; the attraction had recorded 10.3 million total visitors by the end of the second year. After the fair ended on October 17, 1965, the Walt Disney Company planned to send the ride to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, U.S. Its high hourly capacity influenced future attractions; Pirates of the Caribbean had been under construction at Disneyland as a subterranean walk-through, but that design was changed to a boat ride.

=== Description ===
The ride was located on one of the largest sites in the fairground&#x27;s industrial zone. The &quot;1965 Official Guide Book to the New York World&#x27;s Fair&quot; described the ride as &quot;a salute to the children of the world&quot;. As planned, the ride was nine minutes long and could accommodate 54,000 visitors an hour. Outside was Rolly Crump&#x27;s 12-story &quot;Tower of the Four Winds&quot;, an openwork structure made of aluminum. The tower was a large sculpture measuring tall, with depictions of animals that blew around in the wind. Next to the ride was a store for UNICEF, and there were also UNICEF exhibits that were managed by Disneyland staff.

Entertainers dressed as the Seven Dwarfs roamed around the attraction&#x27;s queue line, mingling with riders. Silent jets propelled the boats through a winding track. The boat ride depicted faraway locations where people could buy Pepsi-Cola, as well as fanciful depictions of landmarks such as the Tower of Pisa, Taj Mahal, and Eiffel Tower. Throughout the ride were audio-animatronic dolls of singing children from around the world, placed on both sides of the ride. There were 350 figures that sang the &quot;it&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; song in various languages. Each of the figures was intended to be in constant motions; some figures sang, while others danced or played instruments. Each section of the ride included figures from a different nationality, except at the end of the ride, where figures from every nationality sang side-by-side.

== Disneyland ==

In February 1966, Walt Disney announced that It&#x27;s a Small World would be reinstalled at Disneyland as part of a $23 million expansion of that theme park. The ride was installed at the northern end of Fantasyland, opening on May 30, 1966. One critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said the ride &quot;captures the essence of Walt Disney as it shows the children of the world in joyous abandon&quot;. Within a year, It&#x27;s a Small World was one of the park&#x27;s most popular attractions. In 2014, &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; estimated that the Disneyland installation of It&#x27;s a Small World had carried 290 million riders since its opening. The ride&#x27;s popularity has been attributed to its design, the 15-minute ride time, the fact that the queues typically move quickly, and its indoor location.

The ride building occupies a site and is four stories high, covering . The facade was designed by Rolly Crump, who was inspired by Mary Blair&#x27;s styling. On the attraction&#x27;s primary facade, Crump designed a clock with a smiling face, located high. Every 15 minutes, costumed wooden dolls dance out from the base of the clock. When the ride opened, it was accessed by an oval pavilion surrounded by gardens and paths. There were originally 70 ride vehicles. The boats carry voyagers past representations of structures such as mosques, huts, and castles, as well as figures singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; together in their native language.

=== 1966–2008 changes ===
When the ride was moved to Disneyland, the Tower of the Four Winds was scrapped. In addition, representations of children from the Pacific islands and the Arctic were added to the attraction, and the number of figures was expanded to 500. The ride was originally sponsored by Bank of America. It was an E-ticket attraction, which meant that only visitors with an E ticket—the highest tier of Disneyland admission ticket at the time—could ride.

The facade was changed several times, the first major change occurred in 1978 where the clock tower had blue colors. Following the opening of another version of the ride at Disneyland Paris in 1992, the entire facade was given a pastel colored scheme in 1993. In addition, the Bank of America canceled its sponsorship in 1992. The toy company Mattel agreed to sponsor the attraction in late 1991 and built a shop at the ride&#x27;s exit the next year. The guest loading flow on and off the dock was reversed to accommodate the new gift shop&#x27;s location; previously, guests entered the loading area from the western end of the dock, and exited from the eastern end. The ride was also given a modified version of John Debney&#x27;s soundtrack used at Paris. Mattel dropped its sponsorship in 1999 and closed its store at the attraction&#x27;s exit.In 2002, the original 1966 audio was brought back to the ride along with reverting the facade&#x27;s colors back to the classic white, and gold scheme.

=== 2008 refurbishment and aftermath ===

Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; was closed from January to November 2008 (closed and reopening in a holiday version, skipping the summer season) to receive a major refurbishment. The building&#x27;s structure was improved, permanent attachments created for the &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot; overlay, the water flume replaced and its propulsion upgraded to electric water jet turbines, and the attraction&#x27;s aging fiberglass boats redesigned in durable plastic. The refurbishment added 29 new Disney characters, each in their native land in a similar manner to the Hong Kong Disneyland version.&quot;&quot; Osram Sylvania agreed to a twelve-year sponsorship in 2009. The sponsorship was taken over by Sylvania&#x27;s parent firm Siemens AG in 2014, and Siemens discontinued its sponsorship effective October 2017. The ride got another change during It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday in 2022, in which two new dolls in wheelchairs (one in the South America scene and one in the Finale room) were added in the ride. In 2025, Disney announced that a third verse would be added to the soundtrack on the Disneyland version of the ride.

== Magic Kingdom ==

On October 1, 1971, a version of the ride opened within the Fantasyland section of Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, U.S. It was one of Magic Kingdom&#x27;s original rides. This version of the ride included over 600 figures with costumes.

The attraction lacks the elaborate facade present on the Disneyland version of the attraction, and it is also smaller in scale compared to the Disneyland ride. For three decades, the Magic Kingdom version of the attraction underwent relatively few changes. Depictions of Chinese dolls were added in the 1990s, and a set of laughing African children with hyenas were removed in the 1970s.

Kodak sponsored the attraction in the early 1980s. The toy company Mattel agreed to sponsor the attraction in 1991, discontinuing its sponsorship in 1999. The ride was closed in May 2004 for refurbishment, which included a new entrance, a refurbished exterior, and a new sound system inside. After the renovation was completed, the ride reopened in 2005. In 2021, for the park&#x27;s 50th anniversary, its facade was repainted in bright colors. A doll in a wheelchair was added in 2023, and further minor adjustments to the dolls took place in 2024.

== Tokyo Disneyland ==
Another version of It&#x27;s a Small World opened at Tokyo Disneyland in Chiba, Japan, on April 15, 1983. The Tokyo Disneyland version of the attraction is identical in layout to the Magic Kingdom version except for these differences:
* The facade&#x27;s design is an almost-complete replica of the California counterpart under a different color scheme, resembling Disneyland&#x27;s 1990s version.
* The loading area is split into two zones instead of one.
* A Welcome room was added during the 2018 refurbishment, resembling the one at the California version.
* There are scenes featuring various Disney characters redesigned in Mary Blair&#x27;s style that were added during the 2018 refurbishment.
* The Asian room features radically different sets and dolls for Japan and China compared to the Magic Kingdom version. A Mandarin-language track was added to the China section in the 2018 refurbishment.
* The ride uses a different, more recent recording of the song sung in Japanese specifically created for this version instead of the original Japanese recording. The vocal track is used for both the Asian room and finale room.
* The walls of the African, South American, and Oceanian rooms are painted in colors similar to the Magic Kingdom version before its 2005 renovation.
* The Polynesian room has vocals singing in English.
* The Goodbye room resembles the one found at the California version.
* So far, this was the only version of It&#x27;s a Small World that does not feature the wheelchair doll, while the Magic Kingdom version featured a wheelchair doll since 2023.

=== 2018 refurbishment ===
On March 1, 2017, Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; closed down for refurbishment for its first major update since the park&#x27;s opening in 1983. Reopened in April 2018, to coincide with Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s 35th anniversary, the attraction featured 40 characters from Disney properties including &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, and &quot;Moana&quot; similar to its counterparts in California and Hong Kong.

The attraction was initially set to be relocated to another area in Fantasyland with a new facade similar to the California counterpart as part of original expansion plans announced in October 2014 for the resort within the next ten years, before being revised and updated. The transformed version of the attraction soft-opened on April 15, 2018, revealing an updated color scheme for the facade, a new tick-tock sound and parade music (similar to the ones used in Hong Kong and Anaheim), an entirely reconstructed loading area dubbed &quot;Small World Station,&quot; a new Welcome room, an extended Goodbye room, rebuilt set pieces, and music tracks new to the ride including a Mandarin language track added to the China scene formerly exclusive to the Hong Kong version along with the aforementioned Disney characters.

=== &quot;it&#x27;s a small world with Groot&quot; overlay ===
On March 27, 2024, Tokyo Disneyland announced that &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; would receive a Marvel-themed overlay, called &quot;it&#x27;s a small world with Groot&quot;, closing on September 17, 2024 for installation. The park did not specify when the overlay would end, but it indicated that the ride would reopen in 2025. It was announced that the opening date of the overlay occurred from January 15 to June 30, 2025.

== Disneyland Paris ==
A fourth version of It&#x27;s a Small World opened at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France, on April 12, 1992. France Telecom was the original sponsor of the Disneyland Paris version of the ride.

The attraction at Disneyland Paris is a departure from other versions of the attraction. The facade features rearranged and slightly redesigned landmarks with a completely different clock tower. The exterior clock face features a wide-awake sun on its left half and a sleeping moon on its right half. Unlike all other versions of the ride, every scene is housed in one room with arches being used to define sections of the ride. The scenery design is a complete departure from Mary Blair&#x27;s distinctive style, though the dolls used remain identical to all other versions. The ride also uses a completely different soundtrack composed by John Debney. This is the first version of the ride to incorporate a vibrant European room with dolls singing in French and German, a distinct Middle Eastern section with dolls singing in Arabic and Hebrew and a scene for North America with dolls representing Canada and the United States. In the Finale room, in addition to the song being sung in English, it is also sung in French. Also, the attraction had a post-show area called World Chorus that was sponsored by Orange S.A., which opened with the park in 1992 and then closed in 2010 to make way for the Princess Pavilion meet and greet area.

=== 2015 refurbishment ===
As part of an ongoing plan to refurbish several attractions for the park&#x27;s 25th anniversary, this version was refurbished for six months, reopening on December 19, 2015. The refurbishment included a different color scheme for the facade that is identical to the color scheme when it first opened, restored assets and special effects, refurbished boats, new LED lighting to replace the old stage lighting, and all 176 dolls in the ride being progressively replaced through 2017. The entrance and exit rooms have been completely revamped, being identical to the entrance scene in Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s version and the exit scene in the Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland versions (rendered in the Mary Blair style similar to the other parks). The soundtrack has been completely remastered with the base instrumental removed from the majority of the ride&#x27;s audio except for the finale, making the soundtrack more similar to the original version. Additionally, new audio tracks are added including a new recording of someone yodeling to the tune of the song in the Switzerland scene.

=== 2021–2023 refurbishment ===
Disneyland Paris&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; was scheduled to be closed for extensive refurbishments from November 2021 until May 2023. After an additional nineteenth-month delay and during Disneyland Paris&#x27; 30th anniversary celebration and the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration, the ride was officially reopened on May 5, 2023 and featured 3 new, added, disabled and handicapped, Wheelchair accessible dolls in 3 scenes: a German doll in the Germany scene, an Arabian doll in the Arabia scene and another German doll in the Finale scene.

== Hong Kong Disneyland ==

The Hong Kong Disneyland version of the attraction on Lantau Island, Hong Kong, opened on April 28, 2008. It is located in the Fantasyland section of the park. Hong Kong Disneyland marketed the ride using a Cantonese version of the song &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (After All)&quot; by James Wong Jim. The ride is mostly modeled after the original Disneyland counterpart in that the boats travel through a canal. Some of this version&#x27;s prominent and unique characteristics include:
* 38 Disney characters (all rendered in the Mary Blair style) added to scenes where their stories originated.
* An expanded Asia sequence with Hong Kong, the Philippines and Korea represented with children singing in Cantonese, Tagalog and Korean, respectively, as well as an extended China scene with represented with children singing in Mandarin
* A distinct Arabian room, and scenes for North America, similar to the Paris version
* Extraordinary fiber-optic lighting effects in the Finale room not seen on any other Disney attraction
* Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin, and Tagalog versions of the song that were specifically recorded for Hong Kong Disneyland. The finale is sung in three languages: Cantonese, English and Mandarin.
* In Spring 2024, two new dolls in wheelchairs (a Mexican doll in the South America scene and a Swedish doll in the Finale room) were added in the ride, similar to the Disneyland, Magic Kingdom and Disneyland Paris versions.

==Holiday overlay==
Starting in 1997, Disneyland has featured &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot; during the end-of-the-year Christmas and holiday season. The Disneyland version of the ride has been redecorated nearly every year since then. The attraction is closed in late October to receive temporary holiday decorations inside and outside and reopens in early November before the start of the busy holiday tourist season. After the holiday season, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot; stays open until late January where it closes to remove the holiday overlay and return to classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; in early February. Almost one million lights are included during the holidays. In &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot;, the main theme song is not played in full; instead, the children sing &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and a bridge of &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; in addition to the main theme. In addition, the ride has decorations and symbols that are based on the holidays celebrated in different parts of the world. A projection show introduced in 2005 plays every 30 minutes across the facade while playing a techno version of the Nutcracker suite.

In 2003, Tokyo Disneyland introduced a version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot; called &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Very Merry Holidays&quot;. Although having lights on the clock tower, the rest of the facade was covered in giant snowflakes. The inside of the attraction also had a modified soundtrack, the Asia room, and finale used Japanese vocals replacing the English dub used at Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. The 2011 season was skipped due to damaged props from the earthquake that same year. The Holiday overlay was removed in 2015 due to Haunted Mansion Holiday Nightmare having higher demand, and the two attractions being to close to each other.

Disneyland Paris introduced a Holiday overlay in 1999. The first iteration of the overlay though was poorly made. The ride used an incomplete soundtrack mixed in with the ride&#x27;s regular audio. The first iteration was removed in 2006. For the 2009 winter season, the overlay returned, and it received an official name of &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Celebration&quot;. The ride received an overhaul including, new lighting, Holiday decorations throughout the inside, and the entire attraction now used the full &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday&quot; soundtrack. The clock tower was also given a Santa Hat worn until a refurbishment in 2015. Following that renovation, &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Celebration&quot; was planned to use an updated soundtrack originally set for winter 2016. It was delayed for unknown reasons. &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Celebration&quot; returned for the 2017–2018 holiday season, featuring an updated soundtrack. Since then, it has not returned.

Hong Kong Disneyland implemented its own version called &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World Christmas&quot; that highlights the Disney character scenes in Christmas fashion with an appearance of Santa Claus in the Arctic scene. Despite being heavily decorated on the outside with clock tower dolls displayed in Holiday attire, the ride was barely decorated on the inside. The audio also was a mix between the regular, and Holiday soundtrack that would transition at points. Hong Kong&#x27;s overlay lasted only one season possibly due to poor feedback.

== &quot;The Magic, the Memories, and You&quot; ==

As part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Let the Memories Begin&quot; campaign for 2011, a nighttime projection show premiered at the Disneyland version of It&#x27;s a Small World on January 27, 2011. &quot;The Magic, the Memories, and You&quot; show projected sequences of Disney attractions and characters set to Disney music onto the exterior facade of It&#x27;s a Small World to fill its architectural features, personalized with exclusive photographs and videos of park guests taken that day by Disney&#x27;s PhotoPass cast members. The show also existed in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom, but was projected onto Cinderella Castle. As the Let the Memories Begin campaign drew to a close, the show ended its run on Labor Day, September 3, 2012, at both locations. The Florida version was eventually replaced by &quot;Celebrate the Magic&quot; in fall 2012 and later by &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in 2016.

&quot;The Magic, The Memories, and You&quot; theme song was later used for &quot;Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland&quot; as part of the Tokyo Disney Resort 35th Anniversary celebration that premiered at Tokyo Disneyland on July 10, 2018.

==Accidents==

* On August 18, 1994, a 6-year-old girl from Miami fell out of one of the ride&#x27;s boats in the Magic Kingdom version while it was in the loading area. Orange County authorities believe an incoming boat then struck her after the fall. The girl suffered a broken hip, a broken arm, and a collapsed lung. Paramedics took her to a hospital and she was able to recover fully from her injuries. The ride was closed for an inspection and reopened the following day.
* On October 6, 2010, a Disneyland Paris staff member died when the ride restarted unexpectedly while he was working on it. According to police, the 53-year-old man was cleaning the amusement park ride due to an earlier incident with a child guest. The unnamed man, a sub-contractor of the park, was reportedly trapped beneath a boat on the ride when it started up by accident. He was severely injured and transported by helicopter to a nearby hospital where he later died of his injuries.
* On February 28, 2015 during a renovation at the Disneyland version, a fire broke out on the left side of the ride&#x27;s facade. The fire was sparked from a firework malfunction which burnt a small portion of the facade, a tree, and a construction tarp. There were no injuries, and the main show building was untouched.

== Other incidents and controversies ==
* During It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday in Disneyland on November 27, 2009, the ride broke down while a guest with quadriplegia was on the ride. The guest was stuck in the ride&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Room&quot;, the final setting of It&#x27;s a Small World Holiday, for 30–40 minutes before being evacuated. As he suffered from medical conditions that were aggravated by the &quot;blaring Christmas carols&quot; and was unable to exit the ride, the guest sued Disney for its inadequate evacuation procedures for disabled guests, and for not providing proper warnings for those who could not evacuate during a ride stoppage. On March 26, 2013, a jury awarded the man $8,000.
* On in the Magic Kingdom version, a 22-year-old woman lost consciousness after riding the attraction and later died. The woman had a pre-existing condition.
* On November 26, 2023 in the Disneyland version during holiday, a 26-year-old man exited a boat, removed several pieces of his clothing, walked over several props and entered the flume, resulting in a ride stoppage. The man eventually wandered to one of the outside entrances in which he was seen fully nude. The guest was arrested and removed by the Anaheim Police Department.

<doc id="438350" wikidata="Q732188" url="?curid=438350" title="Napoleon B. Broward">
<text>Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (April 19, 1857 – October 1, 1910) was an American river pilot, captain, and politician. He was elected as the 19th governor of the U.S. state of Florida, serving from January 3, 1905, to January 5, 1909. He was most widely known for his major project to drain the Everglades, to recover land for agricultural cultivation. As governor, he built alliances with the federal government to gain funds for this project. In 1915, the newly formed Broward County was named in his honor.

Broward previously served as the sheriff of Duval County, Florida and in the Florida House of Representatives. He was allied with the Straightouts, Populist-leaning elements of the Democratic Party in the state.

==Early life and education==
His childhood was spent on a series of family plantations along the St. Johns River in Jacksonville. During the Civil War, the Broward family plantation was burned by Union troops occupying the town, and the Broward family&#x27;s slaves were freed. After the war, the Browards struggled to recover.

Broward&#x27;s parents both died when he was still quite young. Broward, along with his brother, tended the family farm for a few years before moving into the city with their uncle.

Broward first worked on the river with this uncle, Joe Parsons, doing odd jobs on his steamboat during the summer. In 1876, having graduated high school, Broward became a ship&#x27;s mate and traveled to New England. He stayed in that region for two years, working on ships along the New England coast and coming home a stout young man, standing six foot two and weighing over two hundred pounds.

After gaining experience in the north as a ship&#x27;s mate, in 1878 Broward returned to Jacksonville and took a job working tugboats on the St. Johns River. He became acquainted with many of the captains and shipping operations.

Broward married his captain&#x27;s daughter (Georgiana Carolina &quot;Carrie&quot; Kemp) in January 1883. That spring, he applied for a license to pilot ships over the St. Johns Bar, a constantly shifting sandbar that stretched across the mouth of the St. Johns, sometimes above water and sometimes many feet below. Piloting ships over the treacherous bar was quite lucrative.

Broward seemed destined for a life of comfort until his wife died a day after giving birth to his son in late October 1883. The son, also named Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, would only live for six weeks.

By 1885, he was back on the St. Johns, piloting his father-in-law&#x27;s steamboat &quot;Kate Spencer.&quot; While working on the ship, he met the young daughter of a fellow boat captain, Annie Isabell Douglass, a frequent passenger and the two were married in 1887. The couple ended up having eight daughters and one son:

*Annie Dorcas Broward Starrett (1889–1923)
*Josephine Broward Beckley (1892–1970)
*Enid Lyle Broward Hardee (1894–1943)
*Elsie Hortense Broward Dumas (1896–1948)
*Ella Jeanette Broward Shevlin (1899–1961)
*Agnes Carolyn Broward Craig (1901–1995)
*Florida Douglass Broward Segrest (1904–1988)
*Elizabeth Hutchison Broward Crawford (1906–1992)
*Napoleon Bonaparte Broward III (1910–1989)

==Political beginnings==
Broward established his reputation as a good pilot and captain. In January 1888, a major prison break disgraced the city&#x27;s sheriff, who was subsequently removed from office. The county Democratic leadership convened and nominated Broward as the best man to become the new sheriff. The governor appointed him to the post on February 27. In less than a month, Broward gained statewide notoriety for breaking up gambling operations in the city.

Broward soon took an active part in city politics. In the early 1890s, the Democratic Party in Florida was undergoing some internal strife. Two factions developed in Jacksonville that eventually became the major statewide camps, the Antis and the Straightouts. The Antis were conservative and pro-business, whereas the Straightouts were allied with Populists and agrarians. Broward joined the Straightout camp. In this period, Populists, sometimes in biracial alliances with Republicans, won numerous states in the South. The Democratic Party struggled to regain power in state legislatures.

In the election of 1892, the Straightouts, under Broward&#x27;s leadership, swept the city offices: Broward&#x27;s close friends, John N.C. Stockton and John M. Barrs, became city attorney and councilman, respectively, while Broward retained the sheriff&#x27;s office. (He was an indicted felon when elected.) The Antis continued to struggle for power and two years later, the split between the two camps became even more severe. The Antis the Straightouts accused each other of voter fraud, complaining to the secretary of state and the governor. Anti sympathizers held most of the state offices, and the Antis won out. Broward was replaced by a new appointee when the Antis regained power in the city.

==Cuban involvement==
In 1895, Broward, his brother, and an associate began building a new steamboat, &quot;The Three Friends&quot;. Located on Fort George Island, the proprietors of the boat-building company were John Joseph Daly and Charles Scammell. During the construction, Cuban insurgents began fighting for independence from Spain. Broward was approached by a prominent member of Jacksonville&#x27;s Cuban community about shipping a load of munitions and some Cuban expatriates from Nassau to Cuba. Broward agreed, and in January 1896, &quot;The Three Friends&quot; shipped out of Jacksonville on her maiden voyage, bound for Cuba.

Broward continued this military filibustering operation until President William McKinley declared war on Spain. Several times Broward was nearly caught and destroyed by Spanish gunboats. Aware of Broward&#x27;s identity, the Spanish ambassador to the United States demanded that the American be stopped and his ship impounded. U.S. authorities tried to catch him, but Broward eluded them by loading &quot;The Three Friends&quot; under cover of darkness in secluded locations, hiding her behind larger ships as she left the St. Johns, and picking up Cubans and munitions from other ships at various points near the mouth of the river. Except when trying to evade capture, Broward never pretended not to be a filibusterer. He gained notoriety around the state for his daring deeds. However, Broward did take precautions against having his cargo intercepted by the Spanish, such as concealing arms and munitions inside shipments of groceries to the island.

==Return to politics==
In 1896, the Straightouts offered to nominate Broward for sheriff, but he was busy with his filibustering operation and declined. In 1900, the war ended and his filibustering days were over.

Broward accepted the Democratic nomination for the State House and was elected almost without opposition. In the House, Broward supported many progressive initiatives, including a state dispensary bill and a law allowing insanity as grounds for divorce (at the request of powerful developer Henry Flagler). The most important law he supported was the Primary Election Law.

Broward had long supported a primary election system to replace the state&#x27;s convention system, which was controlled by a small clique headed by Flagler. A strong law was drawn up in the House, which Broward enthusiastically supported, but after the Senate weakened the bill substantially, he withdrew his support. The bill passed anyway.

Broward was not naïve when it came to politics. As a Straightout and a supporter of the &quot;common man,&quot; Broward naturally opposed Flagler&#x27;s control of the party nominating system in the state. It tended to produce Democratic candidates from the Anti faction. As Florida had disfranchised most blacks and was essentially a one-party state, Anti control of the party nominating system effectively meant Anti control of the state government. Broward was smart enough to sponsor Flagler&#x27;s requested divorce bill, but still wanted to wrest power from the big man.

==Campaign for governor==
Broward did not run for the House again in 1902 because he was busy with a salvage operation in the Keys. During the summer of 1903, he decided to run for the governorship, as he had been approached numerous times during the spring and the summer about running for the office. As the party was hard pressed to find another liberal candidate, he agreed to run for office.

Broward was never wealthy, and in fact, frequently found himself in debt for one reason or another. The liberal forces in the state did not have great financial backing, while the conservative forces controlled most of the money and most of the newspapers in the state, as well as the major cities.

Broward said of his chances,
&quot;I don&#x27;t intend to go after the cities. Their newspapers are against me and they don&#x27;t take me seriously. But I&#x27;m going to stump every crossroads village between Fernandina and Pensacola and talk to the farmers and the crackers and show them their top ends were meant to be used for something better than hatracks. I&#x27;m going to make &#x27;em sit up and think. They won&#x27;t mind mistakes in grammar if they find I&#x27;m talking horse sense.&quot;

Broward began campaigning immediately. His strongest opponent was Robert W. Davis, the railroad (and hence Flagler) candidate, while the two other candidates presented smaller threats. Broward hit Davis early and throughout the election for being a railroad man. Davis and the city newspapers generally derided Broward as an idiot as well as a liberal whose time had passed.

The greatest issue in the campaign was Everglades drainage, a program first examined by the sitting governor, William S. Jennings. Broward came out strongly in favor of drainage, calling the ground &quot;the fabulous muck.&quot; While campaigning, he carried an elevation map of the various parts of the Everglades. If Broward found that he was losing an argument over drainage, he would point to his map and say, &quot;Water will run downhill!&quot;

Davis and Broward easily moved ahead into the second primary, and the campaign grew fiercer, with Davis at one point saying, &quot;Mr. Broward is a man of but little ability and no intellectual brilliance whatever!&quot; Broward used Davis&#x27;s congressional record to repeatedly attack his voting in support of his railroad ties. Broward appealed to few urban voters and no business interests, while Davis could not win support among farmers or rural voters. On election day, Broward&#x27;s rural voters gave him the primary victory by only 600 votes out of 45,000. The general election some weeks later was uneventful, and Broward was inaugurated on January 3, 1905.

==Governorship==
Broward&#x27;s biggest push as governor was for drainage of the Everglades, then considered useless swamp, as white settlers did not understand its ecology or relation to water table and habitat. Early in his term, Broward was attacked often and by many different people for his drainage program and for the land tax he instituted to pay for it. One newspaper noted, &quot;The treasury will be drained before the Everglades.&quot; As drainage progressed, Broward began taking his fiercest opponents for &quot;ocular displays&quot; in the Glades, showing them the work that had been done and how it was progressing. John Beard, one of Broward&#x27;s most effective opponents, was eventually convinced by one of these trips that the land was fertile and that drainage was working. Broward retaliated against Frank Stoneman, publisher of the predecessor of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; who opposed the drainage, by refusing to certify his election as circuit judge.

Broward gained national prominence through this massive program. As his administration progressed, Broward became more involved with legislators and officials in Washington, gaining federal funds for the drainage project. Eventually, he brought President Teddy Roosevelt down to the Glades for a trip through the drainage areas. Roosevelt was an avid supporter of drainage and became an important advocate for the program.

Broward tackled other problems, as well – he worked to emphasize education and upgrade the state universities. His appointees assessed them as not offering much beyond the high-school level. He also helped guide a reorganization bill through the legislature that closed some of the schools and set up a commission to determine where the remaining schools should be located. A fight ensued about where to locate the major state university, which at the time was in Lake City. The Control Board (consisting of Broward and the cabinet) eventually selected Gainesville as the new site for the flagship state university. Residents in both cities complained that the commission members had been bought off.

Broward introduced a bill to the legislature in 1905 directing the state to provide life insurance for its citizens, and setting up an Insurance Commission and a cabinet-level post to go along with the program. The legislature voted the bill down with little debate. Broward supported measures to create a state textbook commission, reform the state hospital system, regulate the accounting profession, and make the state&#x27;s Railroad Commission permanent.

In December 1907, U.S. Senator Stephen R. Mallory, Jr. died suddenly and Broward appointed William James Bryan, Mallory&#x27;s campaign manager and already a candidate for the seat, to fill the vacancy. Newspapers criticized his selection of Bryan, who was only 31 at the time. The &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;If Mr. Bryan has given any symptoms of being worthy of this distinction then we are utterly at a loss to know it; it must be a weighty secret hidden in the governor&#x27;s brain.&quot;

==After the governorship==
In February 1908, Senator Bryan contracted typhoid fever and died in March, shocking the state. Broward appointed William Hall Milton to the post. Milton pledged not to run for the seat in November, but Broward soon announced that he was a candidate, an arrangement that was much-criticized, but took to the stump against his opponents, among them were his old adversary John Beard, along with a former political ally, Jacksonville mayor Duncan U. Fletcher. Beard and Fletcher attacked Broward throughout the campaign, but the former governor prevailed in the first primary, and entered the second primary campaign against Fletcher.

Broward&#x27;s friend John Stockton advanced to the second primary in the governor&#x27;s race, against General Albert Gilchrist of Fort Myers. Fletcher was an old liberal, and though now more conservative than Broward, the two men still agreed on many things. Gilchrist was much feared as a railroad man. Broward campaigned as much for Stockton for governor as he did for himself.

Broward and Stockton both lost. Newspapers statewide loudly proclaimed the end of the Broward era, and the Everglades drainage project seemed doomed, but Broward was not through. The 1908 Democratic National Convention was to be held shortly in Denver, and Broward planned to attend. For months, Broward was mentioned in newspapers throughout the South as a potential candidate for the vice presidency, and he was nationally known for his drainage work and for his earlier filibustering. Upon arrival in Denver, he was greeted by banners reading: &quot;Bryan, Broward, and Bread.&quot; An editorial in the &quot;Denver Post&quot; spoke very favorably of him, concluding that he was an excellent choice for the position. Presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan telegraphed from his home, that he wanted a Midwesterner, rather than a Southerner. Although the crowd at the convention continued to back Broward, Bryan was able to name his own candidate.

The 1908 election results were not all bad for Broward. Fletcher as senator was still a mild progressive and maintained his long friendship with Broward. Gilchrist proved to be much more liberal in the role of governor and became an avid supporter of draining the Everglades.

In 1910, James Taliaferro&#x27;s Senate seat was up for election. Big-city newspapers endorsed Taliaferro for re-election, but Broward soon entered the race against him. The race, expected to be an exciting showdown, proved to be such a bore that election news was pushed off the front page by coverage of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Broward and Taliaferro entered the second primary after a quiet election.

The second primary campaign proved scarcely more interesting, though Broward took to the stump, traveling throughout the state. After an exciting election-eve rally at which Broward&#x27;s supporters got so carried away that Taliaferro left in disgust, Broward pulled out a victory.

Exhausted by the campaign, Broward retired with his family to his home on Fort George Island near Jacksonville. Late in September, Broward fell ill with gallstones, which had been a concern for some months, though Broward had been too busy for surgery. He was in the hospital for a few days, and died just before he was to enter surgery. He was buried on October 4.

The &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; wrote,
The main aspect of his legacy was the draining of the Everglades, now recognized as perhaps the biggest environmental folly in American history. Broward&#x27;s supporters however believe these efforts were integral to establishing the Florida citrus industry as an international powerhouse.

==Views on race==
Called &quot;An arms smuggler as well as a racist,&quot; in 1907 Broward proposed that every black person be physically evicted from the state.&quot; According to the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, Broward was &quot;an unapologetic segregationist.&quot;

In September, 2017, a Broward County lawyer, Bill Gelin, published an excerpt of a forgotten document that Broward wrote during his term and may have delivered as a speech. He called upon Congress &quot;to purchase territory, either domestic or foreign, and provide means to purchase the property of the negroes at a reasonable price and to transport them to the territory purchased by the United States,&quot; similar to the goals of the American Colonization Society. Whites would not be allowed to live in the new nation, and blacks would not be allowed to return to live in the United States. &quot;The white people have no time to make excuses for the shortcomings of the negro,&quot; he said. &quot;And the negro has less inclination to work for one and be directed by one he considers exacting, to the extent that he must do a good day&#x27;s work or pay for the bill of goods sold to him.&quot;

These remarks prompted a series of voices to call for removal of the statue of Broward from the Broward County Courthouse. County Mayor Barbara Sharief said she &quot;would be open to discussion about renaming the county if it&#x27;s what people want to do,&quot; although she said shortly afterward that &quot;we&#x27;re not considering that at this time&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t even want to go down that road.&quot;

The statue was removed during the night of October 18–19, 2017, and placed in storage.

==Archives==
The George A. Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida, Gainesville, has a collection of Broward archival records, described as &quot;The Broward Papers date from 1879 to 1918, but the bulk of the papers coincide with the gubernatorial term from 1905 to 1909. The major subject covered in the collection is the drainage of the Everglades and the development of South Florida lands. Additional topics include real estate, race relations, education, labor unions, liquor, taxes, transportation, waterways, railways, and Broward&#x27;s campaigns for governor and the U.S. Senate. The collection comprises incoming and outgoing correspondence, speeches, news clippings, campaign material, photographs (including images of dredging operations), legislative material, and legal documents. There are a small number of articles, pamphlets, circulars, and other publications pertaining to the drainage of the Everglades, dredging equipment, forestry, sugar, and waterways. In addition to the incoming and outgoing correspondence, there are four bound letterbooks containing letters written by Broward in 1905-1909. Correspondents include numerous real estate developers, business leaders, representatives of state and federal agencies, and Florida politicians such as William Sherman Jennings.&quot;

<text>Big Deal on Madonna Street (; released as Persons Unknown in the UK) is a 1958 Italian comedy caper film directed by Mario Monicelli. Regarded as one of the masterpieces of Italian cinema, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.

The plot revolves around a group of small-time thieves attempting to burgle a pawn shop in Rome, resulting in a series of comedic mishaps. The main characters, portrayed by Vittorio Gassman, Renato Salvatori, Carlo Pisacane, Tiberio Murgia, and Marcello Mastroianni, collectively navigate the pitfalls of their ill-fated heist. The film contributed significantly to the careers of Gassman and Mastroianni, with the former breaking into comedic roles previously considered unsuitable for him.

Claudia Cardinale makes a minor appearance in the film, playing a chaste Sicilian girl constrained by her overbearing brother, portrayed by Murgia. Cardinale achieved fame for her subsequent work. The film&#x27;s breezy jazz score by composer Piero Umiliani contributed to the development of the jazz soundtracks characteristic of European films in the 1960s and 1970s.

Initially doubtful about the film&#x27;s potential success, the producers strategically featured the comedian Totò on the original poster to generate audience intrigue. Despite being cast for comic relief, Totò&#x27;s character opts to serve as a consultant to the heist gang instead of directly joining them.

In 2008, &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; was included in the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage&#x27;s list of 100 Italian films to be saved, acknowledging its impact on the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.

== Title ==

The film&#x27;s original Italian title literally translates as &quot;the usual unknown ones,&quot; which is roughly equivalent to the English phrase &quot;the usual suspects.&quot; The name of the Roman street in the English title is a slight mistranslation, as the Italian name of the fictional Roman street where the midnight burglary in the film takes place is the &quot;Via delle Madonne&quot; (&quot;The Street of the Madonnas&quot;) rather than &quot;Madonna Street.&quot; Compounding the confusion is the fact that the real Roman street on which the scene was filmed is the &quot;Via delle tre cannelle&quot; (&quot;The Street of the Three Spouts&quot;), rather than the &quot;Via delle tre Madonne&quot; (&quot;The Street of the Three Madonnas&quot;).

==Plot==
A hapless small-time Roman crook, Cosimo, is arrested for a bungled car theft and sentenced to a few months in prison. He harangues his girlfriend and lawyer to get him released so he can carry out a heist idea stolen from another inmate, a dishonest bricklayer who purposely constructed a flimsy wall between a pawn shop safe and an adjacent vacant apartment. Ultimately, Cosimo&#x27;s gang bribes Peppe, a boxer with a clean criminal record, to confess. The warden does not believe Peppe; however, he ends up in jail alongside Cosimo. Peppe tells Cosimo that he has been sentenced to three long years for this minor offense. Cosimo, to justify his actions, explains the details of the pawn shop heist to Peppe. Peppe then gleefully reveals that he was only given a year&#x27;s probation and walks out of the prison gate, infuriating Cosimo.

Peppe takes up the heist plan with Cosimo&#x27;s gang: Mario, a petty thief and the youngest member of the group; Michele, a posturing Sicilian crook who needs money for his sheltered sister&#x27;s dowry; Tiberio, a down and out photographer caring for his baby while his wife is in jail on a minor offense; and Capannelle, an elderly pickpocket. Tiberio steals a movie camera from a flea market and attempts to film the pawn shop safe&#x27;s combination with a telephoto lens, but without success. Since none involved have the skill to crack the safe, they enlist the help of genteel local safe cracker Dante, who is careful not to violate his parole but supplies tools and gives them a brief primer.

The gang soon discovers the vacant apartment is occupied by two spinsters and their young maid, Nicoletta. Ladies&#x27; man Peppe learns from Nicoletta that the two older women leave the apartment overnight once a week. Peppe earns the offer of a tryst with the maid the next time the ladies leave. The rest of the group pressures him to accept so they can stage the burglary, but Nicoletta unexpectedly quits her job in a huff, and does not know if the spinsters will make their weekly departure. Meanwhile, Cosimo is released from prison. As the plan&#x27;s mastermind, he had demanded a substantial portion of the loot but was rebuffed. He vows vengeance on the group by robbing the pawn shop with a gun, which the blasé pawnbroker assumes he wants to hock. Deflated, Cosimo leaves, but during a botched purse snatching he is killed by a streetcar.

Mario has fallen for Michele&#x27;s sister, Carmelina, and quits the caper in fear of being caught and embarrassing his mother. He vows to pursue a straight life and court Carmelina. Tiberio deposits his baby with his wife in prison to participate in the robbery, but runs into the flea market proprietor, who breaks his arm for stealing the movie camera. The group&#x27;s fortunes brighten; however, when the apartment&#x27;s elderly occupants make their weekly trip after all. Re-energized, the gang breaks into the apartment. After a couple of misfortunes, they succeed in breaking through a wall that leads to the apartment&#x27;s kitchen; the elderly women had rearranged the furniture, thus disorienting the gang.

Realizing they have little time left until morning, they resignedly gather round the apartment&#x27;s kitchen table and raid the refrigerator. Their repast ends abruptly when ever-starved Capannelle blows up the stove while lighting one of its burners. Thwarted, they all straggle homeward, peeling off one by one for streetcars until only Peppe and Capanelle are left. Peppe then surprises Capannelle by deciding to find legitimate work. A newspaper article later recounts a robbery by unknown persons who apparently broke into an apartment just to steal pasta with chickpeas.

==Production==

According to director Mario Monicelli, while the film was intended as a parody of neorealism, &quot;by then neorealism was already a thing of the past, something that was surpassed. It was more a parody that was aligned with a certain realism around us, with the poverty, and with people who had to do the best they could with whatever means possible to survive, with petty crimes.&quot;

Asked if it was also a parody of Jules Dassin&#x27;s film &quot;Rififi&quot;, Monicelli said: &quot;Yes because we saw this as a film shot in a very harsh, realist style. Very scientific, as the Peppe character continually says. So we wanted to do the same thing, but the characters didn&#x27;t have the means. The way they worked was quite the contrary actually.&quot;

Monicelli and cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo agreed on a photographic tone that was not comedic or brightly lit. &quot;On the contrary,&quot; Monicelli said, &quot;harsh and dramatic, because the film has a dramatic side in that it is about poor people. But Di Venanzo understood the tone. To make people laugh with a story that was dramatic rather than comic. But seen with a comic eye.&quot;

The film was shot in ten weeks on locations throughout Rome. Monicelli said: &quot;The only interior that was shot in a studio was the wall that gets broken into at the end, because I couldn&#x27;t break a wall in an actual apartment! But all the other interiors were shot on location. Which of course was a particular trait of Italian cinema, to shoot on location.&quot;

According to Monicelli, the film adhered to the script, without improvisations.

Dialogue, as was customary in Italian cinema, was all post-dubbed. Monicelli explained: &quot;First of all because in Italy we often shoot with actors who are not professional.&quot; (Carlo Pisacane and Tiberio Murgia were not actors.) &quot;So because they didn&#x27;t know how to recite their lines they had to be dubbed.&quot; Furthermore, some cast members spoke in the wrong dialect. Monicelli continued, &quot;So, for example, [Murgia] who plays the Sicilian was not Sicilian. So I had to have a Sicilian dub his voice. Another one of the actors who was supposed to be Bolognesian (from Bologna) was from Naples, so I had to dub his voice. Cardinale spoke French so I had to dub her voice into Sicilian.&quot;

The apartment and pawnshop on &quot;Via della Madonna&quot; was in reality located at 7–8, Via delle Tre Cannelle (), immediately north of Trajan&#x27;s Market. The building is still standing as of 2019.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for its American release the film was &quot;dubbed into English over a six-month period with considerable money and effort expended in matching voices and intonations to achieve artistic and mechanical perfection.&quot; At the time, there was a general debate over dubbing versus subtitling foreign films, and the American distributor, Richard Davis, screened the first reel of both versions for critics and writers and asked for their preference. They chose subtitles, though the dubbed version did make it to American TV in the early 1960s.

Several critics decried the subtitles. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther called it &quot;an essentially funny picture, artfully and joyously played. It&#x27;s just too bad those incongruous, flat subtitles have to get in the way.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic James Rich liked the film, though he noted &quot;the humor [is] tarnished only when the parade of subtitles makes viewing a sort of exercise in speed reading.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, called it &quot;cleverly directed and acted...but there is one disadvantage for the linguistically limited: they have to wait to read the joke at the bottom of the screen, and by the time they can appreciate its purport the actors have already gone on to the next one.&quot;

Other critics simply praised the film. The critic for the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; called it &quot;one of the most irresistible Italian comedies in years. No one with a sense of humor and an appreciation of humanity should miss it.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Most unusual, however, and ever so clever, are the ways the script progresses to its climactic goof-up.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said: &quot;Director Mario Monicelli has endowed the film with such flashes of brilliance, and the cast...has enacted it with such tasteful understatement, that &quot;The Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; must be listed as one of the funniest comedies of the last ten years.&quot;

Crowther, in a follow-up essay, wrote: &quot;Although the routines have whiskers, so old and used in vaudeville are they, the picture has an ageless zest for laughter.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
The film was a hit in Italy when it was released and won two Italian Nastro d&#x27;Argento awards: Best Leading Actor (Gassman) and Best Screenplay. It also garnered the prestigious Silver Shell for Best Director at the San Sebastián Film Festival in Spain. The film won Best Comedy at the 12th annual Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland. The film was also Italy&#x27;s Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at the 31st Academy Awards. It lost to Jacques Tati&#x27;s &quot;Mon Oncle.&quot;
==Sequels==
A sequel directed by Nanni Loy titled &quot;Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti&quot; (also known as &quot;Fiasco in Milan&quot; or &quot;Hold-up à la Milanaise&quot;) followed in 1959, reuniting the entire main cast, aside from Totò and Mastroianni.

Another sequel was released in 1985, directed by Amanzio Todini and titled &quot;I Soliti ignoti vent&#x27;anni dopo&quot; (known in English-speaking countries as &quot;Big Deal After 20 Years&quot;; it was released by Koch Lorber on DVD in the United States as &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street - 20 Years Later&quot;).

==Remakes==
Two remakes of the film were shot in the United States: the 1984 film &quot;Crackers&quot; by Louis Malle (set in San Francisco) and the 2002 film &quot;Welcome to Collinwood&quot; by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (set in Cleveland).

Bob Fosse created a Broadway musical titled &quot;Big Deal&quot; based on the film. Set in 1930s Chicago with an African-American cast and using popular songs of the era, the show opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 10, 1986, and closed on June 8, 1986, after 69 performances. It received five Tony Award nominations, with Fosse winning for his choreography.

<doc id="438369" wikidata="Q428360" url="?curid=438369" title="Objective Individual Combat Weapon">
<text>The Objective Individual Combat Weapon or OICW was the next-generation service rifle competition that was under development as part of the United States Army OICW program; the program was eventually discontinued without bringing the weapon out of the prototype phase. The acronym OICW is often used to refer to the entire weapons program.

It was started in the aftermath of the Advanced Combat Rifle (or ACR) during the 1980s. Like the ACR program, it has largely been a failure in terms of achieving the specific program goals (e.g., replacing the M16) and has cost millions of dollars, but has resulted in many innovative weapons and weapon concepts as well as offshoot programs of its own.

==Development==

The central idea of the program was to develop a rifle that enabled the attacking of targets behind cover by using airburst munitions. The munitions were to be much smaller than pre-existing grenades and grenade launchers, but large enough to be effective. The idea was refined into a combination of a short assault rifle and semi-automatic, low-velocity cannon firing air-bursting munitions. The OICW aimed to use advances in computer technology in a weapon that fired grenades automatically pre-set to explode above or beside targets hidden from view. Fragmentation from the exploding grenades could hit the target when normal rifle fire could not.

The winners of the first competition for the project during the 1990s were ATK and firearms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch with the XM29 OICW. They went on to build numerous prototypes of the rifle for the United States military in the late 1990s. These projects centered on using a programmable 20 mm airburst munition-firing rifle by itself or with other projectile-based weapons attached. The 20 mm launcher was analyzed in various configurations, including a launcher by itself, with a 5.56 mm weapon (based on the HK G36), or with a MP7 PDW.

By the early 2000s, the weapon had settled on a design and was classified as the XM29. The XM29 was based on the HK CAWS (Close Assault Weapon System) (Cal. 18.5×76mm or 12 Gauge non-conventional). However, the weapon had serious problems: it did not meet weight or cost targets, and the 20 mm High Explosive Air Bursting (HEAB) did not seem to be lethal enough in testing. To compound matters, the kinetic-energy component had to be light and short in length. As a result, the 5.56×45mm NATO barrel had a length of only 250 mm (9.8 inches), which is too short to generate enough muzzle velocity to be effective as a standard infantry rifle. It was also too heavy and too large to be operated effectively by a soldier.

This resulted in the army starting development on new weapons, and finally shelving the XM29 in 2004. The kinetic energy component split off into the XM8 rifle program and the airburst component developed into the XM25 airburst weapon. According to a presentation by Major Kevin Finch, Chief of the Small Arms Division of the Directorate of Combat Developments at the U.S. Army Infantry Center, there were three main parts to the OICW program:

* Increment 1 (OICW 1) was a competition for a whole weapon system family similar to the XM8. The weapon system was to potentially replace the M4 carbine, M16 rifle, M249 light machine gun and some M9 pistols. Other arms companies had contended that the OICW project goals had changed enough to warrant another competition. Potential challengers could include a weapons system based on an updated M16, the Steyr AUG, the FN SCAR, and potentially any other manufacturer that fulfilled the Army requirements for participating. It also listed the shotgun being replaced by a modular shotgun system (XM26 LSS) mounted on the OICW 1 winner. The Increment 1 portion was put on an eight-week hold in July 2005, primarily to take into account input and needs of other services. On October 31, 2005, the OICW I program was cancelled. The reason given for the cancellation was stated as: &quot;This action has been taken in order for the Army to reevaluate its priorities for small caliber weapons, and to incorporate emerging requirements identified during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Government will also incorporate studies looking into current capability gaps during said reevaluation.&quot;
* OICW Increment 2 was a stand-alone airburst weapon the (XM25). This is a standalone launcher that uses bigger 25 mm munition, and was intended to be a special applications and support weapon, not an individual combat weapon as previous models were. In 2005, the weapon underwent limited field trials and combat testing.
* OICW Increment 3 was the XM29. The M203 was listed as being replaced by a combination of Increments 2 and 3. The M249 was also to be partially replaced by a lightweight MG (LMGA, now LSAT), which was listed as being the successor to the M60 and M240.

== Related weapons ==

In the aftermath of the ACR program, the OICW program began. There were two main contenders, one design by AAI and its companies, and the other by ATK (with H&amp;K and other companies); ATK and H&amp;K won.

OICW concepts/prototypes in the 1990s:
* 20 mm smart grenade and 5.56 mm rifle in side by side configuration
* 20 mm smart grenade stand alone unit (XM25)
* 20 mm smart grenade and MP7
* 20 mm smart grenade and 5.56 mm rifle in over-under configuration (XM29 OICW)

Some weapon programs involved with, stemming from, or using technology from the OICW project include:

* XM1018 (25×40mm HEAB Ammunition)
* XM8 rifle (5.56 kinetic energy component)
* M320 (40 mm grenade launcher originally developed for the XM8)
* XM25 (Uses low velocity 25×40mm smart airburst munition, semi-automatic standalone grenade launcher)
* XM109 (Uses high velocity 25×59mm munition, anti-materiel rifle)
* XM307 ACSW (Uses high velocity 25×59mm smart airburst munition, automatic grenade launcher)
** XM312 (.50 BMG version of XM307)
* Mk 47 (Mk 47 Mod 0) (40 mm automatic grenade launcher capable of using smart 40 mm airburst grenades)
* Land Warrior
* XM26 Lightweight Shotgun System (A lightweight 12-gauge bolt-action accessory shotgun)

<text>Richard Stanford Cox (April 19, 1930 – July 8, 1994), known professionally as Dick Sargent, was an American actor. He is best known for being the second actor to portray Darrin Stephens on ABC&#x27;s fantasy sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;. He took the name &quot;Dick Sargent&quot; from a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; illustrator/artist of the same name.

==Early life==
Sargent was born Richard Stanford Cox in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, on April 19, 1930, to Ruth McNaughton and Colonel Elmer Cox. His mother was the daughter of John McNaughton, who founded Los Angeles&#x27;s famed Union Stockyards. She appeared under the stage name of &quot;Ruth Powell&quot;, and had supporting bit roles in such films as &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Hearts and Trumps&quot; with Alla Nazimova. Sargent&#x27;s father Elmer served in World War I and later became a business manager to Hollywood figures, including Douglas Fairbanks and Erich von Stroheim.

Sargent attended the San Rafael Military Academy in San Rafael, California, before majoring in drama at Stanford University. He appeared in two dozen plays with the Stanford Players Theater.

==Career==
Sargent appeared in feature films following his debut in &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; (1954). He appeared in &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot; (1956) starring Fess Parker. In the 1957 movie &quot;Bernardine&quot;, Sargent portrayed Sanford &quot;Fofo&quot; Wilson.

Sargent appeared in the 1959 feature film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; starring Cary Grant, and &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; starring Don Knotts in 1966. He was a regular in three short-lived television comedies, &quot;One Happy Family&quot; in 1961, &quot;Broadside&quot; in 1964, and &quot;The Tammy Grimes Show&quot;, a four-episode ABC flop in 1966. For three seasons, from 1969 to 1972, he played Darrin Stephens — a role he had previously turned down — in &quot;Bewitched&quot;, replacing ailing actor Dick York.

In 1975, Sargent appeared on the television show &quot;Tattletales&quot; with Fannie Flagg.

His later movies included the crime drama &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979) as Jake Van Dorn (George C. Scott)&#x27;s strait-laced brother-in-law, Wes DeJong, and as Dr. Jameson in the sci-fi horror film &quot;&quot; (1979). He also played Sheriff Grady Byrd in two 1979–1980 season episodes of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

Sargent continued to work in film. He played Harry in &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot; (1968) opposite Elvis Presley and Michele Carey, and made guest appearances on television series, including &quot;Navy Log&quot;, &quot;The West Point Story&quot;, &quot;Medic&quot;, &quot;Code 3&quot;, &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Alaskans&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Hazel&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot;, &quot;The Devlin Connection&quot;, &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot;, &quot;The Commish&quot;, &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot; and &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;. In 1990, he also portrayed himself in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;. In the mid-1980s he landed the steady role of Richard Preston, the widowed father, in the TBS sitcom &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. He also appeared in the fantasy comedy &quot;Teen Witch&quot; (1989).

Throughout the 1980s, he joined actress Sally Struthers as an advocate for Christian Children&#x27;s Fund, which brought relief to children in developing nations. Sargent also did charitable work for the Special Olympics, World Hunger, AIDS Project Los Angeles and the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

==Personal life==
On National Coming Out Day in 1991, Sargent publicly declared his homosexuality and his support of gay rights causes. The high rate of suicide among young gay people was the main reason; he jokingly referred to himself as a &quot;retroactive role model&quot;. Sargent recognized that his ill health from prostate cancer may have led people to assume that he suffered from AIDS.

Sargent had a companion, with whom he lived for over 20 years, before the unidentified man died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1979. He later lived with his domestic partner Albert Williams until his death.

In June 1992, Sargent was a Grand Marshal of the Los Angeles Gay Pride parade along with Elizabeth Montgomery.

==Death==
Sargent was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1989. Doctors were initially optimistic that it could be treated. However, the disease continued to spread and, by early 1994, he had become seriously ill. Sargent died from the disease on July 8, 1994, aged 64. His body was cremated.

Former &quot;Bewitched&quot; co-star Elizabeth Montgomery commented, &quot;He was a great friend, and I will miss his love, his sense of humor and his remarkable courage.&quot; Montgomery herself died of colon cancer less than a year later.

<text>U.S. Route 377 (US 377) is a north–south United States highway. Originally formed as a short spur to connect Denton and Fort Worth, Texas, it has since been extended northward into Oklahoma and southward to Del Rio, Texas, near the U.S. border with Mexico.

==Route description==
===Texas===

The southern terminus is in Del Rio, Texas at an intersection with U.S. Route 90. It goes north of town co-signed with U.S. Route 277 for 20 miles (32 km). After splitting off, it enters Edwards County and Carta Valley. It meets SH 55 at the county seat, Rocksprings, before serving as the western terminus of SH 41. About 20 miles north of Rocksprings, the route meets with the headwaters of the South Llano River, which follows the route into Junction, Texas. It heads northeast into Kimble County, crossing the county line near Telegraph. At Junction, it meets both Interstate 10 and US 83. It then continues northeast through London, extreme southeastern Menard County, and Mason County. In Mason County, US 377 passes through Streeter before forming a concurrency with SH 29 near Grit. In Mason, SH 29 splits off to its own alignment while US 377 turns north to join U.S. Route 87.

US 87/377 head north together into Brady, where they meet US 190, the southern terminus of US 283, and SH 71. US 377 splits off to the north and heads to Mercury and crosses the Colorado River near Winchell. In Brownwood, US 377 joins with U.S. Route 67, following its routing all the way to Stephenville, where US 377 splits off on its own again. US 377 then enters Hood County, where it passes through the county seat, Granbury. It cuts the corners of both Johnson County and Parker County before entering Tarrant County and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

US 377 crosses Interstate 20 at exit 429A in Benbrook. It then enters Fort Worth proper, meeting SH 183 and Spur 580. It runs northeast on Camp Bowie Blvd. to Interstate 30, which it begins a concurrency with. At the Interstate 35W junction, it heads north along that highway before splitting off at Exit 52A (Belknap St.). It heads due north at the Denton Highway and continues to run parallel to I-35W through many Fort Worth suburbs, including Haltom City, Watauga, Keller, Westlake, Roanoke, and Argyle. In Denton, it crosses Interstate 35E and has a brief concurrency with US 380 through the eastern portion of Denton into Crossroads.

After splitting from US 380, US 377 runs through Crossroads and north into Krugerville. It continues through Aubrey, through Pilot Point, Tioga, and Collinsville, before having an interchange with US 82 at Whitesboro. It the heads north to cross Lake Texoma (the Red River) into Oklahoma.

===Oklahoma===

US 377 is co-signed with State Highway 99 for its entire Oklahoma length. US 377&#x27;s first junction within Oklahoma is with SH-32 west of Kingston. The first town that US 377/SH-99 pass through is Madill, where the two highways meet US 70 and State Highway 199. The next town after that is Tishomingo, where there is a brief concurrency with SH-22. US 377/SH-99 run north from Tishomingo, having a one-mile (1.6 km) three-route concurrency with SH-7 before meeting State Highway 3 southeast of Ada. US 377/SH-99 run around the east and north sides of town. On the north side of Ada, SH-3E joins the concurrency.

After leaving Ada, US 377/SH-3E/99 pass through Byng. The three highways cross the Canadian River just south of a junction that serves as the eastern terminus of SH-39 and the western terminus of SH-56. North of Bowlegs, SH-59 joins with the other routes briefly. The next major town is Seminole, where the highways meet SH-9, and SH-3E splits off. US 377/SH-99 cross I-40 at Exit 200. The highways have a junction with US 62 in Prague.

As of 2007, the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Stroud, Oklahoma at an indeterminate point somewhere between old Route 66 (now Oklahoma State Highway 66) and modern Interstate 44. SH-99 continues north into Kansas.

==History==
===U.S. 377 in Texas===
When US 377 was commissioned in 1930, US 77 connected Dallas, Texas, with the north and south, but nearby Fort Worth lacked a direct northern connection. US 377 formed a short (less than ) connection between US 77 in Denton and US 81 in Fort Worth. Along with a section of US 81, it provided a parallel north–south route to US 77 between Denton and Hillsboro, where US 81 met US 77. When the Interstate Highway System was built, I-35 included a similar Dallas–Fort Worth split with routes I-35E through Dallas (along US 77) and I-35W through Fort Worth (along to US 377 and US 81).

In 1931, US 377 was extended to southwest from Fort Worth to Stephenville , and in 1951, it was extended south from Stephenville to its current terminus in Del Rio. 

The section of US 377 in Texas north of Denton was signed as SH 10 until 1960 and SH 99 from 1960 until 1968. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, later the American Association of State Highway and Transpiration Officiations, AASHTO), the body which coordinates the numbering of U.S. Highways, approved an extension of US 377 from Denton into Oklahoma in 1968 and signs went up for this section in 1969.

US 377 long remained a two-lane highway between Denton and Fort Worth, but has since been widened with more construction scheduled. North of Denton, US 377 is currently two lanes.

===U.S. 377 in Oklahoma===

US 377 in Oklahoma was predated by Oklahoma State Highway 99, with which it still runs concurrently. The Oklahoma Department of Highways had proposed portions of SH-99 for inclusion in the United States Numbered Highway System several times. One such application made in 1953 suggested that the entirety of SH-99 become a U.S. Route, while another suggested a northern terminus at US 64 near Cleveland. On June 18, 1964, AASHO accepted an extension of US 377 from the Texas state line, but only to US 70 in Madill. This extension was not marked on Oklahoma official state highway maps.

The Department of Highways, and later the Department of Transportation, submitted applications to extend US 377 from Madill to US 64 in Cleveland eight times between December 1964 and 1980, all of which were rejected for unknown reasons. In 1988, ODOT began signing US 377 from Madill to Stroud along SH-99 without AASHTO approval.

The Willis Bridge crossing Lake Texoma on the Red River was constructed in 1960. By the late 2010s, it had guardrail damage causing the remaining bridge to be very narrow and was considered structurally deficient. Parts of the bridge had collapsed. An original estimated start for replacement bridge was February 2018, costing $80 million. In November 2018, the Oklahoma Transportation Commission awarded a $43 million contract to replace the bridge with a new two-lane bridge which started construction in early January 2019. The bridge, funded by both Oklahoma and Texas, was completed in February 2023 after which the old bridge was demolished.

==Future==
The US 377 Cresson Relief Route is a four-lane freeway bypass of Cresson and an at-grade railway crossing that is currently under construction and planned to open in late 2025. The project, originally planned to be opened to traffic in 2022, has faced multiple delays.

==Major intersections==






































===State Highway Loop 118===
State Highway Loop 118 (Loop 118) is a short and unsigned loop highway. The highway connects US 377 to Business State Highway 114 (Bus. SH 114) without the need for an intersection between those highways. The loop is just long, and is located entirely within the downtown portion of the town of Roanoke, Texas. The highway was first designated on February 4, 1941. The original route traveled from US 377 just south of Roanoke, along Oak Street, past Bus. SH 114 northward to SH 114, with State Highway Spur 118 (Spur 118) going from Loop 118 to US 377 via Denton Drive. On September 26, 1996, the stretch of Oak Street traveling from US 377 to Denton Drive was given back to the city of Roanoke.



===State Highway Spur 118===

State Highway Spur 118 (Spur 118) was designated on February 4, 1941, as a spur off Loop 118 in Roanoke to US 377. On September 26, 1996, Spur 118 became a portion of Loop 118 when it was rerouted onto the spur and the former portion of Loop 118 was removed and returned to the city of Roanoke.

<text>USS &quot;Escolar&quot; (SS-294), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the escolar.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Escolar&quot; was laid down by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 18 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Emma Stevens Martin Hudgins, wife of J. Bilisoly Hudgins. She was transferred to the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, after launch and thence to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, prior to her commissioning on 2 June 1944, Commander William J. &quot;Moke&quot; Millican in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Escolar&quot; had her final training for combat at Pearl Harbor, from which she put out for her first war patrol on 18 September 1944. After topping off fuel at Midway Island, she joined and for a coordinated &quot;wolfpack&quot; patrol in the Yellow Sea. Commander William J. Millican led this coordinated attack group, which was designated &quot;Millican&#x27;s Marauders.&quot;

On 30 September, when &quot;Escolar&quot; was estimated to be about north of the Bonin Islands, a listening post received a partial message from her:
&quot;Escolar&quot; was then forced to break off the transmission and the engagement with the gunboat.

No further transmissions were received by bases from &quot;Escolar&quot;, but &quot;Perch&quot; and &quot;Croaker&quot; recorded intra-ship communications with her until 17 October, when &quot;Perch&quot; received a routine message from &quot;Escolar&quot; giving her position and course. She was never heard from again.

Had &quot;Escolar&quot; ended her patrol on the scheduled date, she would have arrived at Midway Island about 13 November 1944. All attempts to contact &quot;Escolar&quot; failed, and she was reported on 27 November 1944 as presumed lost.

Information supplied by the Japanese on anti-submarine attacks gives no clue as to the cause of her loss, but the Yellow Sea area is thought to have been mined. Her course as transmitted to &quot;Perch&quot; does not cross any known Japanese minefields, but positions of mines laid before April 1945 are not precisely known. However, the most likely explanation for her end remains that she detonated a naval mine.

The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Type D Escort Destroyer Number 38 reported having contact with and sinking a US Navy submarine on 19 October 1944 near &quot;Escolar&quot;″s expected position. They &quot;fired about 30 depth charges and then observed a heavy oil slick on the surface and a lot of gear from an enemy submarine floated to the surface.&quot; This could be the fate of &quot;Escolar&quot; as no other US submarines were in the area and no contact was made with &quot;Escolar&quot; after this.

In 1973 a -tall stone memorial was dedicated to &quot;Escolar&quot;. The memorial is in Charlevoix, Michigan, which is just north of Grand Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan.

<text>Things Fall Apart is a 1958 novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. It is Achebe&#x27;s debut novel and was written when he was working at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. The novel was first published in London by Heinemann on 17 June 1958.

The story, which is set in British Nigeria, centers on Okonkwo, a traditional influential leader of the fictional Igbo clan, Umuofia, who opposes colonialism and early Christianity. The novel&#x27;s title was taken from a verse of &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, a 1919 poem by Irish poet W. B. Yeats. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was considered Achebe&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and formed his &quot;African trilogy&quot; with his other novels; &quot;No Longer at Ease&quot; and &quot;Arrow of God&quot;. The novel explores many themes especially culture, masculinity, and colonialism. 

&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is regarded as a milestone in African literature. It gained critical acclaim and popularity upon publication, and has been translated into over fifty languages. It was listed on Time&#x27;s &quot;100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. The novel has been adapted severally including the radio drama, &quot;Okonkwo&quot; (1961), by the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation; 1971 film, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, which starred Princess Elizabeth of Toro.

==Plot==
Okonkwo is a famous man in the village of Umuofia. He is a wrestling champion and leader of a clan. He strives to be the opposite of his father Unoka, who was an indolent debtor unable to support his wife or children, preferring flute-playing over struggling for success. Okonkwo works hard from a young age to build fame and wealth all on his own. Obsessed with manly strength and discipline, he often beats his wives and children.

Okonkwo is selected by the elders to be the guardian of Ikemefuna, a boy who was taken as a peace settlement between Umuofia and another clan after Ikemefuna&#x27;s father killed a woman from Umuofia. The boy looks up to Okonkwo as his second father. The Oracle of Umuofia eventually pronounces that the boy must be killed. Ezeudu, the village elder, warns Okonkwo to stay away from the killing, but he brushes off the warning and carries out the grim task. After killing Ikemefuna, Okonkwo feels haunted by sadness and nightmares. During a gun salute at Ezeudu&#x27;s funeral, Okonkwo&#x27;s gun accidentally explodes and kills Ezeudu&#x27;s son. He and his family are exiled for seven years to his motherland, Mbanta, as required to appease the gods.

While Okonkwo is in Mbanta, he learns that the white men are living in Umuofia with the intent of introducing their religion, Christianity. As the number of converts increases, the foothold of the white people grows and a new government is introduced. The village is forced to accept or oppose the imposition of the white people&#x27;s nascent society. Okonkwo&#x27;s son Nwoye becomes curious about the missionaries, and after he is beaten by his father for the last time, he decides to leave his family to live independently. Nwoye is introduced to the new religion by a missionary, Mr. Brown. In the last year of his exile, Okonkwo instructs his best friend Obierika to sell all of his yams and hire two men to build him two huts so he can have a house to go back to with his family. He also holds a great feast for his mother&#x27;s kinsmen.

Returning from Mbanta, Okonkwo finds his village changed by the presence of the white men. After a convert commits the crime of unmasking an elder as he embodies an ancestral spirit of the clan, the village retaliates by destroying a local Christian church. In response, the District Commissioner representing the colonial government takes Okonkwo and several other native leaders prisoner pending payment of a fine of two hundred bags of cowries. Despite the District Commissioner&#x27;s instructions to treat the leaders of Umuofia with respect, the native &quot;court messengers&quot; humiliate them, shaving their heads and whipping them. Outraged, the people of Umuofia finally gather for an uprising. Okonkwo, being a warrior by nature and adamant about following Umuofian custom and tradition, despises all cowardice and advocates war.

When messengers of the white government try to stop the meeting, Okonkwo beheads one of them. Because the crowd allows the other messengers to escape and does not fight alongside Okonkwo, he realizes with despair that the people of Umuofia will not fight to protect themselves. The result of this is that when the District Commissioner, Gregory Irwin, comes to Okonkwo&#x27;s house to take him to court, he finds that Okonkwo killed himself because he saw he was fighting the battle alone and his tribe had given up. Among his own people, Okonkwo&#x27;s actions have tarnished his reputation and status, as it is strictly against the teachings of the Igbo to commit suicide. Obierika struggles not to break down as he laments Okonkwo&#x27;s death. As Irwin and his men prepare to bury Okonkwo, Irwin muses that Okonkwo&#x27;s death will make an interesting chapter for his written book, &quot;The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger&quot;.

==Background and publication history==

&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was Chinua Achebe&#x27;s first novel. After graduating from the University of Ibadan in 1953, he became a teacher in Oba, Anambra State, before working in the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) the following year. During his stay at NBC, he started writing the manuscript. He wrote in English since he considers the existing standard for written Igbo language as stilted; created by the combination of various dialects, which he revealed in a 1994 interview. In 1957 he removed the second and third parts of the manuscript, leaving only the story of Okonkwo, ultimately the main character of the story. He also restructured it and added new paragraphs and chapters.

After Achebe saw an advertisement in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he sent copies of his handwritten manuscript to a typing agency in London by ordinary mail. After he sent the requested fee of £22 by the agency through the British postal order, he heard nothing from the agency for many months. Towards the end of the year, his colleague, Angela Beattie, who was about to relinquish her post as Head of Talks at NBS, was going to London for her annual leave, Achebe asked her to check the status of his manuscript when she reach London. Following Beattie&#x27;s intervention, the agency retrieved the manuscripts already covered with dust from a corner of the office, and sent only one typed copy to Achebe in Lagos.

Achebe was promoted as the Head of Talks at NBC. He sent his typescript to the literary agent of Gilbert Phelps in 1958. Several publishing houses rejected the typescript, giving the reason that fiction by African writers possessed no financial potential. The typescript was eventually taken to the office of William Heinemann, where it was presented to James Michie and through him, came to the attention of Alan Hill, a publishing advisor. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was published in hardback on 17 June 1958 with around 2000 print copies. Although the publishers didn&#x27;t re-edit or copyedit the manuscript, it achieved instant acclaim in the British national press. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; said that the novel &quot;genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from inside while patterns of feeling and attitudes of mind appear clothed in a distinctive African imagery, written neither up nor down.&quot;

==Themes==
===Culture===
&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; depicts the cultural roots of the Igbos and refers them as a universal principle, which revives the lost dignity of the people during the Colonial Nigeria.

Historians focuses on past African Empires in order to improve the status of African history, but Achebe breaks this pattern by portraying Igbo people as isolated with an established tradition. For example, when the missionaries entered Mbanta, they expected there to be a king. Upon being told there was none, they set up their own ruling system. In &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, there is a contradiction between different cultural practices;
for example, the Europeans allow men to fight over religion but the Igbo tradition forbids the killing of one another.

Achebe presents some standard for the Igbo culture while not idealizing the past, like the troubling culture for modern democrats is the law that says Ikemefuna should be killed for the sins of his clans. Although Achebe shows the treachery, ignorance, and intolerance of the British, he doesn&#x27;t present them as fully evil people. Instead he uses both cultures—British and Igbo—to represent two mixture of human beings as seen in Okonkwo and Mr. Smith, who both refuse to compromise when their cultures are threatened.

Before the publication of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, most of the novels about Africa were written by Europeans and they portray Africans as savages who were in need of western enlightenment. &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; paved way for African culture and it influenced other African writers to write efficiently about the expression of a particular social, historical, and cultural situation of modern Africa.

Achebe portrayes the Igbo society sympathetically, hence, allows his audience to examine the effects of colonialism from a different perspective. He asserted that the popularity of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; in Nigeria can be explained simply that &quot;this was the first time we were seeing ourselves, as autonomous individuals, rather than half-people, or as Conrad would say, &#x27;rudimentary souls&#x27;&quot;. Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka called the novel as &quot;the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him.&quot;

The language of the novel has not only intrigued critics but has also been a major factor in the emergence of the modern African novel. Because Achebe wrote in English, portrayed Igbo life from the point of view of an African man, and used the language of his people, he was able to greatly influence African novelists, who viewed him as a mentor.

Achebe&#x27;s fiction and criticism continue to inspire and influence writers around the world. Hilary Mantel, the Booker Prize-winning novelist in a 7 May 2012 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Hilary Mantel&#x27;s 5 Favorite Historical Fictions&quot;, lists &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; as one of her five favourite novels in this genre. A whole new generation of African writers – Caine Prize winners Binyavanga Wainaina (current director of the Chinua Achebe Center at Bard College) and Helon Habila (&quot;Waiting for an Angel&quot; [2004] and &quot;Measuring Time&quot; [2007]), as well as Uzodinma Iweala (&quot;Beasts of No Nation&quot; [2005]), and Professor Okey Ndibe (&quot;Arrows of Rain&quot; [2000]) count Chinua Achebe as a significant influence. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the author of the popular and critically acclaimed novels &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; (2003) and &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; (2006), commented in a 2006 interview: &quot;Chinua Achebe will always be important to me because his work influenced not so much my style as my writing philosophy: reading him emboldened me, gave me permission to write about the things I knew well.&quot;

&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was listed by &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as one of &quot;12 Novels Considered the &#x27;Greatest Book Ever Written.

The 60th anniversary of the first publication of &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; was celebrated at the South Bank Centre in London, UK, on 15 April 2018 with live readings from the book by Femi Elufowoju Jr, Adesua Etomi, Yomi Sode, Lucian Msamati, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, Chibundu Onuzo, Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, Ben Okri, and Margaret Busby.

<doc id="438393" wikidata="Q6073749" url="?curid=438393" title="Irresistible Bliss">
<text>Irresistible Bliss is the second studio album by the American electronic music group Soul Coughing, released in 1996. The band initially planned for Tchad Blake, producer of their first album &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot;, to produce the album, but the death of a family member in a car accident caused Blake to take a hiatus. Over the objections of his bandmates and his record label, Slash Records/Warner Bros., frontman Mike Doughty (then billed as &quot;M. Doughty&quot;) hired producer David Kahne (Fishbone, The Bangles, Sublime, Tony Bennett, Sugar Ray, The Strokes); he was intent on following up the wild sonics of &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; with a tightly wound, trembly, New Wave–inspired record.

The tracking, at Manhattan&#x27;s Power Station recording studio, was complete in eleven days, and Doughty was jubilant at the results. Doughty tapped Steve Fisk to produce the tune &quot;Unmarked Helicopters&quot; for &quot;The X-Files&quot; soundtrack &quot;Songs in the Key of X&quot;.

All of &quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot;″s songs were produced by Kahne, except tracks 2 and 6 (by Fisk) and track 12 by the band themselves. The mixing process split the tracks between three mixers: Kahne, Chris Shaw, and &quot;Ruby&quot; producer Tchad Blake, who intervened when bass player Sebastian Steinberg briefly quit the band.

&quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot; yielded a hit single for Soul Coughing, &quot;Super Bon Bon.&quot; &quot;Soft Serve&quot; and &quot;Soundtrack to Mary&quot; also received some selective radio airplay.

<text>In music and music theory, a polychord consists of two or more chords, one on top of the other. In shorthand they are written with the top chord above a line and the bottom chord below, for example F upon C: .

The use of polychords may suggest bitonality or polytonality. Harmonic parallelism may suggest bichords.

Examples may be found in Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, p. 15, and &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Adolescents&quot; (1921) (see Petrushka chord).

In the polychords in the image above, the first might suggest a thirteenth chord, the second may suggest a D minor ninth chord with upper extensions, but the octave separation of the 3rd makes the suggestion of two independent triads a minor ninth apart even more likely, and the fourth is a split-third chord.

Extended chords contain more than one triad, and so can be regarded as a type of polychord:


For example G7119 (G–B–D–F–A–C) is formed from G major (G–B–D) and D major (D–F–A), or . (C ≡ D)

The Lydian augmented scale, &quot;has a polychord sound built in,&quot; created by superimposing the Caug and the E () and/or Fdim () triads that exist in the scale, this being, &quot;a very common practice for most bop and post-bop players [such as McCoy Tyner].&quot;

Examples of extended chords include the Elektra chord.

When one or both of the chords in a polychord are not &quot;chords&quot; in some exclusive sense according to some preferred chord theory or other, polychords devolves into chordioid technique.

<text>Live from Baghdad is a 2002 American television war drama film directed by Mick Jackson and co-written by Robert Wiener, based on Wiener&#x27;s book of the same title. The film premiered on HBO on December 7, 2002, during the prelude stage of the Iraq War.

Michael Keaton stars as Wiener, a CNN on-location producer in Baghdad, Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. The film focuses on the news media&#x27;s (primarily CNN&#x27;s) coverage of the war. Fundamentally an action–drama, the characters grapple with the ethics and implications of 24-hour journalism in the days leading up to and during the United States-led bombing of Baghdad.

==Plot==

On August 2, 1990, Iraqi forces and tanks roll into Kuwait City, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait begins. In Atlanta, CNN picks Robert Wiener and his crew to go to Baghdad and cover the invasion. At Rome International Airport, Wiener meets his colleague and producer Ingrid Formanek. Wiener and his crew arrive in Baghdad on August 23, and stay at the Al-Rasheed Hotel.

As they settle in their hotel rooms, they notice that they are being monitored. The crew report their first story on a young British boy held as a hostage by Saddam Hussein. As they continue to report stories, they get pressured by the Iraqi government. Wiener later meets the Iraqi Minister of Information Naji Al Hadithi, and requests pieces of equipment and an interview with Hussein. As the movie goes on, Wiener and Al Hadithi become friends.

Wiener and his crew get access to interview Americans forced to stay in the country by the Iraqi government. The Iraqis use the American hostages as human shields for potential bombing sites. After Wiener&#x27;s crew interview an American named Bob Vinton, Vinton goes missing. Wiener becomes worried about Vinton. Later, Al Hadithi gives CBS and Dan Rather the Saddam Hussein interview. Instead of the Hussein interview, Al Hadithi gives Wiener and his crew a trip to Kuwait. They arrive in Jahra Air Force Base, Kuwait on October 17. The crew cover the incubator story in three Kuwaiti hospitals, but then Iraqis call off the interviews because the CNN crew broke some ground rules. As soon as they arrive back in Baghdad, Wiener and the crew become the story as the only Americans to be in Kuwait.

After an argument between Wiener and Al Hadithi, Al Hadithi agrees to give CNN a Saddam Hussein interview. On October 29, and the CNN crew interview Saddam Hussein at one of his presidential palaces. In the interview, Hussein states that Iraq withdrawing from Kuwait would be like the U.S. withdrawing from Hawaii. The crew then covers the release of American hostages from Iraq. Wiener then finds Bob Vinton and is emotionally moved by his being safe.

The United Nations gives Iraq until January 15, 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, or face military action. As the deadline comes to an end the crew sees that the Iraqi Army is installing anti-aircraft guns in Baghdad. The crew then gets a piece of equipment called the four-wire, which gives them communications to CNN in Atlanta. The four-wire is essentially a direct phone line to their CNN facility in Jordan. From that point it can hit the satellite above and then go to the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. The Iraqis eventually find out that the crew have established communication with Atlanta. The CNN crew is the only foreign news group with the four wire. On January 9, the crew eventually believe that there will be war.

Bernard Shaw arrives in Baghdad again on January 13 to interview Saddam Hussein again at the deadline. As soon as the deadline expires, streets in Baghdad are empty and businesses are shut down. Americans and foreign news groups begin evacuating Baghdad on January 15 in fear of American bombing strikes. Wiener decides to stay, and some members of the crew decide to leave. At around 3 a.m. on January 17, U.S. F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers begin to bomb Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers begin to fire anti-aircraft guns into the sky to shoot down the bombers. As soon as the bombing strikes begin, CNN correspondents Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett begin to report and describe the bombings on the four-wire communicator. The reports are broadcast live on CNN in America. The film shows the points of view from Saddam Hussein and U.S. President George H. W. Bush watching the CNN reports. It also intersperses actual archival footage of news anchors from rival networks, having to report off CNN&#x27;s live feed, since CNN was the only news source transmitting during the bombing of Baghdad. Other archival footage is of Dick Cheney, during a news conference as Bush&#x27;s Defense Secretary, stating &quot;The best coverage I&#x27;ve seen of what transpired in Baghdad was on CNN&quot;, and NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw stating, &quot;CNN used to be called the little network that could. It&#x27;s no longer a little network.&quot;

At around 5 a.m., the crew is forced to stop reporting by Al Hadithi and Iraqi soldiers.

Most of the crew leaves Baghdad, including Formanek and Shaw. Wiener stays, returning to America on January 23. The film ends showing the destruction of buildings from bombings in Baghdad.

<doc id="438406" wikidata="Q6016391" url="?curid=438406" title="Independent Assemblies of God, International">
<text>The Independent Assemblies of God International (IAOGI) is a pentecostal Christian association with roots in a revival of the 1890s among the Scandinavian Baptist and Pietist communities in the United States. &quot;Independent Assemblies of God International&quot; is a member of the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America. International offices are located in Laguna Hills, California.

==History==
In 1907, the Mission of William Howard Durham inspired many congregations and individuals to learn about the Pentecostal movement through Mission in Chicago. One of his assistant elders, F. A. Sandgren, published the &quot;Folke-Vennena&quot; a periodical for Scandinavians and many Midwest churches joined the Pentecostal movement. In 1918, the denomination was organized as the &quot;Scandinavian Assemblies of God in the United States of America, Canada and Foreign Lands&quot; with A. W. Rasmussen. In 1935, at the annual convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota, they merged with another group named the &quot;Independent Pentecostal Churches&quot;, and became Independent Assemblies of God International. In the 1940s and 1950s and organization was deeply influenced and closely connected to the Latter Rain movement and William Branham. Joseph Mattsson-Boze, pastor of the Philadelphia Church in Chicago, became a leader in the movement and his &quot;Herald of Faith&quot; publication served as a publicity tool for the group. The Latter Rain movement had few requirements for ordaining a minister. In 1959, a split in the IAoG led to the formation of the Fellowship of Christian Assemblies who wanted stricter requirements on the qualifications to become a minister. The IAOGI has congregations in Africa, Canada, Guatemala, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Romania, and the United States. The churches meet in an annual convention. There are approximately 1500 churches worldwide. They are present in India since the second half of the 20th century The area of their work includes Nagaland.

==Beliefs==
The &quot;Independent Assemblies of God International&quot; believes some of the uniqueness that sets it apart from other Pentecostal bodies is &quot;its conviction of the sovereignty of the local church&quot;. The IAOGI&#x27;s doctrinal statement reflects the following beliefs:

*&quot;The Bible as the inspired and infallible Word of God;&quot;
*&quot;One God, eternally existent in three persons&quot;
*&quot; The virgin birth of Christ, His vicarious, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and Ascension&quot;
*&quot; Salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ&quot;
*&quot; Water baptism by immersion&quot;
*&quot; The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;
*&quot;Divine healing through the redemptive work of Christ on the cross&quot;
*&quot;The baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot;
*&quot;The sanctification power of the Holy Spirit;&quot;
*&quot; The second coming of Jesus Christ;&quot;
*&quot;The Blessed hope resurrection and translation of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and those who are alive at His coming; and The final judgment of those who have not accepted Christ as Savior, with the devil and his angels in the Lake of Fire&quot;.

The Independent Assemblies of God International should not be confused with the Assemblies of God International Fellowship, the International Assemblies of God Fellowship, and the Assemblies of God, all of which are Pentecostal denominations that have good fellowship with one another as organizations.

<text>HMAS &quot;Castlemaine&quot; (J244/M244/A248), named for the city of Castlemaine, Victoria, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially crewed and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Launched in 1941 and commissioned in 1942, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; operated during World War II in the waters of Australia, New Guinea, and Timor. She remained in service until 1945, when she was decommissioned into reserve and converted into an immobilised training ship. In 1973, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was presented to the Maritime Trust of Australia for conversion to a museum ship. She is one of two surviving examples of the &quot;Bathurst&quot; class, the other being HMAS &quot;Whyalla&quot;.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of . The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Main armament was initially a BL 4-inch Mk IX naval gun on a Mk I mounting, but this was replaced in 1943 by a QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun on a Mk XXIII mounting.

Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Castlemaine&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but crewed and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Castlemaine&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria on 17 February 1941. She was launched on 7 August 1941 by Dame Pattie Menzies, wife of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies. The corvette was commissioned into the RAN at Melbourne on 17 June 1942.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; sailed to Sydney, where she was involved in training exercises and convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. On the night of 11 August 1942, the corvette collided with a Manly ferry, requiring a week of repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard.

After repairs, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was ordered to Townsville, then assigned to Darwin in October: at both locations the ship was tasked with supporting and supplying Allied guerrilla operations in Timor. In late November 1942, the RAN was called on to evacuate the commandoes of the 2/2nd Independent Company (an evacuation attempt in September failed when the destroyer grounded and was scuttled after being badly damaged by attacking Japanese aircraft), a contingent of Dutch troops, and over 100 Portuguese civilians, while delivering a relief contingent. &quot;Castlemaine&quot;, sister ship , and the auxiliary patrol boat were assigned to the operation by Commodore Cuthbert Pope, Naval Officer in Charge Darwin, with &quot;Castlemaine&quot; the commanding ship. The plan was for &quot;Kuru&quot; to reach Betano Bay early on the night of 30 November, offload supplies, and take on the civilians. The two corvettes were to arrive two hours later; &quot;Kuru&quot; would deliver her passengers to &quot;Castlemaine&quot;, which was to head for Darwin at first opportunity, then shuttle relief troops aboard &quot;Armidale&quot; to shore while evacuating the soldiers.

The corvettes sailed from Darwin at midday on 29 November, leaving just as Japanese aircraft flew over the harbour. At 09:00 on 30 November, the two ships were located by a Japanese reconnaissance plane, but were unable to shoot it down. Because of the likelihood of attack during the day and the distance from the destination, the ships radioed Darwin and suggested that the mission be aborted, but Pope instructed they were to continue after steering away from their intended destination for an hour, and promised fighter support. &quot;Armidale&quot; and &quot;Castlemaine&quot; were attacked at midday by 14 Japanese bombers, but these were driven off by a force of Bristol Beaufighters, which then returned to Australia. Another attack came at 14:00, but neither side was able to do damage. Delays from the evasive course and two air attacks meant the corvettes reached Betano Bay after 02:30 on 1 December, with no sign of &quot;Kuru&quot;, and retreated to sea. &quot;Kuru&quot; was sighted at daybreak-assuming the corvettes were not coming, her commander chose to sail for Darwin with the civilians-and the civilians were transferred to &quot;Castlemaine&quot;. Although as senior ship, &quot;Castlemaine&quot;″s commanding officer felt he should return to Betano Bay with the soldiers, the troops were aboard the other corvette, and at 11:00 he ordered (with Commodore Pope&#x27;s approval) &quot;Armidale&quot; and &quot;Kuru&quot; to return by separate routes and attempt the operation again that night. Although &quot;Castlemaine&quot; returned without trouble, &quot;Armidale&quot; was attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft on 1 December.

On 15 December, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was escorting the merchant ships &quot;Period&quot; and &quot;James Cook&quot; to Thursday Island when they were attacked by Japanese aircraft. Four of &quot;Period&quot;″s crew were killed, and the three ships were attacked two more times on 15 December, and a fourth time on 16 December. No further damage was sustained, with the aircraft driven off by the corvette&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament on all four occasions.

Following the Allied withdrawal from Timor in early 1943, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was assigned to minesweeping and escort duties in northern Australian waters. This continued until the end of 1943, when she was reassigned to the convoy escort role between Queensland and New Guinea. In August 1944, the corvette was tasked with survey duties in Australia waters, before sailing to Hong Kong for the Japanese surrender in September 1945.

The ship was granted three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942–43&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–43&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and preservation==
&quot;Castlemaine&quot; paid off to reserve on 14 December 1945. She was immobilised at HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; at Crib Point in Victoria as a training hulk for Engine Room Artificers, who ran the boilers in part providing steam heating throughout the base. During this period, she was also used for damage control training for service personnel.

In September 1973, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was presented as a gift to the Maritime Trust of Australia from the Australian Government. Transferred into Trust ownership by the end of 1973, minus most of the original fittings, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was restored and converted into a museum ship. &quot;Castlemaine&quot; is presently berthed at Gem Pier, Williamstown, Victoria, adjacent to the historic Customs House. The ship is not capable of sailing, as the main mess deck houses a museum, and the engines have been converted to run on compressed air, displaying their mechanical operation to visitors.

Between 14 and 29 August 2015, &quot;Castlemaine&quot; was drydocked for maintenance, cleaning, and hull preservation at the nearby BAE Systems Williamstown shipyard.

<text>Castlemaine ( , non-locally also ) is a town in west central Victoria, Australia, in the Goldfields region about 120 kilometres (75 miles) northwest by road from Melbourne and about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the major provincial centre of Bendigo. It is the administrative and economic centre of the Shire of Mount Alexander. Castlemaine was named by the chief goldfield commissioner, Captain W. Wright, in honour of his Irish uncle, Viscount Castlemaine. At the , Castlemaine had a population of 7,506.

Built on the lands of the Dja Dja Wurrung, Castlemaine began as a gold rush boomtown in 1851 and developed into a major regional centre, being officially proclaimed a City on 4 December 1965, although since declining in population.

It is home to many cultural institutions including the Theatre Royal, the oldest continuously operating theatre in mainland Australia.

==History==
=== First Nations ===
Castlemaine colonised the traditional lands of the Dja Dja Wurrung people, also known as the Jaara people. They were regarded by other tribes as being a superior people, not only because of their rich hunting grounds but because from their area came tachylite, a hard glassy volcanic stone valued for weapons and tools Early Europeans described the Dja Dja Wurrung as a strong, physically well-developed people and not belligerent. The Jaara people have a rich culture and reverence for the land.

The environmental devastation caused by gold mining from the 1850s was widespread and permanent in the entire district. It extinguished many native plant and animal species in the area, and decimated and displaced the Dja Dja Wurrung, for whom quartz was of value but not the soft gold it contained, and who regarded the resulting destruction as having turned their land into &#x27;upside-down country.&#x27;

Their vital water sources included non-perennial creeks and associated underground springs. Mining spread contaminants and destroyed the infrastructure the indigenous people created over generations to maximise seasonal drainage patterns; channels and weirs they built out of timber stakes, to slow receding summer flows, were wrecked; water holes where the people gathered in smaller groups during periods of scarce rainfall and from which they transported water in skin bags when moving, were muddied, polluted and drained; the soaks they had dug between banks into sandy sediment to tap into the water table were likewise obliterated. Some of their waterholes in rock platforms of the Creek that they found or enlarged, then covered with slabs to protect them from animals, may still remain, unidentified.

=== Europeans ===
The first European settlers named it Forest Creek and as the population grew it became known as Mount Alexander. The old name is still present in some place names in Victoria including the Shire of Mount Alexander and the former main road leading to it from Melbourne – Mount Alexander Road. Major Mitchell passed through the region in 1836. Following his discovery, the first squatters arrived in 1837 to establish vast sheep runs.

In 1854, Chief goldfields commissioner, Captain W. Wright, renamed the settlement &#x27;Castlemaine&#x27; in honour of his Irish uncle, Viscount Castlemaine.

===Discovery of gold===
On 20 July 1851 gold was discovered near present-day Castlemaine (Mt Alexander Goldfields) at Specimen Gully on Barkers Creek. The gold was discovered by Christopher Thomas Peters, a shepherd and hut-keeper on the Barker&#x27;s Creek, in the service of Dr William Barker on his Mount Alexander run. When the gold was shown in the men&#x27;s quarters, Peters was ridiculed for finding fool&#x27;s gold, and the gold was thrown away. Barker did not want his workmen to abandon his sheep, but in August they did just that. John Worley, George Robinson and Robert Keen, also in the employ of Barker as shepherds and a bullock driver, immediately teamed with Peters in working the deposits by panning in Specimen Gully where the gold had been found, which they did in relative privacy during the next month. When Barker sacked them and ran them off his land for trespass, Worley, on behalf of the party &quot;to prevent them getting in trouble&quot;, mailed a letter to &quot;The Argus&quot; (Melbourne) dated 1 September 1851 announcing this new goldfield with the precise location of their workings. This letter was published on 8 September 1851. &quot;With this obscure notice, rendered still more so by the journalist as &#x27;Western Port&#x27;, were ushered to the world the inexhaustible treasures of Mount Alexander&quot; also to become known as the Forest Creek diggings. Within a month there were about 8,000 diggers working the alluvial beds of the creeks near the present day town of Castlemaine, and particularly Forest Creek which runs through Chewton where the first small village was established. By the end of the year there were about 25,000 on the field.

===Gold rush: a city develops===


The first small village developed at Chewton, today in effect a suburb of Mount Alexander Shire, which included the Commissioner&#x27;s tent, stores, an office for &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper, and an office for the Mount Alexander goldfields&#x27; own newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

On 28 January 1852, William Henry Wright was one of nearly 200 men who were assigned or affirmed as Territorial Magistrates for Victoria. Not long after, he took control of the Mount Alexander diggings and set up a government camp on Forest Street near the junction of Barker and Forest Creeks (today&#x27;s Camp Reserve). This was to be the new township of Castlemaine. The first reference in a newspaper to the township is found in the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; of 13 March 1852 with the following notice:
:&quot;- The Lieutenant Governor has appointed John Fletcher, Esq., J.P., to be Police Magistrate at Castlemaine; but where Castlemaine is situate[d] we cannot tell.&quot;
A court house was established on what is today known as Goldsmith Crescent, Castlemaine near the new government camp. Stores were also established nearby.

The first official Post Office at Castlemaine, named &quot;Forrest Creek&quot;, opened on 1 March 1852. (Renamed the Castlemaine Post Office on 1 January 1854.) The first official Post Office was established after &quot;The Argus&quot; (Melbourne) correspondent at Forest Creek had an article published in November 1851 that put the case forward for a Post Office to be established somewhere between the Forest Creek goldfield and Kyneton. At the same time (November 1851) he described the Forest Creek diggings as having many businesses such as stores and licensed hawkers and &quot;at least 8000 persons on the two creeks (Forest and Barker)&quot;. The need pointed out in &quot;The Argus&quot; in November 1851 had resulted in an unofficial Post Office being established on the diggings at Chewton (Forest Creek) in December 1851, a Post Office then described as being &quot;on the most central part of the diggings&quot;.

On 15 February 1853 town lots were offered for sale. By that time the first Castlemaine District Hospital had been opened, the gaol had been built, and Castlemaine was moving from &#x27;tent&#x27; town to bricks and mortar. Notable prominent businesswoman Fanny Finch was running a restaurant and lodging house at Forest Creek at this time.

A local government was formed on 23 April 1855 and was later to become the Town of Castlemaine and in 1965 became the City of Castlemaine. However, with municipal amalgamations in the early 1990s, Castlemaine lost its &#x27;City&#x27; status and is now simply the largest town in the Shire.

The Theatre Royal opened in 1856 to provide entertainment for the gold diggers, with a notable performance being provided by the world-renowned Lola Montes and her celebrated Spider Dance. It remains mainland Australia&#x27;s oldest continuously operating theatre.

In 1859, the historic Castlemaine Football Club was established. Evidence makes it the second oldest football club in Australia and one of the oldest football clubs in the world.

===After the gold rush===
In 1877-80 the residences numbered over 2000, and there was a population in the township of 7,500, forming an electorate in itself, within the district, the County of Talbot, of 19,000 people. Four trains ran daily to and from Melbourne with fares at 13 shillings (A$80 value in 2021) for First Class, and 8s. 6d. (A$52.70) for Second.

As gold mining gradually ceased a number of other secondary industries sprang up. These included breweries, iron foundries and a woollen mill. Thompson&#x27;s Foundry (now trading as Flowserve) was one of Castlemaine&#x27;s largest employers.

From the 1970s the industries that had dominated employment in the town for a century began to decline, with many factories closing and others such as Thompson&#x27;s Foundry significantly downsizing. This led to the displacement of large numbers of people, with many families leaving in search of jobs elsewhere. The area&#x27;s precious goldrush history and heritage was, however, increasingly recognised, along with its notable population of arts practitioners. Substantial planning and activity helped create new industries in heritage tourism, arts tourism, nature tourism and so on. As a result, Castlemaine began to be visited – and settled – by more &#x27;outsiders&#x27;, primarily from Melbourne.

Some of these more recent arrivals added to the gentrification of the Victorian era town, helping to preserve its already charming country aspect and enhancing it by establishing a number of cafes and restaurants. As with much gentrification, however, consequent rising house prices placed increased economic pressure on many earlier inhabitants who sometimes struggle to continue living in the area. The town has, overall, taken on a fresh lease of life, combining some of the more desirable aspects of urban Melbourne with the charm and openness of old Castlemaine.

==Geography==
Castlemaine is nestled in a valley. The urban area extends to several suburban areas, north toward Barkers Creek, west to McKenzie Hill, east to Moonlight Flat and Chewton and south to Campbells Creek.

===Climate===
==Governance==

In local government, the Castlemaine region is covered by the Shire of Mount Alexander. The council was created in 1995 as an amalgamation of a number of other municipalities in the region with the Council and Civic Centre in the former School of Mines, in central Castlemaine, next to the original town hall. Castlemaine Town is represented by the Castlemaine Ward. The Loddon River Ward is centred around the township of Newstead. The Tarrengower Ward is centred around the township of Maldon. The Calder Ward is centred around Harcourt. The Coliban Ward covers the villages of Chewton, Elphinstone and Taradale.

In state politics, Castlemaine is located in the Legislative Assembly districts of Bendigo West currently held by the Australian Labor Party.

In federal politics, Castlemaine is located in a single House of Representatives division – the Division of Bendigo. The Division of Bendigo has been an Australian Labor Party seat since 1998.

==Economy==

Castlemaine&#x27;s largest industry is in manufacturing, particularly food manufacturing.

The biggest employer is KR Castlemaine (formerly the Castlemaine Bacon Company, established 1905), producing smallgoods with over 900 employees.

Cultural and heritage tourism is another large industry in Castlemaine, with the historic art gallery being a major drawcard.

Castlemaine has joined the likes of nearby Daylesford with gaining tourism from Melbourne, offering an array of local cafes and bars which have increased the region&#x27;s appeal.

Castlemaine is also home to the Castlemaine Rod Shop (CRS), a company known Australia-wide for its aftermarket components for Holden, Ford and many others, especially Australian-made vehicles.

==Heritage==
The Castlemaine goldfields&#x27; legendary prosperity raised expectations of Castlemaine becoming Victoria&#x27;s second city. That is reflected in imposing buildings erected in the town&#x27;s first few years. Though the rich alluvial diggings were largely exhausted within 15–20 years causing the town&#x27;s population to shrink after the 1870s, a rich legacy remains in the form of its buildings and intact nineteenth century streetscapes comprising public buildings as well as simple miners&#x27; cottages. The historic area tells the history of Castlemaine in relics of significance, including the former steam flourmill (now &#x27;The Mill&#x27;), the Church of England, and the Congregational Church, and despite the town&#x27;s topographical limitation to the valley of the two creeks, broad streets and grand buildings convey an atmosphere of spaciousness.

=== Barker Street ===
Named after William Barker, the pioneer pastoralist whose run included part of the land which is now Castlemaine. The whole eastern side of Barker Street, between Templeton Street and Lyttleton Street, has been classified by the National Trust of Australia (Vic). Adjacent to the solicitors&#x27; offices is the library, built in 1857 as a mechanics&#x27; institute with additions in 1861, 1872 and 1893. Next to it is the Faulder Watson Hall which opened in 1895 and adjacent is the old telegraph office (1857).

On the Lyttleton Street corner of Barker Street is the decorative Neoclassical post office (1873–75). It is in the form of an Italian palazzo with a central clock tower, five arched bays and strongly contrasting colouration. This structure replaced a wooden post office which was built on this same spot in 1859 when the service was transferred from the gold commissioner&#x27;s camp. Over the road is the Cumberland Hotel (1884).

=== Town hall ===
At 25 Lyttleton Street is the Castlemaine Town Hall, a design submitted by Wilkinson and Permewan successfully for a 1898 competition, and repeated by them in the Eaglehawk Town Hall in 1901. Constructed by H D McBean, builder of many substantial buildings in Castlemaine, including part of the hospital and Thompson&#x27;s foundry, it cost £2,000. Essentially a Queen Anne building with elements of Dutch Renaissance, its complex eclecticism is typical of the period. Constructed of face red brick and coloured cement dressings (now painted white) and a tiled roof, it is pavilion-planned. Dutch-Flemish architecture inspires the gabling of the projecting wings, the verticality of the windows and the superimposed post-and-lintel system with Tuscan and composite capitals, while the panelling and representation of fans to the side of the lower windows is unusual. Two storeys of pedimented porticos stacked in top of each other form the central element with a &#x27;broken&#x27; upper pediment, while the vertical line is continues above a balconied parapet, completed by a square tower with glazed circular openings on all four sides, surmounted by an onion dome.

=== Imperial Hotel ===
Opposite the town hall is the Imperial Hotel, a thirty-room, two-storey hotel with attic erected in 1861 for Faulder Watson at a cost of £4,000 and classified in 1982 by Heritage Victoria which describes it as &quot;one of the most innovative classical revival buildings in Victoria&quot;. The sophisticated design in French Renaissance style by leading Melbourne architects Purchas and Swyer (the Glenara homestead at Bulla is also their work), is rare in a building of the early 1860s. The iron crested mansard attic storey, elaborate detailing of both the corner chimneys, and pedimented dormer windows of the street and side elevations make the Imperial Hotel historically significant as one of the more distinctive hotel buildings in Victoria and a critical component in an important historic townscape.

=== Art gallery and museum ===
On 17 November 1983 the Castlemaine Art Museum at 14 Lyttleton Street was classified by the National Trust which notes its significance as &quot;an exceptional building in its intent and execution and ... historically important as one of the earliest examples of the &#x27;modern movement&#x27; in provincial Victoria&quot;. Despite the onset of the Depression, £3,250 was raised in only six weeks from private individuals and local companies, augmented by state government grants totallng £1,500, which together covered the total cost of £4,132. Architect Percy Meldrum&#x27;s design in an American Art-deco style was constructed by local builder Frank Pollard in local brick, slate and granite, by April 1931 for the official opening, free of debt. It consisted of a main gallery behind two smaller galleries and with the museum in the basement with storerooms. The gallery walls are naturally and indirectly lit from concealed windows of a saw-tooth roof above suspended ceilings. A &quot;jazz&quot; style frieze decorates the parapet, front wall and tympanum over the central front door, itself recessed behind ornate wrought-iron grille gates above which is a bas-relief in artificial stone by Orlando H. Dutton. Extensions were made at the rear in 1960, 1973, 1987 and 2000.

=== Market building ===
The Castlemaine Market building at 44 Mostyn Street, facing the main shopping strip, is a rare example of such buildings and, according to the Victorian National Trust, is one of the most important in the country. An 1861 design of town surveyor William Beynon Downes, it is one of the most distinctive classical revival buildings in Australia. It was classified on 11 December 1958, then acquired by the National Trust in 1967 which restored it from a dilapidated condition. Its symmetrical elevation features a tuscan portico, round headed entrance and roundels. The pediment, simply decorated with a rising sun motif, bears a statue of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, between two towers with cupola crowns. A clerestory lights the interior from above deep side wings which are &#x27;arcaded&#x27; and capped by a cornice. A landmark in the historic townscape, exemplifying the period when the temporary town became permanently established, it now serves as the tourist centre.

==Parks and open space==
Castlemaine has its own botanical gardens, established in 1860, which are on the Victorian Heritage Register. The gardens feature Lake Joanna (an artificial lake), many exotic tree species and structures dating to the Victorian era. The Castlemaine public swimming pool is 50m in length and is located next to the botanical gardens.

The Castlemaine Diggings National Heritage Park is the first of its kind in Australia. It embraces gold rush relics and bushland. Home to rare and threatened species of both flora and fauna it offers opportunities for bush walking, bird watching, wildlife monitoring and study while providing a bush setting for the township.

==Culture==
=== Library ===
Housed in an historic building, the Mechanics Institute at 212 Barker Street in which it was established in 1857, the Castlemaine Library held 4,781 volumes in 1877, and since 1996 has expanded its services and offerings and access to 222,931 items (in 2021–22) as part of the North Central Goldfields Regional Library Corporation which services also the City of Greater Bendigo, Loddon Shire and Macedon Ranges Shire; an area of 12,979 square kilometres. The shire contributes a budget of around $500,000. The Castlemaine branch is the most subscribed of all the NCGRL branches with 53% (10,687) of the Mount Alexander Shire population holding a library card and having used the library over any two-year period. The building, administered and maintained by the shire, also houses the 231-seat Phee Broadway Theatre and a foyer exhibition space.

=== Castlemaine State Festival ===
Since 1976, Castlemaine has biennially been the home of the Castlemaine State Festival. Running for ten days, the festival is one of Victoria&#x27;s most notable regional arts events. It was originally held over the Melbourne Cup period in November before it lost $130,000 in a clash in 1996 with the October Melbourne Festival instituted by then state premier Jeff Kennett. He compensated in part for its consequent losses with a grant of $41,800. Subsequently, it is now usually held in late March. It offers visual and performing arts and attracts internationally and nationally renowned performers, including the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.

===Churches===
As a gold rush town, Castlemaine attracted migrants from all over the world. So in addition to &#x27;established&#x27; churches such as the Anglicans, Presbyterians and Roman Catholics, arrivals in the district included Methodists, Baptists and Congregationalists from mining areas in provincial Britain where nonconformist churches were more popular, as well as Lutherans from continental Europe. Initially the churches in Victoria were unable to cope with huge numbers of migrants settling in areas which had been sparsely populated. However a few proactive clergymen set out for the diggings where they were assisted by lay preachers amongst the diggers. Initially they preached in tents and from tree stumps but by 1853 the first rough churches had been built.

There was also a sizeable Chinese population with concomitant joss houses and temples; besides a few artifacts, no structures remain.

Churches to have operated in Castlemaine in order of establishment are:
* Methodist. 1850s – 1977 when it merged as part of the Uniting Church of Australia
* Anglican. 1850s – present
* Roman Catholic. 1853–present
* Presbyterian. 1850s – 1977 and 1984 – 2023. The Castlemaine congregation merged as part of the Uniting Church in 1977, but some members later broke away to re-establish that denomination in the town
* Baptist. 1861? – present
* Congregational. 1800s – 1977 when it merged as part of the Uniting Church
* Church of Christ. 1800s – present
* Lutheran. 1800s to present.
* Salvation Army. Late 1800s to present
* Seventh Day Adventist.
* Uniting Church. 1977–present. Absorbed the local Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches, although some Presbyterians broke away in 1984 to re-establish a Presbyterian presence in the town
* Pentecostal: Grace Church, Liberty Christian Life Centre in Campbell Creek (affiliated with the Assemblies of God)

The Uniting Church was created in 1977 and the local Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational congregations chose to join. Since the Presbyterians had the largest church building, the best hall and largest grounds, the merged denominations met there. The Methodist and Congregational buildings were sold, with the Adventists taking over the former Methodist church and a conservative group that wished to re-establish a distinct Presbyterian service moving into the former Congregational church building over the road from their original church.

==Sport==
Australian rules football is popular, with the Castlemaine Football Club competing in the Bendigo Football League.

On Wesley Hill, just out of Castlemaine, is the Castlemaine sporting complex, which hosts a range of sport including basketball, netball, badminton and cycling. Castlemaine Tennis Club on Wheeler Street next to Forest Creek features four plexipave courts and eight further synthetic grass courts. Castlemaine has many cricket teams in the town itself and the surrounding area. It is also renowned for its mountain bike trails, with a reputedly world-class, newly developed multi trail walking and cycling facility on the slopes of Mount Alexander at nearly Harcourt. Two golf courses are available; at the Castlemaine Golf Club in the bordering Muckleford region on Newstead Road, and at the course of the Mount Alexander Golf Club on Wimble Street.

Castlemaine is also the self-proclaimed Hot Rod centre of Australia, with many small businesses catering to this popular form of motor sport at a national level. Examples of the cars can be seen on show days and rod runs throughout the year. There are plans for a permanent Hot Rod centre.

=== Run the Maine ===
Held annually in October, Run the Maine is a fun run event around the Castlemaine Botanical Gardens which raises funds for the local hospital – Castlemaine Health. Participants can choose to run 5.5 km, 11 km or a 14 km trail run. The 2020 event was run virtually, with runners uploading their times individually due to COVID-19.

The Junior Campus of the Secondary College was at Milkmaids Flat at the northern end of the town on the old High School site, while the Senior Campus occupied the former Tech College site at Norwood Hill to the south of the town. These campuses have now merged at the former Junior Campus. The Norwood Hill site has been re-purposed as Autoplex Castlemaine (a project of Castlemaine Hot Rod Centre Limited) and as a business incubation project by Workspace Australia.

<text>Bohdan Paczyński or Bohdan Paczynski (8 February 1940 – 19 April 2007) was a Polish astronomer notable for his theories and work in the fields of stellar evolution, accretion discs, and gamma ray bursts. He is the recipient of the Eddington Medal (1987), the Henry Draper Medal (1997), the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1999), and the Order of Polonia Restituta (2007). 

==Life and career==
Paczyński was born on 8 February 1940 in Vilnius, Lithuania, to a lawyer and a teacher of Polish literature. In 1945 his family chose to leave for Poland and settled in Kraków, and then in 1949 in Warsaw. At the age of 18, Paczyński published his first scientific article in &quot;Acta Astronomica&quot;. Between 1959 and 1962 he studied astronomy at the University of Warsaw. Two years later he received a doctorate under the tutelage of Stefan Piotrowski and Włodzimierz Zonn.

In 1962 Paczyński became a member of the Centre of Astronomy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where he continued to work for nearly 20 years. In 1974 he received habilitation and in 1979 became a professor. Thanks to his works on theoretical astronomy, at the age of 36 he became the youngest member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

In 1981 Paczyński visited the United States, where he gave a series of lectures at Caltech to former interns at his Warsaw-based institute. After the introduction of the Martial Law in Poland he decided to stay abroad. He was the Lyman Spitzer Jr. Professor of Astrophysics at Princeton University.

Paczyński was the initiator of time-domain sky surveys: Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, led by Andrzej Udalski of Warsaw University Observatory) and All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS, created together with Grzegorz Pojmański).

His new methods of discovering cosmic objects and measuring their mass by using gravitational lenses gained him international recognition, and he is acknowledged for coining the term &quot;microlensing&quot;. He was also an early proponent of the idea that gamma-ray bursts are at cosmological distances.

In 1997, Paczyński hypothesized that hypernovae were supernovae from rapidly spinning stars.

His research concentrated on stellar evolution, gravitational lensing and gravitational microlensing, variable stars, gamma-ray bursts, and galactic structure.

In 1999, he became the first astronomer to receive all three major awards of the Royal Astronomical Society, by winning the Gold Medal, having won the Eddington Medal in 1987 and the George Darwin Lectureship in 1995.

He was honoured with the title of doctor honoris causa by Wrocław University in Poland (on June 29, 2005) and Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń in Poland (on September 22, 2006).

In January 2006 he was awarded Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society, &quot;for his highly original contributions to a wide variety of fields including advanced stellar evolution, the nature of gamma ray bursts, accretion in binary systems, gravitational lensing, and cosmology. His research has been distinguished by its creativity and breadth, as well as the stimulus it has provided to highly productive observational investigations&quot;.

He published over 200 scientific papers, which have been cited over 30,000 times by 2022, making him one of the most cited Polish scientists.

He died of brain cancer on April 19, 2007, in Princeton, New Jersey.

<text>Orange County is a 2002 American comedy film starring Colin Hanks and Jack Black. It was released on January 11, 2002. The movie was distributed by Paramount Pictures and produced by MTV Productions and Scott Rudin. The movie was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White.

==Plot==
Shaun Brumder is intelligent but little interested in his education, leading a carefree SoCal lifestyle of surfing in affluent Orange County, California, drinking and partying. His best friend, Lonny, is killed in a surfing accident, causing Shaun to rethink his life. Finding a novel on the beach by Marcus Skinner, it inspires him to become a writer. Upon learning that Skinner is an English professor at Stanford University, Shaun makes it his goal to attend Stanford and study under him.

Shaun dramatically improves himself academically, obtaining high grades and SAT scores and becoming president of his graduating class. Following the advice of his guidance counselor, Ms. Cobb, Shaun applies only to Stanford. This backfires when he is rejected as Ms. Cobb mixed up his transcript with that of another student.

Reaching out to his wealthy father, Bud, who left his family for a younger woman, Shaun pleads with him to donate to Stanford to increase his chances of acceptance. Disapproving of his son&#x27;s dream to become a writer, Bud refuses. Shaun&#x27;s girlfriend, Ashley, convinces her friend, Tanya, to get Shaun an interview at his home by Tanya&#x27;s grandfather, a Stanford board member. Unfortunately, the antics of Shaun&#x27;s dysfunctional family members—his alcoholic, emotionally fragile mother, Cindy, and his dim-witted, stoner brother, Lance—cause Shaun&#x27;s interviewers to storm out in disgust.

In a last-ditch effort, Ashley and Lance convince Shaun to drive to Palo Alto and plead his case directly to Stanford Admissions Director, Don Durkett. By the time they reach campus, the admissions building is closed. While Lance seduces the secretary on duty, Shaun and Ashley find Durkett&#x27;s home address. There, Shaun impresses Durkett with his real transcript, but Durkett is reluctant to admit him so late in the admissions process.

After much groveling, Shaun convinces him to give it a second thought. Disaster strikes again when Ashley confuses Lance&#x27;s MDMA, commonly referred to as ecstasy, for pain relievers, offering Durkett the pills for his headache, getting him high. Shaun, Ashley, and Durkett return to find the Admissions Building on fire, caused by Lance setting a list of new students on fire and throwing it in the trash. With Lance wanted for arson, they abandon Durkett and flee the scene.

Frustrated with Shaun&#x27;s obsession, Ashley points out that his attending Stanford would likely mean the end of their relationship and she leaves. Depressed, Shaun wanders the campus and meets a female student who invites him to a frat party. He is disappointed to learn the Stanford students are just as vapid as teenagers from Orange County.

With a more cynical view of college, Shaun runs into Professor Skinner and is invited to his office. Shaun confides that he is afraid his dreams of being a good writer are over. Skinner reminds him that many famous authors such as James Joyce and William Faulkner grew up in places that were not intellectually stimulating, and were inspired by the conflicts in their own lives. Having an epiphany, Shaun realizes his misguided intentions and apologizes to Ashley. They pick up Lance, still hiding from police, and go home.

In Orange County, Shaun&#x27;s parents seek out each other to deal with Shaun&#x27;s problem. They reconcile, realizing they are much happier together than with their respective new spouses, and conclude they have not been good parents to Shaun. To make amends, Bud donates enough money to Stanford for the construction of a new Admissions Building, which secures Shaun&#x27;s acceptance.

Initially ecstatic, Shaun remembers what Ashley and Professor Skinner said, and decides to stay in Orange County with Ashley and his family, as they are the true inspiration for his writing. Shaun leaves a copy of Skinner&#x27;s book at the beach for someone else to find, then surfs with his friends for the first time since Lonny&#x27;s death.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;Orange County&quot; was given 3 of 4 stars by Roger Ebert, who described it as, &quot;one of those happy projects where everything seems to fall naturally into place. It will sound like the kind of movie that, if you are over 17, you don&#x27;t usually go to see. But it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s one of those movies where the description can&#x27;t do justice to the experience.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating 47% based on reviews from 122 critics, with an average rating of 5.2 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Smarter than the average teen movie, but a little on the unmemorable side.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 48% based on reviews from 28 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

It garnered a better reception abroad than domestically. Matthew Turner of ViewLondon states that, &quot;though there are no real belly laughs or any Farrelly-like set pieces, this is still a better than average comedy, thanks to its witty script and its amusing collection of characters. Worth watching.&quot; while Brian McKay of eFilmCritic.com describes it as, &quot;a notch above the usual tripe we get from MTV films—but it&#x27;s not a very big notch.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on June 18, 2002, and was re-released in 2017, as well as available in a 3-pack set with &quot;School of Rock&quot; and &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;. It was released on Blu-ray for the first time on April 26, 2022.

<text>Mariama Bâ (April 17, 1929 – August 17, 1981) was a Senegalese author and feminist, whose two French-language novels were both translated into more than a dozen languages. Born in Dakar, Senegal, she was raised a Muslim. 

Her frustration with the fate of African women is expressed in her first novel, &quot;Une si longue lettre&quot; (1979; translated into English as &quot;So Long a Letter&quot;). In this semi-autobiographical epistolary work, Bâ depicts the sorrow and resignation of a woman who must share the mourning for her late husband with his second, younger wife. This short book was awarded the first Noma Award for Publishing in Africa in 1980.

==Biography==
Bâ was born in Dakar, Senegal, in 1929, into an educated and well-to-do Senegalese family of Lebu ethnicity. Her mother, Fatou Kiné Gaye, died when Mariama was 4. Her father, Amadou Bâ, founded the separatist African Autonomist Movement in 1946. He was the Minister of Health in 1956 while her grandfather was an interpreter in the French occupation regime. After her mother&#x27;s death, Bâ was largely raised in the traditional manner by her maternal grandparents. She received her early education in French, while at the same time attending Koranic school.

During the colonial revolution period and later, girls faced numerous obstacles when they wanted to have a higher education. Bâ&#x27;s grandparents did not plan to educate her beyond primary school. However, her father&#x27;s insistence on giving her an opportunity to continue her studies eventually persuaded them.

Bâ attended Dakar Girls’ School and planned to become a secretary. But at 14 she passed the final exam with such high scores that the school’s headmistress, Berthe Maubert, pushed Bâ to continue her education at the École normale de Rufisque, a women&#x27;s teacher-training school. She won the first prize in the entrance examination and entered the École Normale. In this institution, she was prepared for later career as a school teacher. The school&#x27;s principal began to prepare her for the 1943 entrance examination to a teaching career after he noticed Bâ&#x27;s intellect and capacity. She taught from 1947 to 1959, before transferring to the Regional Inspectorate of teaching as an educational inspector.

Bâ founded Cercle Fémina, a women&#x27;s organization, and was a member of Dakar’s Soroptimist Club, a volunteer organization which focuses on education and training for women and girls.

Bâ was married three times and had nine children; her third and longest marriage was to a Senegalese member of Parliament, Obèye Diop, but they divorced.

Bâ died on August 17, 1981 after a long battle with lung cancer, before the publication of her second novel, &quot;Un Chant écarlate&quot; (&quot;Scarlet Song&quot;), which is a love story between two star-crossed lovers from different ethnic backgrounds fighting the tyranny of tradition.

==Work==
Bâ published a book on education in colonial Senegal and contributed essays to African newspapers and periodicals favoring women&#x27;s rights and an end to colonialism in Africa. Bâ wrote two books: &quot;So Long a Letter&quot; (1979) and &quot;Scarlet Song&quot; (1981), in addition to &quot;La fonction politique des littératures Africaines écrites&quot; (The Political Function of African Written Literature), an article published in 1981. Bâ was aware that she wrote in French, a “borrowed language,” as she put it, which the local people may not have been able to read. Her books were later translated into her native language, Wolof.

===&quot;So Long a Letter&quot;===

In 1980, &quot;Une si longue lettre&quot;, translated as &quot;So Long a Letter&quot;, was awarded the first Noma Award for Publishing in Africa. In this book, Bâ recognized the immense contributions African women have made and continue to make in the building of their societies. The book was internationally successful. It was particularly successful in Senegal, which had only recently become independent from French colonial rule.

The book is written in the form of a letter, or a diary, from a widow, Ramatoulaye, to her childhood girlfriend, Aissatou, who lives in the United States. Nafissatou Niang Diallo (1941–1982), who started her works in the 1970s, was a mirror for Mariama Bâ, whose leading role was a strong-minded character. Moreover, she found support, friendship and values from female confidence, unity and harmony. The discriminatory use of power forces Ramatoulaye to deal with its consequences. This discriminatory power is what is in the novel a form of male domination coming from society&#x27;s construction of a patriarchal ideology. Because Ramatoulaye is a woman, she has little power in determining her own destiny, but Aissatou rejects this notion and chooses her own life without being denied a life of her own by her husband Mawdo.

===&quot;Scarlet Song&quot;===
&quot;Scarlet Song&quot; (1981) also gained international attention. This book deals with the critically urgent need for women to create &quot;empowered&quot; spaces for themselves, meaning, women need to create a space where they are not considered the &quot;weaker sex&quot;. &quot;Scarlet Song&quot; is about a marriage between a European woman and an African man. Mireille, whose father is a French diplomat, marries Ousmane, son of a poor Senegalese Muslim family. Moving back from Paris to Senegal, Ousmane once again adopts his traditions and customs. But, as an occidental, Mireille cannot handle this kind of life, especially when Ousmane takes a second wife. However, Senegal has a polygamous society and in their religion it is acceptable but Mireille did not accept it. She suffers the marriage. Most notably, the book criticizes the tyranny of tradition and expounds upon the despair of cross-cultural marriages.

===&quot;La Fonction politique des littératures africaines écrites&quot;===
In this article from 1981, Mariama Bâ states that every African woman should be proud of her strength and accomplishments. She believes that each woman contributes to Africa&#x27;s development and participates in Africa&#x27;s growth.

==Feminism and politics==
Bâ neither accepted the label &quot;feminist&quot;, which for her was too loaded with Western values, nor agreed with the traditional Senegalese Muslim values for women. According to Rizwana Habib Latha, the character of Ramatoulaye in &quot;So Long a Letter&quot; does portray a kind of womanism, and Bâ herself saw an important role for African women writers:

The woman writer in Africa has a special task. She has to present the position of women in Africa in all its aspects. There is still so much injustice. . . . In the family, in the institutions, in society, in the street, in political organizations, discrimination reigns supreme. . . . As women, we must work for our own future, we must overthrow the status quo which harms us and we must no longer submit to it. Like men, we must use literature as a non-violent but effective weapon.

Although Bâ&#x27;s work contains feminist ideas, experts on her life and writing say that she did not like the &quot;feminist&quot; label. Bâ aimed to promote an African perspective that valued mutual respect and equality between genders.

==Legacy==
Columbia University Libraries included &quot;So Long a Letter&quot; as one of the 20th century’s 100 best books about Africa.

A biography of Bâ was published in Dakar in 2007: &quot;Mariama Bâ ou les allées d&#x27;un destin&quot; by her daughter, Mame Coumba Ndiaye. It was praised by Jean-Marie Volet as &quot;a fascinating, considerate and enlightening&quot; book. 

===Mariama Bâ Boarding School (Maison d&#x27;Education Mariama Bâ)===
The Mariama Bâ Boarding School is a top boarding school on Gorée, an island in Senegal. It was founded in 1977 by Leopold Sedar Senghor, first president of Senegal. The school was named after Mariama Bâ because of what she stood for, spoke and wrote about. It admits young women who obtained the highest scores during the national secondary school entry exam. Each year, about 25 female students from the 11 regions of Senegal, are given the opportunity to attend Mariama Bâ boarding school for the rest of their high school years. The curriculum is similar to secondary education in France in that it has seven levels, and students finish with their baccalaureat. In 2009, Jana Films, a Spanish production company, filmed a documentary about the school, directed by Ana Rodríguez Rosell.

<doc id="438425" wikidata="Q1429439" url="?curid=438425" title="Logical volume management">
<text>In computer storage, logical volume management or LVM provides a method of allocating space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes to store volumes. In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine partitions (or block devices in general) into larger virtual partitions that administrators can re-size or move, potentially without interrupting system use.

Volume management represents just one of many forms of storage virtualization; its implementation takes place in a layer in the device-driver stack of an operating system (OS) (as opposed to within storage devices or in a network).

== Design ==
Most volume-manager implementations share the same basic design. They start with physical volumes (PVs), which can be either hard disks, hard disk partitions, or Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) of an external storage device. Volume management treats each PV as being composed of a sequence of chunks called physical extents (PEs). Some volume managers (such as that in HP-UX and Linux) have PEs of a uniform size; others (such as that in Veritas) have variably-sized PEs that can be split and merged at will.

Normally, PEs simply map one-to-one to logical extents (LEs). With mirroring, multiple PEs map to each LE. These PEs are drawn from a physical volume group (PVG), a set of same-sized PVs which act similarly to hard disks in a RAID1 array. PVGs are usually laid out so that they reside on different disks or data buses for maximum redundancy.

The system pools LEs into a &quot;volume group&quot; (VG). The pooled LEs can then be concatenated together into virtual disk partitions called logical volumes or LVs. Systems can use LVs as raw block devices just like disk partitions: creating mountable file systems on them, or using them as swap storage.

Striped LVs allocate each successive LE from a different PV; depending on the size of the LE, this can improve performance on large sequential reads by bringing to bear the combined read-throughput of multiple PVs.

Administrators can grow LVs (by concatenating more LEs) or shrink them (by returning LEs to the pool). The concatenated LEs do not have to be contiguous. This allows LVs to grow without having to move already-allocated LEs. Some volume managers allow the re-sizing of LVs in either direction while online. Changing the size of the LV does not necessarily change the size of a file system on it; it merely changes the size of its containing space. A file system that can be resized online is recommended in that it allows the system to adjust its storage on-the-fly without interrupting applications.

PVs and LVs cannot be shared between or span different VGs (although some volume managers may allow moving them at will between VGs on the same host). This allows administrators conveniently to bring VGs online, to take them offline or to move them between host systems as a single administrative unit.

VGs can grow their storage pool by absorbing new PVs or shrink by retracting from PVs. This may involve moving already-allocated LEs out of the PV. Most volume managers can perform this movement online; if the underlying hardware is hot-pluggable this allows engineers to upgrade or replace storage without system downtime.

==Concepts==

=== Hybrid volume ===
A hybrid volume is any volume that intentionally and opaquely makes use of two separate physical volumes. For instance, a workload may consist of random seeks so an SSD may be used to permanently store frequently used or recently written data, while using higher-capacity rotational magnetic media for long-term storage of rarely needed data. On Linux, bcache or dm-cache may be used for this purpose, while Fusion Drive may be used on OS X. ZFS also implements this functionality at the file system level, by allowing administrators to configure multi-level read/write caching.

Hybrid volumes present a similar concept as hybrid drives, which also combine solid-state storage and rotational magnetic media.

===Snapshots===
Some volume managers also implement snapshots by applying copy-on-write to each LE. In this scheme, the volume manager will copy the LE to a &quot;copy-on-write table&quot; just before it is written to. This preserves an old version of the LV, the snapshot, which may be later reconstructed by overlaying the copy-on-write table atop the current LV. Unless the volume management supports both thin provisioning and discard, once an LE in the origin volume is written to, it is permanently stored in the snapshot volume. If the snapshot volume was made smaller than its origin, which is a common practice, this may render the snapshot inoperable.

Snapshots can be useful for backing up self-consistent versions of volatile data such as table files from a busy database, or for rolling back large changes (such as an operating system upgrade) in a single operation. Snapshots have a similar effect as rendering storage quiescent, and are similar to the shadow copy (VSS) service in Microsoft Windows. 

Some Linux-based Live CDs also use snapshots to simulate read-write access to a read-only optical disc.

== Implementations ==

== Disadvantages ==
Logical volumes can suffer from external fragmentation when the underlying storage devices do not allocate their PEs contiguously. This can reduce I/O performance on slow-seeking media such as magnetic disks and other rotational media. Volume managers that use fixed-size PEs, however, typically make PEs relatively large (for example, Linux LVM uses 4 MB by default) in order to amortize the cost of these seeks.

With implementations that are solely volume management, such as Core Storage and Linux LVM, separating and abstracting away volume management from the file system loses the ability to easily make storage decisions for particular files or directories. For example, if a certain directory (but not the entire file system) is to be permanently moved to faster storage, both the file system layout and the underlying volume management layer need to be traversed. For example, on Linux it would be needed to manually determine the offset of a file&#x27;s contents within a file system and then manually the extents (along with data not related to that file) to the faster storage. Having volume and file management implemented within the same subsystem, instead of having them implemented as separate subsystems, makes the overall process theoretically simpler.

<doc id="438426" wikidata="Q624669" url="?curid=438426" title="Radio edit">
<text>In music, a radio edit, or radio mix, is a modification, typically truncated or censored, intended to make a song more suitable for airplay. It may be censored for profanity, vulgarities, or subject matter; or adjusted for length, instrumentation, or form. Radio edits may also be used for commercial single release radio versions, which may be denoted as the 7″ version (as opposed to the 12″ version, which is an extended version of a song).

Not all &quot;radio edit&quot; tracks are played on the radio.

==Time constraints==
Radio edits often shorten a long song to make it more commercially viable for radio stations. The normal length for songs played on the radio is between three and five minutes. The amount of cut content differs, ranging from a few seconds to nearly half of the song. It is common for radio edits to have shortened intros and/or outros. In the intro, any kind of musical buildup is removed, or, if there is no such buildup, an extensive intro is often halved. In the outro, a song may simply fade out earlier, common on tracks with long instrumental endings, or, if it does not fade out, a part before the ending will be cut or faded. If necessary, many radio edits will also edit out verses, choruses, bridges, or interludes in between. An example is the radio edit of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;, which fades in shortly before the beginning of the third verse and fades out shortly before the vocal vamping at the end of the song.

Some songs are remixed heavily for radio edits and feature different arrangements than the original longer versions, occasionally even being completely different to the studio recordings. A popular example of this is &quot;Revolution&quot; by the Beatles, a completely different recording from the version (&quot;Revolution 1&quot;) which appears on their White Album.

Some lengthy songs do not have a radio edit, despite being as long as 5–8 minutes in length. Examples of this include: &quot;Vicarious&quot; by Tool at 7:06, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; by the Beatles at 7:11, and &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; by Led Zeppelin at 8:03. The idea of extended songs receiving airplay on commercial radio was extremely rare until the birth of progressive radio in the mid-1960s; most rock music formats descend from progressive radio, and as such, rock songs tend to be played at their original length, longer than songs of other genres.

On rare occasions, a radio edit may even be longer than the original album version. This may occur when the song is edited for form, such as in the cases of &quot;Creep&quot; by Radiohead, &quot;2 On&quot; by Tinashe, and &quot;Miserable&quot; by Lit. &quot;Creep&quot;″s radio edit has a four-second drumstick count off before the regular first second, &quot;2 On&quot; repeats part of the chorus one more time than it does on the original album version, and &quot;Miserable&quot;″s radio edit adds the chorus between the first and second verses. Some radio edits lengthen some parts of the song while shortening others. For example, the radio edit of &quot;Thinking Out Loud&quot; by Ed Sheeran has a six-second introduction before the first verse but later in the song cuts from the end of the second verse to the beginning of the last chorus, omitting the second chorus and the guitar solo.

The syndicated radio format &quot;QuickHitz&quot;, notably adopted and then quickly abandoned by the Calgary radio station CKMP-FM in August–September 2014, utilized even shorter edits of songs, from 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes in length.

==Offensive content==
Radio edits often come with any necessary censorship done to conform to decency standards imposed by government agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas in the Philippines, the Korea Communications Commission in South Korea, the Australian Communications and Media Authority in Australia, and Ofcom in the United Kingdom. The offending words may be silenced, reversed, distorted, or replaced by a tone or sound effect. The edits may come from the record label itself, broadcasters at the corporate level before the song is sent for airplay to their stations, or in rarer cases, at a radio station itself depending on local standards.

Radio edits may have more or fewer words edited than the &quot;clean version&quot;, because of the stations&#x27; or agencies&#x27; standards. A &quot;dirty&quot; radio edit preserving the sound of the offensive word or words but maintaining the shorter play time may be produced, which may be aimed at club play, nighttime radio, and non-terrestrial radio stations. After two million copies of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot; (1996) had already been shipped, the lyrics of the original track with the words &quot;Jew me&quot; and &quot;kike me&quot; were replaced with &quot;do me&quot; and &quot;strike me&quot; due to its controversial antisemitic references. Radio edit versions of the track remained with the original version until the edited version was pressed and released. An example occurs in Lady Gaga&#x27;s song &quot;Poker Face&quot; (2008), where the line &quot;P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face&quot; has barely noticeable profanities. Some radio stations repeated the word &quot;poker&quot; from the first part of the line, while others played the original version. A promotional original audio recording studio radio version is available containing both of these versions. The edited version is also available on the compilation &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 31&quot; in the US.

In an unusual case, Lizzo&#x27;s &quot;Truth Hurts&quot; (2017) was edited locally in June 2019 by the market-leading Top 40 station WIXX in Green Bay, Wisconsin, not because of inappropriate content, but due to Lizzo&#x27;s reference in a lyric to an unnamed new player on the Minnesota Vikings. As WIXX is one of three flagship stations for the Green Bay Packers&#x27; radio network and features wraparound content involving the Packers, the station determined that referencing their hometown football team&#x27;s closest rival positively would be jarring to local listeners.

Some individual stations may be more lenient with words that tread the broadcast-appropriate line, depending on their management and programming format; for instance, a rhythmic AC, classic hits, adult contemporary or urban contemporary station may indeed make several radio edits to a song to appeal to a broad base of listeners, while a rhythmic contemporary, modern rock or hip hop-focused station might be more apt to have a light hand in their radio edits to appeal both to listeners and artists who would be favorable to the station&#x27;s reputation. Some edits might even be done for promotional reasons; for instance a song that mentions a city&#x27;s name or a certain radio station might see a special &#x27;station cut&#x27; where the station and its community are mentioned in the song (as heard in Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;You and I&quot; (2011), which has a reference to Nebraska that is easily substituted with another region, state or city; similarly, Sia&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; (2015) is sometimes edited to replace the line &quot;turn the radio on&quot; with &quot;...turn [station name] on&quot; to promote the radio station on which the song is playing).

<doc id="438428" wikidata="Q1198887" url="?curid=438428" title="Music director">
<text>A music director, musical director or director of music is the person responsible for the musical aspects of a performance, production, or organization. This would include the artistic director and usually chief conductor of an orchestra or concert band, the director of music of a film, the director of music at a radio station, the person in charge of musical activities or the head of the music department in a school, the coordinator of the musical ensembles in a university, college, or institution (but not usually the head of the academic music department), the head bandmaster of a military band, the head organist and choirmaster of a church, or an organist and master of the choristers (the title given to a director of music at a cathedral, particularly in England).

==Orchestra==
The title of &quot;music director&quot; or &quot;musical director&quot; is used by many symphony orchestras to designate the primary conductor and artistic leader of the orchestra. The term &quot;music director&quot; is most common for orchestras in the United States. With European orchestras, the titles of &quot;principal conductor&quot; or &quot;chief conductor&quot; are more common, which designate the conductor who directs the majority of a given orchestra&#x27;s concerts in a season. In musical theatre and opera, the music director is in charge of the overall musical performance, including ensuring that the cast knows the music thoroughly, supervising the musical interpretation of the performers and pit orchestra, and conducting the orchestra.

In the 20th century, the title and position typically brought with it an almost unlimited influence over the particular orchestra&#x27;s affairs. As implied by the name, the music director not only conducts concerts, but also controls what music the orchestra will perform or record, and has much authority regarding hiring, firing, and other personnel decisions over an orchestra&#x27;s musicians. Such authoritarian rule, once expected and even thought necessary for a symphonic ensemble to function properly, has loosened somewhat in the closing decades of the 20th century with the advent and encouragement of more power sharing and cooperative management styles (with the orchestra musicians themselves, the administrative staff, and volunteer board of directors). The music director in American lingo also assists with fund-raising, and also is the primary focus of publicity for the orchestra, as what is often called its &quot;public face&quot;.

The term &quot;music director&quot; or &quot;musical director&quot; became common in the United States in the middle of the 20th century, following an evolution of titles. Early leaders of orchestras were simply designated as the &quot;conductor.&quot; In the 1920s and 1930s, the term musical director began to be used, in order to delineate the fact that the person in this position was doing much more than just conducting, and to differentiate them from guest conductors who simply led one particular program or concert. George Szell, for instance, was appointed as &quot;musical director&quot; of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1946, and his position was so named until his death in 1970. His successor, Lorin Maazel, was given the title &quot;music director.&quot; Other major American orchestras kept more current with the times and began using the simpler term in the 1950s and 1960s.

The term can also refer to the person who directs a school band or heads the music program.

==Film and theatre==
Alternatively, the term &quot;music director&quot; used to appear in the film credits for a professional hired to supervise and direct the music selected for a film or music documentary, but today the more common designation is music supervisor.

===India===

In India, where many films are produced as musicals, the term &quot;music director&quot; is commonly used for the composer and music producer of the songs and score used in the film. Their roles also entail arranging, mastering, mixing and supervising recording of film music with conducting and orchestration. Usually, another artist will receive the credit for the lyrics of the songs.

===Theatrical productions===
The &quot;music director&quot; for a theatrical production or Broadway or West End musical often serves as rehearsal pianist and conductor. This music director is often also the vocal coach, may also be involved in arranging material for new works, or collaborate on underscoring. There was a Tony Award category for Best Musical Director beginning in 1948, but it was discontinued in 1964 in part due to the fluid responsibilities of musical directors.

==Broadcasting==
A music director of a radio station is responsible for interacting with record company representatives, auditioning new music, offering commentary, and making decisions (sometimes in conjunction with the program director) as to which songs get airplay, how much and when. In college radio, there may be more than one music director, as students usually volunteer only a few hours each per week, and most stations have a diverse and extensive library of several different music genres.

==Military==

In the British Armed Forces, a director of music is a commissioned officer, always a musician commissioned from the ranks, who leads a military band. A non-commissioned officer or warrant officer who leads a band is called a bandmaster.

==Pop music==
In pop music, a musical director or &quot;MD&quot; is responsible for supervising the musical arrangements and personnel for a touring artist. This can include festivals and televised performances as well as those at traditional on-stage venues. In the modern era, the sound of a studio recording is often impossible or impractical to reproduce on stage, and it is the music director&#x27;s job to assemble musicians and arrangements to adapt that material to a live setting (which may or may not include playback of prerecorded tracks). The music director generally leads rehearsals as well as each performance, allowing the lead artist to focus on performing.

==Germany and Austria==
 (GMD, general music director) is a German title for the artistic director of an orchestra, an institution or a town.

A music director (Latin: &quot;director musices&quot;) was originally the title of the person responsible for music in a town in Germany and Austria. Johann Sebastian Bach was music director in Leipzig, Georg Philipp Telemann and later Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach were music directors in Hamburg, Robert Schumann was music director in Düsseldorf.

&quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; is a title given by larger towns to a person typically responsible for a symphony orchestra and the opera. The first person with this title was Gaspare Spontini in Berlin in 1819. Daniel Barenboim has been &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin from 1992 to 2023.

==Other uses==
Brass bands, wind bands, choirs, opera companies and other ensembles may also have musical directors.

<doc id="438431" wikidata="Q1035157" url="?curid=438431" title="Captal de Buch">
<text>Captal de Buch (later Buché; from Latin &quot;capitalis&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;) was a medieval feudal title in Gascony held by Jean III de Grailly among others.

According to Du Cange, the designation &quot;captal&quot; (&quot;capital, captau, capitau&quot;) was applied loosely to the more illustrious nobles of Aquitaine, counts, viscounts, &amp;c., probably as &quot;capitales domini&quot;, &quot;principal lords&quot;, though he quotes more fanciful explanations. As an actual title, the word was used only by the seigneurs of Trene, Puychagut, Epernon and Buch.

Buch was a strategically located town and port on the Atlantic, in the bay of Arcachon. 

When Pierre, the seigneur of Grailly ( – 1356) married Asalide (the &quot;captaline de Buch&quot;), the heiress of Pierre-Amanieu de Bordeaux, captal de Buch, in 1307, the title passed into the Grailly family, a line of fighting seigneurs with origins in Savoy.

The title is best known in connexion with the famous soldier Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch (r. 1343–1376), the &quot;captal de Buch&quot; par excellence, immortalized by Jean Froissart as the confidant of the Black Prince and the champion of the English cause against France during the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He played a decisive role as a cavalry leader in the Battle of Poitiers (1356). In 1364, he ravaged the country between Paris and Rouen, but was beaten by Bertrand du Guesclin at the Battle of Cocherel (1364) and taken prisoner. Released next year, he received the seigniory of Nemours and took the oath of fealty to the French king, Charles V, but soon resigned his new fief and returned to his allegiance to the English king. In 1367, he took part in the Battle of Navarrete (1367) in which Du Guesclin was taken prisoner, the captal being entrusted with his safe-keeping. In 1371, Jean de Grailly was appointed constable of Aquitaine, but was taken prisoner next year and interned in the Temple in Paris where, resisting all the tempting offers of the French king, he remained until his death five years later.

<text>Anders is a male name in Scandinavian languages and Fering North Frisian, an equivalent of the Greek Andreas (&quot;manly&quot;) and the English Andrew. It originated from Andres via metathesis.

In Sweden, Anders has been one of the most common names for many centuries, earliest attested in 1378. It was common for priests and farmers during medieval times. According to Statistics Sweden, as of 31 December 2021 it ranks 4th among the male names. The great frequency of this name at the point in time (around 1900) when patronymics were converted into family names is the reason why 1 out of every 30 Swedes today is called Andersson.

The name day of Anders in the Scandinavian calendar is 30 November, and in the old peasant superstition that day was important for determining what the Christmas weather would be. If it was very cold on 30 November there would be much sleet on Christmas (and vice versa).

In Denmark Donald Duck&#x27;s name is &quot;Anders And&quot;.

The Fering name Anders may have been borrowed from the Danish version.

<doc id="438443" wikidata="Q2918654" url="?curid=438443" title="Workplace politics">
<text>Workplace politics involves processes and behaviors in human interactions that include power and authority. It serves as a tool to assess operational capacity and balance diverse views of interested parties. Also known as office politics and organizational politics, it involves the use of power and social networking within a workplace to achieve changes that benefit individuals within it. According to Michael Aamodt, &quot;Organizational politics are self-serving behaviors that employees use to increase the probability of obtaining positive outcomes in organizations&quot;. Influence by individuals may serve personal interests without regard to their effect on the organization. Personal advantages may include access to tangible assets or intangible benefits such as status and pseudo-authority that influences others.

== Positive and negative politics ==
* Positive politics includes behaviors designed to influence others with the goal of helping both the organization and the individual. Examples include portraying a professional image, publicizing accomplishments, volunteering, and complimenting others. Organizational politics can increase efficiency, form interpersonal relationships, expedite change, and benefit both the organization and its members.

* Negative politics involves behaviors aimed at personal gain at the expense of others and the organization. Examples include spreading rumors, talking behind someone&#x27;s back, and withholding important information. Such actions can negatively impact social groupings, cooperation, information sharing, and other organizational functions. It is crucial to manage organizational politics to create a conducive political landscape.

== Psychological aspects ==
Psychologist Oliver James identifies the dark triadic personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism) as central in understanding office politics.

John Eldred describes politics as &quot;simply how power gets worked out on a practical, day-to-day basis&quot;. Jarie Bolander emphasizes that &quot;Politics is the lubricant that oils your organization&#x27;s internal gears&quot;.

==The political landscape==

Political landscape is a set of hierarchies that link the political players together. In other words, political landscape is what defines relationships between colleagues at a given time. Drafting of this landscape begins with the leaders of the organization influencing the &quot;formal hierarchy&quot;; which defines the reporting structure and indicates the political setup of the organization as it was initially intended. Organizational hierarchies, each members with its own unique political challenges, depend on many factors of the given organization. Said factors include organizational goals, size of the organization, number of resources available and the type of leaders within the organization. Political landscape will change as individuals are introduced into the organizational mix. 
During the process of working together an &quot;informal hierarchy&quot; is established. The main link between individuals on a political landscape is the access to-in addition to-the flow of information. This hierarchy can be identified by applying numerical values to relationships in proportion to how much two individuals rate and value one another. The sum value of these relating to an individual establishes the place on the hierarchy. Two or more people estimating relationships and merging results can produce more certain results. People quickly realize who the boss is, whom they depend on for valuable information, and who knows all the office gossip. It is very important to recognize where you fit in this landscape and what power and influence you have within the organization. It is important not only to use that power in pursuit of the organization&#x27;s goals, but also to ensure others do not abuse it. &quot;Each player in the organization has a role in the politics that grease the wheels of getting things done.&quot;

==Gossip==

Office politics differs from office gossip in that people participating in office politics do so with the objective of gaining advantage, whereas gossip can be a purely social activity. However, the two are somewhat related. Office gossip is often used by an individual to place themselves at a point where they can control the flow of information, and therefore gain maximum advantage. The secretive nature of organizational politics differentiates it from public gossip and thus, may be more harmful to the organization. Both can cause one to doubt the intentions of co-workers, which creates a hostile work environment. Office politics also refers to the way co-workers act among each other. Employee interaction holds the potential to be either positive or negative (i.e. cooperative or competitive).

==Manipulation==

At the root of office politics is the issue of manipulation. Manipulation can be present in any relationship where one or more of the parties involved uses indirect means to carry out an agenda. In a workplace where resources are limited, individuals often find themselves presented with an opportunity to carry out a personal agenda at the expense of their colleagues. For example, if six people apply for one promotion, they might expect the selection to be made purely on merit. If one of the candidates were to believe that this would put them at a disadvantage, they may use other means of coercion or influence to put themselves into an advantageous position. When those who have fallen subject to the manipulation begin to talk to each other directly—or when other evidence comes to light such as financial results—the manipulator will have an explanation ready but will already be planning their exit, as they are driven to stay in control, not to face a revelation which would expose their behavior. This can also take the form of influencing others not to hire strong candidates in order to prevent one&#x27;s own status and authority from being diminished by a high achiever. For example, a for a position that requires a high technical level on competency, a manipulator who feels threatened might persuade others to vote against the candidate because they lack marketing experience, even though the responsibilities for the position do not include marketing.

==Aims==

The aims of office politics or manipulation in the workplace are not always increased pay or a promotion. Often, the goal may simply be greater power or control for its own end; or to discredit a competitor. Office politics do not necessarily stem from purely selfish gains. They can be a route towards corporate benefits, which give a leg up to the company as a whole, not just an individual. &quot;A &#x27;manipulator&#x27; will often achieve career or personal goals by co-opting as many colleagues as possible into their plans.&quot; Despite the fact that the hidden agenda is a personal victory, allying with unsuspecting co-workers strengthens the manipulator&#x27;s personal position and ensures that they will be the last person accused of wrongdoing.

==Issues==

Office politics is a major issue in business because the individuals who manipulate their working relationships consume time and resources for their own gain at the expense of the team or company.

In addition to this problem, the practice of office politics can have an even more serious effect on major business processes such as strategy formation, budget setting, performance management, and leadership. This occurs because when individuals are playing office politics, it interferes with the information flow of a company. Information can be distorted, misdirected, or suppressed, in order to manipulate a situation for short-term personal gain.

==Games==

One way of analyzing office politics in more detail is to view it as a series of games. These games can be analyzed and described in terms of the type of game and the payoff. Interpersonal games are games that are played between peers (for example the game of &quot;No Bad News&quot; where individuals suppress negative information, and the payoff is not risking upsetting someone); leadership games are played between supervisor and employee (for example the game of &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; where the supervisor sets their employees against each other, with the payoff that none threatens their power base); and budget games are played with the resources of an organization (for example the game of &quot;Sandbagging&quot; where individuals negotiate a low sales target, and the payoff is a bigger bonus).

==Dealing with organizational politics==

Organizational politics is itself similar to a game, one that requires an assumption of risks just like any contact sport. &quot;It must be played with diligence and a full understanding of the landscape, players and rules.&quot; &quot;The dynamics of the situation should always dictate a reexamination of the players and how they fit into the landscape.&quot; One must be careful relying on alliances made on previous circumstances; once the situation changes, alliances need to be reassessed. Building strong alliances will maximize the efficiency of the collective political radar and alert you before conflicts arise. In time of conflict, data-driven employees who rely on hard facts will have an easier time diffusing political conflicts. Always looking out for the best interests of your company is a certain way to ensure that your motivation will remain unquestioned. L.A. Witt, from the University of New Orleans, through his findings, believes that if supervisors were to mold employee values to match their own, it would protect employees from the negative effects of organizational politics and help improve their performance.

== Early life and education ==
Annette Carol Bening was born on May 29, 1958 in Topeka, Kansas, to Shirley Katherine (née Ashley) and Arnett Grant Bening. Her mother was a church singer and soloist, and her father was a sales training consultant and insurance salesman. Her parents, originally from Iowa, were practicing Episcopalians and conservative Republicans. She is of mostly German and English descent.

The youngest of four children, she has an older sister Jane, and two older brothers Bradley and Byron. The family moved to Wichita, Kansas, in 1959, where she spent her early childhood. When Bening was in elementary school, her father relocated the family to San Diego, California, where she spent the remainder of her youth. 

She began acting in junior high school, playing the lead in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. She graduated in 1975 from San Diego&#x27;s Patrick Henry High School, where she studied drama. She then spent a year working as a cook on a charter boat taking fishing parties out on the Pacific Ocean, and scuba diving for recreation. Bening attended San Diego Mesa College and graduated with a degree in Theatre Arts at San Francisco State University.

==Career==

===1986–1999: Initial work, breakthrough and rise to prominence===

Bening began her career on stage with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival company in 1980, and appeared in plays at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. She was a member of the acting company at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while studying acting as part of the Advanced Theatre Training Program. There, she starred in such productions as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; as Lady Macbeth. Bening also starred in productions of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at the Denver Center Theatre Company during the 1985–86 season. She made her Broadway debut in 1987, garnering a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play and receiving a Theatre World Award for her performance as young photographer Holly Dancer in &quot;Coastal Disturbances&quot;. Bening made her film debut in &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; (1988), starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy. Her next role was as the Marquise de Merteuil in &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989) opposite Colin Firth.

Bening achieved her breakthrough with her performance as con artist Myra Langtry in the neo-noir crime thriller &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), for which she earned her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 1991, she portrayed Virginia Hill in Barry Levinson&#x27;s biopic &quot;Bugsy&quot;, alongside Warren Beatty. For &quot;Bugsy&quot;, she received her first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Bening co-starred with Harrison Ford in &quot;Regarding Henry&quot;. In 1994, Bening and Beatty starred together again, in &quot;Love Affair&quot;. In 1995, Bening played a leading role as an environmental lobbyist in &quot;The American President&quot; with Michael Douglas, a role she followed with Tim Burton&#x27;s sci-fi spoof &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Siege&quot; (1998), a thriller with Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis.

Bening garnered acclaim for her starring role in Sam Mendes&#x27; directorial debut film, &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the dark comedy-drama about a man suffering a mid-life crisis in 90s American suburbia. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. For her performance as Carolyn Burnham, a materialistic wife engaging in an affair, Bening won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, in addition to her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress and her second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

In 1999, Bening returned to the stage for the first time in 10 years playing the title role in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised her performance saying &quot;Bening uses her vocal instrument to fine effect, without throwing it around... In the movies you don&#x27;t always hear what Bening can do with that voice, especially when she&#x27;s playing virtuous, &quot;sensible&quot; types... But Ibsen&#x27;s antiheroine—thwarted sensualist, a woman wrestling with her inner troll, belle of a ball that never comes—is neither virtuous nor sensible. She&#x27;s no easy-to-read villain, either, nor a mere vindictive brat, though plenty of actresses have reduced her thus. Bening lays into the venomous sarcasm mighty heavily, but she&#x27;s cagey enough to avoid reductive extremes.&quot;

===2000–2014: Established actress===
Bening starred in other films, including &quot;In Dreams&quot; (1999) and &quot;What Planet Are You From?&quot; (2000). Bening played Sue Barlow in &quot;Open Range&quot; (2003).

<doc id="438452" wikidata="Q152061" url="?curid=438452" title="Green Line (MBTA)">
<text>The Green Line is a semi-metro system (form of light rail) run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. It is the oldest MBTA subway line, and with tunnel sections dating from 1897, the oldest subway in North America. It runs underground through downtown Boston, and on the surface into inner suburbs via six branches on radial boulevards and grade-separated alignments. With an average daily weekday ridership of 101,000 in 2023, it is among the most heavily used light rail systems in the country. The line was assigned the green color in 1967 during a systemwide rebranding because several branches pass through sections of the Emerald Necklace of Boston.

The four branches are the remnants of a large streetcar system, which began in 1856 with the Cambridge Horse Railroad and was consolidated into the Boston Elevated Railway several decades later. The branches all travel downtown through the Tremont Street subway, the oldest subway tunnel in North America. The Tremont Street subway opened its first section on September 1, 1897, to take streetcars off overcrowded downtown streets; it was extended five times over the next five decades. The streetcar system peaked in size around 1930 and was gradually replaced with trackless trolleys and buses, with cuts as late as 1985. The new D branch opened on a converted commuter rail line in 1959. The Green Line Extension project extended two branches into Somerville and Medford in 2022.

==Route description==

The Green Line&#x27;s core is the central subway, a group of tunnels which run through downtown Boston. The Tremont Street subway runs roughly north–south through downtown, with stations at , , , , and – all with connections to other lines of the MBTA subway system. The Boylston Street subway runs roughly east–west through the Back Bay neighborhood, with stations at , , , and ; it connects to the Tremont Street subway at Boylston. The Huntington Avenue subway diverges from the Boylston Street subway at a flat junction west of Copley, running southwest, with stations at and . A branch of the Tremont Street subway, disused since 1962, runs south from Boylston to the former Pleasant Street incline.

The Green Line has four western surface branches, each with a letter designation:
*The B branch runs west in a tunnel from Kenmore, surfacing in the median of Commonwealth Avenue at . It runs on Commonwealth Avenue through Boston University, Allston, and Brighton to Boston College station. 
*The C branch runs southwest in a tunnel from Kenmore, surfacing in the median of Beacon Street at . It runs on Beacon Street through Brookline to Cleveland Circle station. 
*The D branch diverges from the C branch tunnel southwest of Kenmore, surfacing at Fenway station. It runs though Brookline and Newton along the grade-separated Highland branch (a former Boston and Albany Railroad commuter rail line) to Riverside station. 
*The E branch runs southwest through the Huntington Avenue subway from Copley, surfacing in the median of Huntington Avenue at Northeastern University station. It runs along Huntington Avenue and South Huntington Avenue to , with the outer (west of ) in mixed traffic rather than a dedicated median. Until 1985, the line continued south through Jamaica Plain to .

B and C branch service terminates at Government Center, while D and E branch service continues north from downtown Boston. North of North Station, the line inclines up to the Lechmere Viaduct, which crosses the Charles River with an elevated station at . The elevated Lechmere station is located on the Green Line Extension viaduct, which continues north to a flying junction with two branches:
*The Union Square Branch runs west to Union Square station via the Fitchburg Line right-of-way. It is operated as part of the D branch.
*The Medford Branch runs northwest to Medford/Tufts station via the Lowell Line right-of-way. It is operated as part of the E branch.

===Former branches===
The Green Line A branch was the northernmost of the branches, running from the Blandford Street portal (still used by the B branch), west to Watertown, mostly street-running. The bus replaced the streetcar line in 1969. The A branch diverged from Commonwealth Avenue west of Boston University and ran to a terminus in Watertown, across the Charles River from Watertown Square, until 1969. Although the route-letter scheme had been introduced two years prior to its closure, the &quot;A&quot; designation was never signed on streetcars to Watertown. It was, however, included in the destination signs on the Boeing-Vertol LRVs ordered in the mid-1970s, when reopening service to Watertown was under consideration. The &quot;A&quot; line tracks remained in non-revenue service to access maintenance facilities at Watertown until 1994.

The Pleasant Street portal hosted two services in its final days. The to City Point ended in 1953, and the to Egleston was cut back to Lenox Street in 1956, cut back to the portal in 1961, and ended operation in 1962. Prior to that, the serviced Tremont Street to Dover Street and Washington Street, ending at , and last running in 1938.

The last two routes to continue beyond the Canal Street portal both ran to Sullivan. The ran via Main Street, last running in 1948, and the via Bunker Hill Street last ran in 1949. Until 1997, trains continued to use the portal and its North Station surface station as a terminal.

In addition to the lines that later became the E branch, the predecessors to the and split in Brookline, one branch running into the current &quot;E&quot; tracks and into the Boylston Street portal, and the other running up Brookline Street to end at Massachusetts Avenue station. These were truncated in 1932 into a shorter route from Brookline Village to the subway via the Boylston Street portal, which itself stopped running in 1938 (being cut back to Brigham Circle short-turn trips), three years before the closure of that portal.

The last &quot;foreign&quot; cars to operate in the subway were those of the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, running from the Canal Street portal to the Brattle Loop at Scollay Square until 1935. It was then that the old Mystic River Bridge to Chelsea was closed to streetcars and the lines were replaced by bus service; the next year the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) bought the Eastern Mass Chelsea Division and through-routed it with its lines connecting to the East Boston Tunnel at Maverick.

== Rolling stock ==
Like the three other MBTA subway lines, the line uses standard gauge tracks. However, instead of heavy rail metro rolling stock, the Green Line uses modern streetcars (light rail vehicles) as heavy rail stock would be inappropriate for the surface branches with their numerous grade crossings.

Only MBTA operated vehicles are included here, not cars from the Boston Elevated Railway era.

===History===
====Early rolling stock====

When it opened at the end of the 19th century, the Tremont Street subway was not intended as a full-scale rapid transit line (though it was built to semi-metro standards), but to allow ordinary streetcars to bypass the worst street congestion in downtown Boston. Operations by several different companies were eventually consolidated into the Boston Elevated Railway, which ran a mixture of car types. After receiving a test unit in 1937, the BERy began to standardize on PCC streetcars, acquiring 320 units between 1941 and 1951 plus an additional 25 in 1959 to phase out the last older cars. Beginning in 1923, all streetcars on the system were painted orange for maximum visibility in traffic. In 1971, the MBTA began painting Green Line streetcars in a green and white scheme to match the new line name.

Two older streetcars are on display on the unused outer inbound track at Boylston station, which formerly carried cars coming from the Pleasant Street portal. Car #5734, a Type 5 A-1 car built in 1924 and retired in 1959, is owned by the Seashore Trolley Museum, but resides semipermanently in Boston. PCC #3295, built in 1951 and retired in 1986, is owned by the MBTA. The cars were formerly used for fantrips, the most recent one being in 1998.

====Boeing LRV====

In the early 1970s, light rail—which had largely disappeared from North America after the slow decline of streetcar systems from the 1920s to the 1950s—was reintroduced as a method of urban renewal less expensive than conventional metro systems. In 1971, as part of a program to supply further work to defense contractors as the Vietnam War wound down, the Urban Mass Transit Administration selected Boeing Vertol as systems manager for a project to design a new generic light rail vehicle. The UMTA hoped that this &quot;US Standard Light Rail Vehicle&quot; would jumpstart the development of transit lines just as the standardized PCC streetcars had done decades prior.

Boston (with its older streetcar tunnel systems) and San Francisco (with a new Muni Metro streetcar tunnel being built as part of BART construction) were chosen as the testbeds for this new rolling stock. The vehicle was designed as the largest rolling stock that would fit through the Tremont Street tunnel, the Muni Metro&#x27;s Twin Peaks Tunnel, and SEPTA&#x27;s subway–surface lines tunnel. The new cars were faster—a top speed of versus the PCC&#x27;s —and had an articulated middle section for higher capacity.

Boeing began construction of 175 cars for the MBTA in May 1973. The first LRVs entered service on the D branch in December 1976 but were immediately beset with problems. Certain cars frequently derailed on tight turns in the Riverside, Boston College and Lechmere yards. Battery trays, air conditioners—mounted under the cars, continually drawing in dirt and debris from under the car when in the tunnels—and air compressors all suffered numerous failures; the plug-style doors had trouble sealing properly; and traction motors failed sooner than expected.

Desperate for reliable rolling stock, in 1977 MBTA launched an overhaul program to extend the availability of its older PCC cars. A total of 34 cars, primarily out-of-service wrecks and parts cars, were rebuilt to as-new condition. , some of these rebuilt PCC cars still run on the Mattapan Line.

After years of fighting between the MBTA and Boeing-Vertol, both sides reached a settlement in 1979. MBTA was allowed to reject the final 40 SLRVs, and Boeing would return $40 million to MBTA for the cost of repairs and modifications to several cars.

====Modern fleet====
In the early 1980s, with a final settlement with Boeing in place, MBTA started looking for new equipment to supplement and replace the problematic LRVs.

In 1980, the MBTA tested Canadian Light Rail Vehicles for three months to determine whether they could be used on the Green Line. The MBTA ultimately found them unsuitable.

Ultimately, the MBTA purchased LRVs from the Japanese firm Kinki Sharyo. These Type 7 were designed with the best features of the US SLRV, the Canadian LRV, and the PCC cars. A total of 120 Type 7 vehicles were purchased, 100 were delivered between 1986 and 1988, and an additional 20 cars ordered and delivered in 1997.

Low-floor LRVs were added starting in 1998, allowing for accessible boarding directly from slightly raised platforms. MBTA ordered 100 of these Type 8 cars from Italian company AnsaldoBreda. The first Type 8s entered revenue service in March 1999, and quickly proved problematic and difficult to maintain: the first cars failed every , far short of the specified by the MBTA, and were prone to derailment at higher speeds as well as brake problems, echoing the problems with the Boeing stock. In December 2004, the MBTA canceled orders for the cars still to be delivered as part of the authority&#x27;s nine-year, US$225 million deal with Breda. One year later, in December 2005 the MBTA announced that it had entered into a restructuring of the deal, reducing the order to 85 cars (with spare parts to be provided in lieu of the 15 remaining cars), and providing for the remaining payment under the original deal only if the cars met performance requirements. Construction of the last car under the order was completed on December 14, 2006. Ultimately, 10 additional cars would be assembled and delivered in late 2007, with five spare shells retained (95 cars in service). The MBTA was criticized for their failure to assess Bredas&#x27; reliability before entering into the deal, and during delivery. The agency was also forced to spend an additional to modify tracks to prevent derailments and the Type 8 fleet was unable to be used on the D branch (where cars reach full speed) after those modifications were complete in 2008.

As the final Type 8s were delivered, the last of the Boeing-Vertol cars were retired in March 2007 and all except ten of the cars were scrapped. Of the remaining cars, six were sold to the US Government and are now in Pueblo, Colorado for testing purposes, one was given to the Seashore Trolley Museum, and three were retained by the MBTA for work service.

In 2006, as part of a legal settlement, the MBTA committed to always operate at least one low-floor car in each train, with no trains consisting only of Type 7 cars.

Of the 120 Type 7 cars, 103 were overhauled by Alstom in Hornell, New York. The work includes new propulsion systems, climate control systems and interiors as well as exterior work. The pilot car for the program left in October 2012 and was returned in November 2014, with the last car overhauled in April 2019.

=====Type 9=====
Twenty-four new Type 9 Green Line cars were delivered between 2017 and 2020. Revenue service began in late 2018 and all 24 cars were planned to enter service by the fall of 2019, although actual acceptance continued through 2021. The Type 9 cars will provide additional rolling stock to allow for Green Line Extension operations, and will not replace any of the existing fleet. The cars were made by CAF USA, Inc., with the shells and frames made in Spain, and final assembly and testing done at their plant in Elmira, New York. , the first unit had been expected to enter passenger service in Spring 2018, with all 24 cars in service by the end of the year. The first Type 9 car, #3900, began revenue service on December 21, 2018.
==== Future fleet ====

Planning for a Type 10 fleet—which would replace all Type 7 and Type 8 cars in the mid-2020s—began in 2018 with plans for a fully low floor fleet. At long, Type 10 cars would be significantly longer than the existing fleet, and carry twice as many passengers as existing cars. The MBTA released a request for proposals in December 2019, with notice to proceed expected to be given in 2021. In June 2021, the MBTA indicated that the initial order would be for 102 LRVs operating as single cars, with two-car trains deferred for a later project with federal funding. Manufacturer bids were due in July 2021.

The MBTA awarded a $811 million contract to CAF USA on August 31, 2022, to manufacture 102 seven-segment Type 10 &quot;Supercar&quot; LRVs. Four pilot vehicles are to be delivered in spring 2026, with deliveries of two LRVs per month from spring 2027 to spring 2031. The contract included options for additional LRVs. As a separately-funded project, Lake Street Yard will be fully reconstructed to support Type 10 vehicles, with Riverside Yard and the GLX Vehicle Maintenance Facility also modified. When the Type 10 cars are delivered, the Type 9 fleet is expected to be transferred over to the Mattapan Line, replacing the PCC streetcars.
==Accessibility==


The Red Line, Blue Line, and Orange Line run rapid transit cars and use stations with high platforms level with the car floor providing easy access for the disabled. The Green Line originated as a streetcar line, and used a variety of streetcars before converting to light rail vehicles.

Originally all the Green Line stations had platforms at track level, and passengers had to ascend several steps up into the vehicles. This limited accessibility for persons with disabilities. To address this issue and comply with changing federal and state laws, additional facilities have been added:

* Wheelchair lifts have been provided at some stops. They are rolled up to the car door and the lift mechanism is operated using a hand crank. They are quite time-consuming to operate, causing significant delays when used during peak periods.
* Short platforms level with car floors, accessed by ramps, were installed just before or after selected stations. Because the car door arrangement required a large gap between the platform and the car, a bridge plate attached to the raised platform had to be positioned after the train stopped with a door at that platform.
* The MBTA has followed the worldwide trend of operating low-floor streetcars. Platforms are being raised slightly to about the height of a street curb. Low-floor cars have remotely controlled bridge plates at the center doors to allow wheelchairs and strollers to reach the car floor a few inches higher. , the D branch will be the first branch to be completely retrofitted with raised platforms as part of this program.

==History==
Beginning in the 1850s, Boston sprouted a large network of horsecar lines, the first public transit in the city. The West End Street Railway was created by the state legislature in 1887 to build a single line, but soon consolidated many of the existing lines into a single privately owned system with consistent fares and route designations. The Allston – Park Square line (which served the general area of the A branch) was the first section to be converted to electric traction in 1889. It used modified existing horsecars outfitted with Frank J. Sprague&#x27;s revolutionary electrical equipment, which had first been demonstrated the previous year in Richmond, Virginia. In 1897, the West End Street Railway property was handed over to the Boston Elevated Railway in the form of a 24-year lease, and the companies were ultimately combined.

By the early 1890s, the sheer quantity of streetcars during peak periods was clogging the streets of downtown Boston. The Tremont Street subway, the first passenger subway in North America, was opened in stages in 1897 and 1898, with underground stations at Boylston, Park Street, Scollay Square, Adams Square, and Haymarket. The Main Line Elevated was run through the tunnel from 1901, displacing through-running streetcars, until it was rerouted to its own Washington Street Tunnel in 1908, and the streetcars were returned to the Tremont tunnel.

Though initially intended merely to clear streetcars from the busiest sections of downtown streets, the Tremont Street subway became useful as a rapid transit service in its own right. The 1912 completion of the Causeway Street Elevated and Lechmere Viaduct extended grade-separated service to Lechmere Square in Cambridge, and in 1922 the Lechmere transfer station was built. In 1914, the Boylston Street subway opened as a westward extension to just short of Kenmore Square, and in 1933 Kenmore station and short tunnel extensions towards two surface lines were added. In 1941, the Huntington Avenue subway and its two additional underground stations removed the last surface streetcars from downtown Boston.

Beginning in the 1930s, the massive surface streetcar system was &quot;bustituted&quot; with buses and trackless trolleys which had lower operating costs and more flexible routes. As the 1950s closed out, the only remaining streetcar lines were the Watertown Line, Commonwealth Avenue Line, Beacon Street Line, Arborway Line, and the Lenox Street Line plus several short turn services. In 1959, the Boston and Albany Railroad&#x27;s Highland Branch was converted to the Riverside Line, a fully grade-separated suburban service. In 1961, the last through service to Lenox Street via the Pleasant Street portal ended, though a Pleasant Street – Boylston shuttle continued for one more year. In 1963, part of the original subway was rebuilt under Government Center, abandoning and partially demolishing Adams Square station.

In 1947, the now-bankrupt BERy was replaced by the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.). The new agency was unpopular, even spawning a popular protest song; in 1964, it was replaced with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which had an expanded funding area to preserve suburban commuter rail lines. In 1967, as part of a systemwide rebranding that included new station names and color names for the transit lines, the remaining streetcar services were designated the &quot;Green Line&quot; because several of them traveled near the Emerald Necklace park system. The streetcar lines were given letter designations: &quot;A&quot; to the Watertown Line, &quot;B&quot; to the Commonwealth Avenue Line, &quot;C&quot; to the Beacon Street Line, &quot;D&quot; to the Riverside Line, and &quot;E&quot; to the Arborway Line.

The Watertown Line ran mostly in mixed traffic after diverging from Commonwealth Avenue; it was permanently replaced with buses in 1969. The section of the Arborway Line past Heath Street was &quot;temporarily&quot; – ultimately permanently – bustituted in 1985. In 2001, with new low-floor streetcars entering service, the MBTA began retrofitting underground stations and major surface stops with low raised platforms for accessibility for all. In 2004, the Causeway Street Elevated was replaced with a new tunnel under the Boston Garden, which consolidated the Orange Line and Green Line at a new North Station &quot;superstation&quot;, while continuing to connect to Commuter Rail service north of Boston.

The name &quot;Green Line&quot; was assigned in 1967 as part of a major reorganization of the MBTA system&#x27;s branding. In the 1970s, the Green Line and all other MBTA lines were re-evaluated by the Boston Transportation Planning Review for region-wide efficacy and future modernization alternatives initiated as far as physical plant and operating measures.

==Operations and signaling==

, each of the four branches operate on 7- to 9-minute headways during weekday peak hours, and 8- to 12-minute headways at other times. Vehicle usage ranges from 45 trains (90 cars) to 62 trains (124 cars).

Unlike the MBTA&#x27;s heavy rail subway lines, the Green Line has only limited central control and monitoring. This also means that it has lagged behind the other three rail lines in the availability of countdown signs and &quot;next train&quot; arrival information. The line is signalled with advisory wayside signals, except on surface portions in street medians or in-street running. Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere to the surface portals at Kenmore, and along the entire length of the D–Riverside branch. There are no automatic protection devices, but the cars have track brakes, giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.

The line is monitored from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service is shared by the control room and field personnel along the right of way. Track circuit and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of track circuit indications, the AVI system is displayed in the control room to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. Track circuit indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking was expected by early 2015.

The MBTA typically runs two-car trains at all times. The last scheduled use of one-car trains on weekdays was in March 2007. Three-car trains were added on the B and D branches in 2010 – their first use since 2005 – and a four-car train was tested in April 2011. In March 2011, the number of three-car trains was substantially increased, including use on the E branch. However, three-car trains suffered from reliability problems and slow boarding. The use of three-car trains ended in March 2016.

=== Positive train control ===
The MBTA approved a $82.6 million contract in May 2019 for a train protection system for the Green Line. The system would enforce red signals and automatically stop a train if it approached another train too closely. The project was 28% complete by December 2021; installation of in-vehicle electronics was scheduled to be complete by September 2023, with wayside installation complete in June 2024 and full operation that December. A reallocation of funds in January 2022 shortened the project timeline, with completion expected in 2023. However, in January 2023, an NTSB report found that the project had been delayed to June 2025. The MBTA cancelled the contract in June 2024 citing a lack of progress and an inability by the contractor to complete the project. 

The MBTA worked with a different contractor to develop the GLTPS-2 system in two phases. Phase 1, expected to be installed on the existing Type 7, Type 8, and Type 9 fleet by the end of 2025, will be an operator warning system with alarms that trigger when a train is exceeding speed limits or is within of another train. Phase 2, which will be installed only on the Type 9 and future Type 10 fleet, adds automatic enforcement by braking and is planned to be finished by June 2028. A $112.5 million contract to install the system was approved in February 2025.

===Turnarounds===

Aside from the terminal stations, several locations have turnaround loops or crossover switches where trains can reverse direction for short turns. One of these, where northbound trains can turn southbound, is regularly used as the downtown terminal for two of the branches:

* At , a loop under City Hall Plaza. , this is the terminal of the B and C branches.

Several other loops and crossovers are not used in regular revenue service but may be used during construction work or service disruptions, or for non-revenue trains, with some having been regularly used as terminals in the past:
* At , a pair of pocket tracks allow reversing.
* At Government Center, the Brattle Loop allows southbound trains to turn northbound, however, this loop is currently only used during service disruptions.
* At , a loop connects the inner tracks. The MBTA plans to add a crossover to allow through movements from the terminating (inner) northbound platform at Park Street are expected to increase capacity and reliability.
* At , a loop allows eastbound (inbound) C and D branch trains to turn westbound.
* On the B branch, a pocket track at allows trains to reverse in either direction. It is sometimes used to reverse westbound trains to provide extra service in the subway. Occasionally-used crossovers are located at , , and east of .
* On the C branch, occasionally-used crossovers are located at and .
* On the D branch, occasionally-used crossovers are located west of , , , , , and . At Reservoir, the spur tracks to Reservoir Carhouse have platforms for short turn trains.
* On the E branch, crossovers are located at , , and , along with a siding at Northeastern. The Brigham Circle crossover is frequently used for short turns during traffic congestion on the street-running section of the line.

===Location tracking===

The Red, Orange, and Blue lines have block signalling systems that make tracking the location of trains easier. Signs in most station on those lines began to display real-time train information in late 2012 and early 2013, while data feeds have been available for smartphone applications since 2010. However, the wayside signalling system used in the Green Line&#x27;s tunnels and the D branch does not provide for that level of tracking, nor do the basic stop/go signals used on the street-level branch lines. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to provide full tracking data for the Green Line by 2015, allowing use of smartphone applications and in-station countdown signs. The $13.4 million system is funded by MassDOT; it uses existing Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems plus additional sensors in the tunnels, and GPS receivers on the surface sections.

In September 2013, the MBTA announced that &quot;Next Train&quot; signs would be unveiled at Kenmore that month. On October 23, 2014, location tracking data became available for Green Line trains above ground. Arrival predictions for surface stations – including the activation of countdown signs along the D branch – and underground tracking and predictions were to be rolled out in two phases by early 2015. In March 2015, the MBTA announced that enough AVI equipment had been installed to allow the release of some underground data by April. Most underground data was live by August, but trains near Park Street and Boylston waited until September.

The first predictive countdown signs on the Green Line were activated at Newton Centre and Newton Highlands on April 24, 2015, followed shortly by other D branch stations. Countdown signs at Kenmore and Hynes were activated in August 2015. Signs at Copley and Arlington plus eastbound-only signs from Boylston through Science Park were activated in October 2015. The final set of signs – those on the westbound platforms of Science Park through Boylston – were activated in January 2016. Because holding and short-turning trains at the downtown terminals makes time-based predictions unreliable, the signs instead show how many stops away a train is.

==Projects==
===Somerville/Medford extension===

The Green Line Extension (GLX) project added two new branches into the northern suburbs of Somerville and Medford. The project opened in two phases in 2022 at a total cost of $2.28 billion. The rebuilt Lechmere station and the Union Square Branch to opened on March 21, 2022, as an extension of the D branch (briefly the E branch). The Medford Branch opened to on December 12, 2022 as an extension of the E branch, with intermediate stations at , , , and . The total project cost is estimated to be $2.28 billion: $0.996 billion from the federal government and $1.28 billion from the state. Daily ridership on the extension is projected to be 45,000 by 2030.

The GLX begins at the north end of the Lechmere Viaduct, with a new elevated line continuing north for about parallel to the O&#x27;Brien Highway. The former surface-level Lechmere station was replaced by an elevated station on the new alignment. The two branches split with an aerial flying junction on the Red Bridge viaduct in the Inner Belt area. The Union Square Branch runs west from Red Bridge, sharing the Fitchburg Line right of way. The Medford Branch runs northwest from Red Bridge, sharing the Lowell Line right of way. Like the existing D branch, the new branches are fully grade-separated, with no level crossings. A new vehicle storage yard and maintenance facility is located in the Inner Belt area, with leads from both branches at Red Bridge. An extension of the Somerville Community Path runs along the Medford Branch south of Lowell Street, with a high bridge carrying it above the Red Bridge viaduct.

An extension north from Lechmere was first proposed in the 1920s, and again several times during the 20th century. To settle a lawsuit with the Conservation Law Foundation to mitigate increased automobile emissions from the Big Dig, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in 1990 to extend the Green Line from Lechmere to Medford Hillside through Somerville and Medford, two suburbs underserved by the MBTA relative to their population densities, commercial importance, and proximity to Boston. After delays in planning, the state agreed in 2006 to complete the project by 2014. The preferred alternative from the 2009 Draft Environmental Impact Report added the Union Square Branch; the Medford Branch terminus was set as College Avenue, with a potential future extension to .

The planned completion was delayed to 2018 in 2011, and to 2020 in 2014. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in December 2012. The project was expected to cost about $2.2 billion, with half of that paid by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). However, in 2015 it became clear that the project would cost $3 billion, putting its future in doubt. The project was value engineered to reduce its cost: station designs were simplified, several bridge reconstructions eliminated, the Community Path extension shortened, and the maintenance facility reduced in size. The FTA approved the modified $2.3 billion plan on April 4, 2017. The contract was rebid with a provision for the optional restoration of six of the elements deleted in the 2016 plan. The winning bid, selected in November 2017, included six optional elements, including canopies and additional elevators at stations, public art, a full-size vehicle maintenance facility, and the full extension of the Community Path to East Cambridge. Construction reached 20% completion in November 2019; it was over 50% completed by October 2020, and 80% by June 2021.

===Accessibility renovations===

The majority of the Green Line opened by 1959, long before the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act mandated that new construction be fully accessible. The MBTA began modifying Red, Orange, and Blue Line stations for accessibility in the late 1980s; however, Green Line stations were not modified until the late 1990s, when the Type 8 vehicles were under construction. The MBTA began the Light Rail Accessibility Program in 1996. Because modifying the numerous stations all at once would be prohibitively expensive, the MBTA designated &quot;key stations&quot; – largely those with high ridership or bus connections – for prioritization.

Riverside station was completely rebuilt with raised accessible platforms around 1998. and (both of which already had elevators from previous projects) were outfitted with portable lifts for temporary accessibility around 2000, as were and ten surface stations. Between 2001 and 2003, 16 surface stations (4 on the B branch, 4 on the C branch, 3 on the D branch, and 5 on the E branch) were retrofitted with raised platforms. The 13 B, C, and E branch stations collectively cost $32 million. Construction of raised platforms was completed at Park Street and Haymarket around 2003; Prudential was also reconstructed that year by the developer of 111 Huntington Avenue. The fully accessible underground &quot;superstation&quot; at North Station opened in 2004. Wooden mini-high platforms, allowing level boarding on older Type 7 LRVs, were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006–07 as part of the settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;.

Renovations for accessibility were completed at in 2009, and in 2010, and in 2011. A two-year closure of ended in 2016 with the opening of the accessible transfer station. As part of the Green Line Extension, Lechmere was replaced by a fully accessible elevated station in 2022. Reconstruction work on Symphony is expected to take place from 2025 to 2028. (with renovations in design) and are the other remaining inaccessible stations in the central subway.

Other projects have moved towards full accessibility of the surface branches. was made accessible in 2006. Renovations completed in 2009 made accessible for the first time, and replaced the lifts at and . A reconstruction of (replacing lifts) was completed in 2022. Construction of two accessible stations ( and ) on the B branch to replace four non-accessible stations took place in 2021. Temporary work to make accessible was done in 2019, followed by the four remaining D branch stations in 2024; larger reconstructions of the five stations are planned for later in the 2020s. Several other surface accessibility projects are planned:
*The nine remaining non-accessible B branch stations are to be reconstructed in 2025–2027. Consolidations will reduce the nine stops to six.
*The nine remaining non-accessible C branch stations are to be reconstructed in 2025–2026. Consolidations will reduce the nine stops to seven.
*The four remaining non-accessible E branch stations are to be reconstructed in 202–2029. Consolidations will reduce the four stops to two.

==Incidents and collisions==

On May 28, 2008, two D branch trains collided in Newton. The operator of one of the trains was killed and numerous riders were taken to area hospitals with injuries of varying degrees of seriousness. While it was originally thought that cell phone use was responsible for the crash, the cause was officially determined to be an episode of micro-sleep caused by the driver&#x27;s sleep apnea.

On May 8, 2009, two trolleys rear-end collided underground between Park Street and Government Center when the driver of one of the trolleys, 24-year-old Aiden Quinn, was text messaging his girlfriend while driving. Quinn had run through a red light before the crash, which injured 46 people. MBTA officials estimated that the cost of the crash was $9.6 million. A strict ban on cell phone usage by MBTA operators was later enacted.

On October 8, 2012, two E branch trolleys collided in the 700 block of Huntington Avenue near Brigham Circle when one derailed into the other, injuring three people including a train operator. The next month on November 29, two trolleys collided at low speed at Boylston, injuring several dozen passengers.

On March 10, 2014, a D branch trolley with passengers aboard derailed in the tunnel just west of Kenmore Station, near the flat junction between the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;C&quot; branches. A second train had to brake suddenly to avoid hitting the derailed train. Ten people were treated for moderate injuries.

In October 2016, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that the Green Line had the highest number of derailments and collisions on light rail lines in the United States in 2015. The number of incidents had been increasing for several years due to deferred maintenance on tracks and wheels, which resulted in more low-speed derailments of Type 8 cars.

On July 30, 2021, two B branch trains collided at , causing 25 injuries.

On October 1, 2024, a train derailed near Lechmere, injuring seven people and disrupting service on the Green Line Extension. Regular service resumed on October 3rd. The National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Transit Administration, and Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities are investigating the derailment. A preliminary NTSB report noted the train was going 36mph in a 10mph zone and passed through a double red signal that required a stop. The train passed through a switch that was still moving into position, causing part of the first truck of the lead car to go straight and the rest of the train into the diverging track and causing the derailment.

On February 9, 2025, a E branch train crashed into an out of service train at East Somerville, injuring five people.

In 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that the Green Line be outfitted with positive train control to prevent collisions as part of its various crash investigations. The MBTA decided in 2012 not to implement PTC, estimating the cost at $645 million to $721 million. In 2015, as crashes continued to happen, the NTSB complained the agency was moving too slowly identifying a feasible alternative. In 2019, the MBTA awarded a contract to implement a similar safety system by 2024, at a cost of $170 million. A train would automatically brake if a driver violated a traffic signal, or if cameras or radar detected an obstacle. That contract was cancelled in June 2024. A new contract was awarded in February 2025 for a new system that would provide warnings to operators by the end of 2025, and enforce violations with automatically braking by mid-2028.

<text>Double Dare is an American game show in which two teams compete to win cash and prizes by answering trivia questions and completing messy stunts called physical challenges. It originally ran from 1986 to 1993. A revival ran in 2000, and the most recent revival ran from 2018 to 2019.

Hosted by Marc Summers, the program originally premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986, as its first game show. A continuation for syndication premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; on January 22, 1989. The program also had a short run on Fox as &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 7, 1993. The series was revived, hosted by Jason Harris, and titled &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;; this aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000. A second revival of the series, hosted by Liza Koshy and featuring Marc Summers, aired from June 25, 2018, to December 20, 2019.

&quot;Double Dare&quot; saw many adjustments in scheduling and titling throughout its run. Almost immediately after its debut, &quot;Double Dare&quot; had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon&#x27;s afternoon lineup, becoming the most-watched original daily program on cable television. The program was a major success for Nickelodeon, helping to establish the network as a major player in cable television and to revitalize the genre of game shows for children in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;Double Dare&quot; remains Nickelodeon&#x27;s longest-running game show. In 2001, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows. The program has been nominated for two Daytime Emmy Awards, two Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and won a CableACE Award in 1989.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
Each team on the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; consisted of two children, while teams on &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; included two adults and two children. Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after &quot;Double Dare&quot; entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.

Each round begins with a toss-up physical challenge in which both teams compete, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host begins asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earns a monetary award and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled. On the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot;, a question was initially worth $10. On &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 &quot;Double Dare&quot;, a question was initially worth $50, later 50 points.

After the toss-up at the start of the first round, the host explains the rules as follows:

===Physical challenges===
Physical challenges are often messy stunts that a team has to perform in a specified time, usually 20 or 30 seconds, although occasionally 10 or 15 seconds. All physical challenges on &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; were 30 seconds in length, unless a time reduction was in play due to the Triple Dare Challenge. The team wins money and retained control for completing the stunt. Otherwise, the money and control pass to their opponents.

Many challenges have involved filling a container past a line with one of a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involve catching a specific number of items before time runs out. For example, during &quot;Pies in the Pants,&quot; a contestant has to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launches the pies from a foot-operated catapult at the opposite end of the stage.

On the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot;, both contestants on a team competed in all physical challenges. For the 1988 version of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990–93 version of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; and on &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two. All members of a team competed in physical challenges in the first season of the 2018 &quot;Double Dare&quot;, while most challenges in the second season are for two players.

&quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; introduced the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed a team to make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.

===Obstacle course===

The team with the highest score at the end of round two goes on to the bonus round, the obstacle course (renamed the Slopstacle Course for &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;). From the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; through &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; both teams keep all money earned, regardless of the outcome. Only the winning team on the 2018 version gets to keep their money.

The course consists of eight obstacles that have to be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle has an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member runs the first obstacle, then passes its flag to a partner, who then moves on to the next obstacle. The team continues to alternate in this manner until they have completed the course or until time expires. For safety reasons, team members are given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.

Many obstacles have appeared in the course rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course have included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream at the bottom; and Gum Drop, which required contestants to leap into a giant gumball machine filled with plastic balls and slide out through the dispensing hatch at the bottom.

Through January 2019, the team would win a prize for each obstacle completed, escalating in value up to a grand prize for completing the entire course. Two-person teams split cash earnings from the front game, and both contestants receive the same physical prize for each obstacle. Prizes have included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, electronics, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, cash. On the original and &quot;Super Sloppy&quot; versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at Space Camp. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000. On the Fox &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, as well as the first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000. Once again, the grand prize was typically a vacation for the second season of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; and the first season of the 2018 &quot;Double Dare&quot;, with grand prize packages on the 2018 version having a value of more than $6,000. With the premiere of the second season of the 2018 revival, the obstacle course was played for $500 cash for each obstacle completed, with a total jackpot of $5,000 for successfully completing the course. Cash values were doubled for the finals game of a tournament series.

According to host Marc Summers, two children were injured on the obstacle course. The first was a boy who had brittle bone disease, which his parents lied about on the application form, resulting in an injury during taping where a bone went through his arm. The second was a boy who slipped on the ladder within the &quot;Sewer Chute&quot; and fell backwards, with Summers initially believing he had snapped his neck and died. The boy&#x27;s father, an attorney, asked for a television prize as a settlement, to which the &quot;Double Dare&quot; crew agreed.

==Broadcast and production history==

===1986–1989===

In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was approached by production and consulting groups with the idea of doing a game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. &quot;Double Dare&quot; was green-lighted, and Nickelodeon announced its premiere on June 5, 1986.

Initial candidates to host the program included Soupy Sales, host of children&#x27;s variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the search for a host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from New York or Los Angeles. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host &quot;Double Dare&quot;. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position in the first week of September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers, then 34 years old, was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.

In need of an announcer, &quot;Double Dare&quot; producers were made aware of Philadelphia-area radio host John Harvey, known on-air as Harvey, whose &quot;Harvey in the Morning&quot; program on WIOQ had been canceled months earlier. He accepted the offer to be announcer of the program. Stage assistants also appeared on-camera on &quot;Double Dare&quot;, initially only assisting in setting up physical challenges and obstacles, but expanding the role as the series continued to sometimes interacting with Summers, demonstrating challenges, and modeling prizes. Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar were the two permanent stage assistants when the program began.

James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor created the original stage design for &quot;Double Dare.&quot; The design for the original series&#x27; set was inspired by a 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a &quot;natatorium&quot; (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.

Production originated at the studios of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce &quot;Double Dare&quot; because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York or Los Angeles where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. &quot;Double Dare&quot; premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series&#x27; run on Nickelodeon. After the success of the first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered.

A weekend edition titled &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; taped over two weeks in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, airing 26 episodes on Sunday mornings. &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; featured gameplay identical to the original format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.

In July 1987, pilots hosted by Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce Jenner) were produced by Viacom for two possible versions of &quot;Double Dare&quot; with adult players: one pairing celebrities with contestants, and another with married couples. Neither concept advanced to series.

By November 1987, Fox announced they had partnered with Viacom to purchase the distribution rights for new episodes of the program in syndication. New episodes of &quot;Double Dare&quot; aired on independent stations and Fox affiliates beginning on February 22, 1988. There were 130 first-run syndication episodes in 1988.

A 13-episode Saturday night edition titled &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; aired on Fox from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Teams on this version consisted of four family members, most often a mother, father, and two children. The budget was increased, and the prize total featured during the obstacle course was larger than that featured on the Nickelodeon series. A further 13 episodes of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; were then ordered, but Fox canceled the series shortly before production was to begin because of &quot;creative differences.&quot;

On January 5, 1989, production began on a new version of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; from Philadelphia at WHYY-TV, continuing in syndication. The series premiered on January 22, 1989. The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. For the second half, 40 episodes were taped. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes in this part of the series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be patterned after. Themes included a Salute to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, a Salute to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a-Mania episodes featuring wrestlers and personalities from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot;, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989.

===1990–1993===
&quot;Family Double Dare&quot; returned to Nickelodeon on August 13, 1990, first airing repeats of the Fox version. A &quot;Salute to Double Dare&quot; special aired September 2, 1990, with Summers, Harvey, and Marrella highlighting moments from &quot;Double Dare&quot;, discussing its popularity, and previewing the upcoming &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;. Nickelodeon launched its own version of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; on weekends beginning October 6, 1990. Nickelodeon produced the series at the newly opened Nickelodeon Studios on the Universal Studios Florida grounds in Orlando. Production began in July 1990 and ended on July 24, 1992, with 80 episodes taped over two seasons. Between the production cycles of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, two special episodes of &quot;Double Dare&quot; were recorded on February 6–7, 1992: &quot;NBA All-Star Double Dare&quot; with National Basketball Association alumni and &quot;Super Special Double Dare&quot; with members of the casts of &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; and &quot;Welcome Freshmen&quot;.

Jaime Bojanowski and Chris Miles joined Robin Marrella as stage assistants for &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, replacing Dave Shikiar who left the series between the ending of &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; in 1989 and the beginning of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; in 1990 to pursue production opportunities on other programs like &quot;The Home Show&quot; and &quot;Wild &amp; Crazy Kids&quot;. In order to spend time with his wife and his newborn son Caleb, Harvey did not announce the last season of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; in 1992. He was replaced as announcer by Doc Holliday, an Orlando-area radio host on WXXL&#x27;s &quot;Doc &amp; Johnny in the Morning&quot;. Harvey made a cameo appearance on the final episode of the season and the series.

&quot;Family Double Dare&quot; concluded on February 7, 1993, with a one-hour Tournament of Champions episode. The episode featured a &quot;brains vs. brawn&quot; mini-tournament where the two families from the final season who answered the most questions correctly played against each other, and the two families from the final season with the fastest obstacle course times played against each other. The winners of those games competed to determine the 1993 &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; champions. Physical challenges from &quot;Double Dare&quot; appeared on &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Challenge&quot;, a three-part special combining elements from many of Nickelodeon&#x27;s game shows, airing on October 3, 1994.

Repeats of the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; continued to air on Nickelodeon until March 15, 1991, and returned to Nickelodeon&#x27;s schedule again from June 12 to September 30, 1994. Repeats of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; remained on the Nickelodeon schedule until January 31, 1999. At this time, development began for the revival that would become &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;.

&quot;Double Dare&quot; has spawned versions in foreign countries throughout the world, including: Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, The Netherlands, Germany, India, and Brazil. Six episodes of the Australian version (produced by Australia&#x27;s Network Ten) recorded for American consumption, one featuring an American team competing against an Australian team, aired on Nickelodeon during a special marathon on September 3, 1990. Repeats of all versions of &quot;Double Dare&quot; aired in various cycles on Nick GAS from the network&#x27;s inception in 1999 until its closure in 2009. From 2011 to 2019, &quot;Double Dare&quot; was incorporated into the branding of TeenNick&#x27;s classic Nickelodeon blocks The &#x27;90s Are All That, and its successor, The Splat (later known as NickSplat and NickRewind). Episodes of &quot;Double Dare&quot; have occasionally aired in these blocks.

===&quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;===
On December 20, 1999, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; show, titled &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;. Production began on January 5, 2000, and the show broadcast its first episode later that same month on January 22, 2000, now hosted by Jason Harris with Tiffany Phillips as announcer. Additional episodes were taped in July of the same year. Eileen Braun, who worked on the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; as a production assistant and a production coordinator, was the executive producer for &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;. Marc Summers advised on production as an executive consultant. Jeffrey Lamar, Tia Marie Schroeder and Will Finley worked on &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; as stage assistants.

&quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; followed the &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; format with a revamped set and bigger physical challenges. It also featured the new Triple Dare Challenge option in round two, and referred to the obstacle course as the Slopstacle Course. In association with Sony and National Mobile Television, five episodes of &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; were produced in high-definition with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The episodes were broadcast in a 4:3 letterboxed format as Nickelodeon did not broadcast in high-definition until 2008. The music for &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, a Surf Rock style remix of the original soundtrack, was composed by former Crack the Sky guitarist Rick Witkowski. Byron Taylor again served as set designer. The series concluded on November 10, 2000. Repeats remained on the Nickelodeon schedule until July 29, 2001.

===2012–2016===
Beginning May 21, 2012, Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando produced &quot;Double Dare&quot; as a nightly live stage presentation, &quot;Double Dare Live&quot;. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort&#x27;s guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions of &quot;Double Dare&quot;, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version of &quot;Double Dare Live&quot;, called &quot;Double Dare Challenge&quot;, has been presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America in seasonal cycles since 2016.

On July 22, 2016, special live editions of &quot;Double Dare&quot;, produced by Nickelodeon and The Splat with original host Marc Summers, took place at the Fluxx nightclub during San Diego Comic-Con 2016. The event was live streamed on The Splat&#x27;s Facebook page and included in the later anniversary special. The week of July 25, 2016, The Splat aired a &quot;Double Dare&quot;-themed week featuring episodes and moments from the series&#x27; history and included edited versions of the Comic-Con games. These events marked Summers&#x27; first Nickelodeon-sponsored involvement with the brand since &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;.

===2018 version===

A half-hour special presentation, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show&#x27;s premiere, the &quot;Double Dare Reunion Special&quot;, aired on November 23, 2016, on Nick at Nite, with an encore airing on The Splat. The special included vintage clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and a new game recorded at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 played by cast members from &quot;All That&quot;. Summers, announcer Harvey, and stage assistant Robin Russo (née Marrella) appeared in the special. 1.126 million viewers watched the special on Nick at Nite, outperforming all other shows on the network for the evening, and finishing as the third-most viewed of all non-sports original cable telecasts among viewers ages 18 to 34 for that day.

In 2017, Summers stated that, due to the success of the special, he was in negotiations to return to &quot;Double Dare&quot; in some form with Nickelodeon. News outlets reported in March 2018 that Nickelodeon was producing a new series of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, and was in negotiations to reboot &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, two shows originally made by the network in the 1990s. Upon learning of these developments, and inspired by the success of other contemporary television revivals like &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, Summers emailed Nickelodeon executives to ask if he was going to be the person to receive &quot;the next phone call.&quot;

On April 25, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a new version of &quot;Double Dare&quot;, which is the second revival of the show. The network ordered 40 episodes that recorded in Los Angeles at CBS Studio Center throughout June 2018. The series premiered on June 25, airing weeknights. Actress and television/internet personality Liza Koshy hosted the series. Original host Marc Summers also appeared on the series in an on-camera role. Along with performing traditional duties of an announcer, Summers provided commentary on the show&#x27;s physical challenges and helped introduce elements and transition the game.
Summers was also one of the show&#x27;s executive producers. Fremantle produced the series on behalf of Nickelodeon.

The set, designed by James Pearse Connelly, bore a heavy resemblance to the original set used in the 1980s. Updates included using digital screens for displays and decoration, enhanced lighting, and a dedicated space for the obstacle course, though timing and scoring uses emulation of the original vane display-type numerals. Members of the &quot;challenge team&quot; also appeared as stage assistants, including Eric Pierce, Michelle Kallman, James Michael Ryan Jr., and Stad St. Fleur. Edd Kalehoff remixed and re-composed the original theme song and soundtrack for this version.

Episodes broadcast predominantly featured teams of two children competing, but some episodes have participation from teams of one child and one adult family member. An episode also aired with teams of three siblings, and one with teams of two children with two adult family members. Some episodes featured celebrity participants, such as actors from past Nickelodeon series competing, including &quot;All That&quot;&#x27;s Jamie Lynn Spears and Josh Server. The 2018 Kids&#x27; Choice Sports, which aired on July 20, 2018, culminated with host and basketball player Chris Paul competing against Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps in the &quot;Double Dare&quot; obstacle course, presented by Liza Koshy and Marc Summers. Because Koshy had difficulty with her voice during the taping of an episode, Summers filled in as host for the second half of a show, which aired on July 26. The first cycle of season one, airing 24 half-hour episodes, concluded on July 27. Episodes resumed airing on September 30, with weekly airings, culminating with a special 60-minute episode featuring &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell aired on November 21. The final episode of season one aired on February 1, 2019.

In celebration of Super Bowl LIII, a special 45-minute episode featuring stars of Nickelodeon comedy &quot;Cousins for Life&quot; and NFL players was recorded on January 31, 2019, at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, as part of the Super Bowl Experience. The episode was simulcast on Nickelodeon, TeenNick, and Nicktoons on February 3, the same day Super Bowl LIII was held.

In January 2019, casting began for a second season of &quot;Double Dare&quot;. Filming of season two began on February 27 and ran through early March. The season premiered on March 11, with a new tournament format offering cash prizes in the obstacle course. Two teams of four children compete in the first episode, with the winning team splitting up into four individual teams, where each child is paired up with a celebrity. The winning teams from these episodes play against each other in the fourth and final episode of the tournament. The premiere week featured the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards Tournament, teaming kids with nominees of the 2019 awards. WWE Superstars Week aired the week of April 22, teaming kids with wrestlers in WWE. SpongeBob Week aired the week of July 8, celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Halloween Week aired the week of October 21, celebrating Halloween. The Holiday Tournament aired in four weekly installments, beginning November 29. On August 31, 2019, Summers announced that &quot;Double Dare&quot; would not be renewed for a third season. The series concluded with the finals of the Holiday Tournament, which aired on December 20, 2019.

===2021–present===

On October 29, 2021, Summers hosted a reunion special streamed by Red Tail Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Double Dare Live&quot;. Titled &quot;Double Dare Live at 35&quot;, the Facebook special featured Harvey, Robin Russo, Jason Harris, and other cast members, crew and contestants from &quot;Double Dare&quot;&#x27;s runs discussing their experiences with the program.

&quot;The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers&quot; premiered off-Broadway on February 22, 2024, featuring a replica of the &quot;Double Dare&quot; set and audience members competing in stunts from the program. Robin Russo&#x27;s daughter Casey Rae Russo served as the show&#x27;s stage assistant.

==Reception and achievements==
===Ratings and impact===
Within a month of its premiere, &quot;Double Dare&quot; had more than tripled viewership for Nickelodeon&#x27;s afternoon schedule becoming the highest-rated original, daily program on cable. During &quot;Double Dare&quot;″s first year, the program averaged a 3.0 household Nielsen rating, with over 1 million households tuned in each week. On its February 1988 debut in syndication, the program averaged a 5.4 household Nielsen rating and a 15.4 rating among children ages 2 to 11, and was the second-highest rated syndicated program in that demographic. By January 1989, &quot;Double Dare&quot; averaged a 3.1 household Nielsen rating. The special Sunday premiere episode of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; on Fox on April 3, 1988, scored a 4.0 household Nielsen rating, finishing fifth out of 10 programs broadcast on Fox that week helping to give Fox&#x27;s Sunday night schedule its highest ratings to that point.

When &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; premiered in January 2000, episodes in its first two weeks averaged household Nielsen ratings of up to 3.0, being viewed by up to 2.7 million households, and finishing in the top 25 basic cable programs each week. &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; often won its time slot in viewership among children ages 2 to 11.

The June premiere of the 2018 revival was watched by 1.843 million viewers, outperforming all other shows on Nickelodeon for the day, finishing as the highest-rated broadcast for teenagers ages 12 to 17. &quot;Double Dare&quot;&#x27;s premiere was Nickelodeon&#x27;s most-viewed series launch among adults 18 to 49 in more than five years. By the end of its second week, viewership for new episodes hovered around one million overall viewers.

At its peak, &quot;Double Dare&quot; was the highest-rated, live-action show for children ages 8 to 15. The show was also popular with college students, with many schools offering &quot;Double Dare&quot; fan clubs. Half of Nickelodeon&#x27;s operating profit in 1988 was due to the success of &quot;Double Dare&quot; and its syndication. On the show&#x27;s success, then-senior vice-president of Nickelodeon programming Herb Scannell said that &quot;Double Dare&quot; was like &quot;having a hit record your first time out. &quot;Double Dare&quot; put Nick on the map.&quot;

&quot;Double Dare&quot; revitalized interest in the concept of a game show for children. Less than a year after the program launched, NBC had premiered &quot;I&#x27;m Telling!&quot;, Lorimar Television had announced plans for &quot;Fun House&quot;, and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; began airing—all shows based on competition between teams of children. During &quot;Double Dare&quot;″s first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot; were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that &quot;Double Dare&quot; &quot;allowed kids to get dirty and have a good time in ways that really were not acceptable before that show&quot;. &quot;Double Dare&quot; remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.

As &quot;Double Dare&quot; grew messier, a green slime substance became more commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;. &quot;Double Dare&quot;&#x27;s high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon&#x27;s association with slime and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including &quot;Wild &amp; Crazy Kids&quot; and &quot;Figure It Out&quot;. The relationship between Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.

===Critical reception===

Reviews of the show were often favorable, noting it was fun entertainment for the family. After &quot;Double Dare&quot; premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, observed that when contestants &quot;squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious,&quot; and said, &quot;&quot;Double Dare&quot; is so refreshing.&quot; Noel Holston of the &quot;Minneapolis Star and Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;kids and game shows, when you think about it, go together like hot fudge and ice cream&quot;. &quot;The Orange County Register&quot;″s Ellen T. Klein said &quot;Double Dare&quot; is &quot;such fast-paced, furious and messy fun&quot; and rated the show as &quot;good&quot;. In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as &quot;the not-so-secret ingredients in the show&#x27;s success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers&quot;.

Some criticism came from the feeling that the program was not educational. Others were concerned about food waste like beans and eggs in physical challenges and obstacles. In a &quot;Cheers and Jeers&quot; section in 1988, &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave &quot;jeers&quot; to &quot;Double Dare&quot; for &quot;daring to push beyond the limits of good taste,&quot; saying it was &quot;gross and insulting to watch.&quot; In 1989, television and film critic Jeffrey Lyons wrote that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t dream of proclaiming that &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; is good for your child. But what&#x27;s wrong with watching an admittedly dumb—but hilarious—program just for fun?&quot;

Andrea Graham wrote for Common Sense Media that revival series &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; is a &quot;fun, action-filled game show that families can watch together – amid all the slime are some good messages about family togetherness&quot;. Original host and executive consultant for &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; Marc Summers said that &quot;there were issues&quot; with the revival. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, he said that he felt the length of the Triple Dare Challenge took away from the game and that &quot;if we would have done it the way we originally did it, we would have been fine, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t happen&quot;.

The 2018 revival of &quot;Double Dare&quot; premiered to positive reviews, particularly for host Liza Koshy. Reality Blurred&#x27;s Andy Dehnart said that the reboot &quot;did an excellent job of balancing the old and new,&quot; and praised the combination of Koshy and Marc Summers, saying she &quot;can absolutely hold her own as host,&quot; and &quot;her rapport with [Summers] felt natural and playful.&quot; Joel Keller of the &quot;New York Post&quot;&#x27;s Decider observed that &quot;the show belongs to Koshy, who ad-libs well and makes the kids feel at ease,&quot; and gave &quot;Double Dare&quot; a favorable &quot;stream it&quot; rating.

&quot;Double Dare&quot; was nominated for a CableACE Award in the Game Show Special or Series category at the 1989 and 1993 ceremonies, winning the award in 1989, but losing to MTV&#x27;s &quot;Lip Service&quot; in 1993. Dana Calderwood was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children&#x27;s Series in 1989. Nickelodeon was nominated for a 1988 Golden ACE award, cable&#x27;s then-highest programming honor, for its &quot;pro-social television,&quot; including &quot;Double Dare&quot; by name. In January 2001, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the show number 29 on its list of 50 Greatest Game Shows. At the 2019 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, &quot;Double Dare&quot; was nominated in the category of Favorite Reality Show, and Liza Koshy and Marc Summers were nominated as a duo in the category of Favorite TV Host. &quot;Double Dare&quot; was honored at the 47th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2020 with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Game Show.

==Other media==

===Portrayals and parodies===
&quot;Double Dare&quot; has been featured in a number of notable visual media since its premiere, often with one or more characters participating as contestants in homages to the series. On &quot;Double Dare&quot;, a 2016 episode of the 1980s-set sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, Adam Goldberg (Sean Giambrone) tries to find the perfect partner to audition to be a contestant on &quot;Double Dare&quot;. After rejecting his friend Emmy Mirsky (Stephanie Katherine Grant), he eventually runs through a mock obstacle course at a tryout with his grandfather Albert &quot;Pops&quot; Solomon (George Segal). Neither are selected to take part in the program. Benjamin Bauman and Amy Gross, real-life friends of series&#x27; creator Adam F. Goldberg who appeared as contestants on &quot;Double Dare&quot; in 1988, cameo as producers of the show. A first-season episode of the 2013 Nickelodeon series &quot;Sanjay and Craig&quot; titled &quot;Trouble Dare&quot; features the titular characters (voiced by Maulik Pancholy and Chris Hardwick), along with Sanjay&#x27;s mother and father (voiced by Grey Griffin and Kunal Nayyar), leaving their home after a bug infestation. After asking Remington Tufflips (voiced by Chris D&#x27;Elia) to stay in his trailer and finding that the Dickson family is already occupying it, Tufflips decides which family can stay through a game of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; hosted by himself. Harvey (voiced by himself) is concerned with how Tufflips is running the game until Marc Summers (voiced by himself) appears and declares Sanjay&#x27;s family the winners of a night&#x27;s sleep inside the Pick It obstacle. Another &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; game is seen in the music video for rock band Good Charlotte&#x27;s 2011 single &quot;Last Night.&quot; The video shows an abridged game of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;, going through questions, physical challenges, and the obstacle course. Marc Summers appears as himself, guitarist Benji Madden appears as Harvey, and band members play contestants and stage assistants. In July 2020, an episode in season four of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Loud House&quot; aired titled &quot;How Double Dare You!&quot; in which the Loud family siblings attempt to get on &quot;Double Dare&quot;.

&quot;Double Dare&quot; has also been subject to parodies and spoofs in various forms. The October 1988 issue of &quot;Mad&quot; has a spoof of &quot;Double Dare&quot; called &quot;Double Damp&quot;. Marc Summers and Harvey are lampooned as &quot;Muck Slummers&quot; and &quot;Hardly&quot;. The piece mocked the program&#x27;s use of food products, the dangerous nature of some stunts, and the similarity to game show &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. Both Summers and Harvey consider being parodied in &quot;Mad&quot; a high point in their careers. A 2015 episode of the truTV sketch comedy series &quot;Friends of the People&quot; titled &quot;Double Dare&quot; guest stars Marc Summers as himself, hosting &quot;banned&quot; moments from &quot;Double Dare&quot;. Sketches include a contestant exploding, and another being stuck permanently inside an obstacle. &quot;March Dadness,&quot; a 2012 episode of &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, features a flashback to a &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;-like program called &quot;Dare Squared&quot;. A young Cleveland Brown (voiced by Mike Henry) has difficulty finding an orange flag in an oversized stack of pancakes at the end of the program&#x27;s obstacle course. Marc Summers voices the frustrated host. Also, in a 2017 episode of &quot;Billy on the Street&quot;, host Billy Eichner led guest Keegan-Michael Key through an obstacle course with gun law themes titled &quot;Super Sloppy Semi-Automatic Double Dare.&quot; Eichner has cited &quot;Double Dare&quot; as a favorite show of his.

===Merchandise and promotions===

Reebok has been a major sponsor of &quot;Double Dare&quot; throughout its run. Every contestant and stage crew member wore a pair of the company&#x27;s shoes. Additional corporate sponsorships and tie-ins were proposed, including Casio putting their logo on the stage clock, and a &quot;Double Dare&quot;-branded breakfast cereal, but Nickelodeon declined the offers.

From 1987 to 1995, various &quot;Double Dare&quot; live tours visited venues around the United States. Featuring a format similar to the TV show wherein members of a live local audience could participate, the tour would later incorporate aspects of &quot;What Would You Do?&quot;, another show hosted by Marc Summers for Nickelodeon. Some events in these tours sold-out arenas they were held in, with attendance of more than 20,000 spectators. The tours and events resumed in 2000 to promote &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;. Beginning October 30, 2018, a version of &quot;Double Dare&quot; once again began touring nationwide. Marc Summers served as host, with previous &quot;Double Dare&quot; personality Robin Russo appearing as well. The tour ran through the end of 2019.

&quot;Double Dare&quot;″s lasting popularity has led to a variety of products being made available. Pressman Toy Corporation released two traditional board games based on the show: The &quot;Double Dare&quot; home game was released in September 1987 and &quot;Wet &#x27;N Wild Double Dare&quot; was released in March 1989. Another board game titled &quot;Double Dare: The Game&quot; was manufactured by Mattel in 2001. GameTek published a PC game in 1988, and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 based on the program. Stages based on &quot;Double Dare&quot; are playable in the 2020 racing game &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix&quot;, and as a downloadable content update in the 2021 fighting game &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;. Containing facts about the show, along with trivia and activities to host a home version of the game, two editions of &quot;The Double Dare Game Book&quot; were released by Parachute Press in 1988 and 1989. Based on substances referenced on &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, Mattel and Jakks Pacific manufactured a series of toy slimes called Gak and Goooze. Other toys, apparel, lunchboxes, and school supplies have been sold featuring the show&#x27;s logo and art.

&quot;Double Dare&quot; was heavily featured in the summer 2016 &quot;Remember When&quot; promotion at New York concept store STORY. Their partnership with Nickelodeon offered exclusive in-store products like &quot;Double Dare&quot; T-shirts and other goods designed in the style of the program&#x27;s themes. Patrons at STORY could also participate in &quot;Double Dare&quot; experiences, like running the One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel obstacle. As well, other &quot;Double Dare&quot;-inspired products available in-store, including Keds shoes and Stance socks, were offered online through retail partner Neiman Marcus.

Four collections of &quot;Double Dare&quot; highlights and special features were released on home video by Kids Klassics on October 1, 1988,— &quot;Double Dare: The Inside Scoop&quot; and &quot;Double Dare: The Messiest Moments.&quot; On October 17, 1989, a home party guide titled &quot;How to Throw a Double Dare Party&quot; was released by Elektra Video. Sony Wonder released &quot;Double Dare: Super Sloppiest Moments&quot; on May 31, 1994.

Collections of episodes of the original &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; and versions of &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; were made available for purchase via digital distribution on Amazon Prime Video and the iTunes Store throughout 2013. A DVD titled &quot;Nickelodeon Games and Sports: All-Star Collection&quot;, released by Nickelodeon for Amazon.com on April 27, 2015, features an episode of the original &quot;Super Sloppy Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;. Added at launch in August 2018, select episodes of &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot; were available to view on the now defunct NickSplat channel on Otter Media&#x27;s VRV streaming service. 246 episodes from the first three years of the original &quot;Double Dare&quot; were added to the now defunct NickHits channel, available on Prime Video and Apple TV, in December 2019, and later added to Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access) in January 2021. Recent versions were added to channels on Paramount Global&#x27;s over-the-top streaming television service Pluto TV.

Episodes of the 2018 version of &quot;Double Dare&quot; are available for purchase through many online video retailers, sold individually and in multi-episode volumes. The first season of the 2018 version was added to Paramount+ in March 2021, with the second season being added in December of that same year. In August 2018, a &quot;Double Dare&quot; game was released on Facebook Messenger, allowing users to play against friends or other Messenger users in a turn-based version of the program.

<text>Maranello (Modenese: ) is a city of Italy in the province of Modena, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, 18 km from Modena, with a population of 17,504 as of 2017. It is known worldwide as the home of Ferrari and the Formula One racing team, Scuderia Ferrari. Maranello was also home to coachbuilding firm Carrozzeria Scaglietti, owned by Ferrari.

==Ferrari SpA==
Maranello has been the location of the Ferrari factory since the early 1940s. During World War II, Enzo Ferrari transferred to Modena, ending its ownership of Alfa Romeo. Initially, Ferrari&#x27;s factory in Maranello was shared with Auto Avio Costruzioni, a machine tool manufacturing business started by Enzo to tide the company over while Alfa Romeo&#x27;s ban on Enzo Ferrari making cars bearing the Ferrari name was in force. Maranello also houses the Museo Ferrari public museum, collecting sports cars, racing cars and trophies.

Its new library opened in November 2011, and was designed by Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei.

Maranello is the starting point of the annual Italian Marathon, which finishes in nearby Carpi.

==Haas F1==
American Haas F1 Team&#x27;s design team is based in Maranello. Haas&#x27;s design team is led by technical director Andrea De Zordo, who oversees Haas&#x27;s R&amp;D functions, including the Aerodynamics and CFD departments. Since the team&#x27;s inception, Haas has maintained a close technical collaboration with Maranello based Scuderia Ferrari. Haas&#x27;s current car utilizes, among other things, a Ferrari power unit, steering, and transmission.

==Main sights==
Maranello&#x27;s new town library was designed jointly by Andrea Maffei and Isozaki. The library opened in 2012.
The parish church of San Biagio was rebuilt in 1903.

<doc id="438460" wikidata="Q841211" url="?curid=438460" title="Battle of Nedao">
<text>The Battle of Nedao was fought in Pannonia in 454 CE between the Huns and their former Germanic vassals. Nedao is believed to be a tributary of the Sava River.

==Battle==
After the death of Attila the Hun, allied forces of the subject peoples under the leadership of Ardaric, king of the Gepids, defeated the Hunnic forces of Ellac, the son of Attila, who had struggled with his brothers Ernak and Dengizich for supremacy after Attila&#x27;s death. Ellac himself was killed in the battle.

According to the 6th-century historian Jordanes:
And so the bravest nations tore themselves to pieces. For then, I think, must have occurred a most remarkable spectacle, where one might see the Goths fighting with pikes, the Gepidae raging with the sword, the Rugii breaking off the spears in their own wounds, the Suavi fighting on foot, the Huns with bows, the Alani drawing up a battle-line of heavy-armed and the Heruli of light-armed warriors... ...after many grave clashes, victory surprisingly favours the Gepids for the sword and plotting of Ardaric killed nearly thirty thousand men, Huns as well as other tribes who brought them aid. In this battle, the eldest son of Attila, named Ellac,
whom his father was said to have loved so much more than the rest that he favoured him above all his various sons in his empire, was killed.

According to the medieval Hungarian chronicler Mark of Kalt in &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;:
== Modern views ==
Jordanes claimed that at the Battle of Nedao the Ostrogoths fought against the Huns, but this is rejected by modern historians such as Herwig Wolfram and Hyun Jin Kim. The latter believes that this is a forged story and that the Ostrogoth king Valamir himself fought alongside the Huns. Alternatively, J.R. Martindale and Franz Altheim accept that the Ostrogoths were among the victors of Nedao, while many others, including Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen, believe that none of this existed at all.

==Aftermath==
Hunnic dominance in Central and Eastern Europe was broken as a result of the battle. It is hard to reconstruct the exact course of events, but by the early 460s the Hunnic Empire was dissolved with the Gepids, Rugii, Heruli, Suebi, and Ostrogoths achieving independence and eventually becoming federates of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Huns, reorganized under Dengizich, moved to the east, where they attacked the Eastern Roman Empire and were decisively defeated in 469. After that point, the Huns cease to exist in European history.

He began as Vice President and subsequently gained the title of Senior Vice President for Marketing, Business Development, and International. He retired from eBay in 2000 when he and his wife, Anita Yu, established the Westly Foundation.

In February 2007, Westly joined the board of Tesla Motors, a pioneering northern California manufacturer of electric cars. He is now a Managing Partner and founder of The Westly Group, one of the larger venture funds in the US focusing on smart energy, mobility, and buildings. The Westly Group has had nine companies go public on NASDAQ including Tesla Motors.  

Steve Westly also served as a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business from 1991-1995. He returned to teach a new course at Stanford Business School called “The Policy, Politics, and Finance for Solving Global Warming” 2020 to 2024 and continues to teach there today. 
==Political career==
In addition to his professional career, Westly has maintained a concurrent career in the Democratic Party. At age 23 in 1981, he was elected as Northern Treasurer of the California Democratic Party, the youngest party officer ever. He was subsequently elected State Controller of the California Democratic Party in 1983, Northern Chair of the California Democratic Party in 1985, and Vice Chair of the California Democratic Party in 1987. In 1989, he was defeated as State Chair of the California Democratic Party by Jerry Brown. Despite that loss, Westly continued his activism within the party by being elected to the Democratic National Committee in 1988, as the highest vote getter, and was reelected in 1992, 1996, and 2000.

Westly ran for California State Controller in 2002 against State Senator Tom McClintock and won by a margin of 22,730 votes (out of 7,258,758 votes cast). Westly garnered 3,289,839 (45.4%) votes while McClintock won the support of 3,273,028 (45.1%) people. Three other candidates won 695,891 (9.5%) votes.

===California State Controller===
As Controller, Westly opposed Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s plan to change Proposition 98, which requires a certain amount of the state&#x27;s budget to go towards funding public education and community colleges, and in 2005, he created a tax amnesty plan that allowed individuals and corporations who owed back taxes to prevent facing criminal charges and increased penalties if they would immediately pay their back taxes. Westly&#x27;s plan brought in a gross amount of $4 billion in revenue for the State of California. The state&#x27;s non-partisan Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office states that after refunds and advance payments the net profit of the tax amnesty plan was $380 million.

Westly also introduced the ReadyReturn plan to simplify tax preparation by offering to send taxpayers a prefilled form from the state, and allowing them to sign and automatically file their tax refund in a pilot program started in 2005. Westly is also in favor of enforcing current laws requiring Californians to pay sales tax on Internet purchases.

==2006 gubernatorial election==

On June 19, 2005, Westly announced his candidacy for California governor. Despite entering the race long after his primary opponent, California State Treasurer Phil Angelides, Westly&#x27;s campaign picked up considerable momentum, receiving endorsements from such figures as Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Congressmembers Grace Napolitano, Diane Watson, and Brad Sherman, State Senators Carole Migden, Martha Escutia, and Nell Soto, County Supervisor Yvonne Burke, Assembly Members Judy Chu, Ted Lieu, Rudy Bermudez, and Nicole Parra, former Assembly Speaker and current Los Angeles City Councilman Herb Wesson, the majority of the Los Angeles City Council, and other elected officials at the federal, state, and local levels. Westly also gained the support of 85% of the major newspapers that endorsed in the race, including the San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News, Los Angeles Daily News, LA Weekly, Fresno Bee, and many others. Several organizations also endorsed Westly, such as the California Sierra Club, California Police Chiefs Association, California NOW, and the Orange County Professional Firefighters Association.

In the months leading up to the election, Westly overcame an early Angelides advantage and gained the edge in various polls, leading by as much as 13 points. Moreover, unlike Angelides, he consistently beat Governor Schwarzenegger in hypothetical general election matchups.

Despite Westly&#x27;s momentum and resources, the California Democratic Party endorsed Angelides at the State Democratic Party Convention. The race turned negative, highlighting environmental controversies surrounding Angelides&#x27; background as a real estate developer and Westly&#x27;s broken pledge to keep his campaign clean. Westly&#x27;s candidacy also was hurt by an unprecedented multi-million dollar independent expenditure by Sacramento real estate developer and longtime Angelides patron Angelo Tsakopoulos. As election day neared, Westly&#x27;s momentum dissipated and the race tightened. A Field Poll held on June 2, 2006 had Westly leading Angelides by one percentage point, 35% to 34% with 26% undecided and an error size of +/- 4.5 points.

The high number of undecided voters led to the lowest turnout in a California primary election in over half a century. Despite over $80 million spent on the race, including over $35 million of Westly&#x27;s personal fortune, only 30.8% of California Democrats came out to vote, the lowest number in recent history. Angelides finished on election night with 48% of the vote compared to Westly&#x27;s 44%. Westly endorsed Angelides&#x27; candidacy at a unity breakfast the morning after election night.

Angelides&#x27; Republican opponent, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has since used quotes from Westly&#x27;s campaign to attack Angelides. Westly, who endorsed Angelides after the primary, countered, &quot;Governor Schwarzenegger has shown great interest in what Steve Westly has to say about 2006. He is right here to tell you that we all need to vote for the Democratic candidate Phil Angelides in November 2006.&quot;

Phil Angelides was defeated in a landslide by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during the general election held on November 7, 2006 .

==Later career==
After the election of President Barack Obama in November 2008, it was rumored that Westly was being considered for appointment as Secretary of Energy, though Dr. Steven Chu was ultimately named to that position.

Westly&#x27;s name was also figured in political speculation as a possible candidate for Governor to succeed Schwarzenegger in 2010. Former Governor Jerry Brown won the Democratic nomination and defeated Republican Meg Whitman (also a former eBay executive) in November 2010. Westly supported Brown for governor and hosted a Brown fundraiser in October 2010.

He was rumored to run again for Governor of California in 2018, however he did not file to run before the primary.

Westly returned to teach a new course at the Stanford Graduate School of Business called “The Technology, Politics, and Finance for Solving Global Warming” in the Spring of 2020 and continues to teach there today. Mr. Westly is also a frequent guest on CNBC and other business outlets discussing Tesla Motors and the future of Electric and Autonomous Vehicles. Mr. Westly has also had over 60 articles and op-eds printed in USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News, San Diego Union-Tribune, and other outlets throughout the country.

<doc id="438469" wikidata="Q1433069" url="?curid=438469" title="Cliometrics">
<text>Cliometrics (, ), sometimes called &#x27;new economic history&#x27; or &#x27;econometric history&#x27;, is the systematic application of economic theory, econometric techniques, and other formal or mathematical methods to the study of history (especially social and economic history). It is a quantitative approach to economic history (as opposed to qualitative or ethnographic).

There has been a revival in &#x27;new economic history&#x27; since the late 1990s.
==History==
The new economic history originated in 1958 with &quot;The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South&quot; by American economists Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer. The book would cause a firestorm of controversy with its claim, based on statistical data, that slavery would not have ended in the absence of the U.S. Civil War, as the practice was economically efficient and highly profitable for slaveowners.

The term &quot;cliometrics&quot;—which derives from Clio, who was the muse of history—was originally coined by mathematical economist Stanley Reiter in 1960. Cliometrics became better known when Douglass North and William Parker became the editors of the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot; in 1960. The Cliometrics Meetings also began to be held around this time at Purdue University and are still held annually in different locations.

North, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, would go on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in October 1993 along with Robert William Fogel, himself often described as the father of modern econometric history and Neo-historicals. The two were honoured &quot;for having renewed research in economic history;&quot; the Academy noted that &quot;they were pioneers in the branch of economic history that has been called the &#x27;new economic history,&#x27; or cliometrics.&quot; Fogel and North received the prize for turning the theoretical and statistical tools of modern economics on the historical past: on subjects ranging from slavery and railroads to ocean shipping and property rights. North was heralded as a pioneer in the &quot;new&quot; institutional history. In the Nobel announcement, specific mention was made of a 1968 paper on ocean shipping, in which North showed that organizational changes played a greater role in increasing productivity than did technological change. Fogel is especially noted for using careful empirical work to overturn conventional wisdom.

With that being said, the new economic history revolution is thought to have begun in the mid-1960s, where areas of key interest included transportation history, slavery, and agriculture. The discipline was resisted as many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques. According to cliometric economist Claudia Goldin, the success of the cliometric revolution had as an unintended consequence the disappearance of economic historians from history departments. As economic historians started using the same tools as economists, they started to seem more like other economists. In Goldin&#x27;s words, &quot;the new economic historians extinguished the other side.&quot; The other side nearly disappeared altogether, with only a few remaining in history departments and business schools. However, some new economic historians did, in fact, begin research around this time, among them were Kemmerer and Larry Neal (a student of Albert Fishlow, a leader of the cliometric revolution) from Illinois, Paul Uselding from Johns Hopkins, Jeremy Atack from Indiana, and Thomas Ulen from Stanford.

Cliometrics was introduced in the 1970s to Germany by Richard H. Tilly, who had been educated in the US. The Cliometric Society, a group to encourage and further the study of cliometrics, was founded in 1983.

There has been a revival in &#x27;new economic history&#x27; since the late 1990s. The number of papers on economic history published in the top economics journals has increased in the last decades, comprising 6.6% of articles in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; and 10.8% of articles in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; for the period 2004-2014. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot;, &quot;Explorations in Economic History&quot;, the &quot;European Review of Economic History&quot;, and &quot;Cliometrica&quot;.

==Critics==
Cliometrics has had sharp critics. Francesco Boldizzoni summarized a common critique by arguing that cliometrics is based on the false assumption that the laws of neo-classical economics always apply to human activity. He considers that those laws are based on rational choice and maximization as they operate in well-developed markets and do not apply to economies other than those of the capitalist West in the modern era. Instead, Boldizzoni argues that the workings of economies are determined by social, political, and cultural conditions specific to each society and time period.

On the other hand, Claude Diebolt (2016) argued that cliometrics is mature and well accepted by scholars as an &quot;indispensable tool&quot; in economic history. He believes that most scholars agree that economic theory combined with new data as well as historical and statistical methods are necessary to formulate problems precisely, to draw conclusions from postulates, and to gain insight into complex processes so as to close the gap between &quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot; and &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot;: to move from the historical &quot;verstehen&quot; (understanding) side to the economic &quot;erklären&quot; (explaining) side or, much better, mixing both approaches for the achievement of a unified approach of the social sciences. At the applied level, cliometrics is accepted to measure variables and estimate parameters.

Joseph T. Salerno criticizes Cliometrics from the perspective of the Austrian school of economics, defending instead the methods of Ludwig von Mises. In his Introduction to Murray N. Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;A History of Money and Banking in the United States,&quot; Salerno writes that, &quot;in Rothbard’s view, economic laws can be relied upon in interpreting these non-repeatable historical events because the validity of these laws—or, better yet, their truth—can be established with certainty by praxeology, a science based on the universal experience of human action that is logically anterior to the experience of particular historical episodes... [thus] economic theory is an &quot;a priori&quot; science. In sharp contrast, the new [cliometric] economic historians view history as a laboratory in which economic theory is continually being tested... In general, the question of &#x27;Cui bono?&#x27;—or &#x27;Who benefits?&#x27;—from changes in policies and institutions receives very little attention in the cliometric literature, because the evidence that one needs to answer it, bearing as it does on human motives, is essentially subjective and devoid of a measurable or even quantifiable dimension.&quot;

==Distinguishing cliometrics and cliodynamics==
Cliometrics and cliodynamics share the scientific ambition of using quantitative tools and historical data to test general historical principles. Both fields endeavor to gather large amounts of historical data across big samples. However, the two fields also differ in several ways.

Cliodynamics maintains a close relationship with the natural sciences, often employing dominant methods from the natural sciences such as differential-equation models, power-law relations, and agent-based models. Evolutionary game theory and social network analysis are also frequently employed by cliodynamicists, but less often by cliometricians. Cliodynamicists also tend to include factors associated with ecological context and biological determinants in their models.

<text>HMAS &quot;Colac&quot; (J242/M05), named for the town of Colac, Victoria, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Colac&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Colac&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock and Engineering Company at Balmain, New South Wales on 18 April 1941. She was launched on 30 August 1941 by Miss M. Heady, senior lady on the staff of Morts Dock and Engineering, and commissioned into the RAN on 6 January 1942. The Colac was under the command of Lt. Commander Dudley Charles Northam. The ship was originally to be named HMAS &quot;Hamilton&quot;.

==Operational history==

===World War II===

After entering service, &quot;Colac&quot; was assigned as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort vessel, operating between Townsville and New Guinea. This continued until December 1942, when &quot;Colac&quot; and sister ships &quot;Ballarat&quot; and &quot;Broome&quot; were ordered to support the Allied efforts to recapture Buna-Gona by embarking 762 Australian soldiers and delivering them as far into the Japanese-occupied Oro Province of Papua New Guinea as possible. The first attempt, early on 14 December, saw 46 soldiers landed at Cape Sudest before the three corvettes were attacked by Japanese aircraft and forced to withdraw. That night, under the cover of darkness, the remaining troops were landed nearby. Throughout December, &quot;Colac&quot; was involved in three similar troop deployments, and later took part in Operation Lilliput; the reinforcement and supply of the captured area.

In March 1943, &quot;Colac&quot; and &quot;Ballarat&quot; were reassigned to convoy escort duty along the east coast of Australia. On 26 April, a five-ship convoy escorted by the two corvettes was attacked by Japanese submarine &quot;I-177&quot; off Cape Byron. The MV &quot;Limerick&quot; was torpedoed and sunk, with all but two of the crew rescued by &quot;Colac&quot;. &quot;I-177&quot; escaped unharmed. In July, &quot;Colac&quot; was instructed to begin escorting convoys between Australia and New Guinea, before returning to east coast convoys at the start of 1944, then undergoing a refit.

In April 1944, &quot;Colac&quot; was assigned to escort and patrol duties in New Guinea waters, which continued until April 1945, when the corvette was one of four RAN ships providing gunfire support for operations in the Wewak area. In mid-May, &quot;Colac&quot; was assigned to harass Japanese bases in the Solomon Islands area. On 26 May, the ship suffered her first casualties of the war, two hits from Japanese shore batteries killed two sailors, wounded two others, and holed &quot;Colac&quot; at the waterline. The corvette jettisoned stores, her depth charge payload, and replaceable pieces of equipment to avoid sinking and escape, and later limped to the Treasury Islands under tow for repairs. Temporary repairs were made to allow &quot;Colac&quot; to sail to New Guinea and then to Sydney, where she arrived on 18 June and entered dock for repairs. &quot;Colac&quot; was still under repair when World War II ended, and she was paid off into reserve on 27 November 1945.

The corvette was awarded two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

===Training ship===
On 20 February 1951, &quot;Colac&quot; was recommissioned for use as a training ship for National Service trainees.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Colac&quot; was returned to reserve on 30 January 1953. In 1962, the ship was converted into a tank cleaning vessel, and served in this role until 30 September 1983. &quot;Colac&quot; was not recommissioned during this time.

On 4 March 1987, &quot;Colac&quot; was sunk by a Mark 48 torpedo fired by the submarine HMAS &quot;Ovens&quot; in a weapons test. The corvette sank at .

<text>In computing, tree data structures, and game theory, the branching factor is the number of children at each node, the outdegree. If this value is not uniform, an &quot;average branching factor&quot; can be calculated.

For example, in chess, if a &quot;node&quot; is considered to be a legal position, the average branching factor has been said to be about 35, and a statistical analysis of over 2.5 million games revealed an average of 31. This means that, on average, a player has about 31 to 35 legal moves at their disposal at each turn. By comparison, the average branching factor for the game Go is 250.

Higher branching factors make algorithms that follow every branch at every node, such as exhaustive brute force searches, computationally more expensive due to the exponentially increasing number of nodes, leading to combinatorial explosion.

For example, if the branching factor is 10, then there will be 10 nodes one level down from the current position, 102 (or 100) nodes two levels down, 103 (or 1,000) nodes three levels down, and so on. The higher the branching factor, the faster this &quot;explosion&quot; occurs. The branching factor can be cut down by a pruning algorithm.

The average branching factor can be quickly calculated as the number of non-root nodes (the size of the tree, minus one; or the number of edges) divided by the number of non-leaf nodes (the number of nodes with children).

<text>Colac is a town in the Western District of Victoria, Australia, approximately 150 kilometres south-west of Melbourne on the southern shore of Lake Colac.

==History==
For thousands of years clans of the Gulidjan people lived in the region of Colac.

===British settlement===
The British first entered the region in March 1837, when several land-holders came upon Lake Colac while searching for the missing colonist Joseph Gellibrand. Another larger search party, which was acting on information that local Gulidjan had killed Gellibrand, arrived in April. This group returned to Geelong after two Gulidjan people were killed by Aboriginal trackers accompanying the party.

Settlement of the area began in September 1837 with the arrival of grazier Hugh Murray (died 1869) who selected of land and established three sheep stations: Warrion, Elliminyt and Barongarook. According to Murray, conflict with the resident Gulidjan was limited, with one Aboriginal man being shot dead during punitive raids upon Aboriginal settlements following the taking of sheep. In 1841, around forty Gulidjan lived and worked on what was now Murray&#x27;s property.

The surveying for a village began in 1841 and the township of Lake Colac was proclaimed in 1848.

The Post Office opened on 1 July 1848 as Lake Colac and was renamed Colac in 1854. Colac Botanic Gardens in Queen Street located on the shores of Lake Colac, were established in 1868.

===Brookhouse Mystery===
In 1854 town founder Hugh Murray employed a couple of shepherds named Thomas Brookhouse and Patrick Geary. Brookhouse, who was looking for missing sheep disappeared without a trace. Patrick Geary and his wife soon left the district. Fifteen years later a boy out rabbiting found the skeletal remains of Thomas Brookhouse under a pile of rocks near Lake Corangamite. Brookhouse had his head smashed in. It took Police two years to track Patrick Geary and charge him with Brookhouse&#x27;s murder. A friend of Geary told the court that Geary had killed Brookhouse with an axe to stop him from informing Murray of Geary&#x27;s sheep stealing activities. Geary was hanged in Melbourne in 1871.

===Role in World War I===
A plaque on the southern side of the Memorial Square commemorates two historic speeches given on consecutive nights in Colac, beginning on 31 July 1914 with the then Federal opposition leader, Andrew Fisher, and followed the next night by the Prime Minister Joseph Cook. The two speeches declared Australia&#x27;s commitment to follow Britain into World War I, with Fisher declaring &quot;Should honor demand the mother country taking part in hostilities, Australians would stand beside her to the last man and shilling.&quot; and Cook&#x27;s famous reiteration that &quot;If the old country is at war, so are we.&quot; Fisher became Prime Minister for the third time on 5 September.

The War Memorial stands in the centre of Memorial Square.

===Heritage listed sites===

Colac contains a number of heritage listed sites, including:

* 1 Murray Street, Adam Rea&#x27;s Store 
* 1–5 Fyans Street, Colac Botanic Gardens

==Schools==

* Trinity College, Colac
* Colac Secondary College
* Sacred Heart Primary School, Colac
* Colac West Primary School
* Colac Primary School
* Colac South West Primary School 
* St Mary&#x27;s Primary School
* Lake Colac School
* St Josephs 
* Elliminyt Primary School

==Natural features==
The plains around Colac are the third largest volcanic plain in the world. Australia&#x27;s largest permanent salt lake and Victoria&#x27;s largest natural lake, Lake Corangamite, is nearby and Red Rock Reserve is nearby too.

Lake Colac&#x27;s water level can drop over summer dry periods to the point that it actually dried up for the first time in recorded history in 2009, but is always replenished after drought and is used for fishing, boating and water skiing.

==Transport==
 The Princes Highway (part of Australia&#x27;s circumnavigational Highway 1) runs through the city and forms its main street, Murray Street. The highway runs west toward Camperdown and east to Geelong and beyond to Melbourne. Several secondary sealed roads including the C161, C155 and C154 run south toward Apollo Bay and the coastal tourism areas of the Otway Ranges Great Ocean Road, The Twelve Apostles and the Shipwreck Coast. The Colac-Ballarat Road runs north connecting Colac to Ballarat via Cressy.
The railway through the town was opened in 1877, and extended from 1883 as part of the line to the south west of the state.

The Irrewarra-Cressy line towards Ballarat also ran from Colac between 1889 and 1953 
and the Alvie line opened in 1923 and closed in 1954.

A narrow gauge branch line also originated from the town, the branch line to Beech Forest opened in 1902 and was extended to Crowes in 1911, finally closing in 1962. The route of the abandoned railway has been developed as the Old Beechy Rail Trail.

The local railway station is served by V/Line passenger services on the Warrnambool line. The train stops at Camperdown and Terang.

==Events==
Colac was the home of the annual &quot;Cliff Young Australian 6-day race&quot;. The event, which was originally orchestrated by Stuart Walker, occurred for over 20 years until 2006 and is a running/walking event. It was held on the Memorial Square which is right in the heart of Colac and attracted entries from all over the world.

Also held at the Memorial Square is the annual Colac KANA festival taking place on the third Saturday of March. Many market stalls, children&#x27;s entertainment and a song and dance stage can be found at the festival. The most popular feature of the festival is its parade through the streets of Colac&#x27;s CBD. The parade showcases local primary schools and their students as well as local clubs, emergency service organisations and businesses.

On the last week-end of October, first weekend in November the Colac Otway Arts Trail takes place. Featuring artists, studios and galleries in the Colac Otway Shire the trail also feature the &#x27;Art Walk on Murray&#x27; where local artists display their work in the windows of the shops along the Murray Street precinct.

==Industry==
With a wealth of natural resources, such as agriculture and timber, Colac has a strong manufacturing background, with major local employers including Bulla Dairy Foods, Australian Lamb Company, and AKD Softwoods.

While historically the region supported numerous successful brickworks, nowadays the major primary industries are agriculture, such as the dairy, beef, lamb and fine-wool merino industries.

==Sister city==
Colac is the sister city of Walker, Michigan, USA.

==Climate==
Colac has a temperate mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) with mild summers and cool damp winters, with chilly nights year round owing to its far southern location on the Australian mainland. It records only 55.3 clear days on average, with 181.0 cloudy days. 
==Media==

Colac has its own newspaper, &quot;The Colac Herald&quot;, published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Colac is serviced by a number of local radio stations: 3CS 1134AM, MIXX FM 106.3 MHz, and OCR FM Community Radio Station 98.3 MHz and 88.7 MHz in Apollo Bay and surrounds. Narrowcast radio station 3GL 1341AM, owned and operated by Geelong Broadcasters, is also broadcasting in Colac on 88.0 MHz, transmitting on a power of 1-watt. Some FM radio services direct from Ballarat, including 3BA and Power FM can also be received clearly in Colac.

Most digital terrestrial television services are received via UHF from Ballarat Lookout Hill. In addition to the Ballarat service, a local repeater on nearby Warrion Hill provides an alternative source of television reception. As of August 2022, Television channels available include Southern Cross 10, 10HD, 10 Bold, 10 Peach, 10 Shake and Sky News Regional. These stations are now broadcast by Southern Cross Austereo after affiliate changes occurred in July 2021. This change included 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life which are owned by Nine Network except TVSN which is owned by Network 10 but is now broadcast by WIN Television who also transmit WIN HD channel 9HD and GOLD. The city also receives Seven, 7two, 7mate, ishop tv, Racing.com, 7Bravo and 7flix (sub-licensees of the Seven Network) which were unaffected by July&#x27;s change.

In addition to commercial television services, Colac receives Government ABC Television which includes ABC TV, ABC HD, ABC TV Plus (Daily from 7.30pm to 2am, Station Close daily from 2am to 5am), ABC Kids (Daily from 5am to 7.30pm), ABC Me (Daily from 6am to 11pm approximately) and ABC News as well as the SBS&#x27;s owned channels of SBS, SBS HD, SBS Viceland, National Indigenous Television, SBS Food, SBS World Movies and SBS WorldWatch. Analog Television transmissions ceased on Thursday 5 May 2011 as part of the Federal Government&#x27;s nationwide plan for Digital terrestrial television in Australia, which involves switching over all television broadcast services from analog systems to digital DVB-T systems.

FM radio services direct from Melbourne and Geelong can be received in Colac but signal levels are low. Television services direct from Melbourne can be received in Colac but large antenna arrays must be used with mixed results.

Colac is serviced by Foxtel delivered by DTH satellite transmission, via Optus C1 Ku Band Satellite located at 156E.

==Sport==
Colac is home to a number of teams in the Colac &amp; District Football and Netball League combining both Australian Rules football clubs and netball clubs from around the district.

The Colac Football Club, formerly of the CDFNL, competes in the Geelong Football League. Colac is also the hometown of Luke Hodge, from 2002 a player with Hawthorn Football Club (captain 2011 to 2016) and player with Brisbane Football Club in the Australian Football League since October 2017.

Colac has a horse racing club, the Colac Turf Club, which schedules around four race meetings a year including the Colac Cup meeting in February. It also has a picnic horse racing club, Colac St Patrick Picnic, which holds its one race meeting a year in March.

Golfers play at the Colac Golf Club on Colac–Lavers Hill Road, Elliminyt.

Colac has a swimming club which trains swimmers and has athletes competing at Region, State and national competitions.

Colac has a baseball club, the Colac Braves, a team which competes in the Geelong Baseball Association winter competition and the Pan-Pacific Masters Games on the Gold Coast. The Colac Braves also cater for players aged 5 to 15. The Braves have claimed recent premiership success in the Geelong Baseball Association with wins in 2008, 2009 and 2010.

The Colac Otway Rovers AFC is the region&#x27;s only football (soccer) club established in 2010. The club entered the Football Federation Victoria—Geelong Region in 2011—fielding a team in the Men&#x27;s Division 3 Competition. The Colac Otway Rovers conducts a Small Sided Football Program for juniors and an indoor soccer competition.

The Colac Basketball Association hosts summer and winter competitions at Colac&#x27;s Bluewater stadium. The clubs are Saints, Hawks, Demons and Rebels. The association also has representative teams known as the Kookas. The juniors compete in tournaments, while the senior teams compete in Basketball Victoria Country&#x27;s Country Basketball League.

<text>Vice Admiral Sir John Augustine Collins, (7 January 1899 – 3 September 1989) was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) officer who served in both World Wars, and who eventually rose to become a vice admiral and Chief of Naval Staff. Collins was one of the first graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College to attain flag rank. During the Second World War, he commanded the cruiser in the Mediterranean campaign. He led the Australian Naval Squadron in the Pacific theatre and was wounded in the first recorded kamikaze attack, in 1944.

==Early life and education==
John Augustine Collins was born in Deloraine, Tasmania, to English parents in 1899. In 1913, at age 14, Collins joined the first intake to the RAN College. He became a midshipman in January 1917, in time to see war service while attached to the Royal Navy.

==Second World War==
In the early Second World War, Collins commanded in the Battle of the Mediterranean. &quot;Sydney&quot; led Allied ships which sank an Italian cruiser, &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot;, in the Battle of Cape Spada, in July 1940. For this action, in 1940 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

Relations between the RAN and British Royal Navy were close at the time, with frequent exchanges of officers between the two and in June 1941, Collins was transferred to Singapore, as Assistant Chief of Staff to the British Naval Commander in Chief, China Station, Vice Admiral Geoffrey Layton.

Following the outbreak of war with Japan, Collins was appointed Commodore Commanding China Force, the RN-RAN cruiser and destroyer force based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, under the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command.

After the fall of Singapore and the Allied defeat in the Battle of the Java Sea, it became clear that the Dutch East Indies would be occupied by Japan. Collins organised the evacuation of Allied civilians and military personnel from Batavia, and was on one of the last ships to leave, before the city fell, in March 1942. As a result, he was Mentioned in Despatches, and was later made a Commander of the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau.

Collins was then appointed Senior Naval Officer, Western Australia, based at Fremantle.

During 1943, Collins commanded and took part in the Bougainville campaign, the Battle of Cape Gloucester, and operations off the Admiralty Islands and Hollandia (Dutch New Guinea).

In mid-1944, Collins was made commander of the Australian-US Navy Task Force 74, and commander of the Australian Naval Squadron, with as his flagship. He became the first graduate of the RAN College to command a naval squadron in action, during the bombardment of Noemfoor, on 2 July 1944.

Collins was badly wounded in the first kamikaze attack in history, which hit &quot;Australia&quot; on 21 October 1944, in the lead up to the Battle of Leyte Gulf. He did not resume his command until July 1945. When the war ended Collins was the RAN&#x27;s representative at the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay.

==Post-war service and legacy==
Collins was appointed Chief of Naval Staff in 1948, succeeding Sir Louis Keppel Hamilton, and held the position until 1955. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. He later served as Australia&#x27;s High Commissioner to New Zealand (1956–1962).

The latest class of Australian submarine, the &quot;Collins&quot; class bears his name. The lead submarine, , was launched by his widow on 28 August 1993. Collins Road, a street in the north Sydney suburb of St Ives, and another in the town of Narooma was also named in his honour.

<text>The path integral formulation is a description in quantum mechanics that generalizes the stationary action principle of classical mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.

This formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of theoretical physics, because manifest Lorentz covariance (time and space components of quantities enter equations in the same way) is easier to achieve than in the operator formalism of canonical quantization. Unlike previous methods, the path integral allows one to easily change coordinates between very different canonical descriptions of the same quantum system. Another advantage is that it is in practice easier to guess the correct form of the Lagrangian of a theory, which naturally enters the path integrals (for interactions of a certain type, these are &quot;coordinate space&quot; or &quot;Feynman path integrals&quot;), than the Hamiltonian. Possible downsides of the approach include that unitarity (this is related to conservation of probability; the probabilities of all physically possible outcomes must add up to one) of the S-matrix is obscure in the formulation. The path-integral approach has proven to be equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Thus, by &quot;deriving&quot; either approach from the other, problems associated with one or the other approach (as exemplified by Lorentz covariance or unitarity) go away.

The path integral also relates quantum and stochastic processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s, which unified quantum field theory with the statistical field theory of a fluctuating field near a second-order phase transition. The Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an analytic continuation of a method for summing up all possible random walks.

The path integral has impacted a wide array of sciences, including polymer physics, quantum field theory, string theory and cosmology. In physics, it is a foundation for lattice gauge theory and quantum chromodynamics. It has been called the &quot;most powerful formula in physics&quot;, with Stephen Wolfram also declaring it to be the &quot;fundamental mathematical construct of modern quantum mechanics and quantum field theory&quot;.

The basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to Norbert Wiener, who introduced the Wiener integral for solving problems in diffusion and Brownian motion. This idea was extended to the use of the Lagrangian in quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac, whose 1933 paper gave birth to path integral formulation. The complete method was developed in 1948 by Richard Feynman. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier in his doctoral work under the supervision of John Archibald Wheeler. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory using a Lagrangian (rather than a Hamiltonian) as a starting point.

== Quantum action principle ==

In quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is the generator of time translations. This means that the state at a slightly later time differs from the state at the current time by the result of acting with the Hamiltonian operator (multiplied by the negative imaginary unit, ). For states with a definite energy, this is a statement of the de Broglie relation between frequency and energy, and the general relation is consistent with that plus the superposition principle.

The Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is derived from a Lagrangian, which is a more fundamental quantity in the context of special relativity. The Hamiltonian indicates how to march forward in time, but the time is different in different reference frames. The Lagrangian is a Lorentz scalar, while the Hamiltonian is the time component of a four-vector. So the Hamiltonian is different in different frames, and this type of symmetry is not apparent in the original formulation of quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian is a function of the position and momentum at one time, and it determines the position and momentum a little later. The Lagrangian is a function of the position now and the position a little later (or, equivalently for infinitesimal time separations, it is a function of the position and velocity). The relation between the two is by a Legendre transformation, and the condition that determines the classical equations of motion (the Euler–Lagrange equations) is that the action has an extremum.

In quantum mechanics, the Legendre transform is hard to interpret, because the motion is not over a definite trajectory. In classical mechanics, with discretization in time, the Legendre transform becomes
: formula_1
and
: formula_2
where the partial derivative with respect to formula_3 holds fixed. The inverse Legendre transform is
: formula_4
where
: formula_5
and the partial derivative now is with respect to at fixed .

In quantum mechanics, the state is a superposition of different states with different values of , or different values of , and the quantities and can be interpreted as noncommuting operators. The operator is only definite on states that are indefinite with respect to . So consider two states separated in time and act with the operator corresponding to the Lagrangian:
: formula_6

If the multiplications implicit in this formula are reinterpreted as &quot;matrix&quot; multiplications, the first factor is
: formula_7
and if this is also interpreted as a matrix multiplication, the sum over all states integrates over all , and so it takes the Fourier transform in to change basis to . That is the action on the Hilbert space – change basis to at time .

Next comes
: formula_8
or evolve an infinitesimal time into the future.

Finally, the last factor in this interpretation is
: formula_9
which means change basis back to at a later time.

This is not very different from just ordinary time evolution: the factor contains all the dynamical information – it pushes the state forward in time. The first part and the last part are just Fourier transforms to change to a pure basis from an intermediate basis.

Another way of saying this is that since the Hamiltonian is naturally a function of and , exponentiating this quantity and changing basis from to at each step allows the matrix element of to be expressed as a simple function along each path. This function is the quantum analog of the classical action. This observation is due to Paul Dirac.

Dirac further noted that one could square the time-evolution operator in the representation:
: formula_10
and this gives the time-evolution operator between time and time . While in the representation the quantity that is being summed over the intermediate states is an obscure matrix element, in the representation it is reinterpreted as a quantity associated to the path. In the limit that one takes a large power of this operator, one reconstructs the full quantum evolution between two states, the early one with a fixed value of and the later one with a fixed value of . The result is a sum over paths with a phase, which is the quantum action.

== Classical limit ==
Crucially, Dirac identified the effect of the classical limit on the quantum form of the action principle:

That is, in the limit of action that is large compared to the Planck constant – the classical limit – the path integral is dominated by solutions that are in the neighborhood of stationary points of the action. The classical path arises naturally in the classical limit.

== Feynman&#x27;s interpretation ==

Dirac&#x27;s work did not provide a precise prescription to calculate the sum over paths, and he did not show that one could recover the Schrödinger equation or the canonical commutation relations from this rule. This was done by Feynman.

Feynman showed that Dirac&#x27;s quantum action was, for most cases of interest, simply equal to the classical action, appropriately discretized. This means that the classical action is the phase acquired by quantum evolution between two fixed endpoints. He proposed to recover all of quantum mechanics from the following postulates:
# The probability for an event is given by the squared modulus of a complex number called the &quot;probability amplitude&quot;.
# The probability amplitude is given by adding together the contributions of all paths in configuration space.
# The contribution of a path is proportional to , where is the action given by the time integral of the Lagrangian along the path.

In order to find the overall probability amplitude for a given process, then, one adds up, or integrates, the amplitude of the 3rd postulate over the space of &quot;all&quot; possible paths of the system in between the initial and final states, including those that are absurd by classical standards. In calculating the probability amplitude for a single particle to go from one space-time coordinate to another, it is correct to include paths in which the particle describes elaborate curlicues, curves in which the particle shoots off into outer space and flies back again, and so forth. The path integral assigns to all these amplitudes &quot;equal weight&quot; but varying phase, or argument of the complex number. Contributions from paths wildly different from the classical trajectory may be suppressed by interference (see below).

Feynman showed that this formulation of quantum mechanics is equivalent to the canonical approach to quantum mechanics when the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momentum. An amplitude computed according to Feynman&#x27;s principles will also obey the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian corresponding to the given action.

The path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude (corresponding to the classical correlation function) as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state. A Feynman diagram is a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude.

== Path integral in quantum mechanics ==

=== Time-slicing derivation ===

One common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. Once this is done, the Trotter product formula tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored.

For a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by zigzag paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position at time to at time , the time sequence
: formula_11
can be divided up into smaller segments , where , of fixed duration
: formula_12

This process is called &quot;time-slicing&quot;.

An approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to
: formula_13
where is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable and velocity considered (see below), and corresponds to the position at the th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of terms.

In the limit , this becomes a functional integral, which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at in the initial state and at in the final state .

Actually is the classical Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system considered,
: formula_14
and the abovementioned &quot;zigzagging&quot; corresponds to the appearance of the terms
: formula_15
in the Riemann sum approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over to with the integration measure , is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to , e.g. its center, .

Thus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between the initial and the final point also contribute.

=== Path integral ===

In terms of the wave function in the position representation, the path integral formula reads as follows:
: formula_16
where formula_17 denotes integration over all paths formula_18 with formula_19 and where formula_20 is a normalization factor. Here formula_21 is the action, given by
: formula_22

=== Free particle ===

The path integral representation gives the quantum amplitude to go from point to point as an integral over all paths. For a free-particle action (for simplicity let , )
: formula_23
the integral can be evaluated explicitly.

To do this, it is convenient to start without the factor in the exponential, so that large deviations are suppressed by small numbers, not by cancelling oscillatory contributions. The amplitude (or Kernel) reads:
: formula_24

Splitting the integral into time slices:
: formula_25
where the is interpreted as a finite collection of integrations at each integer multiple of . Each factor in the product is a Gaussian as a function of centered at with variance . The multiple integrals are a repeated convolution of this Gaussian with copies of itself at adjacent times:
: formula_26
where the number of convolutions is . The result is easy to evaluate by taking the Fourier transform of both sides, so that the convolutions become multiplications:
: formula_27

The Fourier transform of the Gaussian is another Gaussian of reciprocal variance:
: formula_28
and the result is
: formula_29

The Fourier transform gives , and it is a Gaussian again with reciprocal variance:
: formula_30

The proportionality constant is not really determined by the time-slicing approach, only the ratio of values for different endpoint choices is determined. The proportionality constant should be chosen to ensure that between each two time slices the time evolution is quantum-mechanically unitary, but a more illuminating way to fix the normalization is to consider the path integral as a description of a stochastic process.

The result has a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths of the exponential factor can be seen as the sum over each path of the probability of selecting that path. The probability is the product over each segment of the probability of selecting that segment, so that each segment is probabilistically independently chosen. The fact that the answer is a Gaussian spreading linearly in time is the central limit theorem, which can be interpreted as the first historical evaluation of a statistical path integral.

The probability interpretation gives a natural normalization choice. The path integral should be defined so that
: formula_31

This condition normalizes the Gaussian and produces a kernel that obeys the diffusion equation:
: formula_32

For oscillatory path integrals, ones with an in the numerator, the time slicing produces convolved Gaussians, just as before. Now, however, the convolution product is marginally singular, since it requires careful limits to evaluate the oscillating integrals. To make the factors well defined, the easiest way is to add a small imaginary part to the time increment . This is closely related to Wick rotation. Then the same convolution argument as before gives the propagation kernel:
: formula_33
which, with the same normalization as before (not the sum-squares normalization – this function has a divergent norm), obeys a free Schrödinger equation:
: formula_34

This means that any superposition of s will also obey the same equation, by linearity. Defining
: formula_35

then obeys the free Schrödinger equation just as does:
: formula_36

=== Simple harmonic oscillator ===

The Lagrangian for the simple harmonic oscillator is
: formula_37

Write its trajectory as the classical trajectory plus some perturbation, and the action as . The classical trajectory can be written as

: formula_38

This trajectory yields the classical action
: formula_39

Next, expand the deviation from the classical path as a Fourier series, and calculate the contribution to the action , which gives
: formula_40

This means that the propagator is
: formula_41
for some normalization
: formula_42

Using the infinite-product representation of the sinc function,
: formula_43
the propagator can be written as
: formula_44

Let . One may write this propagator in terms of energy eigenstates as
: formula_45

Using the identities and , this amounts to
: formula_46

One may absorb all terms after the first into , thereby obtaining
: formula_47

One may finally expand in powers of : All terms in this expansion get multiplied by the factor in the front, yielding terms of the form
: formula_48
Comparison to the above eigenstate expansion yields the standard energy spectrum for the simple harmonic oscillator,
: formula_49

=== Coulomb potential ===
Feynman&#x27;s time-sliced approximation does not, however, exist for the most important quantum-mechanical path integrals of atoms, due to the singularity of the Coulomb potential at the origin. Only after replacing the time by another path-dependent pseudo-time parameter
: formula_50
the singularity is removed and a time-sliced approximation exists, which is exactly integrable, since it can be made harmonic by a simple coordinate transformation, as discovered in 1979 by İsmail Hakkı Duru and Hagen Kleinert. The combination of a path-dependent time transformation and a coordinate transformation is an important tool to solve many path integrals and is called generically the Duru–Kleinert transformation.

=== The Schrödinger equation ===

The path integral reproduces the Schrödinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path-integral over infinitesimally separated times.
: formula_51

Since the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of , the path integral has most weight for close to . In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the Trotter product formula.) The exponential of the action is
: formula_52

The first term rotates the phase of locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to times a diffusion process. To lowest order in they are additive; in any case one has with (1):
: formula_53

As mentioned, the spread in is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase that slowly varies from point to point from the potential:
: formula_54
and this is the Schrödinger equation. The normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment.

=== Equations of motion ===

Since the states obey the Schrödinger equation, the path integral must reproduce the Heisenberg equations of motion for the averages of and variables, but it is instructive to see this directly. The direct approach shows that the expectation values calculated from the path integral reproduce the usual ones of quantum mechanics.

Start by considering the path integral with some fixed initial state
: formula_55

Now at each separate time is a separate integration variable. So it is legitimate to change variables in the integral by shifting: where is a different shift at each time but , since the endpoints are not integrated:
: formula_56

The change in the integral from the shift is, to first infinitesimal order in :
: formula_57
which, integrating by parts in , gives:
: formula_58

But this was just a shift of integration variables, which doesn&#x27;t change the value of the integral for any choice of . The conclusion is that this first order variation is zero for an arbitrary initial state and at any arbitrary point in time:
: formula_59
this is the Heisenberg equation of motion.

If the action contains terms that multiply and , at the same moment in time, the manipulations above are only heuristic, because the multiplication rules for these quantities is just as noncommuting in the path integral as it is in the operator formalism.

=== Stationary-phase approximation ===

If the variation in the action exceeds by many orders of magnitude, we typically have destructive interference other than in the vicinity of those trajectories satisfying the Euler–Lagrange equation, which is now reinterpreted as the condition for constructive interference. This can be shown using the method of stationary phase applied to the propagator. As decreases, the exponential in the integral oscillates rapidly in the complex domain for any change in the action. Thus, in the limit that goes to zero, only points where the classical action does not vary contribute to the propagator.

=== Canonical commutation relations ===

The formulation of the path integral does not make it clear at first sight that the quantities and do not commute. In the path integral, these are just integration variables and they have no obvious ordering. Feynman discovered that the non-commutativity is still present.

To see this, consider the simplest path integral, the brownian walk. This is not yet quantum mechanics, so in the path-integral the action is not multiplied by :
: formula_60

The quantity is fluctuating, and the derivative is defined as the limit of a discrete difference.
: formula_61

The distance that a random walk moves is proportional to , so that:
: formula_62
This shows that the random walk is not differentiable, since the ratio that defines the derivative diverges with probability one.

The quantity is ambiguous, with two possible meanings:
: formula_63
: formula_64

In elementary calculus, the two are only different by an amount that goes to 0 as goes to 0. But in this case, the difference between the two is not 0:
: formula_65

Let
: formula_66

Then is a rapidly fluctuating statistical quantity, whose average value is 1, i.e. a normalized &quot;Gaussian process&quot;. The fluctuations of such a quantity can be described by a statistical Lagrangian
: formula_67
and the equations of motion for derived from extremizing the action corresponding to just set it equal to 1. In physics, such a quantity is &quot;equal to 1 as an operator identity&quot;. In mathematics, it &quot;weakly converges to 1&quot;. In either case, it is 1 in any expectation value, or when averaged over any interval, or for all practical purpose.

Defining the time order to &quot;be&quot; the operator order:
: formula_68

This is called the Itō lemma in stochastic calculus, and the (euclideanized) canonical commutation relations in physics.

For a general statistical action, a similar argument shows that
: formula_69
and in quantum mechanics, the extra imaginary unit in the action converts this to the canonical commutation relation,
: formula_70

=== Particle in curved space ===

For a particle in curved space the kinetic term depends on the position, and the above time slicing cannot be applied, this being a manifestation of the notorious operator ordering problem in Schrödinger quantum mechanics. One may, however, solve this problem by transforming the time-sliced flat-space path integral to curved space using a multivalued coordinate transformation (nonholonomic mapping explained here).

=== Measure-theoretic factors ===
Sometimes (e.g. a particle moving in curved space) we also have measure-theoretic factors in the functional integral:
: formula_71
This factor is needed to restore unitarity.

For instance, if
: formula_72
then it means that each spatial slice is multiplied by the measure . This measure cannot be expressed as a functional multiplying the measure because they belong to entirely different classes.

=== Expectation values and matrix elements ===

Matrix elements of the kind formula_73 take the form
: formula_74.

This generalizes to multiple operators, for example
: formula_75,
and to the general vacuum expectation value (in the large time limit)
: formula_76.

== Euclidean path integrals ==
It is very common in path integrals to perform a Wick rotation from real to imaginary times. In the setting of quantum field theory, the Wick rotation changes the geometry of space-time from Lorentzian to Euclidean; as a result, Wick-rotated path integrals are often called Euclidean path integrals.

=== Wick rotation and the Feynman–Kac formula ===
If we replace formula_77 by formula_78, the time-evolution operator formula_79 is replaced by formula_80. (This change is known as a Wick rotation.) If we repeat the derivation of the path-integral formula in this setting, we obtain
: formula_81,
where formula_82 is the Euclidean action, given by
: formula_83.
Note the sign change between this and the normal action, where the potential energy term is negative. (The term &quot;Euclidean&quot; is from the context of quantum field theory, where the change from real to imaginary time changes the space-time geometry from Lorentzian to Euclidean.)

Now, the contribution of the kinetic energy to the path integral is as follows:
: formula_84
where formula_85 includes all the remaining dependence of the integrand on the path. This integral has a rigorous mathematical interpretation as integration against the Wiener measure, denoted formula_86. The Wiener measure, constructed by Norbert Wiener gives a rigorous foundation to Einstein&#x27;s mathematical model of Brownian motion. The subscript formula_87 indicates that the measure formula_88 is supported on paths formula_18 with formula_19.

We then have a rigorous version of the Feynman path integral, known as the Feynman–Kac formula:
: formula_91,
where now formula_92 satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schrödinger equation,
: formula_93.
Although the Wick-rotated Schrödinger equation does not have a direct physical meaning, interesting properties of the Schrödinger operator formula_94 can be extracted by studying it.

Much of the study of quantum field theories from the path-integral perspective, in both the mathematics and physics literatures, is done in the Euclidean setting, that is, after a Wick rotation. In particular, there are various results showing that if a Euclidean field theory with suitable properties can be constructed, one can then undo the Wick rotation to recover the physical, Lorentzian theory. On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give a meaning to path integrals (even Euclidean path integrals) in quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics.

=== Path integral and the partition function ===

The path integral is just the generalization of the integral above to all quantum mechanical problems—
: formula_95
is the action of the classical problem in which one investigates the path starting at time and ending at time , and formula_17 denotes the integration measure over all paths. In the classical limit, formula_97, the path of minimum action dominates the integral, because the phase of any path away from this fluctuates rapidly and different contributions cancel.

The connection with statistical mechanics follows. Considering only paths that begin and end in the same configuration, perform the Wick rotation , i.e., make time imaginary, and integrate over all possible beginning-ending configurations. The Wick-rotated path integral—described in the previous subsection, with the ordinary action replaced by its &quot;Euclidean&quot; counterpart—now resembles the partition function of statistical mechanics defined in a canonical ensemble with inverse temperature proportional to imaginary time, . Strictly speaking, though, this is the partition function for a statistical field theory.

Clearly, such a deep analogy between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics cannot be dependent on the formulation. In the canonical formulation, one sees that the unitary evolution operator of a state is given by
: formula_98
where the state is evolved from time . If one makes a Wick rotation here, and finds the amplitude to go from any state, back to the same state in (imaginary) time is given by
: formula_99
which is precisely the partition function of statistical mechanics for the same system at the temperature quoted earlier. One aspect of this equivalence was also known to Erwin Schrödinger who remarked that the equation named after him looked like the diffusion equation after Wick rotation. Note, however, that the Euclidean path integral is actually in the form of a &quot;classical&quot; statistical mechanics model.

== Quantum field theory ==

Both the Schrödinger and Heisenberg approaches to quantum mechanics single out time and are not in the spirit of relativity. For example, the Heisenberg approach requires that scalar field operators obey the commutation relation
: formula_100
for two simultaneous spatial positions and , and this is not a relativistically invariant concept. The results of a calculation &quot;are&quot; covariant, but the symmetry is not apparent in intermediate stages. If naive field-theory calculations did not produce infinite answers in the continuum limit, this would not have been such a big problem – it would just have been a bad choice of coordinates. But the lack of symmetry means that the infinite quantities must be cut off, and the bad coordinates make it nearly impossible to cut off the theory without spoiling the symmetry. This makes it difficult to extract the physical predictions, which require a careful limiting procedure.

The problem of lost symmetry also appears in classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian formulation also superficially singles out time. The Lagrangian formulation makes the relativistic invariance apparent. In the same way, the path integral is manifestly relativistic. It reproduces the Schrödinger equation, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the canonical commutation relations and shows that they are compatible with relativity. It extends the Heisenberg-type operator algebra to operator product rules, which are new relations difficult to see in the old formalism.

Further, different choices of canonical variables lead to very different-seeming formulations of the same theory. The transformations between the variables can be very complicated, but the path integral makes them into reasonably straightforward changes of integration variables. For these reasons, the Feynman path integral has made earlier formalisms largely obsolete.

The price of a path integral representation is that the unitarity of a theory is no longer self-evident, but it can be proven by changing variables to some canonical representation. The path integral itself also deals with larger mathematical spaces than is usual, which requires more careful mathematics, not all of which has been fully worked out. The path integral historically was not immediately accepted, partly because it took many years to incorporate fermions properly. This required physicists to invent an entirely new mathematical object – the Grassmann variable – which also allowed changes of variables to be done naturally, as well as allowing constrained quantization.

The integration variables in the path integral are subtly non-commuting. The value of the product of two field operators at what looks like the same point depends on how the two points are ordered in space and time. This makes some naive identities fail.

=== Propagator ===

In relativistic theories, there is both a particle and field representation for every theory. The field representation is a sum over all field configurations, and the particle representation is a sum over different particle paths.

The nonrelativistic formulation is traditionally given in terms of particle paths, not fields. There, the path integral in the usual variables, with fixed boundary conditions, gives the probability amplitude for a particle to go from point to point in time :
: formula_101

This is called the propagator. To obtain the final state at we simply apply to the initial state and integrate over resulting in:
: formula_102

For a spatially homogeneous system, where is only a function of , the integral is a convolution, the final state is the initial state convolved with the propagator:
: formula_103

For a free particle of mass , the propagator can be evaluated either explicitly from the path integral or by noting that the Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation in imaginary time, and the solution must be a normalized Gaussian:
: formula_104

Taking the Fourier transform in produces another Gaussian:
: formula_105
and in -space the proportionality factor here is constant in time, as will be verified in a moment. The Fourier transform in time, extending to be zero for negative times, gives Green&#x27;s function, or the frequency-space propagator:
: formula_106
which is the reciprocal of the operator that annihilates the wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation, which wouldn&#x27;t have come out right if the proportionality factor weren&#x27;t constant in the -space representation.

The infinitesimal term in the denominator is a small positive number, which guarantees that the inverse Fourier transform in will be nonzero only for future times. For past times, the inverse Fourier transform contour closes toward values of where there is no singularity. This guarantees that propagates the particle into the future and is the reason for the subscript &quot;F&quot; on . The infinitesimal term can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation toward imaginary time.

It is also possible to reexpress the nonrelativistic time evolution in terms of propagators going toward the past, since the Schrödinger equation is time-reversible. The past propagator is the same as the future propagator except for the obvious difference that it vanishes in the future, and in the Gaussian is replaced by . In this case, the interpretation is that these are the quantities to convolve the final wavefunction so as to get the initial wavefunction:
: formula_107
Given the nearly identical only change is the sign of and , the parameter in Green&#x27;s function can either be the energy if the paths are going toward the future, or the negative of the energy if the paths are going toward the past.

For a nonrelativistic theory, the time as measured along the path of a moving particle and the time as measured by an outside observer are the same. In relativity, this is no longer true. For a relativistic theory the propagator should be defined as the sum over all paths that travel between two points in a fixed proper time, as measured along the path (these paths describe the trajectory of a particle in space and in time):
: formula_108

The integral above is not trivial to interpret because of the square root. Fortunately, there is a heuristic trick. The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an oscillating quantity, and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space:
: formula_109

This describes a sum over all paths of length of the exponential of minus the length. This can be given a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths is a probability average over a path constructed step by step. The total number of steps is proportional to , and each step is less likely the longer it is. By the central limit theorem, the result of many independent steps is a Gaussian of variance proportional to :
: formula_110

The usual definition of the relativistic propagator only asks for the amplitude to travel from to , after summing over all the possible proper times it could take:
: formula_111
where is a weight factor, the relative importance of paths of different proper time. By the translation symmetry in proper time, this weight can only be an exponential factor and can be absorbed into the constant :
: formula_112

This is the Schwinger representation. Taking a Fourier transform over the variable can be done for each value of separately, and because each separate contribution is a Gaussian, gives whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian with reciprocal width. So in -space, the propagator can be reexpressed simply:
: formula_113
which is the Euclidean propagator for a scalar particle. Rotating to be imaginary gives the usual relativistic propagator, up to a factor of and an ambiguity, which will be clarified below:
: formula_114

This expression can be interpreted in the nonrelativistic limit, where it is convenient to split it by partial fractions:
: formula_115

For states where one nonrelativistic particle is present, the initial wavefunction has a frequency distribution concentrated near . When convolving with the propagator, which in space just means multiplying by the propagator, the second term is suppressed and the first term is enhanced. For frequencies near , the dominant first term has the form
: formula_116

This is the expression for the nonrelativistic Green&#x27;s function of a free Schrödinger particle.

The second term has a nonrelativistic limit also, but this limit is concentrated on frequencies that are negative. The second pole is dominated by contributions from paths where the proper time and the coordinate time are ticking in an opposite sense, which means that the second term is to be interpreted as the antiparticle. The nonrelativistic analysis shows that with this form the antiparticle still has positive energy.

The proper way to express this mathematically is that, adding a small suppression factor in proper time, the limit where of the first term must vanish, while the limit of the second term must vanish. In the Fourier transform, this means shifting the pole in slightly, so that the inverse Fourier transform will pick up a small decay factor in one of the time directions:
: formula_117

Without these terms, the pole contribution could not be unambiguously evaluated when taking the inverse Fourier transform of . The terms can be recombined:
: formula_118
which when factored, produces opposite-sign infinitesimal terms in each factor. This is the mathematically precise form of the relativistic particle propagator, free of any ambiguities. The term introduces a small imaginary part to the , which in the Minkowski version is a small exponential suppression of long paths.

So in the relativistic case, the Feynman path-integral representation of the propagator includes paths going backwards in time, which describe antiparticles. The paths that contribute to the relativistic propagator go forward and backwards in time, and the interpretation of this is that the amplitude for a free particle to travel between two points includes amplitudes for the particle to fluctuate into an antiparticle, travel back in time, then forward again.

Unlike the nonrelativistic case, it is impossible to produce a relativistic theory of local particle propagation without including antiparticles. All local differential operators have inverses that are nonzero outside the light cone, meaning that it is impossible to keep a particle from travelling faster than light. Such a particle cannot have a Green&#x27;s function that is only nonzero in the future in a relativistically invariant theory.

=== Functionals of fields ===

However, the path integral formulation is also extremely important in &quot;direct&quot; application to quantum field theory, in which the &quot;paths&quot; or histories being considered are not the motions of a single particle, but the possible time evolutions of a field over all space. The action is referred to technically as a functional of the field: , where the field is itself a function of space and time, and the square brackets are a reminder that the action depends on all the field&#x27;s values everywhere, not just some particular value. &quot;One&quot; such given function of spacetime is called a &quot;field configuration&quot;. In principle, one integrates Feynman&#x27;s amplitude over the class of all possible field configurations.

Much of the formal study of QFT is devoted to the properties of the resulting functional integral, and much effort (not yet entirely successful) has been made toward making these functional integrals mathematically precise.

Such a functional integral is extremely similar to the partition function in statistical mechanics. Indeed, it is sometimes &quot;called&quot; a partition function, and the two are essentially mathematically identical except for the factor of in the exponent in Feynman&#x27;s postulate 3. Analytically continuing the integral to an imaginary time variable (called a Wick rotation) makes the functional integral even more like a statistical partition function and also tames some of the mathematical difficulties of working with these integrals.

=== Expectation values ===

In quantum field theory, if the action is given by the functional of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the time-ordered vacuum expectation value of polynomially bounded functional , , is given by
: formula_119

The symbol here is a concise way to represent the infinite-dimensional integral over all possible field configurations on all of space-time. As stated above, the unadorned path integral in the denominator ensures proper normalization.

=== As a probability ===
Strictly speaking, the only question that can be asked in physics is: &quot;What fraction of states satisfying condition also satisfy condition ?&quot; The answer to this is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a conditional probability, written as . In terms of path integration, since , this means
: formula_120
where the functional is the superposition of all incoming states that could lead to the states we are interested in. In particular, this could be a state corresponding to the state of the Universe just after the Big Bang, although for actual calculation this can be simplified using heuristic methods. Since this expression is a quotient of path integrals, it is naturally normalised.

=== Schwinger–Dyson equations ===
Since this formulation of quantum mechanics is analogous to classical action principle, one might expect that identities concerning the action in classical mechanics would have quantum counterparts derivable from a functional integral. This is often the case.

In the language of functional analysis, we can write the Euler–Lagrange equations as
: formula_121
(the left-hand side is a functional derivative; the equation means that the action is stationary under small changes in the field configuration). The quantum analogues of these equations are called the Schwinger–Dyson equations.

If the functional measure turns out to be translationally invariant (we&#x27;ll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let&#x27;s say nonlinear sigma models), and if we assume that after a Wick rotation
: formula_122
which now becomes
: formula_123
for some , it goes to zero faster than a reciprocal of any polynomial for large values of , then we can integrate by parts (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following Schwinger–Dyson equations for the expectation:
: formula_124
for any polynomially-bounded functional . In the deWitt notation this looks like
: formula_125

These equations are the analog of the on-shell EL equations. The time ordering is taken before the time derivatives inside the .

If (called the source field) is an element of the dual space of the field configurations (which has at least an affine structure because of the assumption of the translational invariance for the functional measure), then the generating functional of the source fields is defined to be
: formula_126

Note that
: formula_127
or
: formula_128
where
: formula_129

Basically, if is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn&#x27;t be taken too literally as an interpretation of QFT, unlike its Wick-rotated statistical mechanics analogue, because we have time ordering complications here!), then are its moments, and is its Fourier transform.

If is a functional of , then for an operator , is defined to be the operator that substitutes for . For example, if
: formula_130
and is a functional of , then
: formula_131

Then, from the properties of the functional integrals
: formula_132
we get the &quot;master&quot; Schwinger–Dyson equation:
: formula_133
or
: formula_134

If the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product , where is a functional and is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the target space is diffeomorphic to . However, if the target manifold is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense.

In that case, we would have to replace the in this equation by another functional
: formula_135

If we expand this equation as a Taylor series about &quot;J&quot; 0, we get the entire set of Schwinger–Dyson equations.

== Localization ==
The path integrals are usually thought of as being the sum of all paths through an infinite space–time. However, in local quantum field theory we would restrict everything to lie within a finite &quot;causally complete&quot; region, for example inside a double light-cone. This gives a more mathematically precise and physically rigorous definition of quantum field theory.

=== Ward–Takahashi identities ===
Now how about the on shell Noether&#x27;s theorem for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well.

Let&#x27;s just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (not local in the sense of a gauge symmetry, but in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question). Let&#x27;s also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a Lagrangian, and that
: formula_136
for some function where only depends locally on (and possibly the spacetime position).

If we don&#x27;t assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a &quot;true&quot; symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless or something. Here, is a derivation that generates the one parameter group in question. We could have antiderivations as well, such as BRST and supersymmetry.

Let&#x27;s also assume
: formula_137
for any polynomially-bounded functional . This property is called the invariance of the measure, and this does not hold in general. (See &quot;anomaly (physics)&quot; for more details.)

Then,
: formula_138
which implies
: formula_139
where the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog of Noether&#x27;s theorem.

Now, let&#x27;s assume even further that is a local integral
: formula_140
where
: formula_141
so that\
: formula_142
where
: formula_143
(this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). We&#x27;re not insisting that is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we are &quot;not&quot; insisting upon the gauge principle), but just that is. And we also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant:
: formula_144

Then, we would have
: formula_145

Alternatively,
: formula_146

The above two equations are the Ward–Takahashi identities.

Now for the case where , we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We&#x27;d simply have
: formula_147

Alternatively,
: formula_148

== Caveats ==

=== Need for regulators and renormalization ===

Path integrals as they are defined here require the introduction of regulators. Changing the scale of the regulator leads to the renormalization group. In fact, renormalization is the major obstruction to making path integrals well-defined.

=== Ordering prescription ===

Regardless of whether one works in configuration space or phase space, when equating the operator formalism and the path integral formulation, an ordering prescription is required to resolve the ambiguity in the correspondence between non-commutative operators and the commutative functions that appear in path integrands. For example, the operator formula_149 can be translated back as either formula_150, formula_151, or formula_152 depending on whether one chooses the formula_153, formula_154, or Weyl ordering prescription; conversely, formula_152 can be translated to either formula_153, formula_154, or formula_149 for the same respective choice of ordering prescription.

== Path integral in quantum-mechanical interpretation ==

In one interpretation of quantum mechanics, the &quot;sum over histories&quot; interpretation, the path integral is taken to be fundamental, and reality is viewed as a single indistinguishable &quot;class&quot; of paths that all share the same events. For this interpretation, it is crucial to understand what exactly an event is. The sum-over-histories method gives identical results to canonical quantum mechanics, and Sinha and Sorkin claim the interpretation explains the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox without resorting to nonlocality.

Some advocates of interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasizing decoherence have attempted to make more rigorous the notion of extracting a classical-like &quot;coarse-grained&quot; history from the space of all possible histories.

== Quantum gravity ==
Whereas in quantum mechanics the path integral formulation is fully equivalent to other formulations, it may be that it can be extended to quantum gravity, which would make it different from the Hilbert space model. Feynman had some success in this direction, and his work has been extended by Hawking and others. Approaches that use this method include causal dynamical triangulations and spinfoam models.

== Quantum tunneling ==
Quantum tunnelling can be modeled by using the path integral formation to determine the action of the trajectory through a potential barrier. Using the WKB approximation, the tunneling rate () can be determined to be of the form
: formula_159
with the effective action and pre-exponential factor . This form is specifically useful in a dissipative system, in which the systems and surroundings must be modeled together. Using the Langevin equation to model Brownian motion, the path integral formation can be used to determine an effective action and pre-exponential model to see the effect of dissipation on tunnelling. From this model, tunneling rates of macroscopic systems (at finite temperatures) can be predicted.

<text>The Condamine River, part of the Balonne catchment that is part of the Murray-Darling Basin, drains the northern portion of the Darling Downs, an area of sub-coastal southern Queensland, Australia. The river is approximately 500 kilometres (310 mi) long and rises on Mount Superbus, South East Queensland&#x27;s highest peak, on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, approximately from the east coast of Queensland, and then flows north west across the Darling Downs, then west. The Condamine River is a tributary of the Darling River.

==Course and features==

The headwaters of the river rise on the slopes of Mount Superbus, part of the Main Range, before passing through Cambanoora Gorge. The river flows through the towns of , , and Chinchilla and the tributary Gowrie Creek drains the slopes around Toowoomba. At the junction with Dogwood Creek, south of Yuleba, the Condamine turns to the south-west and becomes known as the Balonne River. The Condamine descends over its course, with a catchment area of . The water basin contains more than 1,800 wetlands.

The Balonne River is joined by Bungil Creek at Surat followed by the Cogoon River (Muckadilla Creek) before a major junction with the Maranoa River at Lake Kajarabie above St George from where it continues southwest to Dirranbandi. Below Dirranbandi the Balonne forks into a series of anabranches with a western distributary being called the Culgoa River which, in turn, flows into the Darling River. The eastern branch of the Balonne River in turn branches again - into the Bokhara River on the right and the Narran River on the left (eastern) side. The Narran flows to Narran Lake, an endorheic lake between Brewarrina, Walgett and Lightning Ridge. The Birrie splits from the Bokhara before these join with the Barwon River west of Brewarrina which also flows into the Darling River.

===Water storage===

Water from the Condamine River is used for town water supply and for irrigation. Leslie Dam on Sandy Creek, a tributary of the Condamine, is the main water reservoir for Warwick. Talgai Weir is a small weir that can hold near Clifton. Other water storage facilities on the Condamine River include the Yarramalong Weir, Lemon Tree Weir, Loudoun Weir, Tipton Weir and the Cecil Plains Weir. The Condamine River is reduced to a series of drying ponds during droughts in Australia.

=== Chinchilla Weir ===
The Chinchilla Weir was built in 1973 and is located on the Condamine River, eight kilometres south of the town of Chinchilla. The weir has the dual purpose of providing supply of irrigation water along the alluvial flats of the Condamine River and of augmenting the water supply to the town of Chinchilla. Chinchilla Weir is a concrete faced earthfill structure and is known for the unique curved design of its wall. The weir is the only storage for the Chinchilla Weir Water Supply Scheme.

At the official opening of the Weir in 1974, approximately 5000 people were counted through the gates. Chinchilla Weir remains a freshwater playground for locals and visitors with waterskiing, canoeing, swimming and fishing being popular activities.

==History==
Parts of the water catchment were settled by the Bundjalung people. The Condamine River was named by Allan Cunningham in 1827 for Thomas de la Condamine, a former aide-de-camp to Governor Ralph Darling who became the colony&#x27;s first Collector of Internal Revenue. Patrick Leslie was the first white settler in the area. He established Canning Downs in 1840, near Warwick.

Major Thomas Mitchell crossed the Balonne River on St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 1846. The next year 1847 Ludwig Leichhardt went to examine the course of the Condamine River. 
In 1985, it was proposed by the Water Research Foundation of Australia to transfer water from the Clarence River to the Condamine water basin. The Condamine River and its catchment area were involved in the 2010–11 Queensland floods. During the floods the river reached a record peak at Condamine of and another peak of .

===Coal Seam Gas industry===
The Coal Seam Gas industry (often referred to as Coal Bed Methane) started exploring for unconventional gas in the Chinchilla region, through which the Condamine River flows, around 2000 when Bob Bryan formed The Queensland Gas Company (QGC). Initially supplying gas into the domestic market, the industry grew quickly with the advent of the CSG/LNG industry and building of export facilities in Gladstone.

The gas is found in the coal seams and is adsorbed to the coal by water pressure. To extract gas from coal seams it is necessary to remove the water from the coal seams to allow the gas to flow. The de-watering of the Walloon Coal Measures has been raised as a concern by landholders, as stock water bores drilled into the coal seams can be affected by reduced water flows or gas. Under Queensland law, gas companies are required to &quot;make good&quot; if there is an impairment on a landholder&#x27;s bore.

The Walloon Coal Measures are hydraulically connected to the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin (within the Surat Basin) and in some locations immediately underlies the Condamine Alluvium.

===Methane gas seeps===
In 2012 methane gas was observed escaping from the river. The gas that is seeping is derived either from the underlying Walloon Coal Measures and/or the Springbok Sandstone. The Queensland Government undertook an investigation into the gas seeps and the technical study concluded that the bubbling was unlikely to be caused by coal seam gas (CSG) activities in the region, but that further studies were required. In relation to the presence of methane in the river, the report concluded that “…&quot;there is no safety risk or evidence of environmental harm occurring in the immediate area from the Condamine River gas seeps.&quot;&quot;

In April 2016 the Condamine River seeps were brought to the forefront of media attention by New South Wales Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, when he allegedly set alight the methane gas bubbling from the riverbed. He claimed that &quot;hydraulic fracturing&quot; was the likely cause for the problem, but to date there is no direct link.

In 2017 CSIRO researchers with expertise in hydrogeology, geology, ecology and biogeochemistry assessed the Condamine River to determine what is currently known about the methane seeps in the River including natural and human causes, and the potential human and environmental health and safety impacts of methane escaping from underground. They concluded that there could be a number of reasons for the methane releases, but conceded that &quot;depressurisation of the Walloon Coal Measures during gas production could generate horizontal migration of methane gas. However, this flux of methane is likely to be small because of the shallow dip of the coal beds and the distance to gas production fields.&quot; Other reasons for variation in bubbles includes changes in water flow, or flooding changing groundwater patterns. Hydraulic fracturing is not considered to be the cause as there has been no hydraulic fracturing in those fields.

Natural gas seeps are not altogether uncommon in Queensland, but there are no recorded instances of bubbles occurring in a river. The Queensland Gasfields Commission (a government agency) identified 17 soil gas surveys undertaken during the 1980s and 1990s, from locations around the state that record naturally occurring methane releases. The nearest one to the bubbling in the Condamine river was 16 km distant and not linked to the river. These measured low levels of mixed gas ranging from less than 10 parts per million (ppm) to 240ppm occurring in the subsoil at depths of up to one metre.

In 2017, the gas company that holds the tenure over this area of the river reported a 90% reduction in the level of the seep compared to the peak rate recorded in early-2016. This was done by intercepting and producing the gas before it reached the river, effectively taking it out of the system.

While the story of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; focuses on the life of the daughter of a wealthy slave owner, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; tells the story of the life of slaves through Cynara, an enslaved woman during the same time period and events.

The title is an African American Vernacular English play on the original&#x27;s title. Cynara&#x27;s name comes from the Ernest Dowson poem &quot;Non sum qualís eram bonae sub regno Cynarae&quot;, a line from which (&quot;I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind&quot;) was the origin of the title of Mitchell&#x27;s novel.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; revolves around Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, a pampered Southern white woman, who lives through the American Civil War and Reconstruction. &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; is the same story, but told from the viewpoint of Cynara, a mulatto slave on Scarlett&#x27;s plantation and the daughter of Scarlett&#x27;s father and Mammy.

Sold from the O&#x27;Haras, Cynara eventually makes her way back to Atlanta and becomes the mistress of a white businessman. She later leaves him for a black aspiring politician, eventually moving with him to Reconstruction Washington, D.C.

==Characters==
* Cynara—The narrator of the novel, the recently freed slave is the daughter of white plantation owner Planter and his slave Mammy. She has a lifelong rivalry with her half-sister Other, sparked by jealousy that Mammy paid more attention to the white baby. They both came to love R.
* Mammy—Cynara&#x27;s mother and Other&#x27;s wet nurse, Mammy doted on Other while neglecting her own daughter. Her masters believe she is a loyal slave, but the other slaves suspect that she killed Lady and Planter&#x27;s male children—given to her to nurse—so that Planter would be Cotton Farm&#x27;s last white master. Her real name, Pallas, is so rarely used that her daughter didn&#x27;t learn it until after her death. A clear parallel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s Mammy, she is the only major character called by the same name in both books.
* Other—The daughter of Planter and Lady, Other formed a strong bond with her wet nurse Mammy. When her youngest daughter dies in an accident and her husband R. leaves her, she returns to Mammy and the Cotton Farm. Parallel to Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* R.—Other&#x27;s husband R. leaves his wife and takes Cynara as a mistress and kept woman. Cynara sees him as a prize that she can win in her rivalry with her half-sister Other. While R. loves Cynara for her beauty, he never tries to understand her. Parallel to Rhett Butler in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* Beauty—A brothel owner who once owned Cynara, Beauty is a source of advice for the young woman. Although she had an affair with R., Cynara believes she is a lesbian. Parallel to Belle Watling in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* Garlic—Planter&#x27;s manservant Garlic is the architect of his master&#x27;s success, his master&#x27;s marriage and the house Tata. He used his wits and patience to manipulate Planter, with the goal of becoming the estate&#x27;s real master. Cynara suspects that he may also be the mastermind behind Planter&#x27;s death. Parallel to Pork in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* Lady—After the death of her cousin Filipe, her only love, Lady joined Planter in a chaste marriage. Hurt by the close relationship between Other and Mammy, she would sometimes care for and breast-feed Cynara. She kept a secret that could destroy her family: she learned that one of her distant ancestors was black, which by the one-drop rule made her and her children Negro. Parallel to Ellen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* Planter—Though he doted on his daughter Cynara when she was young, he gave her away to another family when he realized that she was Other&#x27;s rival. His passion was for Mammy, not for his wife. Parallel to Gerald O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* The Dreamy Gentleman—The unobtainable knight of Other&#x27;s dreams, the Dreamy Gentleman chose to marry his plain cousin Mealy Mouth and live respectably. As a homosexual, he was horrified by Other&#x27;s advances; he secretly loved Miss Priss&#x27; brother. When his lover revealed the affair to his wife, Mealy Mouth had the slave whipped to death. Parallel to Ashley Wilkes in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* Miss Priss—Garlic&#x27;s daughter holds a grudge against Mealy Mouth, whom she blames for two of her brothers&#x27; deaths. One of her brothers was whipped to death when Mealy Mouth discovered his affair with her husband. The other starved to death as a baby when his mother became wet nurse to Mealy Mouth&#x27;s child. The whites believe she was psychologically broken by her brothers&#x27; deaths, but the slaves believe that she is a crafty woman who is responsible for Mealy Mouth&#x27;s death. Probable parallel to Prissy in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

==Similarity to characters in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;==

The book consciously avoids using the names of Mitchell&#x27;s characters or locations. Cynara refers to her sister as &quot;Other&quot;, rather than Scarlett, and to Other&#x27;s husband as &quot;R&quot; (and later, &quot;Debt Chauffeur&quot;) instead of Rhett Butler. Other is in love with &quot;Dreamy Gentleman&quot; (Ashley Wilkes), although he is married to &quot;Mealy Mouth&quot; (Melanie Wilkes). The magnificence of the O&#x27;Haras&#x27; house, Tara, is reduced to &quot;Tata&quot; or &quot;Cotton Farm&quot;, and Twelve Oaks is renamed for its builders, &quot;Twelve Slaves Strong as Trees&quot;.

== Legal controversy ==

The estate of Margaret Mitchell sued Randall and her publishing company, Houghton Mifflin, on the grounds that &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; was too similar to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, thus infringing its copyright. The case attracted numerous comments from leading scholars, authors, and activists, regarding what Mitchell&#x27;s attitudes would have been and how much &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; copies from its predecessor.
After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated an injunction against publishing the book in &quot;Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin&quot; (2001), the case was settled in 2002 when Houghton Mifflin agreed to make an unspecified donation to Morehouse College in exchange for Mitchell&#x27;s estate dropping the litigation.

The cover of the book bears a seal identifying it as &quot;The Unauthorized Parody.&quot; It is parody in the broad legal sense: a work that comments on or criticizes a prior work. This characterization was important in the &quot;Suntrust&quot; case.

<text>HMAS &quot;Cook&quot; (GOR 291/A 219), named after Captain James Cook, was an oceanographic research vessel of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Design work for a dedicated oceanographic research vessel to replace the converted frigate began in the late 1960s. The ship was ordered in 1973. &quot;Cook&quot; was in length overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was 1,900 tons at standard load, and 2,450 tons at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of diesel engines, connected to two shafts driving variable pitch propellers . A bow thruster and an active rudder provided extra maneuverability, especially when the ship was required to remain in one position at sea for oceanographic measurements. Top speed was , with a range of at . &quot;Cook&quot; was operated by a ship&#x27;s company of 150, with facilities for up to 13 civilian scientists. The ship&#x27;s armament was limited to light calibre weapons only.

&quot;Cook&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, on 30 September 1974, launched on 27 August 1977 and commissioned into the RAN on 28 January 1980. After a six-year construction period the ship spent another two years in dockyard hands fixing defects from the building period, including the realignment of the entire propulsion mechanism to reduce vibration.

&quot;Cook&quot; paid off on 31 October 1990 and was sold for conversion as a small cruise ship and subsequently renamed &quot;Maria Kosmas&quot; - IMO number 8872784. As of 2009, the vessel was in the United Arab Emirates) under the name &quot;Cosmos&quot;, in the hands of Platinum Yachts and laid up next to the &quot;EasyCruiseOne&quot; for conversion into a private yacht, but work had been suspended. In 2022, both vessels were dismantled even though the conversion had made progress earlier.

<text>John Bernard &quot;Jack&quot; Mundey (17 October 1929 – 10 May 2020) was an Australian communist, trade unionist and environmental activist. He came to prominence during the 1970s for leading the New South Wales Builders&#x27; Labourers Federation (BLF) in the famous green bans, whereby the BLF led a successful campaign to protect the built and natural environment of Sydney from excessive and inappropriate development. Mundey was the patron of the Historic Houses Association of Australia.

==Early years==
John Bernard &quot;Jack&quot; Mundey was born on 17 October 1929 in Malanda, Queensland on the Johnstone River in the Atherton Tablelands, some 100 km west of Cairns. He was one of five siblings born to Catholic parents of Irish descent. His father was a lifetime Labor voter. His mother died when he was six. He was educated at Malanda Primary School and at St Augustine&#x27;s, Cairns. He ran away from the latter due to its &quot;authoritarian methods&quot; of discipline.

Mundey moved to Sydney when he was 19, and became a metalworker and later a builder&#x27;s labourer, joining successively the Federated Ironworkers&#x27; Association and the Builders Labourers Federation. He also played rugby league for Parramatta under Vic Hey for three years. He joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in 1957.

Mundey&#x27;s first wife was Stephanie Lennon; the couple had a son, Michael. 15 months after her son&#x27;s birth, Stephanie Mundey died at a young age from a brain tumour. Mundey remarried, in 1965, to Judith Ann Willcocks, known as Judy Mundey. Michael, Mundey&#x27;s only child, was killed in a car accident at age 22.

During the 1960s, Mundey was a crusading unionist and an advocate on a wide range of issues from safety reforms on building sites to wider issues such as feminism, gay rights and international politics. Mundey considered all these matters appropriate targets for union activism. His second wife, Judy, joined him in these campaigns and later rose to become national president of the CPA.

==Green bans==
In 1968, Mundey was elected secretary of the NSW Builders&#x27; Labourers Federation (BLF). From this position, he became a highly visible individual who, with his union and supportive community members, was responsible for the green bans that saved much of Sydney&#x27;s heritage and built environment. He insisted that the priorities of development be reversed such that the open community spaces and heritage buildings be preserved and that affordable public housing was more important than accumulating empty or underused commercial buildings.

In 1975, Mundey and other New South Wales leaders of the BLF were expelled from the union by the federal leadership under Norm Gallagher, who was later to be convicted of corrupt dealings with developers.

According to Senator Bob Brown, former parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens the use of the term &quot;Green&quot; as a political category actually derives from the green bans, by way of Petra Kelly&#x27;s visit to Sydney in 1977.

Mundey&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Green Bans and Beyond&quot;, was published in 1981. In 1981 Mundey joined the Quayhole Committee in their effort to save the landing site of the First Fleet at Circular Quay.


==Politics==

Mundey was the lead Legislative Council candidate of the Communist Party of Australia at the 1978 New South Wales state election. His party polled almost 80,000 votes – 2.9 per cent of the statewide total – and outpolled the Australian Democrats. Mundey came close to winning a seat, and was the last candidate excluded from the count.

Mundey served as an alderman on the City of Sydney council from 1984 to 1987. He was chairman of the planning committee of Sydney City Council from May 1984 to September 1985.

==Later life==

In 1988, the University of Western Sydney made Mundey an honorary Doctor of Letters and an honorary Doctor of Science in recognition of his service to the environment for the previous 30 years.

Mundey was made a life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation in the 1990s. In 1995, in keeping with his continued interest in Sydney and the state&#x27;s urban environment and heritage, he was appointed chair of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales, and he was also the patron of the Historic Houses Association of Australia.

In 2003, Mundey joined the Australian Greens, citing their opposition to the Iraq War and their environmental stance. He remained a member until his death.

In February 2007, the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales renamed a portion of Argyle Street in The Rocks &quot;Jack Mundey Place&quot; in recognition of his leadership &quot;in the fight to preserve such significant sites in the historic Rocks area.&quot;

During mid 2009, the NSW State Labor Government headed by Premier Nathan Rees, announced the now cancelled CBD Metro rail project for Sydney. Mundey would once again enter the fray to help fight the demolition of historic buildings and space, this time in Sydney&#x27;s Pyrmont and Rozelle. The government had planned to build a metro style railway between the existing city circle, over to Rozelle. This involved demolishing numerous buildings and businesses along the way. Ultimately, the CBD Metro project was cancelled, after a storm of protest.

In 2014, Mundey was named Patron of the Friends of Millers Point as he joined the fight to save the Sirius building which was built for the people of The Rocks when the green bans saved them from eviction and The Rocks from demolition forty years earlier. In 2012, he joined the action to preserve Windsor Bridge from further development. In 2017, he was awarded the NSW President&#x27;s Prize at the NSW Architecture Awards.

In 2021, the year after Mundey&#x27;s death, Eastlakes Reserve was renamed Jack Mundey Reserve at the request of Bayside Council.

<text>HMAS &quot;Cootamundra&quot; (J316/M186), named for the town of Cootamundra, New South Wales, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Cootamundra&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Cootamundra&quot; was laid down by Poole &amp; Steel at Sydney, New South Wales on 26 February 1942. She was launched on 3 December 1942 by Lady Davidson, wife of the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and commissioned into the RAN on 30 April 1943.

Compared to other &quot;Bathurst&quot; class corvettes, &quot;Cootamundra&quot; is slightly longer ( as opposed to ) and has a slightly shallower draught ( compared to ).

==Operational history==

===World War II===
After commissioning, &quot;Cootamundra&quot; was assigned to convoy escort duties along the east coast of Australia. On 15 June, a thirteen-ship convoy heading for Brisbane and escorted by &quot;Cootamundra&quot; and sister ships &quot;Bundaberg&quot;, &quot;Deloraine&quot;, &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot;, and &quot;Warrnambool&quot;, was attacked off Smoky Cape. The United States Army Transport &quot;Portmar&quot; and the US Navy Landing ship &quot;LST-469&quot; were torpedoed by Japanese submarine &quot;I-174&quot;: the former sinking in minutes with the loss of only two lives, while 26 were killed aboard the latter ship, which survived and was towed to port. This was the last submarine attack to be made on the east coast of Australia during World War II.

&quot;Cootamundra&quot; was reassigned to Darwin in early June, and began to escort shipping between Darwin and Thursday Island. On 6 August, while escorting the merchantman SS &quot;Macumba&quot;, the two ships were attacked by two Japanese aircraft. &quot;Macumba&quot;’s engine room was destroyed, and despite efforts to tow the ship to safety, the merchantman&#x27;s crew were taken aboard the corvette that evening and the ship was allowed to sink. &quot;Cootamundra&quot; remained in her role until April 1944, when she sailed to Sydney for refit. The refit finished at the end of May, and after a brief period operating as an escort from Darwin, &quot;Cootamundra&quot; was reassigned to New Guinea waters. The corvette served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship from 5 July until the end of World War II.

The corvette was awarded three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1943&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;.

===Post-war===
Following the end of the war, &quot;Cootamundra&quot; was used to transport Allied prisoners-of-war back to Australia, and carry an occupation force to Ambon, before leaving New Guinea waters on 29 September 1945 while towing HMAS &quot;Leilani&quot;. The corvette arrived in Melbourne on 26 November 1945, where she was decommissioned into reserve.

On 12 December 1951, &quot;Cootamundra&quot; was re-commissioned as a training ship. In 1954, the corvette visited New Zealand. In 1957, she was assigned to northern Australian waters, to supervise the Japanese pearling fleet.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Cootamundra&quot; was decommissioned for the second time on 8 June 1959. She was marked for disposal on 27 September 1961, and was sold for scrap on 28 March 1962.
